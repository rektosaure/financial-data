My name is Rebecca, and I'll be today's host. [Operator Instructions]\nNow I'll hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rebecca. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2025. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors Section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Dietmar Berger; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite.\nLet me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to Slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining today as we take you through another very strong set of quarterly results. Our third quarter earnings underscore the growing momentum you're seeing from Gilead today which is driven by our strong portfolio and the impressive execution of our teams. As you'll hear during the call, our progress is visible in both our quarterly results and in our strong clinical pipeline.\nHighlights of our third quarter include commercial outperformance across our HIV therapies and Livdelzi. This resulted in 6% year-over-year growth for Biktarvy, 20% year-over-year growth for Descovy, and 35% sequential growth for Livdelzi. Disciplined operating expense management contributed to 22% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP EPS. Even excluding a $0.25 benefit from a nonrecurring accounting item, non-GAAP EPS grew 10% compared to 4% base business growth year-over-year, highlighting the leverage in our business model.\nAs a reflection of our strong performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year HIV revenue growth expectations to approximately 5%. This is despite the $900 million headwind for our HIV business in 2025 associated with the Medicare Part D redesign. Our newest addition to the HIV portfolio, Yeztugo, for HIV prevention delivered third quarter sales of $39 million or $54 million, including the first few weeks of launch in June. Of course, our initial priority has been securing payer coverage, and I'm very pleased to share that we've already achieved our 75% coverage goal nearly 3 months ahead of our target. This sets a strong foundation for continued growth in 2026.\nOur confidence in our HIV business comes from both our existing on-market product leadership and our innovative pipeline. We look forward to sharing progress on one of our next-generation HIV treatments before the end of the year with an update on the ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 studies. These Phase III programs are evaluating an investigational single tablet regimen of bictegravir and lenacapavir, and we continue to target a product launch in early 2027. As I mentioned, Livdelzi was a standout of the quarter, contributing to 12% year-over-year growth in our liver portfolio. Livdelzi exceeded $100 million in quarterly sales for the first time and is already the #1 treatment for second-line PBC in the U. S.\nWe're also pleased to share that we have filed for FDA approval of bulevirtide for the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus. This therapy has been available in Europe since 2020 under the brand name of Hepcludex and we expect to bring it to patients in the U.S. in 2026.\nTurning to oncology. We continue to make significant clinical progress, most recently with the presentation of our ASCENT-03 detailed data at ESMO and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. Given the particularly aggressive nature of this disease, we are moving as quickly as we can to bring Trodelvy to first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. We have submitted SBLAs with the FDA and are targeting a potential commercial launch in 2026 that could extend Trodelvy's leadership in breast cancer. We also continue to target commercial launch for anito-cel for multiple myeloma in 2026 and look forward to sharing an update from the Pivotal iMMagine-1 study before the end of this year.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, building on a very strong 2025 overall. And just as importantly, we have significant potential ahead. The quality, breadth and diversity we built into the portfolio over the past years is now presenting us with multiple opportunities to drive benefits for patients. With several just launched or soon-to-be-launched products across HIV, oncology and liver disease and clinical readouts on the horizon with further commercial potential. This continues to be an exciting phase of growth. The fact that we now have no major LOEs until 2036, reinforces our strong position.\nMy thanks as always to the Gilead team for their incredible work this quarter and their continued dedication to doing more for the communities we serve.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share our third quarter results representing another strong quarter of commercial execution, with exciting momentum in our most recently launched products, Yeztugo and Livdelzi, in addition to continued robust Biktarvy and Descovy growth.\nStarting on Slide 7. Third quarter product sales, excluding Veklury, were $7.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially driven by strength across our HIV portfolio, offset in part by lower oncology revenue. Including Veklury sales of $277 million, third quarter total product sales were $7.3 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower Veklury sales associated with fewer COVID-19-related hospitalizations.\nMoving to Slide 8. HIV sales of $5.3 billion represented 4% growth versus prior year and prior quarter, primarily driven by higher demand and favorable inventory dynamics partially offset by lower average realized price. Year-to-date, our HIV business has grown more than 5%, which is particularly impressive as we manage through a $900 million headwind for the full year related to the Medicare Part D redesign. Consistent with our performance year-to-date, we are increasing our guidance for full year HIV revenue growth to approximately 5%, up from 3% last quarter.\nOn Slide 9, Biktarvy sales of $3.7 billion were up 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to higher demand, reflecting continued market growth of 2%, 3% and strong commercial execution. Biktarvy's year-over-year market share in the U.S. has grown every quarter since launch and achieved a record high of approximately 52% in the third quarter. Given Biktarvy's clear differentiation and market leadership, we're pleased that the expected loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for Biktarvy has been extended into 2036.\nMoving to Descovy. Third quarter sales were a record $701 million, increasing 20% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand for Descovy for PrEP. Sequentially, sales were up 7% driven by higher demand and average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by inventory dynamics. As a reminder, roughly 3/4 of Descovy sales are for HIV prevention. This highlights the incredible momentum in the prevention market driven by the growing awareness and increasing unrestricted access as well as excellent commercial execution. Descovy for PrEP achieved a new record market share of more than 45% in the U.S. in the third quarter. This reflects the strength of our PrEP team and the impact they're having in ensuring HIV PrEP reaches more of the people who could benefit from it. Overall, the PrEP market grew approximately 14% year-over-year.\nMoving to Slide 10 and one quarter in, we are really excited with the initial positive reception to our Yeztugo launch across consumers, clinicians and payers. Yeztugo is increasingly recognized in clinical guidelines, including most recently the U.S. CDC. This strong endorsement of Yeztugo offers health care providers, public health leaders and communities clear guidance on an innovation that could help shift the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. As we've discussed previously, expanding payer coverage is a critical indicator in our initial launch and we're working with every payer to accelerate access. I am thrilled that we have already achieved 75% access in the U.S., almost 3 months ahead of our target. This includes coverage by UnitedHealthcare and [ Express Scripts ] as well as 20 of the top 25 state Medicaid plans. In most cases, payers do not require prior authorization or co-pays.\nKeep in mind that much of our progress to the 75% access goal has been made in the last several weeks. We continue to work on an account-by-account basis to help clinicians navigate the new logistics and reimbursement process and the benefits of this access will pull through in 2026. Looking forward, we're moving quickly to expand access beyond 75% and continue to target 90% by the end of the first half of 2026.\nAltogether, Yeztugo is off to a strong start, delivering $39 million in sales in the third quarter. From launch in the middle of June to the end of the third quarter, Yeztugo revenue was $54 million, including $15 million of new launch-related stocking at the end of the second quarter. As we expected, most early prescribers are existing HIV prep clinicians who are leveraging white bagging to simplify the logistics and reimbursement arrangements. In August, the European Commission approved lenacapavir for PrEP under the name to [indiscernible]. We look forward to further regulatory decisions across other geographies.\nAdditionally, as part of our broader commitment to access, Gilead has agreed with the global fund and the U.S. State Department through [ PEPFAR ] to supply enough doses of lenacapavir for PrEP to reach up to 2 million people over 3 years in certain low and lower middle income countries.\nMoving to liver disease on Slide 11. And sales of $819 million were up 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven almost entirely by Livdelzi for primary biliary cholangitis. Livdelzi grew 35% sequentially driven by strong commercial execution, including some new launches outside the U.S. and withdrawal of a competitor's product in the U.S. We are particularly pleased to see strong levels of persistence among users and believe that Livdelzi shows clear differentiation and value to those with PBC. Livdelzi is now the market leader in second-line PBC in the U.S. and quarterly revenue topped $100 million for the first time.\nMoving to Slide 12. Trodelvy sales of $357 million were up 7% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand and down 2% sequentially with higher demand, offset by unfavorable inventory dynamics and lower ex U.S. average realized price. Trodelvy's continued strength in the U.S. and international markets across metastatic breast cancer, more than offset on a year-over-year basis, the expected impact from the bladder cancer withdrawal in the U.S. With Trodelvy's potential launch, in first-line metastatic TNBC following the potentially practice-changing ASCENT-03 and ASCENT-04 this year. We look forward to expanding the options available for patients in this earlier line setting. There are almost twice as many patients in the first-line metastatic setting compared to second line and patients typically have a longer duration of therapy.\nFor cell therapy on Slide 13, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, third quarter sales of $432 million were down 11% both year-over-year and sequentially with continued competitive headwinds from in and out of class there. We anticipate these headwinds to continue in the near future. We remain committed to increasing the adoption and utilization of cell therapies given their curative potential for many patients. Year-to-date, we've added more than 40 authorized treatment centers and now have more than 570 globally.\nAs shared in prior quarters, our efforts to lower the hurdles to community adoption are progressing but it's clear that we have more to do before all eligible patients have the opportunity to benefit from these cell therapies. In addition to the team's work to expand the reach of cell therapies, Kite is also progressing its next-generation pipeline to offer similar efficacy with better safety, which would result in enhanced outpatient usage potential.\nAdditionally, we're very excited by the development of anito-cel, which continues to show potential best-in-class safety and efficacy as a BCMA CAR T therapy for late-line relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. We look forward to providing an update from the iMMagine-1 study later this year.\nWrapping up our third quarter, I'd like to thank the commercial teams who are executing relentlessly across both our in-line portfolio as well as our newer opportunities like Yeztugo and Livdelzi. Looking to 2026, we're preparing for a number of additional potential launches across our therapeutic areas of focus and are excited by the opportunity to extend our reach and impact on the patients and communities we serve.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Dietmar.\n\nDietmar P. Berger\n\nGlobal Head of Research & Development, Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n\nThank you, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, the team progressed 56 clinical programs across our 3 therapeutic focus areas with 4 additions since last quarter. As we advance our research with the most meaningful potential scientific and patient impact into the clinic.\nBuilding on Johanna's comments on our Yeztugo launch, we continue to lead HIV innovation with 10 clinical programs across treatment and prevention. Lenacapavir and its prodrugs are foundational in our treatment and prevention programs, and in July, we initiated the registration of Phase III PURPOSE-365 trial, evaluating lenacapavir as HIV prevention with once yearly injections. This is a single-arm PK and safety study, which, along with the unprecedented efficacy seen in the Phase III PURPOSE I and II studies is expected to support a regulatory filing with potential for approval in 2028.\nMoving to treatment. We have 7 ongoing clinical programs evaluating daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and twice yearly regimens based on lenacapavir or one of its prodrugs. Beginning with our next-generation daily oral regimen, BIC/LEN, we continue to expect an update from our Phase III ARTISTRY studies later in the year. ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 are evaluating the potential of Gilead's investigational complete regimen that combines bictegravir, the key integrase inhibitor in Biktarvy and lenacapavir, our breakthrough capsid inhibitor. The regimen is a potential option for virologically suppressed people with HIV, including many people currently on complex regimens.\nFurther, we have a suite of long-acting oral and injectable agents in development for a range of dosing frequencies from once-weekly oral to twice yearly injectables. Our strategy has been to set up our pipeline for multiple shots on goal and then choose the best option for each dosing frequency. Notably, for our development of a twice yearly treatment regimen combining a novel integrase inhibitor with lenacapavir, we took 2 [ insteagents ] to Phase I, GS-1219 and GS-3242. Aligned with the guidance we shared at our HIV analyst event last year we have now chosen to prioritize the development of GS-3242 over GS-1219, and we expect to share more details on GS-3242 at a virology conference in 2026.\nOn Slide 16, I'm pleased to highlight that we have completed the BLA filing for bulevirtide in chronic hepatitis delta virus or HDV. We're excited by the potential to bring bulevirtide to HDV patients in the U.S. with a potential regulatory decision in 2026. As a reminder, HDV affects approximately 2% of patients with HBV or about 40,000 people in the U.S. Patients with chronic untreated HDV infection can experience accelerated development of cirrhosis or severe scarring of the liver and have higher risk of liver cancer and potentially end-stage liver disease and failure.\nBeyond bulevirtide, we are also evaluating next-generation approaches to HDV treatment. Specifically, we have advanced GS-4321 a [ Pre-S1 ] neutralizing antibody into Phase I clinical development. We believe GS-4321 has significant potential, given its preclinical safety profile and long half-life with potentially quarterly subcutaneous dosing.\nMoving to Trodelvy on Slide 17. Earlier this month at the ESMO meeting, we presented detailed potentially practice-changing Phase III ASCENT-03 data in first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients who are not candidates for PD-L1 inhibitors. Specifically, Trodelvy demonstrated a 9.7-month median progression-free survival compared to 6.9 months for standard of care chemotherapy. This reflects a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 38% reduction in disease progression or death versus standard of care chemotherapy. As we expected when we initiated the study, the median overall survival data are not yet mature. These results were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nAdditionally, the detailed results from ASCENT-04 were shared at the ASCO meeting in May. These data, combined with ASCENT-03, highlight the potential for Trodelvy to be a backbone treatment across first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Based on these positive Phase III update from ASCENT-03 and 04, we have submitted 2 supplemental biologics license applications for Trodelvy in first-line metastatic TNBC and expect regulatory decisions in 2026. This is incredibly important for patients as metastatic TNBC is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Historically, progress in first-line therapy has been minimal, and nearly half of patients do not progress beyond first-line treatment, meaning they may never access Trodelvy if it remains a later line option.\nSimilarly, we are currently exploring Trodelvy for first-line post endocrine hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients in the Phase III ASCENT-07 trial. We now expect to provide an update from this trial before the end of the year.\nOn Slide 18, we are highlighting overall survival results shared at ESMO earlier this month, from ARM A1 of the Phase II EDGE-Gastric study, evaluating domvanalimab, our Fc-Silent Anti-TIGIT plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic upper gastrointestinal cancers. In the 41 patients who received the novel regimen in this analysis, the median overall survival was 26.7 months. These findings were simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. These data are in a small number of patients. Survival results for this patient population still need to be confirmed in our ongoing Phase III STAR-121 trial evaluating domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in patients with metastatic upper gastrointestinal cancers. We continue to expect an update from the event-driven STAR-121 trial in 2026.\nWe also continue to develop domvanalimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in the Phase III STAR-121 trial.\nMoving to cell therapy on Slide 19. And on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, you can see that we have strengthened our in vivo capabilities. The in vivo cell therapies are potentially off-the-shelf products that could shorten the time it takes to treat patients. and are also expected to have more simplified and cost-effective manufacturing processes. Given these potential advantages over autologous CAR-T, we believe in vivo could unlock broad access to cell therapies. With that in mind, we have welcomed the Interiors team into the Kite family adding a novel in vivo platform and a strong IP portfolio. We have also entered into a new research and licensing collaboration with [ pre-gene ] biopharma. It's early days for in vivo but we're excited to accelerate our exploration of the opportunities these technologies could bring to patients.\nAs we step up our investment in vivo therapies, we remain committed to our current Yescarta and Tecartus portfolios. For example, FDA recently granted priority review Yescarta in primary CNS lymphoma with a PDUFA date in February 2026. Primary CNS lymphoma is a rare, yet aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects the central nervous system. Additionally, CD19 CAR-T products, including Yescarta, have recently received a category 2A recommendation from the NCCN for Richter's transformation. We are pleased with these review and guideline decisions, which will provide HCPs with additional opportunities to prescribe Yescarta.\nFor our next-generation CAR-Ts, we look forward to sharing Phase I data from KITE-753 and KITE-363 in lymphoma at an upcoming medical congress later this year, as well as pivotal Phase II initiation of KITE-753 for third-line large B-cell lymphoma in the first quarter of 2026. In autoimmune diseases, KITE-363 is enrolling patients for its Phase I trial in rheumatology and a Phase I study in neuro-inflammatory conditions is expected to start in the first quarter of 2026. We look forward to providing updates from these earlier stage programs.\nTogether with our partner, Arcellx, we plan to share additional follow-up data from the pivotal iMMagine-1 trial of anito-cel at an upcoming medical meeting. We continue to believe anito-cel has the potential to offer a best-in-class efficacy and safety profile for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The target commercial launch in fourth line plus relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma remains in 2026.\nOn Slide 20, I will quickly highlight the key milestone updates. First, we have received European Commission Marketing Authorization of [ 20 ] and remain on track to provide updates for our Phase III ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials for BIC/LEN. And for our pivotal Phase II iMMagine-1 trial for anito-cel in the fourth quarter. Finally, we now also expect ASCENT-07 data in the fourth quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn over the call to Andy.\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nChief Financial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dietmar, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 22. Our third quarter results showed continued strong execution across the company. Our base business was up 4% year-over-year to $7.1 billion, driven by growth in Biktarvy, Descovy and Livdelzi.\nVeklury sales were down 60% year-over-year to $277 million which continue to reflect fewer COVID-related hospitalizations. Including Veklury sales, total product sales were $7.3 billion.\nMoving to Slide 23. You can see we benefited from a $400 million contribution in royalty, contract and other revenues in the third quarter. This relates to an IP asset sale from 2018. Given we are now able to reasonably estimate future royalty and milestone payments, we are required to recognize this revenue in the third quarter. This is a nonrecurring accounting item and does not reflect cash received during the quarter. As a reminder, this contribution was not part of our product sales and therefore, did not impact our product gross margin in the third quarter. But it does otherwise flow through to the bottom line, contributing approximately $0.25 after tax.\nMoving to our non-GAAP results on Slide 24. Third quarter product gross margin was 86%, in line with 87% in the third quarter of 2024. R&D expenses of $1.3 billion were down 3% compared to the third quarter of 2024. Year-to-date, 2025 R&D expenses were $4.1 billion, in line with 2024 suggesting we are on track for our full year goal.\nAcquired IPR&D expenses were $170 million in the third quarter, including a $120 million upfront payment to [ pre-gene ] for a research and licensing collaboration in the in vivo cell therapy space. SG&A expenses of $1.4 billion were down 4% compared to the third quarter of 2024, modestly lower than we expected due to the timing of spending. Third quarter operating margin was 50%, reflecting the continued focus on operating expense discipline and leverage. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18% this quarter, slightly below our expectations due to a $79 million tax settlement. And finally, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.47 for the quarter, excluding the $400 million nonrecurring other revenue, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $2.22 for the third quarter.\nMoving to our full year guidance on Slide 25. We are raising the low end of our product sales range by $100 million to reflect our strong performance year-to-date. As a reminder, the $400 million included in our royalty contracts and other revenue in the third quarter does not impact our full year guidance as we do not guide to total revenue. We now expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, to be between $27.4 billion and $27.7 billion primarily reflecting higher HIV growth. Driven by the outperformance of both Biktarvy and Descovy year-to-date, we now anticipate our HIV franchise will grow approximately 5% year-over-year versus our prior guidance of 3%.\nConsistent with last quarter, I'll note that our assumptions for the impact of the Medicare Part D redesign remained unchanged from the beginning of the year, and we continue to expect approximately $900 million of impact to our HIV business in 2025. Our 2025 assumptions for Yeztugo also remain unchanged, and we remain very encouraged by the launch so far, particularly the accelerated time line for payer coverage. In other parts of our business, strength in HIV is expected to be partially offset by weaker cell therapy estimates where we now forecast approximately a 10% decline for full year 2025 versus full year 2024.\nFor Veklury, we continue to expect full year revenue of approximately $1 billion. As a result, total product sales are anticipated to be in the range of $28.4 billion to $28.7 billion. As noted earlier, this reflects a $100 million increase at the low end of the range from our previous guidance. Finally, we continue to expect the impact of known tariffs to be manageable in 2025.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. There is no change to our prior non-GAAP guidance for product gross margin, R&D and SG&A expenses. We continue to expect product gross margin of approximately 86%, R&D expenses to be roughly flat on a dollar basis from 2024, and SG&A expenses to decline by a mid- to high single-digit percentage compared to 2024. Similar to last year, we expect a step-up in both R&D and SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter, reflecting normal end of year trends. We have updated our IPR&D expectations for the full year to reflect our actuals through the third quarter and our known fourth quarter commitments, including $300 million relating to the Interiors acquisition. We now expect full year acquired IPR&D to be $900 million.\nRounding out the P&L, we expect operating income to be between $13.1 billion and $13.4 billion reflecting an increase of $100 million at the low end of the prior guidance range. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And finally, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the range of $8.05 and $8.25, raising non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 at the low end of the range. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.65 to $6.85.\nOn Slide 26, our capital priorities remain unchanged, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the third quarter, which included $435 million of share repurchases. These repurchases are intended to offset equity dilution at a minimum but can also be used opportunistically, as you've seen in the first 3 quarters of 2025.\nOverall, we are pleased with the strong performance this quarter, highlighted by our clinical and commercial execution and supported by our disciplined operating model. We continue to be well positioned for near-term and long-term growth and we remain focused on delivering on our strategic commitments.\nWith that, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.",

My name is Rebecca, and I'll be today's host. In a moment, we'll begin our prepared remarks, followed by our Q&A session. To ask a question, please press star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Now, I'll hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Treasury and Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Rebecca. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the Q2 of 2025. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investor section of our website at Gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Dietmar Berger; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to slide two regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased to be here with you today to share the results of a very successful Q2. This quarter had special significance, of course, with the FDA approval of lenacapavir, or YEZTUGO, for twice-yearly HIV prevention. I want to take this opportunity to thank the many people who contributed to this remarkable achievement, from the Gilead teams who discovered and developed lenacapavir to the participants in the PURPOSE studies, as well as the KOLs, advocates, community partners, and others who have been part of the lenacapavir journey. This is truly a milestone moment in the history of HIV, with the launch of a groundbreaking innovation that could bend the arc of the epidemic. Moving to the quarterly results, we had another very strong quarter of clinical, commercial, and operational execution.\nExcluding VEKLURY, base business sales of $6.9 billion grew 4% year-over-year, driven by robust growth across BIKTARVY, DESCOVY, LIVDELZI, and TRODELVY. Product sales of $7.1 billion grew 2% year-over-year. The strong base business performance was partially offset by lower VEKLURY sales due to fewer COVID-19-related hospitalizations. HIV had a very strong Q2, with demand-driven growth of 7% year-over-year, more than offsetting the anticipated headwinds from the Medicare Part D redesign. BIKTARVY grew 9% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, and DESCOVY grew 35% year-over-year to $653 million. This was DESCOVY's strongest quarter ever, highlighting the growth of the HIV prevention market, into which we are now launching YEZTUGO. It is now seven weeks since FDA approval of YEZTUGO, and we are very pleased with what we're seeing so far.\nJohanna and Andy will take you through our results in more detail, but overall, the strong commercial execution and operating expense discipline year to date support higher expectations for the second half of 2025. As a result, we are increasing our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year. From a clinical perspective, the Q2 was one of the strongest in Gilead's history. In addition to the FDA approval YEZTUGO, we received a positive CHMP opinion from the European Medicines Agency. With more than one million new HIV infections globally each year and over 600,000 HIV-related deaths, we believe lenacapavir is one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of our time, which brings a sense of urgency and responsibility to reach the communities most in need as quickly as possible. At the same time, we continue to fully evaluate lenacapavir's potential in the clinic.\nFor example, we have just initiated PURPOSE 365, a phase lll trial evaluating once-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP. Additionally, we continue to develop seven combination regimens that utilize lenacapavir-based molecules for HIV treatment. In the second half of this year, we plan to share updates from ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2. These phase lll trials are evaluating a potential new single tablet regimen combining bictegravir plus lenacapavir that could further extend the reach of Gilead's current HIV treatment business. Moving to oncology, we announced back-to-back positive phase lll results for TRODELVY with the top-line data from ASCENT-03 and the detailed data from ASCENT-04. We now have data that show highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit for TRODELVY across first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\nTRODELVY is already the leading therapy for second-line metastatic TNBC, and with these data, we look forward to potentially advancing TRODELVY to the first-line setting where it could benefit twice as many patients. In cell therapy, we expect to provide a pivotal update from the phase ll iMMagine-1 trial evaluating anito-cel for multiple myeloma later this year. Given the compelling efficacy and safety data seen to date, combined with Kite's industry-leading manufacturing capabilities, we believe anito-cel is well-positioned as a potential best-in-class therapy for multiple myeloma. In summary, this is a very special time for Gilead that's underscored with our Q2 results. This highlights the strength of our R&D engine and the level of excellence in our commercial and operational execution. Having built this positive momentum, we're excited by what's to come with continued innovation that will benefit patients and drive growth across our therapeutic areas.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another very strong quarter of commercial execution, culminating with the launch of YEZTUGO following FDA approval in late June 2025. Q2 product sales, excluding VEKLURY, of $6.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by 9% growth in BIKTARVY and 35% growth in DESCOVY. We also delivered encouraging contributions from LIVDELZI in its third full quarter of commercial launch and in TRODELVY, partially offset by lower HCV sales following a very strong Q2 in 2024. Sequentially, sales in our base business were up 10%, driven by growth in HIV, oncology, and liver disease. Including VEKLURY, total product sales of $7.1 billion were up 2% year-over-year. While VEKLURY's share of US hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19 remains well over 60%, the number of patients impacted by the pandemic continues to decline.\nThis is reflected in Q2 sales of $121 million for VEKLURY and also in our updated full-year guidance. Moving to slide eight, HIV sales of $5.1 billion represented very strong 7% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by increased demand in addition to higher average realized price. Sequentially, sales were up 11%, reflecting inventory build and higher average realized price, both typical Q2 seasonal dynamics, as well as higher demand. On slide nine, BIKTARVY sales of $3.5 billion were up 9% year-over-year, with commercial execution supporting a strong increase in demand. Sequentially, sales were up 12%, reflecting seasonal inventory build and higher average realized price, as well as higher demand. BIKTARVY once again expanded its US market share and increased two percentage points year-over-year to over 51%. BIKTARVY continues to lead in share in major markets around the world.\nFurther strengthening BIKTARVY's differentiation, FDA recently granted a label expansion to include the treatment of HIV in people with antiretroviral history who are not virologically suppressed, with no known or suspected resistance. This new indication addresses an important unmet need for people with HIV, specifically those who come off therapy and then restart treatment. This label expansion reinforces confidence in BIKTARVY to get such individuals to sustained viral suppression. Moving to DESCOVY, Q2 sales of $653 million increased 35% year-over-year, with growing awareness of PrEP and unrestricted access driving both higher average realized price and higher demand. Sequentially, sales were up 11%, reflecting seasonal inventory dynamics and higher demand. Partly driven by strong execution from our commercial teams and continued growth ahead of the YEZTUGO launch, the US PrEP market has now expanded to more than half a million active users.\nThis market continues to grow in the mid-teens year-over-year, highlighting progress on our goal of expanding the HIV prevention market. Additionally, DESCOVY for PrEP share grew once again this quarter, representing more than 40% of the US market. Moving to slide 10, we received FDA approval of YEZTUGO as the first twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention in mid-June, and the team has been executing what I consider to be the best planned commercial launch I have seen to date. Revenue in the first days of launch, right at the end of Q2, reflected planned inventory build as we expected. While it's still early days, we're extremely pleased with the feedback from both clinicians and consumers, as well as the progress of our early discussions with payers and the effectiveness of our launch preparations and execution to date.\nNotably, the first YEZTUGO prescription was written within hours of approval, with the first product shipped within 24 hours and the first dose administered within days, well ahead of our expectations. Prior to launch or any commercial engagement, YEZTUGO's unaided awareness among healthcare providers was at 72%, more than twice the typical pre-launch awareness, with aided awareness at 95%. I look forward to sharing more about YEZTUGO's early performance in the coming quarters. We are well on our way to achieving our target of 75% access for YEZTUGO within six months of launch and 90% within 12 months. Outside the US, we have just received a positive CHMP opinion and expect a European Commission decision on lenacapavir in the next two months. Our launch preparations in our initial target European territories are underway.\nGilead is committed to facilitating access to lenacapavir for those who could benefit from HIV prevention, regardless of where they live. With that in mind, we recently announced a partnership with the Global Fund to bring lenacapavir to approximately two million people in primarily low and lower-middle-income countries over the next three years. We were also pleased that the World Health Organization and the International AIDS Society both recently announced new HIV prevention guidelines recommending the use of lenacapavir. As we look at the rest of 2025 on slide 11, it's clear that we are seeing very strong performance in both HIV treatment and prevention. With that in mind, we're increasing our full-year sales guidance and now expect HIV sales to grow approximately 3% in 2025, up from our prior assumption of flat revenue year-over-year.\nThis updated HIV guidance is driven by strong BIKTARVY and DESCOVY performance so far this year and our expectations for the second half. Some additional considerations. First, we've made no change to our assumption regarding the impact of Medicare Part D redesign, which at the start of the year, we expected to impact our HIV business by approximately $900 million in 2025. Excluding this headwind, HIV growth this year would be more than 7%. Second, given the recency of launch, we have made no changes to launch assumptions surrounding YEZTUGO. And finally, given a broad range of possible policy outcomes, our updated HIV guidance assumes no changes to the current landscape. Moving to liver disease on slide 12, sales of $795 million were down 4% year-over-year, following a particularly strong Q2 of 2024.\nThis reflects lower average realized price and lower patient starts in HCV, partially offset by the very strong launch of LIVDELZI, as well as demand for HDV and HBV products. For HCV, US pricing has been impacted year-over-year by Medicare Part D redesign, while volume was driven by the timing of purchases in both the US and internationally. In Primary Biliary Cholangitis, we continue to be pleased with LIVDELZI's performance in the US, as well as the early launches in Europe following approval last quarter. Overall, revenue almost doubled from $40 million in Q1 to $78 million in Q2, driven by growing second-line PBC market share with our focus on both market expansion and persistence of therapy. Looking ahead, we are particularly encouraged by the demand we're seeing for LIVDELZI in new patient starts.\nThat said, and after a tremendously strong Q2, we do expect sequential growth to be more moderate in the Q3, reflecting continued growth in new patients, but a slower uptake among switch patients where cadence of physician visits remains a gating factor. Moving to slide 13, TRODELVY sales of $364 million were up 14% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, reflecting TRODELVY's continued strength in metastatic breast cancer and more than offsetting on a year-over-year basis the expected decline associated with the withdrawal of the bladder cancer indication in the US. Internationally, we have seen strong demand growth both year-over-year and sequentially, where launch momentum and share gains continue across major markets.\nBuilding on our market leadership in second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, we're working towards filing for approval in the first-line setting based on the potentially practice-changing results from the ASCENT-03 and ASCENT-04 trials. As a reminder, there are almost twice as many patients in the first-line metastatic setting compared to second-line, as well as longer duration of therapy, and we look forward to expanding the options available for patients in this earlier line setting. For cell therapy on slide 14, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Q2 sales of $485 million were down 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower demand, partially offset by higher average realized price. As expected, our Kite cell therapies continue to face competitive headwinds, although sales were up 5% sequentially, helped by favorable FX impact in addition to higher demand for YESCARTA in the US and TECARTUS globally.\nIt's taking time to reduce the barriers to broaden adoption of cell therapy, but we're making progress. For example, FDA recently removed the CAR-T class requirement for a REMS program, which we believe will reduce the burden of CAR-T administration for healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers, and we're pleased to see these changes starting to be rolled out across authorized treatment centers. FDA also made additional changes to the CAR-T product labels that will have meaningful impact on patient and caregiver quality of life. This included a 50% reduction in the time patients need to remain near their treating center and a 75% reduction in driving restrictions. We continue to believe that outpatient delivery remains key to broader cell therapy adoption. With that in mind, new real-world data shared at ASCO highlighted the viability of outpatient administration for YESCARTA.\nThis is also reflected in increasing outpatient adoption over time, suggesting growing physician comfort with the use of YESCARTA in this setting. Our efforts to educate physicians and patients on the potential benefits of a one-time CAR-T treatment are also ongoing. Most recently, we highlighted new five-year overall survival analysis from TECARTUS in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at EHA, the longest follow-up of any CAR-T therapy in this indication. Together, these new data support our goals of bringing cell therapy closer to patients and increasing adoption. Wrapping up our Q2, I want to thank the commercial teams for delivering yet another strong quarter of impact for patients and financial results for Gilead. Any commercial organization is energized by new product launches, and we are so fortunate to have several new, exciting, and impactful products in our portfolio.\nThe YEZTUGO launch marks a unique moment for Gilead, and I know the commercial teams share a sense of both excitement and responsibility, given the potential to truly transform the HIV landscape in the coming years. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Dietmar.\n\nDietmar Berger\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start on slide 16 by recognizing the years of tireless effort across many research and development teams at Gilead, Kite, and our partners that contributed to a spectacular quarter of clinical results. In April and May, we announced positive top-line results from ASCENT-04 and ASCENT-03 that showed TRODELVY regimens demonstrated highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy with the potential to be practice-changing in first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. In May and June, we shared promising early results from our next-generation bicistronic CAR-Ts in lymphoma and glioblastoma.\nIn June, we shared updated data from our pivotal iMMagine-1 trial in fourth-line and later relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma that further reinforced our belief in anito-cel's best-in-class potential. And also in June, we achieved FDA approval of YEZTUGO, our breakthrough twice-yearly injectable for HIV prevention, which we truly believe has transformative potential. We believe lenacapavir will help bring us closer to our goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the years ahead. You have heard Johanna's excitement about the commercial launch in the US, and in July, we were pleased CHMP adopted positive opinions for our EU marketing authorization application and for EU-Medicines for All, which enables a streamlined assessment for WHO pre-qualification and additional global regulatory reviews. These are critical advances in our plans to help make lenacapavir available to people who need to be protected from HIV globally.\nThis is a moment of pride for this Gilead team and has given me personal pause as I recognize and appreciate the brilliance of the team of scientists that we have here and the determination to keep out-innovating ourselves to achieve the best possible experience and outcomes for those we serve. With that in mind, our work in HIV continues. As you can see on slide 17, with the approval of YEZTUGO, we continue to target up to eight additional HIV product launches before the end of 2033, including five that would come to market by the end of 2030. In HIV prevention, we have initiated our phase lll trial evaluating once-yearly intramuscular injections of lenacapavir for HIV prevention, now called PURPOSE 365. If successful, this could launch as early as 2028.\nIn HIV treatment, we continue to expect an update on our new daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir in the second half of the year from ARTISTRY-1 in people with HIV on complex regimens. In addition to ARTISTRY-1, we now expect to provide an update for ARTISTRY-2, the second phase lll trial for BIGLEN for virologically suppressed people with HIV or people looking to switch regimens. Looking at our weekly HIV treatment programs, we expect a phase lll update on the lenacapavir plus islatravir combination in 2026, with a view to potential launch in 2027. As we announced, our wholly owned Weekly Wonders program evaluating the combination of GS4182, one of our lenacapavir prodrugs, and GS1720, one of our long-acting integrase inhibitors, is on clinical hold pending further analysis.\nWe're making progress on our other oral long-acting candidates and continue to expect our wholly owned once-weekly program to be moving forward with a delay of three to six quarters. Among the rest of our leading HIV programs, three are in phase l, namely our monthly oral, our quarterly, and twice-yearly injectables. We look forward to sharing updates on these in due course. Finally, we continue to plan for our phase lll study evaluating lenacapavir plus broadly neutralizing antibodies, or BNABs, as a potential twice-yearly injectable treatment. We continue to target commercial launch in 2030. Moving to oncology on slide 18, TRODELVY's impact in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer was reinforced with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in the phase lll ASCENT-03 and ASCENT-04 studies in the first-line setting.\nAt ASCO, we presented potentially practice-changing detailed data from ASCENT-04 showing treatment with TRODELVY plus pembrolizumab resulted in an 11.2-month median progression-free survival, a 35% improvement versus chemo plus pembro for first-line PD-L1 positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We saw an early trend for improvement in overall survival with TRODELVY plus pembro, though we would note these data are immature. Still, these results are remarkable given the high share of patients who crossed over to TRODELVY following disease progression in the control arm, which would be expected to mask a potential overall survival benefit. We will be filing for full approval based on the primary median PFS endpoint for both ASCENT-03 and ASCENT-04, with a potential FDA regulatory decision expected in 2026.\nWe plan to share detailed phase lll ASCENT-03 data at an upcoming medical meeting, which will allow it to be considered for future guideline updates. These results are encouraging as we continue to evaluate TRODELVY in earlier lines of breast cancer. In addition to ASCENT-03 and ASCENT-04, our other phase lll breast cancer programs include ASCENT-07 in chemo-naïve, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, evaluating TRODELVY following endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapies. This is an event-driven trial, and we will update you in due course. ASCENT-05 in high-risk early triple-negative breast cancer, evaluating adjuvant TRODELVY plus pembro. As would be expected with an earlier line trial in a potentially curative setting, it will be several years before we are able to provide an update.\nWe also remain focused on clinical execution of our five other ongoing phase lll programs for TRODELVY and domvanalimab across lung, endometrial, and upper GI cancers. Moving to slide 19, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we were pleased to present new data from across our cell therapy pipeline at the ASCO and EHA conferences. In partnership with Arcelix, data from the iMMagine-1 trial at EHA demonstrated the consistent and compelling efficacy and safety profile of anito-cel. We continue to believe anito-cel has the potential to offer a best-in-class profile, and we look forward to presenting pivotal data from this trial towards the end of the year. As a reminder, we continue to target 2026 for a commercial launch.\nFrom our next-generation constructs at ASCO, we presented initial data from the bicistronic CD19/CD20 Kite 363 CAR-T, which we believe has shown a promising profile in B-cell malignancies, and we have selected Kite 363 to be evaluated in phase l trials of autoimmune and neuroinflammatory conditions. In the second half of this year, we will decide which program to advance in hematology, choosing between our three next-generation CAR-T constructs. Additionally, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, ASCO data on the bicistronic EGFR-IL-13R?2 CAR-T strengthens proof of concept for expanding CAR-Ts to treat solid tumors. Overall, we remain excited in the potential of our next-generation therapies to offer improved efficacy and safety profiles and to reach patients faster as we work towards our goal of bringing potentially curative therapies to patients.\nFinally, moving to our pipeline milestones on slide 20, we have had an extremely productive and successful quarter overall. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect the pivotal update from our iMMagine-1 trial evaluating anito-cel in fourth-line or later relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, the European Commission decision on lenacapavir for PrEP following the recent positive CHMP opinion, and a phase lll update for ARTISTRY-1 evaluating BIGLEN in people with HIV on complex regimens. We have also added a new milestone, a phase lll update for ARTISTRY-2 evaluating BIGLEN in virologically suppressed people with HIV. Together, ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 have the potential to support global regulatory filings that could expand the reach of Gilead's HIV treatment business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Dietmar, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 22, our Q2 results show continued strength in execution across the company. Our base business was up 4% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, driven by growth in BIKTARVY, DESCOVY, LIVDELZI, and TRODELVY. Reflecting fewer COVID-related hospitalizations, VEKLURY sales were down 44% year-over-year, resulting in total product sales of $7.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Moving to our non-GAAP results on slide 23, Q2 product gross margin was up 1% from the same quarter last year to 87%, driven by a more favorable product mix. R&D expenses were up 9% compared to a relatively low Q2 of 2024, reflecting investments in clinical manufacturing and study activities. I'll highlight that we continue to expect full-year R&D expenses to be roughly flat on a dollar basis from 2024, and year-to-date R&D expenses are tracking in line with our internal expectations.\nAcquired IP R&D expenses were $61 million in the Q2, primarily driven by the Kymera collaboration we announced in June. SG&A expenses were flat year-over-year, with higher sales and marketing expenses primarily related to our HIV franchise, offset by lower G&A expenses. Q2 operating margin was 46%, or 47% excluding acquired IP R&D. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter, in line with our expectations. Finally, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.01 for the quarter. Moving to our full-year guidance on slide 24, we had an extremely strong first half of 2025, driven by our HIV portfolio and bolstered by the encouraging momentum in both LIVDELZI and TRODELVY. With that in mind, we are updating our full-year 2025 guidance as follows.\nWe now expect product sales, excluding VEKLURY, of approximately $27.3 to 27.7 billion, representing an increase of half a billion dollars in our base business expectations for 2025. This update reflects HIV growth of approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by the outperformance of BIKTARVY and DESCOVY year to date, FX tailwinds, and softer cell therapy expectations, where we now expect a modest decline for full-year 2025 versus full-year 2024. I'll note that our assumptions have not changed in the following areas. Firstly, our assumptions for the impact of Medicare Part D redesign remain unchanged from the beginning of the year, and we expect approximately $1.1 billion of impact to our business. Secondly, while we're very encouraged by the launch dynamics of YEZTUGO to date, we are not updating our assumptions for YEZTUGO revenue in the second half of 2025 at this time.\nFinally, we have not updated our expectations for the impact of potential tariffs or other changes to the broader policy environment. We continue to expect the impact of known tariffs to be manageable in 2025. Moving to slide 25, we are reducing our full-year 2025 expectations for VEKLURY by $400 million to approximately $1 billion, reflecting the current path of the COVID-19 pandemic, including lower hospitalization rates in the first half and the trends we've seen in the first month of the Q3. As a result, total product sales is expected to be in the range of $28.3 to 28.7 billion, with half a billion dollar increase in base business expectations, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related sales.\nFor other items in the P&L, on a non-GAAP basis, we now expect product gross margin to be approximately 86%, reflecting strong performance year to date and a more favorable product mix. We expect R&D expenses to be roughly flat on a dollar basis from 2024, which is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. We expect acquired IP R&D to be approximately $400 million, reflecting $315 million of expenses so far this year, in addition to known commitments and expected milestone payments. SG&A expenses are now expected to decline by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to 2024, updated to reflect higher HIV sales and marketing expenses, and other corporate expenses associated with higher 2025 base business expectations.\nRounding out the P&L, we expect operating income to be between $13 billion and 13.4 billion, our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, consistent with our prior guidance, and we expect our full-year diluted EPS to be between $7.95 and 8.25, an increase of $0.20 at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor the macro landscape carefully, and we expect that our disciplined approach to operating expense management positions us well to adapt as needed in the months ahead. On slide 26, our capital priorities remain unchanged, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the Q2. This included $527 million of share repurchases currently being executed under our 2020 plan. We expect to complete the 2020 program over the next several quarters, and our board recently approved a new $6 billion program to support continued share repurchases.\nThese repurchases are intended to offset equity dilution at a minimum, but can also be used opportunistically, as you've seen in the first half of 2025. Overall, Gilead delivered another very strong quarter of clinical and commercial execution, supported by our disciplined operating model. As we look to the second half of the year, we believe that Gilead is well positioned for near-term and long-term growth, and we remain focused on delivering on our strategic commitments. With that, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Andy. At this time, we'll invite your questions. Please be courteous and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. Again, to ask a question, press star one, and to withdraw your question, press star two. Our first question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. Tyler, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Hey there. Thanks very much, and congratulations on the progress. I know you'll be shocked to hear this question, but can you please elaborate on the early uptake withYEZTUGO and whether you expect the early prescriptions to trend linearly from here, or if it's still very early and what is expected to be more of an exponential launch curve?\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, go ahead, Johanna, please. Thanks.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Treasury and Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nHi, Tyler.\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nWe are very surprised to get that question.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nShocked. Tyler, thanks for the question. It's Johanna. Yeah, we're really pleased with the launch so far. And you're right, it's still early days. We're about six weeks in, but super thrilled to see what's been going on. I think, number one, a lot of that has to do with the readiness of the cross-functional teams.\nAs you know, the day that we got, or I should say the hour we got the approval, everything was basically ready to turn key and get going. So the teams have hit the ground running, and just really proud to see how they're working together in pods across the US to make sure that this happens. We've already had over about 25,000 customer calls executed in the field, and just understanding that our target base is about 15,000. So many of those customers have seen either a representative or a medical sales representative more than once. And that's how we see kind of the uptake and the excitement. When we think about the awareness at launch, it was already kind of double what we usually see in industry at launch, right? You were looking at about a 72% unaided awareness. Usually, those numbers are in the 30s or so.\nAnd then, of course, our aided awareness was 95 plus. So we really knew that as we were going into this, we were ready, and now it's up to us to pull it through. You heard me say a couple of early data points around first script within hours, injection within a couple of days, and tracking that super closely. The piece that maybe is important to understand as well is how access is playing out here. We've always said about you should expect 75% or so access at six-month time point, and then about 90% at 12. And the medical exceptions are basically the way people are working through this. And we have a great field reimbursement team that is there to provide that end-to-end reimbursement support to make sure we can pull through those scripts as quickly as possible.\nBut different plans will take different times, and that's what we're obviously very conscious of. At the same time, I will say we have a couple of early wins that we're really proud of. One, I would say the J-code, which sometimes is having a miscellaneous J-code is great, but having the J-code come through is actually really important. It just simplifies the whole billing and reimbursement process. And we got confirmation that our J-code is coming through for 1 October 2025. You probably know from other launches, usually that takes at least two to three quarters. And so that's a little bit ahead of our expectations. And then we've had some early commercial wins where some plans have come in as of 1 August. And then we've had also some state Medicaid wins.\nNamely, I just want to highlight, we have a couple more than this, but two out of the four biggest PrEP states, prevention states are California and Florida. Both of those are on formally as of 1 August 2025. We're really pleased to see that more and more lives are getting access and working through kind of those medical exceptions as we go, and really high interest from a lot of our payers to make sure we can have those discussions. We've engaged with multiple accounts, over 200 accounts we've engaged with to make sure they have all the information they need to make those formulary decisions. That's what we're working through. That's obviously going to take a little bit of time, as you know, but I think we're very well on our way to achieve our goals. Super excited.\nHopefully, you can hear it and see all the data, the proof points to support it. I think we have the right team, the right attitude, and the responsibility to make sure we really make a difference here with YEZTUGO and bend the curve of this epidemic. So stay tuned as a little bit more data comes through in the next quarter and more to come.\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Johanna. Thanks, Tyler, for the question. I just want to add, I'm really impressed with the team's early launch support here, and we look forward to updating you in quarters to come. Can we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Terence. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on all the progress as well. Johanna, you mentioned DESCOVY had one of its best quarters ever. I think if you look at the growth trajectory there, it's obviously been very robust and looks to be tracking well above the 8% rate that I think is implied in your longer-term guidance for the prep market when you guys look out to 2030. So just wondering how durable this kind of a growth rate is, given what you're seeing out there in the market and a lot of the work you're doing that you've done ahead of the YEZTUGO launch. And then just one clarification. Can you just comment on the accuracy of YEZTUGO IQVIA data for us if you have any visibility there? Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Thanks, Terence. So a couple of things. One is the PrEP market is growing nicely, at about double digit, right? About 15% or so year on year. That obviously has to do with a lot of the work that we've been pulling through, a lot of initiatives in the field to increase awareness about prevention and the importance of prevention. That's why we were excited to share that those numbers are growing quite actively, and we're at about 500,000 or so active users in PrEP, which is well on our way to kind of those goals that you were referring to of over a million by mid-30s.\nWe do think that there's an opportunity for us to basically continue that growth in the marketplace, especially with the excitement with YEZTUGO. I think the PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2 data are just so powerful that they're really having impact in the field. We will continue to drive that.\nTo your comments around DESCOVY and the incredible performance that we've been seeing with DESCOVY, right, that 35% share, a lot of that has to do with basically continued favorable access that we've seen over the last six to nine months or so, where we're seeing the copays come down to $0 in many cases. Our access basically jumped up a little bit, and we're now at about, if you think about unrestricted access, we're at about 88% of total lives covered, and we are about 98% total covered lives. So about 10% still have a little bit of restrictions, either step edit or prior auth. But that's actually a big jump. And then the teams have done an incredible job with those plans that had those changes, is really to increase those shares of DESCOVY in those plans. So that's what you're seeing in the uptake.\nWhat I would suggest, though, is as YEZTUGO gets traction and ramps up over the next coming quarters, you will probably see a little bit of a decline because the intent with YEZTUGO is obviously to look at the total PrEP market and make sure that we're differentiating there across all the orals as well as other long-acting. So you will see a little bit of a shift in the mix, right, as we go forward. Hopefully, that addressed that question. And your quick comment on IQVIA data, listen, it's still really early, but we do believe IQVIA data is directionally aligned. It's just some accounts, some channels are not represented in IQVIA, as you well know, so they're not reflected in the data. I think we're going to need a couple of more quarters to stabilize, as you've seen in the past with other launches.\nHaving said that, we are so pleased kind of with what we're seeing in the initial uptake, the customer response. I think I will tell you the excitement is palpable internally, externally. And I would also say that we're also tracking really closely kind of the customer uptake as well, right? So as it goes through into the reimbursement, because our teams are making sure that we can pull those scripts through. And what really matters through IQVIA is users that are getting the injection. So we're tracking both of those really closely. So stay tuned, but I think a couple more quarters will help us kind of normalize that data.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many analysts as possible on today's call. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat at Evercore. Umer, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress with YEZTUGO. I figured I'll go in a different direction on potentially a risk factor for the business. In a scenario where the industry does converge around an MFN proposal, which is focused on Medicaid, how do you see the impact of Gilead business from a revenue perspective? And obviously, inclusive of the mandatory and CPI rebates you do pay to Medicaid already. Thank you very much.\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah. Thanks, Umer. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Johanna to talk specifically about the Medicaid portion of it. I just want to be clear that obviously we are having discussions and working with the administration on the whole topic of MFN.\nI would say just as a backdrop to all this, that given the general business uncertainty in the country and also some of the sector-specific uncertainty, it's even more important that we're at this stage in Gilead's history of driving forward with all these new launches, controlling operating expenses. I remind you, as you know, we have just very limited patent exposure until the end of 2033, with a very strong clinical development plan to be able to support the patients with that medicine prior to 2033. So I'll just put that in the backdrop. Obviously, we very much support the concept of finding ways to have patients better afford their medicine in this country while also preserving the right ecosystem here. Now, specifically related to your Medicaid question, I'll hand it over to Johanna to talk about how that could or could not impact us.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nRight. I mean, so you know, Medicaid business for us in HIV, I'm going to focus on HIV, biggest piece of our business, is around mid- to lower 20s. And so that is something that is important to us. Remember, the copays, so the patient out-of-pocket cost for Medicaid is incredibly low. It's either $0 or a couple of dollars per script. And there's a lot of support for that. I mean, obviously, what we're tracking is also not just potential demo projects and things like that with MFN, but we're also tracking the current legislation with Medicaid as to the big beautiful bill. And we are tracking that, realizing that most of those have implications late 2026 into 2027, so no immediate impact at this point in time. Having said that, all of that said, HIV is very different.\nAnd it is a disease that obviously, if you don't treat it, I think the repercussions and the consequences are not just that individual patient. They could be much broader, such as a local epidemic of HIV in the United States. And so that's why many individuals, or most individuals that are diagnosed with HIV, there's really always a safety net program to support them in their treatment. And whether that's state programs, ADAP programs, foundations, or even Gilead's patient access programs, these are all pieces of the puzzle that we're thinking through to make sure we wrap around to make sure that those patients get coverage and access to the medicines they need.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Seigerman at BMO Capital Markets. Evan, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, thank you for the question, and really congrats on the progress. Given the importance of the YEZTUGO launch and the recent changes to the HHS Preventive Services Task Force, if PrEP is removed as a preventive medicine broadly, how does this change your approach to commercialization and is there a potential also impact to DESCOVY? Thank you so much.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nI heard most of that. It's Johanna. Evan, I'll take that one. Yeah. So listen, let me start by saying the USPSTF guidance is something we truly support. We believe in preventive services. We think it's very important across all diseases, but namely in HIV when you think about prevention. The current guidelines are well enforced. They support the $0 copay and without access restrictions or step edits or whatnot for HIV prevention. And we believe that also includes YEZTUGO as we're going forward with those conversations with the plans.\nAs I mentioned earlier, DESCOVY is well covered, 88% of access with no restrictions. Having said all of that, if there was to be a change in the future, not that we foresee that, if there was to be a change, I just want to remind you that these guidelines didn't really have legs until probably less than a year ago, probably about two, three quarters ago. Before that, the prevention market was still growing very strong, same rates basically that we're seeing today. We were very successful with DESCOVY at about a 40% share or so. We're now closer to about a little bit towards the 44% to 45% share now, and the market's still growing at around the same rate. So we do believe that whether we have USPSTF, that's ideal.\nIf it was to change in any way, we still believe we could work through it and just work closer with our payers to make sure that people have access to HIV prevention moving forward, just as they do today.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott at J.P. Morgan. Chris, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nHi, great. Thanks so much. And yeah, congrats on the progress. I just wanted to ask about the treatment pipeline and specifically just elaborate on your confidence on the 4182, 1720, the weekly treatment combo, the Weekly Wonders program, following the clinical hold announced earlier this year. I guess just kind of next updates we should be watching for on that combo and just how does that stack up relative to some of the other treatment combos that you're working on? Thank you.\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey, Chris, we'll get Dietmar's voice here.\n\nDietmar Berger\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris, for the question. Our confidence in the treatment pipeline is high, right? And remember, we not only work on a weekly approach, we also work on daily, monthly, every three months, and every six months approaches. So the pipeline is deep. We have a variety of different molecules. And if you look at 4182 and 1720, one of them is a lenacapavir prodrug. The other one is an INSTI, and we have several other molecules of those classes in our portfolio. So what we're currently doing is we're trying to understand the data further. We're doing preclinical and clinical analysis to really isolate the observation that we had to make sure we understand which of the molecules led to that observation.\nAnd then to move forward expeditiously with one of our other molecules that we have in the portfolio in a new combination to really get that weekly treatment opportunity to patients. I also want to mention that we obviously have our phase lll islatravir program, islatravir and lenacapavir ongoing, which is currently in phase lll. The next update on that program is coming 2026, and the estimated launch for that one is in 2027. With regards to our wholly owned program, kind of the Weekly Wonders program and the succession of that, we will update you in due course.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham at Citibank. Geoff, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director of Citi Research, Citibank\n\nAll right, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on YEZTUGO. It seems like the OUS contribution. I think it's going to be much bigger when you compare to DESCOVY or Truvada in PrEP Johanna, I'm not asking for guidance, but when you think about the US versus OUS contribution for HIV treatment, could that ultimately mirror what you will see in PrEP kind of at the peak? I guess that's what I'm asking, is that the outside the US market is one that's sort of novel and new for you guys and want to get some context there. Thanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Geoff. I do think that you're right. I think there is a broader opportunity with YEZTUGO ex-US. And a lot of that has to do, right, with DESCOVY. We were kind of challenged in many markets to compare it with Truvada. And Truvada was generic in many of those markets.\nWith YEZTUGO, I think with the innovation, the transformational value that we are bringing for markets that truly recognize the need for something else in HIV prevention and recognize the value of lenacapavir and what it brings to their populations or their specific target populations where you see an HIV incidence that is very high, I really do think there's an opportunity for us to have broader footprint than just where we are today with DESCOVY, for example. So I think, to your point, at steady state or at peak, I do think maybe that'll take a little bit of time because I think the challenge from a reimbursement standpoint will not be simple.\nBut I do think for the countries that have literally said and been very outspoken that they want to bend the curve or that they're not meeting their 2030 targets, which nobody is, this is really an opportunity for us to partner with those stakeholders and make sure that YEZTUGO is available for those countries.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal at Wells Fargo. Mohit, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nSenior Biotech and Pharmaceutical Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. And Johanna, you are very popular today, so one more for you. So the question is regarding the logistics as well as the safety side of it. So just wanted to understand for YEZTUGO the logistics dynamic because this is a prescriber base that is used to orals, and now they're going to use an injection, which is also at doctors' offices. So how are you navigating that? And would it take some time to help understand prescribers, the entire dynamic? Would love to understand that. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences",
    "content2": "Sure. Sure. And as we were preparing for this launch, we were leveraging a lot of the learnings of past launches in this space or launches that went from an oral to injectable just to understand what we needed to do to prepare for it. And one of the key things was education and making sure that there was optionality, flexibility for where they go. So at launch, we were able to offer our customers, our HCPs, the clinics, to make sure that they understood that they could prescribe it and do buy-and-bill in their office.\nWe also offered them to make sure that they could prescribe it and then send the script to specialty pharmacy, and they would do all the background work and then send the product back for the injection with the user, the consumer. Or if they didn't want any of that, they could go to an alternate site of care and basically just send with the script the consumer to that alternate site of care for their injection and do all the reimbursement background work. So I think we've set it up with a lot of flexibility. And what we're seeing, although very early, what we're seeing is exactly kind of what we thought. We thought at the beginning we're going to see a lot heavier towards specialty pharmacy. The buy-and-bill would be more the clinics that were already doing buy-and-bill in the past.\nA little bit of an alternate site of care is happening as well, but few and far between. So I think it's still very early to kind of assess where that's looking for. But I will say one of the biggest differentiations is I talked a little bit earlier around cross-functional network and partnership. The teams are set up across the US so that they have a full cross-functional team, whether it comes with nurse educators, field reimbursement, the medical representative, the commercial sales representative, and they work together in pods. So what they've done is actually set up meetings with a lot of these clinics around the country together so that they could answer all the questions at the same time to navigate the process, the logistics for YEZTUGO. And that has apparently had incredible success. Our customers aren't used to that.\nThey've been incredibly appreciative and satisfied with what we've been bringing so that they have all their answers when they need it so that they can put pen to paper and prescribe for their patients. And so I think we're managing it incredibly cross-functionally and making sure that we understand the complexity of the logistics, but making sure the customers see it as simple. And so that's our goal.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Courtney Breen at Bernstein. Courtney, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, well, thanks so much for taking my question today. Probably another one for Johanna, I think. You spoke a little bit about kind of you've been surprised positively so far in the YEZTUGO launch around access and around kind of the connecting of the dots that the team has been able to achieve and the scripts and the actual injection rates. Why didn't you raise the launch expectations or the guidance as you thought about kind of the YEZTUGO launch for the remainder of this year? What are the things that are still question marks in your mind that would give you confidence to kind of raise your own expectations in terms of this launch for the early parts and what we might see this year? Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nCCO, Gilead Sciences\n\nCourtney, great question. And I think I would answer it with two ways. One is it's still very early, right? We're six weeks into the launch, so that's one. Two is access is critical here. And so we're managing one-offs on medical exceptions every time our field reimbursement team hears that there is a little bit of a block somewhere, and we're working through it with the plans.\nBut I think more importantly, we really need to see the number of covered lives increase over the next quarter or two to really see that momentum and really pull through those intake calls into scripts and injections. And so that's kind of the piece that we're waiting to see. And so I think you can ask me that question again in a couple of quarters, and we'll go from there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Carter Gould at Cantor. Carter, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cantor\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on all the YEZTUGO progress. Maybe to switch things up, I just wanted to ask on sort of your continued confidence on a need to sell approvability based on a single-arm study. I'm familiar with the feedback your partner received some time ago, but since then, there's been bispecific approvals.\nCompetitor CAR-T's have had confirmatory data coupled with obviously no shortage of disruption across CBER and FDA. So just how you get comfortable with the feedback from years past still applies, and if there's been ongoing feedback that bolsters that confidence. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, I know we're not communicating our regulatory strategy other than to say that we are continuing to have conversations with the FDA and are looking forward to launching in 2026. We don't have any major shifts in the things that we've communicated before and are looking forward to filing an NDA. Thank you.\n\nDan O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nGreat. This is Dan. I just want to thank everybody for your questions today and for joining the call. Maybe just a couple of closing comments from my side.\nAs we've shared today, this has been a really successful Q2 with growth drivers from all three of our therapeutic areas contributing to the 4% growth in the base business, more than offsetting the anticipated headwinds we had from the Medicare Part D redesign. Just to remind you all, we're incredibly proud of, and much of the call was devoted to this, to have delivered the world's first twice yearly prevention for HIV with lenacapavir in the US. It's really off to a very strong start. We'll continue to update on the quarters with that. But in addition, of course, we have the positive CHMP opinion on YEZTUGO and a great start overall with the launch. So we're incredibly impressed and proud of where we believe this will go. And overall, it's also been one of our strongest clinical quarters we've ever had.\nWe didn't speak about it so much today, but in addition to that, we had the back-to-back positive phase lll results for TRODELVY, and we just finished with the last question on the anito-cel and cell therapy and the broader cell therapy pipeline, I would say. This top-line performance is transforming down to the bottom line. It's a really special time at Gilead with so many launches, imminent launches, YEZTUGO, LIVDELZI, TRODELVY first line potentially coming up as well as anito-cel. So it's a strong time for the team. So I just want to take this opportunity to thank the Gilead team for the incredible efforts they're putting into driving this level of innovation. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As usual, our IR team is available for follow-up and any questions that you have.\nWe wish you a great rest of your day, and thank you for your interest in Gilead."

My name is Rebecca, and I'll be today's host. In a moment, we'll begin our prepared remarks followed by our Q&A session. To ask a question, please press star one, and to withdraw your question, press star two. I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Treasury and Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Rebecca. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2025. The press release slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.\nThe speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer Dietmar Berger, and our Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to slide 2 regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you Jacquie and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to share our Q1 results which reflect strong commercial and clinical execution across the business. Our base business excluding Veklury grew 4% from Q1 2024, primarily driven by growth in our HIV business. HIV sales were up 6% year-over-year with Biktarvy up 7% highlighting our demand led volume growth that was offset in part by the expected headwinds associated with the Part D redesign. Livdelzi continues its strong launch momentum with $40 million in sales in its second full quarter since launch.\nYear-over-year growth in our HIV and liver disease businesses was partially offset by softer than expected Trodelvy sales due to inventory dynamics that masked increase in demand as well as headwinds in cell therapy. Total product sales including Veklury were down by 1% from last year, reflecting fewer COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Beyond our commercial results, we also saw impressive operational execution with strong operating margin and earnings per share, results that highlight our continued focus on expense management and leverage in our business model. Our diverse pipeline continues to deliver across HIV, oncology, and inflammation.\nIn HIV, we are now only weeks away from the anticipated FDA decision on twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP. We remain on track for the 19 June PDUFA date and the potential launch in the US immediately following. As a reminder, this is one of up to nine potential HIV product launches we are targeting to before the end of 2033, building on Gilead's decades of leadership in HIV innovation.\nIn oncology. Earlier this week we announced the positive results from the phase III ASCENT-04 study of Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab for first-line PD-L1 positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The results showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival over the standard of care. This news represents an important potential benefit for patients.\nMetastatic TNBC is one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer and has historically been very difficult to treat. We expect to share the ASCENT-04 data at a medical congress in the near future and to file with global regulatory authorities as quickly as possible. We continue to expect an update later this quarter on the phase III ASCENT-03 study evaluating Trodelvy monotherapy in first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients who are not candidates for PD-1 inhibitors.\nMoving to cell therapy, we plan to provide an update on our registrational phase II iMMagine-1 trial later this year and remain on track to potentially launch anito-cel in late-line relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in 2026. We believe that anito-cel's clinical profile, combined with Kite's exceptional manufacturing capabilities and industry-leading turnaround time puts us in a strong position to address the unmet need for patients with multiple myeloma.\nIn inflammation, we are launching Livdelzi in additional markets following approval from the European Commission in February. We look forward to continued momentum as we bring Livdelzi to more people seeking to manage their primary biliary cholangitis with a differentiated option. As we wrap up a strong Q1 performance, we can look forward to continuing positive momentum. We have multiple potential launches ahead, including lenacapavir, anito-cel, and now Trodelvy. As a reminder, we have no major LOEs until the end of 2033 and expect to drive top line growth over time across all three of our therapeutic focus areas of virology, oncology, and inflammation.\nThe overall strength of our business means we are well positioned to adapt to a range of potential policy outcomes in the United States. It is worth noting that Gilead's average corporate tax rate of approximately 20% reflects the fact that the substantial majority of our intellectual property is already registered in the United States. The 2017 tax reform was instrumental in us bolstering our US investment and Gilead is differentiated in that almost 100% of our R&D capital infrastructure is in the US.\nIn addition, we have been increasing our investment in US manufacturing over the last several years with two large-scale cell therapy sites, and we have additional investment projects underway that are expected to run through 2028. Our focus is on delivering on our multiple upcoming launches and advancing our diverse pipeline, and in the meantime we continue to engage with the administration to encourage a balanced policy agenda that prioritizes innovation and the needs of patients. With that, I'll hand it over to Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks Dan, and good afternoon everyone. We've had a solid start to the year with our commercial execution delivering strong year-over-year sales growth in our base business. Product sales excluding Veklury of $6.3 billion were up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by HIV and liver disease sales, partially offset by lower oncology sales. Sequentially sales were down 12% as expected, mainly due to inventory dynamics, partially offset by higher sales in liver disease. Total product sales of $6.6 billion were down 1% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, reflecting lower Veklury sales.\nMoving to Slide 8, our HIV business delivered sales of $4.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year driven by higher average realized price and higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 16% consistent with our guidance reflecting normal first quarter seasonality including lower average realized price and volume following a particularly strong fourth quarter as well as the impact of Medicare Part D redesign.\nAs a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is generally more variable and less indicative of overall trends than full year results with normal first quarter impacts including inventory drawdown following a build in the fourth quarter and channel dynamics including the resetting of patient copays and deductibles which result in lower average realized price.\nBeyond these typical first quarter dynamics, HIV revenues were also impacted by Medicare Part D redesign in Q1 2025. This increased the manufacturer contribution and includes individuals on low-income subsidy for the first time. While we are still in the early stages of this implementation, our assumptions remain unchanged. In the meantime, we continue to expect robust demand led volume growth for the full year, though as shared back in February, this will be obscured this year, due to Part D headwinds resulting in flat reported HIV sales overall for 2025 with a return to growth in 2026.\nOn slide 9, in HIV treatment, Biktarvy sales of $3.1 billion were up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 17% as we expected, reflecting Q1 seasonality including lower average realized price and volume. Biktarvy once again increased US market share in Q1 to 51%, outpacing the growth of alternative regimens and remains the regimen of choice across G9 markets. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2-3% annually.\nDescovy sales of $586 million increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher average realized price and higher demand. HIV prevention continues to represent the significant majority of Descovy sales, and growth this quarter was driven by broader awareness, growing unrestricted access and associated pricing favorability, as well as focused commercial execution that contributed to approximately 16% US PrEP market growth year-over-year. Additionally, Descovy maintains over 40% market share and grew more than 2% year-over-year.\nSequentially, sales were down 5% reflecting typical seasonal inventory dynamics, partially offset by higher average realized price and higher demand. Growing awareness and adoption of HIV prevention is encouraging ahead of our upcoming potential US launch of lenacapavir for PrEP. I'm excited to have our field teams across market access, commercial, medical community, and our nurse educators mobilized to ensure we're ready for launch.\nBuilding on our deep expertise and success of HIV launches and with strong engagement across the ecosystem, from community leaders to healthcare providers, our teams are ready to build awareness, drive adoption, and overall deliver a seamless customer experience. Additionally, we're working with health authorities, policymakers, and other organizations outside of the US as we look to bring lenacapavir for PrEP to more people globally once approved.\nMoving to liver disease on slide 10, sales of $758 million were up 3% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand across PBC, HBV, and HDV, partially offset by lower average realized price for HCV products in the US. Sequentially, liver disease sales were up 5%, primarily driven by increased demand and inventory dynamics, partially offset by lower average realized price.\nFor Livdelzi. Q1 sales of $40 million reflect continued early momentum in the launch of PBC, and we're proud of the market share we've achieved so far. We're also pleased that in February the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for Livdelzi. We have just launched in Germany a few weeks ago and we expect to expand into other major European markets in the coming months.\nMoving to Slide 11, Veklury sales of $302 million were down 45% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations due to a milder winter season. Veklury's consistently high share of over 60% of treated hospitalized patients in the US reinforces its clinical benefit and position as the standard of care, particularly among patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Despite the variability of the path of the pandemic, we expect Veklury's important role to continue.\nOn Slide 12, Trodelvy sales of $293 million were down 5% year-over-year, reflecting inventory dynamics, lower average realized price, partially offset by higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 17%, primarily driven by inventory dynamics and lower demand. Trodelvy remains the leading regimen in second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in both the United States and Europe with stable share in pre-treated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.\nWe also look forward to potentially bringing the benefits of Trodelvy to triple-negative breast cancer patients in earlier lines of treatment given the clinically meaningful progression-free survival benefits seen in ASCENT-04 and with data from ASCENT-03 expected later this quarter. These studies could further strengthen our position in triple-negative breast cancer with almost double the addressable population compared to the second-line setting.\nMoving to cell therapy on slide 13, sales of $464 million were down 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, reflecting accelerating competitive headwinds, notably outside the US and more specifically for Tecartus. Yescarta sales of $386 million were up 2% year-over-year, driven by higher average realized price and increased rest of world demand, partially offset by lower demand in the US. Sequentially, sales were down 1%, reflecting European pricing favorability in the prior quarter that did not repeat, partially offset by higher demand outside the US.\nTecartus sales of $78 million were down 22% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, reflecting increased in and out of class competition. Our work to increase CAR T class penetration is ongoing, and we continue to make progress in breaking down barriers to adoption in the community setting, including in accreditation and commercial reimbursement. More broadly, we continue to raise awareness of the strength of our data, the advantages of a one-time treatment, and the potential benefits of earlier CAR T.\nNotwithstanding the ongoing competitive headwinds that we continue to expect to extend through 2025, we remain very excited about the overall opportunity and future for cell therapy with the potential launch of anito-cel in multiple myeloma in 2026 and exciting early stage data in our next generation products across lymphoma and solid tumors at ASCO.\nBefore I hand over to Dietmar Berger, I'd like to thank the commercialization teams for delivering a great start to the year. We remain focused on expanding the reach of our current portfolio, but are also very excited about the rich pipeline of near term launches over the next 12-18 months. In addition to the ongoing launch of Livdelzi and the potential launch of lenacapavir for PrEP in 2025, we're also looking forward to the potential launch of anito-cel in multiple myeloma and Trodelvy in first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in 2026. With that, I'll hand the call over to Dietmar.\n\nDietmar Berger\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. We have made a lot of progress in the first quarter with some exciting lenacapavir updates at CROI and our first pivotal phase III top line readout for Trodelvy in breast cancer since 2022. The quality of these readouts highlights the breadth and depth of clinical expertise across Gilead with the potential to support growth in our target therapeutic areas with new commercial launches in the years ahead.\nStarting with HIV on slide 15, we shared 20 abstracts at CROI, including data that showcase lenacapavir's potential even beyond the remarkable results we saw in PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2 last year. For example, we shared our phase I data that showed once yearly intramuscular injections maintained lenacapavir blood concentrations above those shown with twice yearly subcutaneous injections for more than 12 months. The injections were generally well tolerated. These data were published in the Lancet and we look forward to initiating a phase III study for once yearly lenacapavir for HIV prevention in the second half of this year.\nAs a reminder for our twice yearly subcutaneous injection of lenacapavir for HIV prevention, we have already submitted NDA, MAA, and EU Medicines for all applications with FDA and EMA. Further, we've submitted filings with regulatory bodies in South Africa and Brazil and continue to make good progress in all our discussions with the global regulatory bodies. In particular, we have not experienced any disruptions in our interactions with FDA and we continue to expect a regulatory decision by 19 June.\nIn HIV treatment, we shared phase II data at CROI evaluating twice-yearly lenacapavir plus two broadly neutralizing antibodies or bNAbs in virologically suppressed people with HIV genotypes that are highly susceptible to both bNAbs. At week 26, the combination regimen maintained virologic suppression with high efficacy similar to the stable baseline regimen comparator. There were no infusion-related reactions to the bNAbs and no discontinuations due to injection site reactions.\nLenacapavir plus bNAbs has already received breakthrough therapy designation from FDA and these phase II data further underscore the potential for this combination to be the first complete. Twice yearly treatment regimen for virologically suppressed people with HIV. Phase III planning is in progress.\nTouching upon liver disease on slide 16, we announced the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for Livdelzi for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis or PBC. The decision reflects Livdelzi's clinical benefit across key biomarkers of PBC and related pruritus in the phase III RESPONSE trial. In addition, we continue to make progress on our phase III IDEAL trial which is evaluating the efficacy of Livdelzi in PBC patients who are partial responders to UDCA, potentially doubling the addressable patient population. Overall, we are excited by the opportunities to bring this differentiated treatment to more patients across the world.\nMoving to Oncology on slide 17. I'm very pleased to share Trodelvy plus pembro demonstrated highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival benefit over standard of care in the phase III ASCENT-04 trial in first-line PD-L1 positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is the most aggressive type of breast cancer that disproportionately impacts younger and premenopausal women. We look forward to being able to potentially bring the benefits of Trodelvy to these metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients in the first line.\nWe will be submitting these data for.Presentation at a future medical congress and will engage with global regulators as quickly as possible. Further, we expect to provide an update from the phase III ASCENT-03 trial evaluating Trodelvy monotherapy in first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients who are not candidates for PD-1 inhibitors later this quarter. We also remain focused on clinical execution of our seven other ongoing phase III programs for Trodelvy and domvanalimab across six tumor types.\nMoving to Slide 18 and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we are pleased to be sharing new data from our next generation products at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June, including phase I data from KITE-363, our bicistronic CD19, CD20 CAR T for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and phase I data from the bicistronic EGFR IL-13Ra2 CAR T for glioblastoma in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. We believe KITE-363 could offer deeper, more sustained responses with a potential to overcome certain resistance mechanisms given its ability to target both CD19 and CD20.\nAdditionally, we believe its dual co-stimulatory domains balance effects such as rapid tumor cell killing, CAR T cell proliferation, and persistence in an optimal way. This could result in a potentially improved overall efficacy and safety profile in B-cell malignancies. Further, we believe many of these potential benefits could translate to B-cell driven autoimmune diseases, and have filed an IND to evaluate KITE-363 in this area as well.\nFor anito-cel, our pivotal iMMagine-1 study in 4th line plus relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is ongoing, and we look forward to providing an update in 2025 in the second-line plus setting. We are pleased to announce the phase III iMMagine-3 protocol has been amended to include minimal residual disease negativity as a dual primary endpoint in addition to progression-free survival. We're excited for this positive step to potentially bring anito-cel to patients in early line settings and remain confident in Anito-cel's profile across efficacy and safety combined with Kite's leading manufacturing capabilities.\nFinally, on slide 19 we achieved several important milestones this year, including European Commission conditional approval of Livdelzi, positive phase III top-line readout from ASCENT-04, and initiation of the phase III EVOKE small cell lung cancer study. We anticipate an update from the phase III ASCENT-03 trial later this quarter.Additionally, in virology we remain on track to provide an update on the data from our phase II-I trial, our wholly owned once-weekly INSTI-containing oral treatment for HIV at an upcoming medical meeting. Now I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Dietmar, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect both strong operating and commercial execution. As shown on slide 21, our base business was up 4% year-over-year to $6.3 billion, largely driven by growth in our HIV and liver disease business, partially offset by lower oncology sales. Veklury sales were down 45% year-over-year, resulting in a 1% decline in our total product sales to $6.6 billion.\nMoving to our non-GAAP results on slide 22. For the first quarter, product gross margin was flat year-over-year at 85%, in line with our full year guidance expectation of 85-86%. R&D expenses were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower clinical manufacturing activities. Acquired IPR&D expenses were $253 million, primarily driven by the LEO Pharma STAT6 collaboration we announced in January.\nSG&A expenses were down 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower corporate expenses partially offset by incremental selling and marketing spend in the United States. Q1 operating margin was 43%, highlighting our ongoing commitment to continue to operating expense discipline and delivering top quartile margins once again. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16% this quarter, below our historic average, largely driven by tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Finally, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.81.\nMoving to our full year guidance on slide 23, we are not making any changes to our revenue expectations or non-GAAP P&L guidance at this time. As we reflect on the tariffs that have been enacted to date, these could increase some of our indirect costs, but are expected to be manageable in 2025 in part due to potentially lighter FX headwinds than previously expected.\nFor 2025, therefore, we continue to expect total product sales of approximately $28.2 billion-28.6 billion, product sales excluding Veklury of approximately $26.8 billion-27.2 billion, 2025 HIV sales to be approximately flat compared to 2024, with demand-driven growth offset by the impact of the Medicare Part D redesign, and Veklury sales of approximately $1.4 billion. While Q1 was lighter than expected, we know this can be a highly variable business. With that in mind and consistent with our approach last year, we do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our Q3 earnings call.\nMoving to other parts of the P&L for full year 2025 on a non-GAAP basis, we continue to expect product gross margin to range between 85-86%, R&D expenses to be roughly flat from 2024, acquired IPRD to be approximately $400 million including the $253 million of expenses in Q1 as well as known commitments and expected milestone payments, SG&A expenses to decline by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2024, operating income to be between $12.7 billion-13.2 billion, effective tax rate to be approximately 19%, and finally, diluted EPS to be between $7.70-8.10 for the full year.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to monitor the macro landscape carefully, and we expect that our disciplined approach to operating expense management positions us well to adapt as needed in the months ahead. Finally, on slide 24 our capital priorities remain unchanged. We have already returned $1.7 billion to shareholders in Q1 2025 through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pursue disciplined expense management and careful investment in the most promising pipeline opportunities both internally and externally.\nI'm also pleased to note that S&P recently upgraded Gilead's long-term debt rating from BBB+ with a positive outlook to A- with a stable outlook. Recognizing the outlook for our HIV franchise and other products combined with steady revenue growth and strong cash flow generation overall, Gilead is on track to continue delivering demand-led volume growth, a disciplined operating model, and strong cash flow that positions us well for the rest of 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Andy. At this time we'll invite your questions. Please be courteous and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. Again, to ask your question, press star one, and to withdraw your question, press star two. First question comes from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Go ahead, your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, great. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter and progress. We wanted to ask about your expectations for the PrEP launch and assuming approval on time, how you think about the dynamics in the second half related to commercial reimbursement, Medicaid reimbursement, and whether guideline changes other factors also need to play a role. Thanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nHi Michael, it's Johanna. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so we're excited about the opportunity with the PDUFA date around the corner. We are counting, I think Dan referred to weeks. The team is counting days. We are absolutely ready for the launch. From an access standpoint, what we've said is we believe that it was going to take a couple of months as it builds access. We think about 75% or so access within the first six months to a peak covered lives at about 90% at a 12-month mark. That's going to happen month after month. It doesn't all happen in a bolus.\nWe also believe at the beginning that they're going to go through medical exceptions. They'll go through the process just like they do, for example, with Livdelzi as we're building access there as well. We believe that just takes a little bit more time but still could get through the process for those people that want lenacapavir. We'll work through that, and we're excited about that opportunity as we build out through 2025 and of course into 2026 with much stronger access.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carter Gould at Cantor Fitzgerald. Carter, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nGreat, thank you. Good afternoon. Following on the prior question, there have been a number of cuts across HHS, CDC to start the year across various teams, divisions, raising uncertainty around potential disruptions to messaging, education, awareness. Can you help maybe frame some of these and specifically as they might impact the launch? Are these either roles or activities that Gilead can maybe step into to do some of the heavy lifting and your confidence that we won't be pointing to these aspects as impacting the launch later in 2025 or into 2026?Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Carter. This is Dan. I'll start and then Johanna can add or others. I just want to be clear that, to date, we haven't heard or seen anything that would cause us to alter our plans or expectations for the len for PrEP launch or adversely affect our HIV business. Obviously, we're staying very closely attuned to this. Importantly, we're having discussions with policymakers to emphasize the importance of lenacapavir for PrEP and, in particular, in relation to their stated goals of addressing chronic diseases in this country and the value of prevention. We think that lenacapavir for PrEP is really well positioned there.\nSpecifically relative to the government support, and in particular you mentioned CDC, Carter, obviously their responsibilities include research and surveillance of HIV. They include supporting efforts around diagnosis and linkage to care. We're also involved in those activities. Again, nothing we've seen so far suggests that those core services are in a position to change our approach to the launch. Maybe with that, I'll hand it over to Johanna if she has any other questions or Dietmar if you want to comment on FDA too.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure, Dan. Maybe just to add a point, Carter, around PrEP market growth and what you asked, what Gilead can do. I think that Gilead's been incredibly focused on making sure we continue to have market development initiatives to ensure screening, diagnosis, for treatment, but also to ensure awareness, and within the PrEP market, make sure there's education there as well.\nI think you've seen that as you think about the PrEP market growth. We had a lot of activities in Q4 of last year, and that's playing out. We saw a nice uplift of the growth of the PrEP market in Q4, and you see that come through again in Q1 at about 16% year-over-year. Really well-positioned as you think about lenacapavir around the corner.\n\nDietmar Berger\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nOn the FDA side, at this time, all our interactions with the FDA have been on track, as expected, without any surprises. We've not experienced any impact to our lenacapavir PrEP filing or any of our clinical trials, actually, to date. We continue to expect the lenacapavir decision by 19 June.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. James, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. I have a question for Johanna. Johanna, the strength in Descovy for this quarter, is there any read-through or implications? There looks like there were some price benefits of Descovy, but is there any read-through or implications to len's launch?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, there is. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we saw really nice growth year-on-year, about 38% growth for Descovy that was driven by higher average realized price as you mentioned, as well as higher demand. Those are the two big drivers, and there's a couple of reasons behind that. One is definitely the prep market growth that I was referring to earlier around 16% year-on-year, driven really by the market development that we've done that we've been leading.\nSecond was around focused commercial execution. We've actually grown the share of Descovy year-on-year by about just over 3 percentage point, which is really amazing. That's driven by the commercial team which have been doing an amazing job, but also supported by growing unrestricted access that we've seen even just in the last quarter, to be honest, as well as associated lower co-pays, which also helps our pricing. All those pieces together get you to that 38% year-on-year, and I do believe actually because of that PrEP market growth, because of this setup from an access standpoint, really supports the opportunity with lenacapavir in, hopefully, June.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Salveen Richter at Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon.Thanks for taking my question. You touched on this a little earlier, but while Gilead seems fairly unexposed to tariff risk here, can you just share any details on how much of the US market is supplied by ex-US manufacturing, either API or finished product, and to what degree you can shift this to the US, and is it fair to say limited risk to the business from a tax transfer pricing perspective? If I could also just get a clarification with regard to earnings earlier on the redesign with regard to whether your assumptions are unchanged here, and whether you could just comment on how this is taking shape relative to your 2025 guide given the dynamics to date?Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nGreat. Thanks, Salveen. Let me just start at the high level and then I'll hand it over to Andy or Johanna to comment a little more deeply, just to emphasize what you said around the tariffs. I think at the highest level, of course, we separate them into two different categories. One is indirect tariffs, which are related to all businesses. For us there are things like steel, lab-supplied chemicals, reagents. Obviously there we have some known understanding of what those tariffs will be. What we see so far today, we've absorbed into our guidance without changing our guidance for the rest of the year. Andy can comment a little further on that.\nThe other category of tariffs are obviously the pharmaceutical specific tariffs, which are not enacted today. They've only been discussed and chatted about. We obviously haven't speculated on those nor included those. To your point, I think that there is a difference relative to Gilead's makeup and setup that is important when you consider those tariffs, and that is that the vast majority of Gilead's IP is in the US. What that suggests is lower value for its pharmaceutical imports at the end of the day, which is the value in which tariffs would be placed. In fact, more than 80% of Gilead's profits are recognized in the US.\nTo your question around the supply chain, it's quite a complicated answer. The strongest footprint we have is in the United States. Like most companies, we leverage both internal and external manufacturing on a global basis. We're always looking to adapt that to make sure that we have good continuity of supply across the world so that we can do that accordingly.\nI'd also say that we've invested significantly in our manufacturing infrastructure in the United States over the past many years and our R&D infrastructure, including opening cell therapy manufacturing sites. We have four large-scale US investment projects in progress that are expected to run through 2028. It's difficult to get into the detail of every product and every supply chain. I think we're well positioned overall. I would ask Andy to comment and maybe Andy or Johanna on the Medicare Part D.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Hi Salveen, and it's Andy. Just to confirm what Dan said, our updated guidance does reflect the expected impact of the increase in indirect costs that we've seen from both announced tariffs and reciprocal tariffs, as well as our general expectations for the inflationary environment that we may be moving into. As you can expect, there are a number of puts and takes in the P&L. As you look again at another very strong quarter of disciplined expense management, that helps us absorb some of those additional costs.\nThere's also a bit of a tailwind, as you've heard from our peers. As the US dollar is weakened for those of us that are based in the United States, there's a tailwind relative to our budgeted amounts that will help offset some of those as well. We're very confident today that with the strong growth you saw in the base business in Q1, despite the Part D impact, which Johanna can speak to, even with the tariffs, we're happy to reconfirm our guidance for the year, and we feel like we're in a good spot.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nGreat. Maybe just specific to your Part D redesign question, although still quite early in the stages of implementation. Just important to note that Medicare claims will lag by a quarter, so still looking for that data. We'll get that sometime late Q2 for the first quarter of this year. Our assumptions haven't changed. We continue to expect about that $1.1 billion that we shared for total impact, of which about $900 million or so is specific to HIV.\nIn terms of phasing, we do expect some linear progression over the quarter. That's in part driven by the cost of our medicines. Last but not least, we're really quite pleased with our Q1 results. If you think about our HIV business growing six points year-over-year, if you were to take out Part D redesign, you'd be looking at a 9% growth year-over-year. We're really pleased with how HIV is playing out and being able to navigate those seasonal dynamics of inventory that we always see in Q1, but also the Part D redesign dynamics.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. Tyler, go ahead.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey guys, thanks very much. For Trodelvy, is the lower demand quarter-over-quarter due to bladder coming out or lower demand in breast? It would be helpful if you could elaborate on that.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Johanna. I'll take that one. Yeah. Quarter-over-quarter has to do with inventory and a little bit of lower demand just because Q4 was really strong performance. If you look at our year-on-year at about -5%, that's really just inventory dynamic and lower average realized price due to channel mix and higher demand. We are trending nicely with Trodelvy and holding a really nice position both in second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and as well as HR-positive HER2-negative.\nWe feel confident with what's to come in 2025, let alone with the great positive news on ASCENT-04 that just reinforces the confidence for physicians in the second-line setting with the data that we had originally showed with ASCENT.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Daina Graybosch at Leerink Partners. Daina, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDaina Graybosch\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nHi. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you can talk about the process to add lenacapavir to the USPSTF mandate for coverage without cost sharing, assuming SCOTUS upholds the constitutionality in June. What's the timing of that being added and how much impact or uplift do you expect in revenue and growth in the US when it's added to the mandate? Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Daina, for your question. Johanna again. I think what's important is that we are assuming that it's going to take a little bit of time for USPSTF to add lenacapavir as the process. From a guideline standpoint, we've already seen those guidelines play out. When you think about IAS guidelines, we already have lenacapavir there prior to even approval, but usually they wait for approval and then we go forward with trying to get medical updates through, including USPSTF. We do believe though, that despite this, we feel we're incredibly well positioned because of the transformative nature of lenacapavir to build access across the different channels.\nWe're prepared to do that. That's again going to take a little bit of time over the next six to 12 months, but we feel that that would be in line with what we've seen in the past with other agents, including Descovy. We're going to be leveraging all the guidelines possible to make sure that there's a real value that's displayed for access to go as quickly as possible. USPSTF would be nice to have, to be honest with you, but in the first six to 12 months, we're assuming that that's not going to be in play. Our plans are really based on our value proposition of lenacapavir.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham at Citigroup. Geoff, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I have one for Dietmar. On the HIV treatment opportunity and looking to your long-acting orals, the question is, what's the gating factor for selecting the best phase III combo? Related to that, while you haven't seen resistance with len, it hasn't really been an issue. Would it still make sense to have, in the treatment setting, a three-drug versus a two-drug combo just to mitigate the lower risk of resistance? Thank you.\n\nDietmar Berger\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Geoff, for the question. That's really early in our development program here. I think the important piece is that we're looking for optionality. We're really looking for the breadth and depth of the portfolio to deliver for people basically with monthly, weekly, and in the PrEP setting, obviously, once every six months and potentially also once every year options.\nIn the immediate future obviously, we're really looking forward, as discussed to the lenacapavir for PrEP launch, but then we also had data at CROI. We were talking about the potential of lenacapavir for once every year PrEP, and that, of course, are some of our focus areas. Obviously, we will look at the overall portfolio and see with the options that we want to develop which ones we can take forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Chris, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Just was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Livdelzi launch so far. Maybe just elaborate a bit more on what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint and how that ramp is progressing relative to your internal expectations. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Chris. Johanna. Yeah, we're really pleased with the progression of Livdelzi. In our full second quarter, $40 million. Most importantly, it actually has to do with the share uptake that we've seen. We are looking at about 1/3 of the market today out of the second line products that are currently indicated and growing incredibly rapidly. We grew about 10 points share in one quarter. We are really building that momentum with a lot of positive feedback that we're getting from our healthcare providers around the efficacy, both the ALP, the biochemical response, and the pruritus.\nCoverage right now is in line with our expectations. We're at about just over 80% or so coverage with commercial plans, and we think that's going to keep growing probably within the next couple of months to just well above 90%. I think right now we're well on our way to continue to drive Livdelzi and really differentiate it in PBC.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Terence, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I noticed and you mentioned that you added MRD negativity as a co-primary endpoint in the anito-cel phase III trial. I'm just wondering if you could on what the regulators would want to see there to approve that on an MRD negativity endpoint in terms of what delta you would need or if you'd also have to have other supportive data to justify an approval. Thank you.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Gilead Sciences\n\nTerence, it's Cindy Perettie. We don't comment on the delta that they're looking for, but what I would share is that this is a dual primary endpoint. Being able to use MRD, we know today that that correlates to PFS and it also allows us to assess within months of the treatment if the patient is having a response. Our goal is to use the MRD negativity endpoint first and then follow that up with progression-free survival. The correlation between the two is what we're talking to regulators about.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tim Anderson at BofA. Tim, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nAnalyst, BofA\n\nThank you. On Descovy, how much will lenacapavir for PrEP cannibalize? Could US Descovy sales go ex-growth as soon as 2026? Can you just give us any ballpark estimate for how many patients could be on lenacapavir for PrEP by the end of the year?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks for the question, Tim. Yeah, we don't give product specific guidance, but here's what I can say. I do think that as you think about lenacapavir and its offering of twice a year, there really is an opportunity when you think about a switch strategy. When you think about 95% of the market today are daily orals, which obviously that includes Descovy and generic Truvada. That will definitely be where I think the first patients come through in addition to naive patients, naive folks as well that have been waiting for lenacapavir. There is definitely a lot of noise in the system from the communities that people are hanging in there until the approval of lenacapavir.\nThose two pieces are what's exciting as we think about the launch. As I think about the growth of this market, we basically said that we're just over about 400,000, 450,000 folks or so on PrEP today in the US. We think that number will definitely continue to grow quite rapidly, especially with the acceleration. I think it will accelerate with the launch of lenacapavir. I think that number could be quite exponential as you think about the next 10 years or so. We're looking forward to seeing a little bit more in growth as we're 16% year-on-year today. I think you're going to see a bit of an acceleration as you think about the lenacapavir launch around the corner.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Seigerman at BMO. Evan, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi, thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to drill down a little bit on some of the dynamics we're seeing in cell therapy. Are you seeing more share or competitive share capture from competitive cell therapy products or bispecifics?The flip side, once folks might use a different cell therapy product, do you tend to see them switch over? What are the dynamics behind that? Thank you so much.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Gilead Sciences\n\nPerettie. Thank you for the question. I think that we have shared probably in the previous quarter and this quarter we're seeing the dynamics from both bispecifics as well as in-class competition. I think it depends as you look at Yescarta and Tecartus on those dynamics. We have a number of new approved indications within-class competition outside of the US. That's some of the dynamics you're observing outside of the US.\nWithin the US, in some of the more smaller markets that Tecartus is competing in, we're seeing new indications as well within class competitors, but we're also seeing new indications in the US and Europe with the bispecific. It's both that we're observing right now Hopefully that answers your question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from [Matt Biegler]. Matt, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. I had another question on Trodelvy and the decreased demand QoQ. Are you seeing any headwind from Datraway's recent approval in HR-positive? I guess that leads to a broader question. Could you just comment on the patient mix you're treating in terms of triple-negative versus HR-positive? Thanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Basically with competitive impact. We haven't seen any impact thus far really as we think about new entrants in the marketplace. We continue to really see a really strong dynamic in triple-negative breast cancer to HR-positive. Remember, the indications are a little bit different. In triple-negative, we're looking at a second-line metastatic indication in HR-positive, HER2-negative. Your later lines of therapy fourth line. You're definitely the Trop-2 ADC of choice in HR-positive HER2-negative versus other ADCs that are used much earlier in line. In first and second line, for example. In triple-negative breast cancer, we are absolutely the ADC of choice in that setting.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Courtney Breen at Bernstein. Courtney, go ahead, your line is open.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHi all, thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the once yearly lenacapavir. We obviously saw the early data presented at CROI. It seems with the timeline associated with that press release that there could be a different trial design than what we've seen in PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2. Can you just talk about whether there is any potential for an expedited PK or PD package relative to an efficacy trial or what might be needed to get once yearly to market for PrEP?\n\nDietmar Berger\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks Courtney for the question. That's very insightful. We are currently looking into the different study designs. We have not commented exactly on what we're planning on doing at this point in time, but you're absolutely right. There are different study designs that you can utilize, and potentially a PK based approach is a possibility that we're discussing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi there. Thanks so much for taking my question. A question for Johanna around the potential on the ground dynamics for lenacapavir and PrEP. Can you give us a sense of the awareness across the target physician practices of the drug, the number of sites, or maybe proportion of your target practices that are going to be ready to order and administer the drug at launch, and where provider stands with regards to capacity and bandwidth to administer?Thanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences",
    "content2": "Okay. I think from an awareness standpoint, the awareness is actually quite high, both at the healthcare provider level but also within the community. I think we're leveraging both of those pieces as we think about how do we prepare for our launch. We're also very targeted. We know that about 75% of HIV prescribers are the one prescribing PrEP today. At launch that's really our target, is really around differentiating lenacapavir versus current options, making sure that we are setting them up for success and creating a very smooth customer experience.\nTo your point about number of sites, we've been very targeted on our approach in the first 30 days. We have a 30-day plan, 90-day plan. We're also very clear as some clinics are set up to do buy-and-bill today, and they currently do it. Those are clinics that might be a little bit more open to do buy-and-bill with lenacapavir. We know those, and we're making sure that they have all the training necessary to be able to do so as of post-launch. You also have a lot of clinics that do not have that set up and will need to go through more of a white bagging process through specialty pharmacy.\nThe optionality here is going to be really important. That's what we want to make sure we offer and that we train folks, not just the healthcare providers, to be honest with you, but actually anybody in the clinic that's managing this. We have a team of folks ready to go, not just our medical and sales teams, but we also have nurse educators making sure people know how to inject, making sure they can help with any questions they might have.\nWe also have field reimbursement managers that are going to be in the field, basically making sure that we can track and follow to make sure they get reimbursed, especially as you think about the first six months or so. As plans are just coming online, it's going to take a little bit of time. Most prescriptions will get a medical exception. We just want to make sure that we're tracking those to make sure we can help clinics and healthcare providers follow through on that so that they can get started on lenacapavir as quickly as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from [Mohit Bansal]. Mohit, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. I would love for you to comment on a couple of macro themes that we hear a lot as they pertain to Gilead. One is of course about the NIH funding cuts and potential for funding cuts regarding something which could help with the HIV awareness and PrEP awareness thing. Number two is potential for Medicaid cuts and how it pertains to Gilead and if Gilead can actually operate in an environment like that. Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Mohit. Let me start. This is Dan, and then Johanna can certainly add as well. I just want to repeat that we haven't seen or heard anything to date that would cause us to alter our plans or expectations in the HIV field, including the len for PrEP launch. I think it's just too early to speculate on anything related to Medicaid at this stage. There's no confirmed cuts at this time. I believe the administration understands the importance, particularly chronic diseases and prevention as they approach that. I'd also say at the CDC side, we're obviously strong supporters of the CDC and also the role that NIH plays in creating a scientific community.\nSpecifically relative to CDC, still too early to understand any impact on particularly CDC programs. They're generally focused on supporting PrEP utilization with community outreach, provider training, education. Those are also things that we do as well. Maybe I'll turn it over to Johanna to say how she sees it in terms of how some of our programs may be able to make sure that services are delivered to the people that need these medicines.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Dan. Yeah, we've been tracking this very closely and obviously making sure that the work that we do continues and in some areas gets accelerated or elevated where necessary, where there might be some gaps where necessary, and where HIV incidence is maybe higher as well where there's a greater need. We're very targeted in our approach.\nObviously there's nothing in play and we wouldn't speculate about anything around Medicaid, but I just want to remind everybody, we're talking about HIV. These are individuals that if they need access to HIV medicines, they will find other channels for coverage because if they don't, unfortunately, HIV will turn into AIDS and they will die. In the past, what we have seen is if one channel is close, they go to another. There are many different channels where they can go to today, including some federal, but some state-funded approaches as well as Gilead programs that they can just make sure that they get over these access barriers. I just want to pause on that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Alex Hammond at Wolfe. Alex, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe\n\nThanks for taking the question. How should we think about the potential impact of the 340B channel mix on HIV pricing for 2025? How do you expect utilization to compare to what was seen in 2024? Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nAgain, at this time, there is nothing new that we are seeing for 340B. We've seen a growth actually of 340B in every quarter from 2024 into 2025. We hope that stabilizes. We believe in the 340B channel absolutely for what it was designed originally to do. We just want a little bit more transparency because that would really help cut out some of the duplicates that we're currently seeing as well across some of our different therapeutic areas.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Simon Baker at Redburn Atlantic. Simon, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Baker\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThank you for taking my question. Going back to the part redesign, we've talked about the impact. I just wonder if you'd give us some thoughts on when you are expecting to see a potential benefit as the lower cost of patients increases starts and increases stay time. I'm guessing it's too early now. As the year goes on, when should we start to see an offsetting positive impact from the changes that have been made? Thanks so much.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. In terms of volume, given the number of safety nets that I was just referring to earlier, there's so many programs that are available today that exist for HIV. We're not expecting to see a material uptick from the Part D reform. We're obviously going to track it super closely. If we were to see, it would be later in the year. Just to remind people, when you look at Biktarvy, for example, the level of abandonment of Biktarvy is incredibly low today. Very different maybe than other therapeutic areas that you might see in chronic diseases just because of the consequences of not being on an HIV treatment.\nThat's why we're monitoring the situation. We haven't included in our numbers like we've shared in the past. If we do see something, we'll share with you as soon as we do. If it was to happen, it would be later in the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThat completes the time that we have for questions today. I'll now invite Dan to share any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nTerrific, everybody. Let me wrap up by thanking the Gilead teams that are responsible for this great start to the year. I'll just say that on behalf of all of us, the strong base business growth of 4% year-over-year and 6% growth in our HIV business, combined with the continued success of the Livdelzi launch, growing demand for Trodelvy, alongside the impressive operating margin, and earnings per share, all demonstrate that we have a strong and efficient business today, which I think is extremely important given the current environment that we're all operating in now.\nMoving forward, we're also excited about what's next. Our diverse pipeline and generating multiple upcoming potential launches, including lenacapavir for PrEP, which is weeks away, Livdelzi in further markets, and now Trodelvy based on the positive phase III results from the ASCENT-04 study all fill us with great promise as we continue on a diversification approach and confidence in our business overall. This is an exciting time for Gilead, the ongoing work that we all do for patients in the communities we serve. I just want to close by thanking you all for joining us today. We look forward to keeping you up to date on our progress as the year continues."

My name is Rebecca, and I'll be your host for today. In a moment, we'll begin with our PrEPared remarks, followed by our Q&A session. At that time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star two. I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance, Gilead\n\nThank you, Rebecca. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for Q2 2024. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investor section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to slide two regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share that this was another strong quarter of commercial execution with growth across HIV, liver disease, and oncology. BIKTARVY for HIV treatment was up 8% year-over-year, TRODELVY was up 23%, and cell therapy was up 11%. In addition, we continued to demonstrate disciplined operating expense management and delivered exceptional bottom-line growth, highlighting the leverage in our business model. Given the results for the first half of the year, we are raising our non-GAAP operating income and EPS guidance for the full year. Moving to clinical updates, this is an important time for our virology and inflammation therapeutic areas. A key highlight of the quarter was the readout of our phase III PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention. The results showed 100% efficacy with zero HIV infections in cisgender women.\nThe presentation of these results at AIDS 2024 in Munich generated considerable excitement, and we're delighted to have reached this milestone with such a positive outcome. Lenacapavir, with its twice-yearly dosing, could set a new bar for HIV prevention and allow PrEP to reach a much broader population of people who could benefit from a prevention regimen. The PURPOSE program, which is expected to include more than 9,000 participants in over 10 countries, is designed to highlight the efficacy of HIV prevention in a wide range of groups, including cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. We expect an update for PURPOSE 2 late this year or early next year, with a commercial launch as early as late 2025. The PURPOSE data were part of several updates at AIDS 2024 that highlight the strength of Gilead's innovation in HIV for both prevention and treatment.\nOur pipeline has the promise to expand our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond. Updates at AIDS 2024 included data from our daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir, which is now in pivotal phase III trials for people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also shared data from our broad long-acting program, including our once-weekly orals, GS-4182, and GS-1720. We plan to start the phase II study evaluating these in combination before the end of the year. This, in addition to the once-weekly oral combination of lenacapavir and islatravir in partnership with Merck, will begin phase III also before the end of the year. On the immediate horizon, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week.\nThe body of clinical evidence behind seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, continues to grow, most recently with the phase III ASSURE data shared at EASL. The Gilead team is excited by the opportunity to launch seladelpar and bring a promising new treatment to the patients who could benefit. Moving to oncology, we are ready to manufacture anito-cel for multiple myeloma at our Maryland Kite facility, and we are PrEParing to support the phase III iMMagine-3 trial from the site starting later this year. The iMMagine-3 trial is expected to reach a broader set of second- to fourth-line multiple myeloma patients with our potentially best-in-class BCMA CAR-T. At ASCO, we shared new data from our phase II EVOKE-02 program evaluating TRODELVY in combination with pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nThe results showed meaningful efficacy compared to the historical standard of care, supporting the phase III EVOKE-03 trial currently underway. We continue to assess the path for TRODELVY in second-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic bladder cancer, following the EVOKE-01 and TROPiCS-04 readouts earlier this year. In the meantime, I'd highlight the strong commercial results this quarter in breast cancer, where TRODELVY remains the first and only approved Trop-2 directed ADC on the market and is the standard of care for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. To date, we have served over 40,000 cancer patients and remain confident that TRODELVY will continue to be an important treatment option. We also shared phase II EDGE-Gastric data at ASCO for domvanilimab plus zimberelimab and chemotherapy in first-line upper GI cancers.\nThese results showed compelling efficacy that supports the phase III STAR-221 program, which has completed enrollment. Moving to our 2024 key milestones on slide six, we look forward to the upcoming updates from the phase III ASCENT-03 trial and phase II iMMagine-1 trial. ASCENT-03 is an event-driven trial evaluating TRODELVY in first line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. A positive progression-free survival outcome would support global filings, potentially moving TRODELVY into earlier lines of triple negative breast cancer. Our iMMagine-1 trial could support regulatory filings for anito-cel in later line relapse or refractory multiple myeloma. Overall, the Q2 was a strong performance for the Gilead team, with the highlights including some remarkable clinical results in HIV, solid revenue growth across therapeutic areas, tangible impact from our discipline cost management initiatives, and planning for the imminent launch of seladelpar.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report the continued momentum we saw in the Q2 and would like to thank the Gilead teams who contributed to another strong quarter of execution. As shown on slide eight, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.7 billion in the Q2, up 6% year-over-year, with growth across HIV, liver disease, and oncology. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Starting with HIV on slide nine, sales of $4.7 billion were up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong demand across treatment and prevention, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 9%, reflecting favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical Q1 dynamics, as well as higher demand.\nLooking to the full year, we remain on track to deliver HIV sales growth of approximately 4%. Turning to slide 10, total Q2 BIKTARVY sales of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher demand. Sequentially, sales were up 10%, largely reflecting favorable pricing and inventory following the typical Q1 dynamics. Highlighting our leadership position, BIKTARVY represents more than a 49% share of the treatment market in the US. This was up almost 3% year-over-year, our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year market share gain. With a meaningful share lead over all other branded regimens for HIV treatment, BIKTARVY firmly remains the HIV treatment of choice, particularly for those starting or switching regimens in the US, as well as across other major markets. Overall, the HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2 to 3% annually.\nTurning to Descovy, we continue to see higher demand with sales of $485 million in Q2. year-over-year, sales were down 6% as demand growth was more than offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix. As a reminder, shifts in channel mix will continue to impact average realized price, in addition to our ongoing efforts to ensure people who want or need PrEP have access to the prevention regimen of their choice. Sequentially, sales were up 14%, reflecting favorable inventory and pricing following typical Q1 seasonality, in addition to the higher demand. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its over 40% PrEP market share in the US, despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. We're particularly excited to note that the HIV PrEP market in the US.\ncontinues to expand, with total volumes up more than 12% in Q2 2024 compared to the same period last year. With that in mind, we're thrilled with the unprecedented results seen in our pivotal phase III PURPOSE 1 trial, achieving 100% efficacy with zero cases of HIV infections in a broad population of cisgender women, including those who are pregnant or lactating. This is just the beginning of our larger landmark PURPOSE program, which includes multiple populations and communities where PrEP is underutilized or more difficult to access today, such as cisgender women, transgender men and women, Black and Latino individuals, and young adults. Overall, we expect lenacapavir will emerge as the regimen of choice for those who want or need prevention as the first and only long-acting option, with twice-yearly subcutaneous dosing. We are preparing for potential launch as early as late 2025.\nMoving to the liver disease portfolio on slide 11, sales were up 17% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, driven by higher demand and higher average realized price due to channel mix in the US. Our liver disease franchise continues to differentiate itself, with leading share in HCV, despite fewer HCV starts year-over-year, together with growing demand in HBV and HDV. As you know, our PDUFA date for seladelpar is next week, and we stand ready to launch commercially in the US. We're able to leverage our existing commercial footprint in liver diseases and continue building upon these relationships to quickly bring seladelpar to many of the 130,000 people impacted by PBC in the US who progress after initial treatment. Outside the US, commercial preparations are well underway, and we look forward to the European regulatory decision in early 2025.\nTurning to slide 12, while the severity of COVID infections and hospitalization rates remain variable, Veklury continues to be recognized as an important part of the standard of care for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. This includes the US, where Veklury has maintained well over 60% share in this setting. For the Q2, Veklury sales were down 16% year-over-year and down 61% sequentially, as expected. Moving to oncology on slide 13, sales were up 15% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $841 million. With over 60,000 patients treated with a Gilead or Kite therapy to date, we're proud of the positive impact our oncology medicines have made across multiple cancer types.\nLooking in more detail at TRODELVY on slide 14, sales for the Q2 were $320 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially, primarily driven by higher demand in the US and Europe across its metastatic breast cancer indication. TRODELVY is the only approved and available Trop-2 directed ADC to demonstrate clinically meaningful survival benefits across two types of metastatic breast cancers. With increasing awareness among physicians, TRODELVY has remained the leading regimen in the US and Europe for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, with growing adoption in the pretreated HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer setting. We are working to expand TRODELVY's reach beyond the 40,000+ patients treated to date across multiple tumor types, as we look to new and existing markets, as well as new indications.\nIn bladder cancer, we are planning to further discuss the results of TROPiCS-04 and next steps with the FDA. At this time, TRODELVY continues to be available under an accelerated approval in the US for second line plus metastatic or advanced bladder cancer. Turning to slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales in Q2 were $521 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% quarter - over - quarter, with solid growth in all regions. In the US, sales were up 11% sequentially, as we've begun to see momentum from our focused efforts at the authorized treatment centers, including further educating providers and patients on the curative potential of our cell therapies. Despite these efforts, in-class and out-of-class competition remain a near-term headwind in the US.\nAs we extend the reach of cell therapy, we're making important inroads with key community practices, including working with national payers to unlock broader commercial reimbursement. As a reminder, expect impact from these initiatives towards the end of 2024. We'll continue to refine this blueprint as we work to onboard new centers and patients over time. Outside the US, demand for Yescarta and Tecartus across Europe and other international geographies remains strong, and we're encouraged by the solid progress in our newly launched markets, such as Japan and Saudi Arabia. Overall, it was a strong Q2 for our commercial portfolio, and the teams are energized by the potential to bring two more transformational therapies to market, first with seladelpar for PBC next week, and then lenacapavir for HIV prevention as early as late next year. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nThank you, Johanna. We were very pleased to wrap up the Q2 with two New England Journal of Medicine publications and a number of important readouts across our portfolio. Most exciting was a readout of our phase III PURPOSE 1 trial evaluating twice-yearly subcutaneous lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infection in cisgender women. As you can see on slide 17, this was the first phase III HIV prevention trial to ever achieve 100% efficacy. We have since shared data at the International AIDS Society meeting in July, where our presentation was a highlight of the plenary session. The data were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Our second registrational trial for lenacapavir, PURPOSE 2, has enrolled approximately 3,300 men, trans women, and non-binary people who have sex with men. This trial completed enrollment globally in December 2023, approximately four months after PURPOSE 1.\nAs a result, we expect to provide an update in late 2024 or early 2025. Assuming positive data from PURPOSE 2, we plan to file based on data from both trials, with the goal of bringing transformative HIV prevention to people at risk of HIV as early as late 2025. Beyond our registrational trials, we are generating phase II data from the PURPOSE 3, 4, and 5 trials in key populations across the US, UK, and France, including people who inject drugs. These trials reflect our commitment to evaluate lenacapavir across diverse populations that could benefit. These studies are also intended to drive greater awareness among physicians and patients, including geographies where prevention options have not been effective historically. In addition to HIV prevention, we are, of course, intensely focused on next-generation HIV treatment options. And slide 18 highlights our comprehensive HIV treatment pipeline.\nOur recent updates at the AIDS Society meeting included longer-term phase II data from our once-daily oral combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir that showed the regimen was highly effective at maintaining viral suppression. These results further support our ongoing phase III studies in people with HIV, including those on complex regimens. We also reported safety and PK data for both GS-4182, an oral prodrug of lenacapavir designed to provide two to three times greater oral bioavailability, and GS-1720, our long-acting oral integrase inhibitor. Initiation of the phase II trial evaluating the combination of these agents as a once-weekly oral regimen is expected later this year. Additionally, we are on track to initiate our phase III ISLEND-1 and ISLEND-2 trials, evaluating once-weekly lenacapavir in combination with Merck's islatravir. This regimen is expected to be the first once-weekly oral treatment option.\nLooking at our longer duration treatments, we expect to provide phase one updates from our every three-month injectable programs and to initiate the phase one studies for our potentially every six-month integrase inhibitors in the second half of the year. Moving to our liver disease portfolio, on slide 19, we presented more than 25 abstracts across both viral and inflammatory liver diseases at the EASL conference in June, highlighting our continued leadership. Importantly, as shown on the right of the slide, new interim results from the open-label phase three ASSURE study of seladelpar for PBC were consistent with the pivotal response study that formed the basis of our global regulatory filings. As you know, we expect an FDA regulatory decision shortly, with a decision from European regulators to follow in early 2025. In viral hepatitis, Gilead shared final week 144 results of the phase III MYR301 trial at EASL.\nThese data continue to support monotherapy bulevirtide 2 mg as a chronic treatment for HDV. Additionally, we presented promising phase II B data evaluating bulevirtide 10 mg with interferon alpha-2a as a finite regimen. The post-treatment response rates were the highest ever posted in HDV and were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are encouraged by the data and continue to be engaged with KOLs and health authorities, including the FDA, as we work to bring bulevirtide to patients as quickly as possible. Switching to oncology on slide 20, we're pleased with the progress across our mid- to late-stage programs. In the frontline setting, we shared mature cohort A data at ASCO from our phase II EVOKE-02 trial with TRODELVY plus Pembro, demonstrating a median progression-free survival of 13.1 months.\nThese data exceeded the historical performance of PD-1 monotherapy in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer and support our ongoing phase III EVOKE-03 trial, where enrollment is going well. In an all-comer non-small cell lung cancer population, our phase III STAR-121 study evaluating domvanilimab plus zimberelimab is ongoing. Our phase III STAR-221 study in upper GI cancers evaluating domvanilimab with zimberelimab and chemo has completed enrollment. The updated phase II EDGE-Gastric data presented at ASCO supported the use of this combination. If successful, domvanilimab plus zimberelimab and chemo would be the first TIGIT-based regimen for upper GI cancer patients. In addition, we have several phase III programs underway in earlier settings of breast cancer, including ASCENT-03 evaluating TRODELVY in PD-L1 negative metastatic triple negative breast cancer.\nTurning to our second line programs, we have discussed the results of EVOKE-01 in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with regulators, and as expected, have confirmed there is no immediate regulatory path based on EVOKE-01 alone. We're currently assessing next steps for TRODELVY in this setting. We will also provide updates on our bladder cancer program, including the full trial results at a future scientific conference after discussions with FDA and KOLs. Moving to slide 21, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, we shared updates for Yescarta and Tecartus at both ASCO and the European Hematology Association meeting. At ASCO, we shared encouraging new efficacy data from a pilot study of Yescarta in 18 patients with relapsed or refractory primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma in collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\nYescarta demonstrated greater than 26 months median overall survival with no reported treatment-limiting toxicities and no apparent additional risk of adverse events in these patients with high unmet need. Based on these results, we are engaging with regulators to expand the use of Yescarta to include these patients. Additionally, we reported that treatment with Tecartus resulted in a 40% four-year overall survival rate and median overall survival of almost 26 months in the pivotal ZUMA-3 trial in relapsed or refractory adult B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At EHA, we shared preliminary analysis from the phase II ZUMA-24 trial, further supporting outpatient use of Yescarta in relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma with the use of prophylactic steroids and other early intervention strategies. Real-world manufacturing experience of Yescarta for second and third line large B cell lymphoma reinforces our strong manufacturing success rate of 96%.\nFurther, on slide 22, I will highlight our promising clinical development program for anito-cel, a potential best-in-class BCMA CAR-T that we are developing in partnership with Arcellx. Notably, we shared our study design for our phase III iMMagine-3 trial that will include a broader set of earlier line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. We expect to have first patient in for this trial in second half this year. We're pleased to note that the tech transfer and transfer of the US IND of anito-cel to Kite are now complete. The Kite manufactured product will be used in the iMMagine-3 trial, and we anticipate the turnaround time for anito-cel to be on par with Kite's commercially available products. Wrapping up with our key 2024 milestones on slide 23, we completed all of our first half milestones and are pleased with our program execution overall.\nWe're off to a good start for the second half, with the readout of PURPOSE 1 occurring ahead of our committed timeline. We look forward to the FDA decision next week for seladelpar in PBC, as well as an update from the pivotal phase II iMMagine-1 trial in later-line relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, in addition to an update on the pivotal phase III ASCENT-03 study in first-line PD-L1-negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Along with these updates, we have a maturing innovation pipeline that includes several phase II programs, such as a once-daily oral alpha 4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor and an oral TPL2 inhibitor for inflammatory bowel disease. Now I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 25, the team delivered an excellent quarter with our base business up 6% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. Product sales growth across HIV, liver disease, and oncology more than offset the expected decline in Veklury, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year. Moving to our non-GAAP results on slide 26, product gross margin was 86%, down 84 basis points from last year. R&D expenses were down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the wind down of certain magrolimab, obeldesivir, and TRODELVY studies following recent data and regulatory updates. Sequentially, R&D was down 5%, primarily due to the timing of clinical and manufacturing activities, partially offset by the initiation of new studies. These savings reflect disciplined management of R&D resources towards the most meaningful opportunities.\nAcquired IPR&D was $38 million, reflecting new and ongoing collaboration payments in the Q2. SG&A was down 27% year-over-year, primarily due to the $525 million legal settlement in 2023 that did not repeat in 2024. Excluding this payment, SG&A was up 2% year-over-year and includes commercial investments ahead of the launch of seladelpar. Operating margin for the Q2 was 47%, our strongest operating margin since the Q3 of 2022, highlighting the leverage we have in our business model. Turning to tax, our effective tax rate was approximately 18%, reflecting settlement with a tax authority in the Q2. On a reported basis, our Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 50% year-over-year from $1.34 to 2.01 per share.\nAs mentioned earlier, we had a $525 million legal settlement representing $0.32 per share in the Q2 of 2023 that did not repeat in the Q2 of 2024. Excluding this settlement, EPS grew 21% year-over-year, reflecting higher product sales and lower expenses, including acquired IPR&D expenses. As highlighted on slide 27, we had a strong first half of the year with solid performance in each of our core franchises across virology and oncology, driving base business growth of 6% year-over-year, which is at the upper end of our full-year guidance of 4 to 6%. Switching to our expectations for 2024 on slide 28, we continue to expect total product sales in the range of 27.1 to $27.5 billion and total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of 25.8 to $26.2 billion.\nGiven the inherent variability experienced historically and as stated previously, we are not updating our Veklury guidance at this time. As we think about the second half of the year, here are some of the factors that we are continuing to monitor. First, we continue to expect the normal quarter-to-quarter variability in our HIV business that we have always experienced relative to average realized price associated with channel mix. Second, we expect quarterly variability in cell therapy due to continued in-class and out-of-class competition. Third, there is some uncertainty associated with TRODELVY bladder revenue following TROPiCS-04. As a reminder, bladder represents less than 10% of total TRODELVY sales today. And finally, there is a possibility of incremental FX headwinds in the second half of the year.\nFor the rest of 2024, we continue to expect to deliver strong volume growth across all therapeutic areas and, assuming approval, seladelpar as an incremental contributor to revenue growth. Continued HIV volume and revenue growth consistent with our full-year expectation to grow HIV product sales by approximately 4%, and continued focus on disciplined operating expense management. Moving to the non-GAAP guidance, there is no change to our non-GAAP gross margin range of 85% to 86%. For R&D, we now expect total R&D expense to increase by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2023, reflecting lower than previously expected R&D expenses in 2024, despite absorbing the late-stage seladelpar program. For SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance pointing to a mid-single-digit decline compared to 2023. Consistent with our expectations last quarter, we have been able to absorb the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction.\nFor acquired IPR&D, we now expect full-year expenses of $4.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion last quarter, to reflect a $320 million transaction with Janssen to buy out the global seladelpar royalty. This expense will be included in our Q3 results. Finally, with the strong operational expense control demonstrated in both the first and Q2s, and despite this new $320 million acquired IPR&D expense, we are increasing our operating income guidance to 7.2 to $7.6 billion and increasing our Non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to 3.60 to $3.90. Slide 29 highlights that the increase to our EPS guidance fully absorbs the $320 million, or approximately $0.20 per share, expense associated with the buyout of the seladelpar royalty from Janssen. This transaction removes Gilead's royalty obligation to pay 8% of seladelpar sales.\nExcluding this transaction, our EPS guidance increase would have been even more significant today, up $0.30 or 8% at the midpoint, again highlighting the financial discipline that is translated into operating leverage. Moving to slide 30, we continue to have sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet to execute on our capital allocation priorities. In the Q2, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, repaid $1.75 billion of senior notes, and paid $1.2 billion as part of the federal transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The remaining transition tax payment of $1.3 billion is scheduled for April 2025. Overall, we believe that Gilead is well positioned for near- and long-term growth, and we continue to be focused on commercial execution, expense management discipline, and delivering on our strategic commitments. Now I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Andy. At this time, we'll open up the call for questions. We ask you to be courteous and limit yourself to one question so that we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star two.\nGo ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi there. This is Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. I wanted to touch on TIGIT. There's been a lot of updates in the TIGIT space. I know after ASCO, we had the Roche update, and most recently, Merck discontinued their KeyVibe study in small cell lung cancer. So Merdad, maybe you could just walk us through how you think about the opportunity for TIGIT and what good would look like for you in terms of both safety and efficacy with the STAR-121 program. Thank you so much.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Evan, for the question. Yeah, I think, as you noted, there have been a lot of updates on TIGIT over the past six months or so, and I think that gets to our approach, which I think is somewhat differentiated from our competition in that, as we've said all along, we have a differentiated molecule first off, and that is that we have an Fc-silent molecule relative to an Fc-active molecule that the competition has. And I would note that that is demonstrating a difference in terms of the adverse event profile, including the data that were highlighted today. Additionally, I think we've tried to stay focused in areas where we believe that there is the best chance of activity. And so, for example, we have not initiated any trials with small cell.\nWe look forward to capitalizing on the data we have seen so far, both in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer. As you know, we provided an update on the EDGE-Gastric study at ASCO, and as I noted in the call, we have completed enrollment of the phase three trial of that. So we continue to be cautiously optimistic about TIGIT and are doing it in a data-driven way based on the data we've generated in our trials so far.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nBiotech and Biopharma Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Two-part for me. Just, Merdad, wondering if you can help frame expectations for the PURPOSE 2 trial, just given this is a slightly different population relative to PURPOSE 1. So just as we think about level setting there ahead of that data. And then the second part is for Johanna. So obviously, you guys noted that you've seen growth in the PrEP market recently, which is encouraging. But what other steps can you as a company take to maybe help alleviate some of the payer roadblocks that are really still in the way of branded PrEP use, given the still high level of generic Truvada use? Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Terence. I'll start, and then I'll hand it off to Johanna, as you said. It's a great question and a good thing for us to make sure that everyone remembers. Our PURPOSE 1 was the trial that was in cisgender women, and as I noted, PURPOSE 2 is our ongoing study in the cisgender gay men, transgender women, men, and gender non-binary people. Now, that study is ongoing. It is the second trial that's necessary for filing. And like PURPOSE 1, PURPOSE 2 is designed to evaluate the superiority of lenacapavir against background HIV rates. That's the primary endpoint, and the secondary endpoint would be similar to PURPOSE 1, will be superior to Truvada as a secondary endpoint.\nSo once we, if hopefully we demonstrate a positive result in PURPOSE 2, we would combine those data with PURPOSE 1 and move as quickly as possible to filing those data to move lenacapavir forward for PrEP.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nGreat. So maybe just to complete the second part of that question around the growth in PrEP and what the opportunity lies ahead, despite some of the payer roadblocks that you were referring to, just a couple of points on that. One is today the market for PrEP is growing at about 12% or so year on year. So nice consistent growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. Descovy's coverage is over 90% of all lives are covered from an access standpoint. So today the daily orals do not have any concerns from an access standpoint. I think maybe what you're referring to is potentially, as we think about medical benefits versus a pharmacy benefit, that might create a little bit more access headwinds from a payer standpoint, and we've seen that already with some of our competitors.\nAs we think about lenacapavir, in light of not only the data just most recently with PURPOSE 1, but also just the profile that it offers with a twice-yearly sub-Q, I think it really allows us to redefine the PrEP market as a whole. And as much as we're seeing today, maybe over 400,000 users in the US, we really see three major growth opportunities. One is around market size growth. The other one's around market share growth, and the third one is on adherence. So if I just break those down a little bit, the market size growth is around reaching more users, so well beyond just white MSMs, thinking about cisgender women, transgender men and women, Latino, Black individuals, as well as young adults, reaching more prescribers in different settings than we are today, and over time reaching more countries, right?\nBecause right now PrEP revenues are really coming primarily out of the United States. From a market share growth standpoint, Descovy is the number one branded daily oral today with over 40% share, and we believe lenacapavir will be number one from a long-acting standpoint. And between the two together, we believe the Gilead presence in HIV prevention will also be leading and greater than where we are today. And last but not least is higher adherence, and that just has to do with the frequency of administration. When you think about a twice-yearly sub-Q, it has much higher adherence than a daily oral and obviously better outcomes. So all those pieces together is what we are focused on as an opportunity for the future of prevention with not only Descovy, but obviously with lenacapavir around the corner potentially.\nFrom an access standpoint, we are thinking ahead as we think about even the work that CMS is doing when they think about making it a Part B drug for a medical benefit in PrEP to ensure greater access. But we're also thinking through how is this going to impact from both a prescriber standpoint and how do we support that reimbursement challenges that I think others have been facing, and how we basically do a very high-touch approach here to make sure everyone who needs or wants PrEP gets access to their drug of choice.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many analysts as possible today. Our next question comes from Leerink Partners. Go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDaina Graybosch\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nHi. Hi. Thanks for the question. I want to ask on anito-cel, a two-part. One is just a process factual. I wonder if you can confirm whether you have completed enrollment in iMMagine-1 and thus what kind of follow-up time we can expect in the data should it be accepted at ASH? And then a deeper question on iMMagine-3. I wonder what your approach is in iMMagine-3 to bridging therapy so as to avoid the higher risk of death that was observed in the competitor trials soon after enrollment. Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead\n\nThanks, Daina. So we've got Cindy Perettie here. We'll turn it over to her to answer that. Thank you for the question.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nThanks, Daina. We continue to be really excited about the potential with anito-cel with its best-in-class profile, and our enrollment target for iMMagine-1 has been met. I think the second question you asked is what type of follow-up would we expect to see at ASH? And I think we're in the process of; we did an initial cut, obviously, for the abstract. We'll do a second cut for the final sharing of the data. So I don't have the exact follow-up time, but we can certainly look to follow up with you once we have that. Your second question was around iMMagine-3 and bridging therapy. Right now, we will be moving, so we were able to complete the tech transfer, as you heard from Dan, into our Maryland production facility.\nWe will be supplying therapy out of our Maryland facility, and we expect to apply a lot of the learnings that we have with our existing products on the market today and be able to get anito-cel back to those patients in iMMagine-3 as it relates to having time upfront to do bridging therapy. However, with the protocol design today, we do have the option to do bridging therapy if necessary for patients.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Umar Raffat of Evercore ISI. Go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nUmar Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm very intrigued about your lenacapavir plus bictegravir trial heading into phase III, and I'm just trying to understand, could this regimen possibly replace BIKTARVY to a meaningful extent, or would you rather have some sort of a low-dose nuke in that combination as well as a second alternative? I'm just thinking back to some of the Dovato experiences as well. Thank you very much.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nSo maybe I'll take that one, Umar. So the Len-Bic combination is a single treatment regimen that really combines a best-in-class integrase inhibitor with a first-in-class capsid. The studies that we are doing, both phase II and III, are really first, we looked at the complex regimen, which that was kind of the first step, and as we go into phase III, we believe we can get a broader label indication to also include all virologically suppressed. So as we think about that opportunity, we think it's an opportunity for an STR that's optimized, simplified for complex regimen, but also provides optionality in the virologically suppressed, the switch segment of the marketplace.\nSo as we think about it as a portfolio perspective, we still believe that today BIKTARVY is the standard of care and will remain as the standard of care from a daily oral standpoint, but we also think that's an opportunity in the switch segment. So naïve is a big piece, probably the biggest piece for BIKTARVY's growth and the switch because we have such a large share, obviously, right? So from a switch segment, that offers us another opportunity for us to play in a bigger market space in HIV.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Carter Gould at Barclays. Go ahead, Carter. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst of Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one on PURPOSE 1. So again, yeah, the efficacy was very impressive. However, we did see that north of 20% of patients did have nodules out to week 52. And I guess for Johanna, as you think about that profile in this setting, recognizing they were only grade one, but sort of the long-term nature of those nodules, how do you see that influencing or impacting the profile, its demand, and the potential for those patients to then go back and get retreated after six months? Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nSure. And Carter, just to explain a little bit, the nodules are because it's a drug depot, right? So the nodule actually gets smaller over time. What we've seen is actually very little discontinuation in PURPOSE 1 due to that. That's number one. Two, is the nodules are sometimes palpable, not all, but sometimes palpable but not visible, generally speaking. And so we believe that actually we will have some flexibility as well as to where those injections play out and when because I think they've been studied in different places, not just in the stomach, inside. And so I think that'll be an opportunity as well for people to be a little bit more flexible as to where they get their injections. So we're not overly concerned there at all, actually.\nAnd really, we're taking it from the data that we're getting from PURPOSE 1, and hopefully we'll have similar data to learn from PURPOSE 2.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mike Yee at Jefferies. Mike, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMike Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you, guys. We have one question on long-acting HIV, specifically the potential for a Q6 month, which I think could be a game changer. I think you have one or two of them on your slide, and they are advancing. Can you tell me your confidence level on what you have there? Because if you follow HIV development, you know that if it's generally safe, well tolerated, and significant viral load reduction, you're in a pretty good spot in phase one, two. Thank you. Let me know.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nHi, Michael. It's Merdad. Thanks. Yeah. I think you raised the right question, which is that whenever we're looking at the new long-acting agents, we have to be cautious about the transition from preclinical to clinical. We're not always able to predict the injection site reactions that you might get from the long-actings in particular. We were just talking about the nodules for lenacapavir, but other more severe injection site reactions, and then the human pharmacokinetics. So I think we need those to play out to allow us to move forward, and that's why you see multiple agents going into phase I. We've generated a number of molecules. We move them forward. We've been pretty aggressive in moving them forward in order to maintain our leadership in long-acting HIV treatment and prophylaxis.\nAnd so once we start to see those data in phase I, I think that will help us decide both choosing between those molecules and where we want to go forward. Remember, we're also moving our bNAb program forward, which is our most advanced long-acting program with lenacapavir plus bNAbs, and we expect to get phase two data from that study as well. So for those early programs, it's the usual risks, which is why we take multiple shots, and hopefully we'll be able to advance one of them quickly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Abrahams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nHead of Biotechnology Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi there. Thanks so much for taking my question. You guys have an oral GLP-1, GS-4571 in your preclinical pipeline. Are you planning to move it forward? And as you continue to diversify the portfolio, how are you guys thinking about the obesity landscape and potentially participating, or are there other metabolic areas and adjacencies that you may be more interested in pursuing? Thanks.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Brian. Yes, we have shared some preclinical data on 4571, as you note. It is an internally developed oral GLP-1 agonist, which came out of our initial interest in our NASH program. And based on the data so far, both preclinical and the tox, we are planning a phase I study for that molecule, and that'll help us evaluate 4571 for weight management, obesity, and other metabolic diseases. Once we generate those data, we will decide in a data-driven way how best to proceed from there, and we'll just have to see how that plays out. We want to make sure if we develop something that's best-in-class and allows for a best-in-class profile. So we'll update more as the data are generated.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Chris, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. My questions were just or a question was just on the US CAR-T franchise. Just wanted to get your latest view on how we should be thinking about sequential growth from here. And maybe as part of that, can we just get an update on kind of your community physician engagement with the CAR-Ts and any leading indicators that you're seeing there that could maybe guide some of the efforts when we could start seeing the impact from some of these efforts in the US? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead\n\nThanks, Chris. We are really pleased with our strong cell therapy growth this quarter, and this is really part and parcel to our US refresh strategy. So as a reminder, we restructured our sales team at the end of last year. We got our new sales team in place and trained and ready to go. As part of that strategy, we also focused for the next couple of quarters on really within the authorized treatment centers, making sure those referrals occur between the lymphoma specialist to the CAR-T specialist. That's what you're seeing as part of the excellent performance that we had this quarter. We'll continue to deliver and really focus on the referrals within the ATC.\nWe're also in parallel building up those community practices and spending time educating both the community practices, I'd say, regional hospitals, and those institutions about the curative potential of CAR-T and why it's important to bring this into the therapies that they're offering to their patients. And we're making really good progress there, including a lot of work with national payers. But despite all of this, as you heard earlier from both Dan and Johanna, we are facing; it's a dynamic market. We're remaining cautious for the second half of this year as we continue to see some competitive headwinds, both in-class competition, so we have new indications that came out in the late May, early June timeframe, which are capturing physician mind share initially. And we're also seeing out-of-class competition with the bispecifics.\nBut with all of that said, we are focused on execution and working with our physicians and institutions to raise awareness of the curative potential for CAR-T, and we'll continue to do so the second half of this year. As it relates to community practices, I shared last quarter that it's taking us a little bit longer than we had expected to get them up and fully operating, but we're making great progress as it relates to that and learning a lot along the way. So we're continuing to refine our blueprint as we onboard new centers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steven Seedhouse at Raymond James. Steve, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Seedhouse\n\nBiotech Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nYes, thank you very much. Just given some of the newer tailwinds outside of oncology, so lenacapavir, obviously, which you indicated could redefine the PrEP market and then seladelpar, of course, as well. When you just combine that with the updated view of oncology pipeline, are you still expecting the 2030 revenue mix to be about 1/3 of oncology, or is that more of a moving target? Just hope you could comment on the long-term outlook. Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nYeah, thanks, Steven, for the question. So 1/3 of sales remains our target with the portfolio that we have today, and which we believe is achievable without additional BD. I'll just remind you, keep in mind that the indications in that target are probability adjusted, and many of them are around 50%. So you'd expect to see puts and takes in that pipeline evolution. We certainly expected that when we set that target. So it allows for some programs to fail or fall short of initial expectations, and others obviously succeed to support achieving that goal. I would just note that oncology sales today are already more than 1/3 of the way there. In Q2 2024, they're about 12% of the total product sales, growing nicely. So it's highlighting the progress we're making on this overall goal.\nI think you're right to point out also the progress, and as you put it, the tailwinds with our virology business and lenacapavir data as well as seladelpar. Obviously, as that grows, that puts even more stretch to our ambition. It's a good problem to have. But I think the ambition we have is very much along the lines of diversifying our business as well as solidifying our base in virology, and we're firmly committed to that strategy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. Tim, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director, Senior Equity Research Analyst, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Thank you. I have a question on the Trop-2 space. Sometime before or around year-end, we'll get your phase III first-line triple-negative readout with TRODELVY from the ASCENT-03 trial. And we'll also be getting Astra's TROPiCS-02. And the design of those trials is quite similar, which will allow probably for the best side-by-side comparison thus far of your drug versus Astra's. And I'm sure you've thought about this a lot. What's your prediction for how those results will likely stack up against each other? I'm guessing you'll show less ILD as one benefit, but how do you think efficacy and other safety metrics will compare?\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nSure. This is Merdad. Maybe I think you hit the highlights. TRODELVY has demonstrated great efficacy in the triple-negative breast cancer space, and we remain, I think, the only approved Trop-2 ADC, and that space in triple-negative is definitely where TRODELVY is doing very well and has become standard of care for most physicians. So I think that sets us up nicely. ASCENT-03, as we update the status of that trial as the end of the year rolls around, I think will be part of the continuation of that story and our expectation for TRODELVY's success in triple-negative breast cancer. We have felt that there are areas where our programs are differentiated, and for TRODELVY, as you mentioned, our adverse event profile has remained largely predictable and very manageable on the part of physicians.\nWe certainly both the ILD you mentioned, as well as stomatitis, have been very different in their manifestations, and mostly for TRODELVY, it's been neutropenia and diarrhea, which I think clinicians have gotten very comfortable with managing, certainly when we speak to our KOLs. So we'll be looking for those data, and we'll look for our data in particular, and I think as a continuation of where we think TRODELVY can go and really solidify our position in triple-negative breast.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nYeah, I would just reemphasize what Merdad said. I think just the fact that we are the ones on the market today and so well established as the number one standard of care in triple-negative breast cancer second-line, I do think that that is a big differentiator as we think about some of these data points.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Salveen Richter at Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nLead Biotechnology Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. With regard to the long-acting program, could you speak more about potential read-through from PURPOSE 1 to PURPOSE 2 and whether there are typically any differences in responses to HIV drugs in these different patient populations? And regarding the strategy to expand the PrEP market, could you speak to specific strategies here and why you haven't been able to reach these patients already? Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Salveen. It's kind of a two-part. So I'll have Dan start and maybe have Johanna add as well.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead\n\nYeah, Salveen, you're absolutely right that the patient populations are different. This is why we did the PURPOSE program to really get a diversity of patients early in our program to ensure that we can bring PrEP to a variety of populations early on in our development. The patient populations are different. We're talking really cisgender women relative to the PURPOSE 2 population, which is a different population. And our expectation is that those populations have different levels of awareness, different levels of compliance in their use of PrEP otherwise, for example, with the oral PrEP agents.\nDespite that, I think the strength of the PURPOSE 1 data and the fact that you have people who are essentially protected for six months with no infections occurring in the cisgender women so far, I think gives us a lot of confidence that with, I would expect some variability in the background infection rate in the population. If we are able to maintain that degree of protection in PURPOSE 2, we remain really confident that the outcome will be very powerful.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nAnd maybe to pick up on the second part of that, Salveen, so just to take a step back, I think it's important to understand how much we have moved the needle actually when you think about the penetration in the prevention market. Just a couple of years ago, you were about 25% penetration when you, if you consider it from a CDC standpoint estimate, we're now over 1/3 of that. So we have really grown this market and expanded it. I think one of the challenges has definitely been this is not a typical market that you, it's not HIV treatment. It is a market where these are individuals that are not sick. They have no asymptomatic, obviously, they have nothing.\nSo therefore, it's very challenging when you think about a daily oral pill, which is today over 95% of the total market, where you think about current generics or Descovy share. Taking a pill every single day is incredibly challenging. So many use PrEP on demand, and I do think there's, and in that, the biggest population that we see are actually white MSM, so very much a high commercial market here. We believe that there's a real opportunity to, with something that has the profile of lenacapavir with a twice yearly sub-Q, that we can truly expand the reach of the people, the individuals that could truly benefit from prevention for the future. So that's kind of the step. I think it's an ongoing growth that we've been seeing.\nI think we have to do a step change here as we think about the future of prevention. I think we have to think completely differently about what lenacapavir could offer all of these people and really make a dent in this HIV epidemic.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Olivia Brayer at Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia, go ahead. Your line is open. Our next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. James, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question. For PrEP, is the move to Part B a net positive to access? And when Len is eventually approved for PrEP, do you expect the market to remain mostly a buy and bill? Thank you.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nSure. I'll take that one. So the move, the NCD for PrEP that CMS is working on, I do think it's positive. I think it's really around providing greater access and potentially providing also the services that go with it. So D to B could actually be a nice move despite the fact that today Medicare is a very small piece of the total prevention market. As we think about lenacapavir, I think it'll be both. I think there's probably opportunities for it to be both a pharmacy benefit as well as a medical benefit and be a buy and bill. And I think we just need to think very differently because buy and bill in the current users of prevention, this is not something that they're familiar with.\nAnd so this is something we're really thinking about today for tomorrow is to setting up that system to make sure they understand how to do this if they want to do it, but that they have an option if they don't want to do it. I think that's what we're kind of planning for as we think about the future of lenacapavir.\n\nOperator\n\nThat completes the time that we have for questions. I'll invite Dan to share any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead\n\nThank you, everybody. In closing, we, the team here, would like to summarize the quarter as follows. We had a very strong quarter of revenue growth and impressive bottom line growth that highlights the leverage in our model. Secondly, we made progress that should enable us to build on that growth in the future, including really remarkable data from the PURPOSE 1 trial and from across the HIV portfolio with the promise to extend our HIV leadership well into the late 2030s and beyond, the imminent launch of seladelpar in the US, and continued progress in oncology. All of this leaves us well positioned for the second half of 2024 when we will continue to focus on quarter after quarter of strong clinical, commercial, and financial execution. My thanks to the Gilead teams and to all of you for joining today.\nI want to hand it over to Jacquie Ross for some final comments.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance, Gilead\n\nThank you, Dan, and thank you all for joining us today. One final housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our Q3 2024 earnings results on Thursday 7 November 2024. Please note that this date is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of the Q3. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the quarter."

My name is Rebecca, and I'll be your host for today. In a moment, we'll begin our PrEPared remarks. After that, we'll have a Q&A session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star two. I'll now hand the call over to Jacquie Ross, VP, Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Rebecca. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the Q1 of 2024. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors' section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier, our Chief Medical Officer, Mehrdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite. Before we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Please refer to slide two regarding the risks and uncertainties relating to forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by thanking the Gilead teams for delivering a strong Q1, which you see in our commercial performance and our clinical execution. Total product sales, excluding VEKLURY, grew 6% year-over-year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher demand across HIV, oncology, and liver disease. VEKLURY's sales continued to track with the rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 and reached a total of $555 million. Once again, sales growth for the quarter reflected the diversity of our portfolio. HIV product sales grew 4% year-over-year. Oncology product sales were up 18%, driven by TRODELVY, which is well established as the number one regimen for second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and by our transformative cell therapies.\nAs we outlined at the recent Kite Analysts' event in Maryland, we have exciting plans to build on our clear market leadership in cell therapy, such as expanding the community networks in the US, more than double our manufacturing capacity, and move into new indications and disease areas with next-generation products. From an EPS perspective, Q1 results reflect the close of the CymaBay acquisition with an acquired IPR&D charge of $3.9 billion, or an expense of $3.14 per share. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.82 for Q1, which is above expectations, driven by higher product sales. The CymaBay acquisition brings us an important registrational medicine, seladelpar, which has the potential to address significant unmet need in liver disease.\nWe have filed for regulatory approval of seladelpar as a treatment for primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, with both FDA and EMA, and we expect an FDA regulatory decision in August. If approved, we will leverage our industry-leading commercial infrastructure and longstanding expertise in liver disease to bring seladelpar, a potentially transformative therapy, to people with PBC who might benefit. Moving to clinical execution, we're very pleased with the momentum in our HIV pipeline, which was reflected in our 80 data abstracts at CROI. Based on the strength of the data, we've initiated phase III trials for bictegravir and lenacapavir, our novel once-daily oral regimen, and plan to advance once-weekly oral programs, including lenacapavir plus islatravir, into phase III.\nLater this year, we will host an HIV Analysts event to share details of how we will further shape the HIV landscape with innovative options for prevention and treatment, including the next wave of long-acting therapies. Before I pass it to Johanna, I will briefly recap our 2024 milestones on slide six. We have already achieved first patient in for the phase III ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials, evaluating once-daily lenacapavir in combination with bictegravir, as well as phase II first patient in for SWIFT, evaluating GS-1427, our oral alpha-4 beta-7 inhibitor. We are also on track for our upcoming milestones, including updates from three phase III clinical trials for TRODELVY and lenacapavir. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, this is a time of focused execution for Gilead.\nWe will stay disciplined and agile in our approach, and we will focus the organization on both near-term execution and longer-term plans. With 54 clinical programs in play, no major patent expiration to the end of the decade, and many opportunities for growth, we have a lot of potential and a lot to deliver. My thanks again to the Gilead teams for their great work this quarter and the ongoing progress across our diverse portfolio of therapies. With that, I'll hand it over to Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. With Q1 marking the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, our teams delivered a strong start to 2024, notably navigating the seasonal Q1 dynamics and establishing a firm base on which we can continue to build this year. Beginning on slide eight, total product sales, excluding VEKLURY, were $6.1 billion for Q1, up 6% year-over-year, reflecting solid growth across our HIV, oncology, and liver disease businesses. Including VEKLURY, total product sales were $6.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Moving to HIV on slide nine, sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by higher demand, as well as favorable pricing dynamics in Europe that are not expected to repeat.\nQuarter-over-quarter sales were down 7%, driven by the typical seasonality we experienced in the Q1 of the year, partially offset by higher demand. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, more variable and less indicative of overall trends than the full year. This is evident in the Q1 of every year, where inventory drawdown typically occurs following a build that generally happens towards the end of the prior year, and patient copays and deductibles reset at the start of every year, and together with shifts in channel mix, lowers average realized price in the Q1. As always, we typically see these quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics normalize as we progress throughout the year. We continue to expect approximately 4% HIV sales growth for 2024. Supporting that outlook, the treatment market grew in line with our expectations, as shown on slide 10.\nBIKTARVY remains the leading regimen for HIV treatment across major markets for new starts, as well as for those switching regimens, with sales up 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, reflecting strong demand. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were down 5% as the higher demand was offset by the typical seasonal factors discussed earlier. It's notable that six years after launch, BIKTARVY continues to gain market share in the US, up 3 percentage points year-over-year to approximately 49% share, and once again outpacing all other branded regimens for HIV treatment. Moreover, we continue to see BIKTARVY's benefit extend into broader populations of people with HIV. Most recently, BIKTARVY was granted FDA approval for use in virologically suppressed individuals with known or suspected M184 resistance, a common form of treatment resistance.\nTurning to prevention, DESCOVY sales were down 5% year-over-year to $426 million, driven by lower average realized price due to channel mix, partially offset by higher demand. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, reflecting the seasonal dynamics discussed earlier, partially offset by higher demand. While market volumes in February were temporarily disrupted by the cyber attack on Change Healthcare, volumes readily recovered in March. Overall, the PrEP market continued to demonstrate robust growth, up over 11% in the Q1, with DESCOVY maintaining over 40% PrEP market share in the US, despite the availability of other regimens, including generics. This is a solid setup as we look to potentially launch lenacapavir as early as late next year as the first and only twice-yearly subcutaneous prevention option.\nGiven Gilead's strong commercial foundation across treatment and prevention, we are well positioned to maintain leadership in HIV as we look to the evolving marketplace of daily orals, long-acting orals, and long-acting injectables. Moving to liver disease on slide 11, sales for Q1 were $737 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics and the timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections for our HCV products, as well as higher demand across HCV, HBV, and HDV. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of HCV purchases. Despite fewer HCV starts globally year-over-year, our viral hepatitis portfolio overall has remained stable and continues to be a meaningful contributor to our commercial performance. This strength is underpinned by our extensive global footprint and expertise in the treatment of liver diseases.\nTo that end, pending approval, Gilead is excited to bring seladelpar to patients for the treatment of certain adults with PBC, impacting approximately 130,000 people in the US and about 125,000 people in Europe. With a sales force that covers almost 80% of the US prescriber base for PBC, we expect to readily make seladelpar available to patients upon approval in the second half of this year. seladelpar has demonstrated the potential to be best in class with a differentiated clinical profile to existing and emerging therapies, particularly on a key symptom of the disease, pruritus. Following its launch in 2024, we expect seladelpar to contribute modestly to sales and more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond. Turning to slide 12, VEKLURY continues to be the standard of care antiviral for hospitalized patients treated with COVID-19, with market share well over 60% in the United States.\nCOVID-related hospitalizations were lower in Q1, with the winter wave peaking earlier than expected in the US and Europe as compared to other regions such as Japan. As a result, VEKLURY sales overall were down 3% year-over-year and down 23% sequentially to $555 million. Shifting to oncology on slide 13, sales were up 18% year-over-year to $789 million and are now firmly above a $3 billion annual runway. Having treated over 50,000 patients to date, we look forward to bringing our portfolio of medicines and future treatments across lines of therapies and tumor types to many more patients around the world. Moving to slide 14, TRODELVY's sales for Q1 exceeded $300 million, up 39% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand.\nSequentially, sales were up 3%, primarily driven by demand outside the US, as well as unfavorable Q4 pricing dynamics in Europe that did not repeat. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics in the US, where we saw a drawdown in the Q1. Overall, TRODELVY's strong market share reflects its awareness among providers and patients. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, TRODELVY remains the leading regimen with approximately 1/3 share in the US. And in the pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer setting, TRODELVY has demonstrated continued adoption, most notably in the IHC0 setting. We are confident TRODELVY continues to differentiate itself with its safety profile and clinically meaningful survival benefits, with over 30,000 patients across tumor types already treated to date.\nWe look forward to potentially extending TRODELVY's reach to many more patients in the years ahead, particularly in bladder cancer, earlier line breast cancer settings, and lung cancer. Turning to slide 15, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales were $480 million in the Q1, up 7% year-over-year. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in line with our guidance of flat to slightly up. We're pleased to see continued demand for YESCARTA and TECARTUS in both existing and new markets across Europe and other geographies, such as in Japan, where we've seen good progress in growing brand share and expanding our network of authorized treatment centers to over 20 to date.\nIn the US, and consistent with our recent updates, we see opportunity for growth through expanding the number of authorized treatment centers and affiliated satellites, while also driving increased referrals from the community setting. For example, we're proud to have established our flagship community collaboration with Tennessee Oncology in Q1. We've identified many critical learnings on how we can partner effectively with community oncology practices for cell therapy, and we will continue to refine this blueprint so that we become more efficient at onboarding new centers over time. We expect to start seeing the impact from this initiative toward the end of 2024. Wrapping up Q1, we had a strong start to the year, primarily driven by higher demand across each of our core businesses year-over-year.\nWe look forward to carrying this momentum through 2024, as we bring seladelpar to market later this year following approval. I'd like to thank the commercial teams and cross-functional partners across Gilead and Kite for their strong execution as we diligently expand our therapies to new populations, positively impacting more people all around the world. With that, I'll hand the call over to Mehrdad.\n\nMehrdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Johanna. We've had a busy Q1 at Gilead, with a cadence of clinical readouts that will continue throughout the rest of the year. Importantly, we anticipated an FDA regulatory decision on seladelpar and three phase III updates across HIV prevention, bladder cancer, and breast cancer. Starting on slide 17, we continue to progress our industry-leading virology pipeline, which is building momentum following a data-rich presence at CROI in March. This included robust virologic suppression data from our one-pill oral combination of bictegravir with lenacapavir from the phase II portion of the ARTISTRY-1 trial. This novel combination has the potential to benefit people with HIV on complex regimens. We have since started two phase III trials of this combination, one in virologically suppressed individuals and another in virologically suppressed treatment-experienced individuals. We expect to complete enrollment in H1 2025.\nWe also have two once-weekly oral programs. First, a combination of lenacapavir with Merck's NRTTI, islatravir, in virologically suppressed people with HIV, expected to advance into phase III later this year. Second, a combination of a capsid inhibitor with GS-1720, our novel oral integrase inhibitor. We're working to advance this combination into a phase II study. The second program has the potential to be the first once-weekly oral regimen containing an INSTI agent. INSTIs are the standard of care treatment for HIV and an important treatment option for clinicians who continue to prefer INSTI-based regimens. Finally, we presented phase Ib data from our twice-yearly parenteral program of lenacapavir plus our two broadly neutralizing antibodies for people with HIV at CROI, and we intend to share data from the phase II study in the second half of this year.\nMoving to PrEP, we plan to share an update from our phase III PURPOSE 1 trial in the second half of this year. Data from PURPOSE 1, together with data from PURPOSE 2, is expected to support the filing of lenacapavir for HIV prevention. This PrEP option would not only offer a convenient dosing schedule as a first twice-yearly subcutaneous regimen, but could also be transformative in terms of adherence to HIV prevention regimens. Turning to slide 18, our TRODELVY program continues to be evaluated across a range of solid tumors with seven phase III trials currently underway across breast, bladder, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancers, with plans to start the phase III trial in endometrial cancer later this year. Abstract titles were just released yesterday for the upcoming ASCO meeting, and we're pleased to have over a dozen oncology presentations this year.\nWe'll be presenting late-breaking phase III data from our second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer trial, EVOKE-01. Updated data from first-line PD-L1 high subjects in cohort A of the phase II EVOKE-02 trial will also be shared. We plan on providing updates from cohort C and D evaluating TRODELVY plus Pembro and chemotherapy in PD-L1 all comers at a medical congress in the second half of this year. In addition, presentations for both the phase II EDGE-Gastric trial and the phase II ARC-9 studies will be highlighted. Depending on the timing of event accruals, we anticipate two more phase III updates this year for TRODELVY. These include overall survival data from our confirmatory phase III bladder cancer study, TROPiCS-04, that could support TRODELVY's submission for full regulatory approval in the US and enable ex-US filings.\nIn mTNBC, where TRODELVY is the only ADC to have demonstrated statistically significant improvement in overall survival in the second-line setting, we expect to share an update on the phase III ASCENT-03 trial in first-line PD-L1 negative patients later this year. Moving on to cell therapy, I'm pleased to share Kite's approach to the development of novel cell therapies that Cindy and the team presented at last month's investor event. As you can see on slide 19, YESCARTA and TECARTUS established Kite as a leader in cell therapy, and we plan to potentially extend this leadership into multiple myeloma while also paving the way for innovative next-generation constructs. On anito-cel in later line multiple myeloma, we expect to provide a phase II IMAGINE-1 trial update in the second half of this year.\nThis update follows the highly encouraging phase I data presented at ASH last year, where anito-cel demonstrated durable responses with median progression-free survival not yet met at 26.5 months median follow-up, and no cases of parkinsonian symptoms observed in the trial. For our next-generation cell therapy assets, we have bicistronic and optimized manufacturing constructs in phase I trials, which are aimed at overcoming resistance mechanisms, providing potentially deeper and more sustained responses, and improving product potency. Beyond that, we have early research in allogeneic and in vivo CAR, with plans to expand into a range of other disease areas such as multiple myeloma with anito-cel, solid tumors, and autoimmune diseases. Moving to inflammation on slide 20, we recently completed our acquisition of CymaBay and added seladelpar, an investigational PPAR delta agonist, to our portfolio.\nIn phase III clinical trials, seladelpar demonstrated significant improvement in both pruritus and markers of cholestasis related to the risk of progression for PBC. As previously announced, FDA and EMA accepted our regulatory filings for seladelpar for the management of PBC in certain adult patients. We anticipate an FDA regulatory decision by 14 August 2024 and a decision from European regulators early next year. We continue to work with global regulatory authorities to expand the reach of seladelpar for PBC patients. Further, as we look at the rest of our innovation pipeline, we have several early phase assets that have progressed into phase II trials, including our potentially first-in-class oral TPL2 inhibitor, a potentially best-in-class oral alpha-4 beta-7 anti-integrin, and an oral IRAK4 inhibitor.\nWrapping up on slide 21, we continue to progress on our clinical milestones for the year, and we have had two first patients in and one data readout completed in the Q1, and we remain on track for our remaining milestones. Now I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Mehrdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on slide 23, it was a strong start to the year with our base business up 6% year-over-year. The solid growth achieved across HIV, oncology, and liver disease offset the decline in VEKLURY, with total product sales up 5% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. As expected, our base business was down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics in HIV. Moving beyond our revenue results, two items significantly impacted our EPS performance in the Q1, as shown on slide 24. First, our GAAP and non-GAAP results included an acquired IPR&D charge of $3.9 billion, or $3.14 per share, associated with the close of the CymaBay acquisition. As an asset acquisition, this transaction was fully expensed in the Q1.\nThis was a non-deductible expense item and, as a result, impacted our effective tax rate. Excluding this expense, our non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.82 for Q1, above expectations, primarily driven by higher sales. The second item shown on the right-hand side is an impairment charge that is included in our GAAP results and excluded from our non-GAAP results. As a reminder, this relates to the carrying value of the IPR&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired from Immunomedics. At the end of 2023, the carrying value was $5.9 billion, all associated with non-small cell lung cancer. As a result of the EVOKE-01 readout in late January, we have reassessed and reduced the remaining value to $3.5 billion.\nThis primarily reflects the smaller addressable market that TRODELVY could serve among second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients, a delay in expected launch timing, and associated competitive activity. We remain confident that TRODELVY will deliver attractive returns over time, with sales now exceeding $1 billion a year, a strong IP portfolio, and a development program with multiple shots on goal in new indications, as well as earlier lines of therapy, including some opportunities not included in our initial deal model. In the meantime, you can see that the impairment impacted Q1 GAAP EPS by $1.46 per share. Moving to the rest of our non-GAAP results on slide 25. For Q1, product gross margin was down modestly to 85.4%, primarily due to product mix. R&D and SG&A were each down 2% year-over-year.\nThis is the second consecutive quarter of operating expense declines on a year-over-year basis, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management. Our effective tax rate in the Q1 was a -30%, reflecting the non-deductibility of the CymaBay acquired IPR&D charge. Overall, our diluted earnings per share was a -$1.32 compared to a +$1.37 for the same period last year, primarily reflecting the $3.14 per share expense related to the CymaBay acquisition. Switching to full-year guidance on slide 26, there is no change to our revenue expectations for 2024 at this time. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 - 27.5 billion, and we continue to expect total product sales, excluding VEKLURY, in the range of $25.8 - 26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% - 6% for our base business year-over-year.\nAdditionally, there's no change to our VEKLURY guidance of approximately $1.3 billion for the full year. As discussed last quarter, we do not expect to update our VEKLURY guidance until our Q3 earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. Shifting to the other parts of the P&L for 2024 on a non-GAAP basis, there is no change to our gross margin guidance, where we continue to expect product gross margin in the range of 85% - 86%. We now expect R&D to grow at the higher end of our previous low to mid-single-digit growth range, reflecting the incremental expenses associated with the CymaBay acquisition. We continue to expect SG&A expenses to decline a mid-single-digit percentage relative to 2023. On a dollar basis, SG&A is expected to be modestly higher than our previous SG&A expectations as we incorporate CymaBay expenses.\nHowever, we can manage this within the window of the previously issued operating expense guidance. Acquired IPR&D is now expected to be approximately $4.4 billion due to the CymaBay transaction, as well as milestones anticipated throughout the rest of the year. Operating income is now expected to be in the range of $7 - 7.5 billion, reflecting the updated acquired IPR&D guidance and the modest increase to operating expenses associated with the CymaBay transaction. Given the non-deductible impact of the CymaBay acquisition, the effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be approximately 30%. This includes a negative impact of approximately 11% from the one-time charge for the acquisition of CymaBay. We therefore now expect diluted EPS in the range of $3.45 to 3.85.\nAs shown on slide 27, this has only been updated to reflect the transactions that were closed in the Q1 of 2024. Excluding these charges, you can see that we are comfortably within the range of the EPS guidance we shared back in early February. On a GAAP basis, we expect full-year 2024 diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.10 and $0.50. Moving to slide 28, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with sufficient flexibility in our balance sheet. Specifically, as demonstrated in the Q1, we announced a 2.7% increase to our quarterly dividend and returned approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders. In addition, we acquired CymaBay for $4.3 billion, adding seladelpar to our portfolio.\nOverall, we'll continue to be disciplined in our use of capital, and while we will continue to be flexible and opportunistic, it is unlikely that Gilead will be engaging in any sizable M&A transactions in the near term. Before I wrap it up, on slide 29, a quick note on our expectations now that the CymaBay transaction has closed. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to launch seladelpar in the US before the end of 2024, as Johanna highlighted earlier, with a modest revenue contribution expected this year. Additionally, we have shared that the transaction is expected to add to operating expenses this year as we make incremental investments to support the launch, as well as other R&D efforts, all of which we are able to manage within the window of the previously issued operating expense guidance.\nAs we look ahead, while the transaction will be dilutive to our EPS this year, we expect the deal to be break-even to earnings in 2025 and significantly accretive in 2026 onwards. And now I'll invite Rebecca to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Andy. At this time, we'll open up the call for questions. We ask that you be courteous and limit yourself to one question so that we can get to as many analysts as possible during today's call. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star two. Thank you.\nOur first question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Chris, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a question on the HIV franchise and the impact from the Medicare redesign as we think about 2025, and this is coming from more and more conversations. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that impact to your franchise? And maybe just more broadly, can we directionally still think about top-line growth and margin expansion for Gilead next year despite this headwind? So any color you can provide there would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, great, Chris. Welcome, everybody. This is Dan. I'm going to have Johanna cover this question. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Chris, for the question. So we do expect an impact of the Part D redesign to be weighted towards our HIV business, and expect our HIV growth in 2025 to be offset by the Part D redesign impact. So as a result, we expect our HIV sales to be roughly flat year on year in 2025. Having said that, overall, we expect our total business to grow despite the impact of the Part D redesign in 2025, with the top-line building momentum beyond 2025, right, 2026 and beyond. So we do expect growth in 2025, but our HIV business, the demand of HIV will offset the impact of Part D.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nChris, it's Andy. I'll take the question on margin expansion. As you know, we don't provide more specific guidance for 2025 beyond what Johanna just mentioned. What we have said historically, and I'd underscore, is that we are very focused on disciplined expense management. That will be true in 2025 as it is today. You've seen that in the last two quarters. I think on a non-GAAP basis for this quarter, if you look at our operating margin, if you strip out the CymaBay transaction, you see an improvement in our operating margin, and we expect that to continue over time. So we do expect broadly for our operating margin to improve over time as you see the continued top-line growth and the disciplined expense management. So thanks for the question. More details, of course, to be provided early next year when we provide our 2025 guidance specifically.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Daina Graybosch at Leerink Partners. Daina, your line is open.\n\nDaina Graybosch\n\nSenior Managing Director of Immuno- Oncology, Leerink Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. It's for Kite. FDA's ODAC recently had two important meetings of relevance for multiple myeloma and CAR-T there. One dealt with the early death risk from CAR-T and ABECMA, and the second was to recommend MRD as an intermediate endpoint for accelerated approval in multiple myeloma. And I wonder how you're thinking about both of these ODACs in relation to an anito-cel in your earlier line trial design. Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Daina. We've got Cindy Perettie here, so we'll go right over to her.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nThanks, Daina. So if I start off with the early line ODAC, I think we believe this is positive for everybody. What it's shown is that people recognize the value of having CAR-T therapies earlier in their disease. They value the disease-free intervals that they get from that. So we were very happy to see that. I think we were equally as excited to see the second ODAC around MRD, minimal residual disease, as an additional endpoint. And I think the piece around this is that we're really encouraged that the ODAC decision is going to open up the door for us to potentially bring an anito-cel to market faster for patients. And we're in the process right now of understanding how the MRD surrogate endpoint can be used with regulatory agencies, and the application of our program, and so more to come on that front.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Umer Raffat at Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just thought I'll spend a quick second on CymaBay given the recent deal. My question is, did Gilead, during the diligence process, deploy independent pathologists to evaluate the cases of \"possible liver pathology\" that happened in the NASH trial previously, as well as the paired liver biopsy data from the PBC trial of the lower dose where CymaBay didn't think it would need safety adjudication? I'd be very curious how you guys did that and if you would ever publish that. Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Umer. Mehrdad here, so we'll let him answer.\n\nMehrdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Umer. Let me start by saying we think seladelpar is one of those medicines that will bring a lot of benefit to patients, and really some near-term expansion of our liver portfolio and what we think will synergize with many of the other work, much of the other work that we're doing in liver disease overall. We obviously did thorough diligence in our approach to seladelpar and CymaBay. We didn't do a third party. I think your question was around whether we did an independent third-party review of the pathology. We did not do that. However, we did a lot of thorough diligence on the data itself and the outcomes, and we are confident around the outcome and what it means for patients over time.\nObviously, we're awaiting right now our upcoming PDUFA date and also the filing in the EMA, which we are optimistic about, and following the questions and all those sorts of items that we're in. So we're looking forward to providing an update on that as those filings proceed.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tyler Van Buren at TD Cowen. Tyler, your line is open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. I was hoping you could help set expectations for the EVOKE-01 and 02 presentations at ASCO. For EVOKE-02, the late breaker tag is interesting. So is that related to the three-month OS benefit in the PD-1 refractory patients, or should we be expecting something more? And for EVOKE-02, what should we hope to see with the cohort A data that should leave us confident in the EVOKE-03 readout next year?\n\nMehrdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nTyler. It's Mehrdad again here. So it's a little challenging because I can't share too many details now because we're under embargo for both of those, and obviously happy to fill in a lot of the blanks once the data are released and we can talk about them at ASCO. I think for EVOKE-01, we think there are a number of pipeline updates in our ASCO presentations that we have upcoming, which we see as a real change for us and a real evolution of our pipeline overall and our ability to build our oncology pipeline and bring new options for patients. As part of the late breaker session for EVOKE-01, as you mentioned, we will include data on overall survival and PFS, ORR, and duration of response, as well as the safety profile, of course.\nI wish I could give you more details, but I can't at this point. As you say, we will also be providing other updates there, including the EVOKE-02 cohort A data, looking at the PD-L1 high non-small cell population. And again, I can't really talk about the details of those data, but we are looking forward to sharing those results with everyone and talking about the implications of that for our broader lung cancer, and especially the front-line lung cancer EVOKE-03 study that we are conducting right now, which is underway with our partners at Merck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham at Bank of America. Geoff, your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. Mehrdad, I had a question for you. On the cell therapy front, you obviously have the NEDO cell update later this year, which is big. But beyond that, I wasn't sure what the priority was among the next-gen CAR assets that you've got kind of cartooned on slide 19. There's a lot of competition in this space, but you guys are among the only players that have real scale, and you could move the next-gen stuff, I think, pretty fast. But if you had to pick sort of a priority list, it would be good to know. Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Jeff. This is Dan. We're going to have Cindy Perettie answer that question, if you don't mind. So Cindy, over to you.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nHi, Jeff. So we have three products right now or three constructs that are in phase Ia and 1b clinical trials. The first one is a bicistronic CD19, CD20 that has 4-1BB and CD28. The second one is that same construct with fast manufacturing, three-day manufacturing. And the other one is a CD19 like YESCARTA with three-day manufacturing. So we're looking at all three of those in parallel with the goal of picking the winner to advance that rapidly into our pivotal trials. So that's what's coming up next. Obviously, we've shared a lot around anito-cel as well. With anito-cel, we have the IMAGINE-1 readouts, and we expect to move quickly into earlier lines as it relates to anito-cel. And you'll hear more about that later this year. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nWe certainly have a number of plays in early research, but we would plan to advance our next-generation lymphoma asset quickly and obviously with the scale that we have at Kite, as well as the integrated fact that we can create the vector as well as the construct in-house.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Yee at Jefferies. Michael, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi, guys. Thanks. Following up on the TRODELVY data coming at ASCO and your enthusiasm for front-line, can you just remind us, A, do you believe that your data in EVOKE second-line that will be at ASCO is at least as competitive or better than AstraZeneca? And that is why you're excited about front-line. And B, if you are, do you have a triple therapy on top of chemo combo, or is your whole first-line strategy just on top of PD-1? Thank you.\n\nMehrdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Michael. This is Mehrdad again. As we've noted, I think, and as you talked about, the EVOKE-01 data in second-line will be something that we discuss at ASCO, and showing those data in the full data set does motivate us to go forward in lung cancer, including with discussions with regulators. The unmet need in this population is great, and the data give us options, including discussions with health authorities and conducting follow-up trials. We'll be able to share more once the data are provided at ASCO. And so we'll look forward to having those deeper discussions once we can speak directly to the data. Sorry, and the second part of your question was around the frontline. Again, I think once we are able to share the EVOKE-02 data, the update on EVOKE-02 data, we'll be able to talk more.\nBut it does continue to allow us to think about the frontline and our confidence around EVOKE-03. And then the last part of your question on other combinations, we do think about our intra-portfolio combinations. For example, we have a combination of domvanilumab and TRODELVY in a trial where we're looking to see if we can get additional efficacy from those sorts of combinations. So we do continuously look at our portfolio and look for opportunities for moving the needle with combinations from within our portfolio.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Salveen Richter at Goldman Sachs. Salveen, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nBiotechnology Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So you currently have about $5 billion in cash and noted leverage is back to pre-Immunomedics deal levels. How are you thinking about meaningful or bolt-on BD post the CymaBay acquisition, and is there any preference now between virology, INI, and oncology? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey, Salveen. It's Andy. Maybe I'll start with that one. In our prepared remarks, I highlighted that in the near term, we don't expect sizable M&A. We have a lot of execution ahead of us. We have a deep portfolio, a lot of growth drivers, including seladelpar. We're very clearly highlighting that in the short term, we will continue to do ordinary course business development, the standard licensing deals. You saw a couple of those in Q1, but it's unlikely that we would pursue any meaningful M&A in the near term. We've also said historically that deals like CymaBay are exactly what we're looking for and that we should do deals like that on a regular basis over the cycle. Whether that's every two years on average or more or less, that's a general ballpark.\nSo I think you're appropriately highlighting we generate a lot of operating cash flow. You saw that again in Q1. We will rebuild our cash over time. We're going to continue to invest in the pipeline, but at least in the short run, we don't expect any meaningful M&A in the short run, so.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nAnd Salveen, this is Dan just to answer the end of your question. I mean, we're always therapeutic area agnostic when we approach these. I mean, first of all, we've got very robust portfolios around both virology, oncology, and a building portfolio in inflammation. So we look, frankly, across those spectrums. seladelpar is a great example of finding an opportunity within our liver disease franchise and being able to use that channel. But equally, we'll look for opportunities and synergies that complement our portfolio across therapeutic areas. And that's our approach. We think that makes sense. We look for the most attractive science. And as Andy said, we have a lot in our hands right now to work through and to execute on. And so we'll keep the bar very high.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Shin at Deutsche Bank. James, your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thanks for my question. I wanted to ask on TRODELVY's efforts in HR-positive, HER2-negative. DESTINY-Breast06 is going to have data pretty soon, it seems, and then you also have ASCENT-07. Sort of sounds familiar to DESTINY-Breast04 versus TROPiCS-02. Can you share how you think this landscape will play out with these two trials?\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks for the question, James. Well, I've learned to try to keep away from prognostication, so that's harder to do. Look, maybe the way I would put it is we are proud of the fact that TRODELVY is still the only TROP2 ADC that is approved, and that is in large part driven by the important role that TRODELVY plays in breast cancer right now for patients. We do continue to want to push that along with ASCENT-07. We have a number of other trials ongoing to expand our footprint in breast cancer. I think we are right now in mTNBC the leading regimen. As we are continuing to advance our HR-positive, HER2-negative, and in particular in the IHC0 population, I think we remain confident around our place there.\nWe've shown benefit in randomized clinical trials there, and that's been the basis for our regulatory filings and approvals. So I don't think we can assume success. We'll have to see what the data are, but looking forward into the year that's coming with ASCENT-03 coming up, I think that will provide us additional information to further expand our potential in breast cancer.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nMaybe, yeah, Johanna, do you want to add?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nSo maybe just to add to that, I would also say that the more options these patients have, these women have in HR-positive in earlier lines of therapy, instead of cycling through chemotherapies, the better. So with DESTINY-Breast06 results and moving potentially that compound up earlier, it actually allows for TRODELVY to also play a more important role in a bigger population than it is today because of the profile of the TROPiCS-02 label. And so we do believe that there's opportunities for this TROPiCS-02 to move up and also differentiate itself versus other ADCs in this marketplace, depending on the side effect profile, the safety profile, not only on the efficacy.\nIn light of the IHC0 setting being really our strong foothold in HR-positive, HER2-negative, we believe that'll continue, whether that's in later lines of therapy or earlier lines as these studies play out.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal at Wells Fargo. Go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co- Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe a big picture question if you think about medium to longer term, because, I mean, yes, you do not have an LOE, but I mean, HIV growth is somewhere around low single digits. And oncology, I mean, again, I mean, with TRODELVY and all, the expansion opportunities seem limited at this point. So just trying to understand how do you turn this low single digit to more like a high single digit kind of growth for overall company. CymaBay is definitely an addition, but how are you thinking about it from medium to long term, which probably people like us are missing?\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, Mohit, maybe I'll start and then have others add. First of all, I think just stepping back and thinking about the portfolio that we've built over the past four years now, more than doubling the size of the portfolio, and with significant advances in our HIV portfolio, oncology, and with outside of cell therapy. So as we think about growth moving forward, I mean, first of all, I would say on the HIV side of the business, we have to constantly remind ourselves and others that in addition to the treatment market and the potential for long-acting treatment that we have a very robust program on, and we'll update you a little bit more on towards the second half of this year with an analyst event, we've got the PrEP market that is just beginning to kind of be dimensionalized.\nAnd that is, I think, that provides significant growth opportunity when you think about your time frame, which you mentioned, which is until the end of the decade. So I think it allows us to think about accelerated HIV total growth prevention and treatment as we head towards the second half of the decade. On top of that, then we have the entirety of the oncology portfolio. So both cell therapy within the large B-cell lymphoma area, as well as potentially the multiple myeloma entry with the anito-cel. And then on top of that, a very robust oncology portfolio that has both TRODELVY and other novel agents that will read out over the course of this decade.\nAnd I'll just remind you, again, we've got close to 20 readouts this year, of which three of those are in phase III, including lenacapavir for PrEP in the second half of this year, two TRODELVY phase III readouts. Then importantly, we've added seladelpar to the mix with a PDUFA date in August. Then finally, just the opportunity to update you on the anito-cel at the end of the year as well.\nSo we'll be providing more guidance as we continue to look at the entirety of our portfolio, but we really think we have, within the company today, by the way, I'll just mention, in addition to complementing where needed from the outside, but within the company today, we have what it takes to drive a substantial growth in our business over the course of the next decade, with focus on expense management as well, to produce good returns for investors.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Simon Baker at Redburn Atlantic. Go ahead, Simon. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Baker\n\nPartner and Head of Global Biopharma Research, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThank you for taking my question. One on seladelpar, if I may, and a question really around the competitive dynamics at launch. If all goes according to plan, you're launching August and Ipsen will launch alafibranor in June. So I was really wondering if that really makes any difference. You've obviously got far greater infrastructure than Ipsen. Is it too early for them to steal a march? Or paradoxically, does having somebody else on the market promoting PBC actually raise disease awareness and help the situation? So any color around the dynamics at launch would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead\n\nThanks, Simon. It's Johanna. Let me take that one. And I think you're absolutely right. I think the fact that there is more than one competitor hitting the market is great for patients, namely around increasing disease awareness around PBC and the fact that there are true options available. Having said that, I also feel incredibly confident that seladelpar is well differentiated to potentially be best in disease when you think about the significant impact and clinically meaningful impact we have with the ALT normalization in the clinical phase III clinical trial we've seen, as well as the improvement in pruritus, which is a key symptom of the disease. And today, there really is no effective antipruritic options for PBC patients.\nSo all of that put together, in addition to the fact that we believe our footprint, both commercial and medical, is incredibly well established when it comes to liver disease. It already covers about 80% of all US PBC prescribers. With that strong differentiated profile we were just referring to, I don't think those three months make a difference. I think really it's about best-in-class launch and that potential with seladelpar that we look forward to for our PDUFA date.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Skorney at Baird. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Charlie on for Brian. So again, to ask something about seladelpar, just wondering if you have any ambitions for potentially looking at a label for first line in the future, considering there's a lot of unmet need with pruritus there, as well as any potential synergies you may be considering with the remainder of your liver portfolio. Thank you.\n\nMehrdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences",
    "content2": "Thanks, Charlie. This is Mehrdad. First line is a challenge given what is currently the standard of care. But as you know, we think that seladelpar is going to bring a lot of benefit to a lot of patients, especially given the pruritus. And the potential for getting to patients earlier in their course will be really important for us. And so we have to see how the market starts to respond to the presence of seladelpar in the second line. And I think the other thing to recall or think about is how long people actually get first line therapy before moving on to second line therapy.\nGiven the efficacy profile of the front line therapies and the fact that there haven't been any options, one could anticipate that patients are moved to second line therapy relatively early in their treatment course, and moving up formally for registrational trials of the front line potentially superfluous. So I think we'll see how that plays out in the market once we see our label and all those sorts of things. So we'll be able to update more after that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Abrams at RBC Capital Markets. Brian, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Abrams\n\nSenior Biotech Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. PURPOSE 1 is obviously an important upcoming readout, so I wanted to clarify some elements of its unique design. Specifically, what's the sensitivity of assessing when HIV infection occurred to accurately project the control infection rate? And then how do you control for potential intrinsic differences in risk behavior that the screened-out group serving as the control may have versus individuals who may get into the trial? Thanks.\n\nMehrdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nBrian, thanks. This is Mehrdad again. And I could talk about this for a long time. I'll try to give a very concise answer. The recency assay that's been developed for HIV has been studied very thoroughly, and we can, based on the diagnosis at the time of screening, create a profile for anyone who's potentially HIV infected at that time as to how recently they were infected. And I think that's a key part. And that relates to the second part of your question in that we don't, in a sense, need to compare risk behaviors before and after randomization in that we'll be looking at the overall incidence of HIV at the time of screening and then comparing in this counterfactual design with what happens after people start therapy.\nI think between those two elements and all the discussions we've had with the regulators and the experts in the field, we're confident in that the design will provide the information necessary to get us to approval and for adoption.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terrence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Terence, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerrence Flynn\n\nBiotech and Biopharma Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two-part on the CAR-T franchise. So just was wondering, high level, your commitment to anito-cel if it proves there is parkinsonism, so meaning it's less differentiated. And then the second part is curious where your progress stands with respect to developing the CAR-T for immunology. Obviously, a lot of focus here amongst a number of other companies in the industry. So just curious on Gilead's thoughts on the forward. Thank you.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nThanks, Terence, for the question. So on the commitment to a needle cell, as it relates to Parkinson's, we absolutely feel that we're differentiated potentially on both safety and efficacy. As we noted earlier, we have not observed the neurotoxicity that some of the other constructs have observed, and we'll continue to monitor it, but we feel great about the profile right now. And then the efficacy profile early signals are, we think we will be equivalent or could be best in class. So we're 100% behind a needle cell, and we're looking forward to bringing those data soon. The second question around autoimmune space. So we continue to monitor the autoimmune space. And as you've heard from Andy and others before, we will play in that space. We're taking time to take a look at what's in the space versus what we have in our portfolio.\nI don't have any updates further than that today.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Carter Gould at Barclays. Carter, go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nBiopharma Equity Research Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just to round things out on cell therapy, you flagged the same dynamics that have been kind of persisting in the US as far as some of the constraints at the ATCs. I also saw the Tennessee Oncology reference. But I guess putting that all together, just your level of confidence, you'll sort of hit that return to more meaningful growth in the second half of the year. I didn't hear that mentioned, and clearly that's a point of focus. Any commentary there would be appreciated.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nYeah. No, we feel very confident that we're going to return to growth the second half of the year, as we stated. I think just as a reminder, we had shared in Q4, our guidance was that we would be flat to slightly down in Q1. And part of that is due to the restructure. So we are putting our strategy into play. We feel very confident about the approach we're taking in the US. And we now are looking at having almost a fully staffed sales team back out and working hard. I think a piece that we need to talk about as well is the market dynamic. So the things we're observing, we're observing out-of-class competition with the bispecifics, the ATC constraints that we've spoken about in the past based on multiple myeloma constructs coming in.\nBut what we're seeing is a lot of the hospitals and ATCs are working through those constraints, and we feel really confident about the second half of this year.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Cindy. This is Dan again. So, appreciate all of you joining. Maybe just a bit of a summary statement. I want you all to know we at Gilead are very focused on the near-term execution and the long-term plans. We'll continue to stay disciplined and agile in our approach. I mean, just as highlights, we've got 54 active clinical programs, no major patent expiries to the end of the decade, a variety of opportunities for growth, and a lot more to deliver. And on top of that, we are on track to provide updates from three phase III clinical trials for TRODELVY, lenacapavir. We've got the seladelpar PDUFA date in August and the update on the anito-cel phase II update with IMAGINE-1 at the end of the year.\nSo rest assured that we are firmly focused on the many opportunities we have, and we have a lot more potential to deliver. With that, I'll hand over to Jacquie for closing comments.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategic Finance, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Dan. To close, just one housekeeping item. I can share that we are tentatively planning to release our Q2 2024 earnings results on Thursday, 8 August 2024. Please note that this date is provisional and could be changed to accommodate scheduling conflicts that arise between now and then. As always, we will announce our confirmed date following the close of Q2. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the quarter. With that, we'll close our call for today. Thank you."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Jacquie Ross. Thank you. You may proceed, Jacquie.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with Earnings Results for the Q4 and Full Year of 2023. The press release, slides, and supplementary data are available on the investors' section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A, where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections, and the use of capital, and 2024 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. The team and I are pleased you could join us today as we share the details of our full year and Q4 performance and the latest on our clinical portfolio. Starting with our full year performance, 2023 was a strong year for Gilead, with 7% growth in product sales, excluding Veklury, driven by HIV and oncology. HIV grew by almost $1 billion, with Biktarvy sales growing 14% to almost $12 billion and increasing its market share in the US to 48%.\nOncology grew 37% to almost $3 billion, an increase of almost $800 million in just one year. This growth was split evenly between our Kite cell therapies and Trodelvy. Veklury for COVID-19 contributed $2.2 billion in 2023, ahead of our expectations but down year over year, as expected given the evolution of the pandemic.\nIn the last two years combined, Gilead's base business has grown approximately $3.3 billion, or more than 7% annually, largely offsetting the decline in Veklury revenues over the same period. The consistent growth in our base business gives us a strong foundation as we continue into 2024 and look to deliver on our broad clinical portfolio. This is a catalyst-rich base for Gilead, with more than 20 updates this year and many more to come beyond 2024. Starting with oncology, we expect at least 12 further updates by the end of 2024. These include phase III updates for Trodelvy in bladder, and triple-negative breast cancer, and results from the pivotal phase II iMMagine-1 study for anito-cel and multiple myeloma, for which we saw encouraging phase I data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December.\nAlso in cell therapy, we are very pleased to have shortened our manufacturing time for Yescarta by another two days in the US, reinforcing our industry-leading median turnaround time, which is now at an anticipated 14 days. As you know, we did not reach the primary endpoint for EVOKE-01, our phase III trial for second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nMerdad will go into detail on this later, but while we did not see the outcome we hoped for, the data are encouraging on a number of levels, namely a numerical improvement in overall survival favoring Trodelvy, including in both squamous and non-squamous tumors, a safety profile consistent with our product label that could continue to differentiate Trodelvy versus other TROP2 ADCs, and while not statistically powered, a potential benefit for a pre-specified subpopulation that saw more than three months' median overall improvement.\nThe team is evaluating next steps given the data and the significant unmet need, and we look forward to discussing the data with regulators. Based on the totality of the results in both EVOKE-02 and EVOKE-01, we are confident in Trodelvy's potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, including in earlier lines of therapy. In virology, we are looking forward to a very important year for our HIV portfolio.\nAmong the multiple updates we are expecting are the phase III data for lenacapavir in HIV prevention and at least eight updates from our HIV treatment program. These are milestones that could bring us closer to our goal of helping to end the HIV epidemic, building on Gilead's decades of leadership in HIV. In COVID-19, today we are announcing that our phase III trial, OAKTREE, evaluating, did not meet its primary endpoint.\nWe conducted the study to explore whether obeldesivir could address the public health need that existed with COVID-19 for standard risk patients. Again, Merdad will share details later, but essentially, because of the way things have evolved, the standard risk population is now better able to fight COVID-19 without antiviral therapy. This made it more difficult for obeldesivir to show a benefit compared to placebo. We know that the world needs to be equipped for other viruses, and the broad antiviral activity of obeldesivir shown preclinically means it has potential for other viral infections. The updates we are expecting in 2024 have the potential to unlock multiple opportunities across virology and oncology. With a broad portfolio where the risk is balanced, we look forward to following the science and continuing to make a positive impact for patients and communities.\nGilead has set an ambitious goal of delivering at least 10 transformative therapies by 2030, and we are driving confidently to that goal. Before I hand over to the team for their updates, I'll move to slide six and recap that we executed well in 2023 and achieved all the remaining targeted goals that we expected to in the Q4. We'll share our 2024 milestones later in the presentation, but it's clear that it's going to be a very busy year for Gilead. I'd like to thank the teams for their work in bringing us to this important catalyst-rich phase for the company, and for the strong commercial performance that gives us a firm foundation on which to build. With that, I'll hand it over to Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Beginning on slide eight, total product sales for the full year were at the high end of our guidance range at $26.9 billion, reflecting solid base business growth, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, at 7% year over year to $24.7 billion. This was almost entirely offset by the expected decline in Veklury sales. For the full year, Veklury sales were $2.2 billion, reflecting the uptick in hospitalizations at the end of 2023, though still below levels seen in 2022. Turning to the Q4 on slide nine, total product sales were $7.1 billion, down 4% year over year.\nOur base business sales were roughly flat year over year at $6.3 billion, primarily driven by higher oncology sales, offset by lower HIV sales due to changes in channel mix that resulted in lower average realized price, in addition to the expected decline of our portfolio of non-promoted products. Moving to slide ten, our HIV business delivered very strong results for the full year, up 6% year over year to $18.2 billion, and contributing almost $1 billion in base business growth, primarily driven by demand, as well as higher average realized price due to channel mix and inventory dynamics. More specifically, almost half of the full year HIV growth was driven by higher demand, most notably by Biktarvy, which delivered solid double-digit year-over-year growth of 14%, with annualized revenues now more than $12 billion.\nAlready the clear market leader, Biktarvy continues to demonstrate impressive share gains, growing almost 3% year-over-year in the Q4 of 2023 to approximately 48% share in the US. This growth, once again, outpaced all other branded regimens for HIV treatment and represented the 22nd quarter of consecutive year-over-year share gains. For the Q4, as highlighted on slide 11, HIV sales of $4.7 billion reflected strong demand in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, this was offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix that was notably favorable in the Q4 of 2022 and resulted in a decline of 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, similarly driven by strong demand as well as favorable inventory dynamics, partially offset by lower average realized price due to channel mix.\nAs we've noted previously, the pricing Tailwinds we saw in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 are not expected to repeat and will make year-over-year comparisons more challenging in the immediate term, as we saw in the Q4. As a reminder, quarterly HIV growth is, in general, significantly more variable and less indicative of overall trends in the full year, particularly as certain quarterly pricing and inventory dynamics tend to normalize over the course of the year. Factors include, first, gross net adjustments, which can be difficult to forecast due to the lag between product sales and claim payments that frequently occur in different quarters. Second, the timing of bulk government purchases, which contribute to overall demand but can have significant negative impact on pricing in the quarter in which they occur.\nFor example, certain discounted government segments are unpredictable in terms of bulk order timing, and this impacts overall average realized price. Then finally, the inventory build by subchannel wholesalers and customers that typically occurs towards the end of the year. Historically, this happens in Q4. In 2023, we saw the build start in Q3 and continue, albeit to a lesser extent relative to prior years, into Q4. Overall, despite these quarterly variables, we remain confident that overall demand trends are strong and unchanged. With our HIV treatment market share above 70% in the US and above 40% in PrEP, Gilead remains well-positioned to continue delivering demand-driven growth. For 2024, we expect HIV sales to grow approximately 4%, reflecting annual treatment demand growth of 2% to 3%, Biktarvy market share gains, and continued double-digit growth in demand for HIV prevention.\nIn terms of quarterly HIV revenue, keep in mind that the Q1 is always impacted by the reset of patient copays and deductibles. Additionally, we've historically seen inventory buildup in the Q4 that has led to notable drawdowns by wholesalers in the Q1. In the Q1 of 2023, this contributed to HIV sales declining 12% sequentially, and we expect a similar decline in the 10% to 12% range for the Q1 of 2024.\nThe continued strong performance to both Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP are shown on slide 12. Overall, Gilead's leadership in HIV is unmatched, with a solid commercial portfolio and robust pipeline of potentially best-in-class regimens to serve the daily oral, long-acting oral, and long-acting injectable markets. I can share we are off to a strong start in terms of HIV demand, which gives us confidence in our full-year expectations for 2024.\nMoving to the liver disease portfolio on slide 13, sales of $2.8 billion for the full year highlight the consistently strong and stable contribution from our liver disease portfolio. In the Q4, sales were $691 million, flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially, primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics, offset by higher HCV market share, our efforts to increase linkage to care, and growing HCV demand in new and existing European geographies. In HCV, we continue to reinforce Gilead's leadership with a market share of over 60% in the US and over 50% in Europe. While we continue to expect the rate of HCV new starts to trend downwards over time, given the curative nature of our medicines, demand growth in both HDV and HBV is largely offsetting that headwind. Onto slide 14.\nBiktarvy sales continue to be highly variable, with the Q4 down 28% year-over-year, though up 13% sequentially due to higher COVID-related hospitalizations in the Q4. For the full year, Biktarvy sales of $2.2 billion exceeded the expectations we set out at the beginning of 2023. Turning to slide 15, our oncology business has achieved an annualized run rate that now exceeds $3 billion, with strong Q4 sales of $765 million, up 24% year-over-year.\nIn just three years, Trodelvy revenue has grown to more than $1 billion, and we continue to see strong growth across our approved indication. In cell therapy, sales approached $2 billion in 2023, and Kite remains firmly established as the leading provider of CAR T-cell therapies globally. Looking more closely at Trodelvy on slide 16, sales for the full year were $1.1 billion, up 56% year-over-year.\nFor the Q4, sales were $299 million, up 53% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. With over 30,000 patients treated to date, Trodelvy's solid demand trends continue to reinforce its robust clinical profile as the only TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate approved and available in multiple tumor types. Awareness and utilization continue to increase, driving notable share gains. In second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, approximately 1/3 of patients are receiving Trodelvy, reinforcing its position as the leading regimen across the US and other major markets. In pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, we're encouraged to see share growth overall, driven by increasing adoption in the IHC-0 setting as well as continued use in HER2-low. Additionally, we look forward to potentially making Trodelvy more broadly available in metastatic bladder cancer.\nData from the confirmatory phase III TROPiCS-04 study in the first half of the year could enable global filings and subsequent launches, as well as potentially drive adoption in the US, altogether expanding Trodelvy's potential reach to nearly 25,000 second-line plus patients with metastatic bladder cancer.\nTurning to slide 17, and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, cell therapy sales were $1.9 billion in 2023, grew 28% from 2022, driven by impressive growth, particularly outside the US as we expanded our network of authorized treatment centers and secured reimbursement following recent approvals. In Q4, cell therapy product sales were $466 million, up 11% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, with strong growth in both Yescarta and Tecartus in Europe and other international markets, offset in part by near-term headwinds for Yescarta in the US, both in-class and out-of-class competition.\nAs previously discussed, CAR T class share of eligible second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma patients remains at roughly 15% in the US, as growth continues to be slower than anticipated, despite the compelling clinical data that suggests these therapies are potentially transformative for many patients. In Europe and other markets, CAR T class share in this same second-line plus setting continues to be stronger at approximately 30%. Following a restructuring in November, the Kite team has been focused on extending the reach of cell therapies from primarily academic medical centers to community practices, especially in the US.\nIn late 2023, we established partnerships with leading community networks, which include over 1,750 physicians nationally. We are certifying affiliated practices to become authorized treatment centers to provide Kite cell therapies. So far, we've made notable headway across centers in the southeast United States, for example, that operate over 40 locations to serve cancer patients.\nWe expect to see the initial impact of these initiatives in mid-2024. In the meantime, we expect our cell therapy business to be flat to slightly up in Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023. Importantly, alongside our 96% reliability rate, we're also thrilled to share that we have shortened our manufacturing time in the US by two days for Yescarta, bringing our anticipated median turnaround time to 14 days.\nThis further extends our industry leadership in terms of manufacturing, and the Kite team continues to innovate in this critical element of the cell therapy business. We look forward to inviting you to visit one of our manufacturing facilities later this quarter during an analyst and investor event. In conclusion, I'd like to thank our teams for a strong 2023 performance and setting up such great momentum for continued growth in 2024. The team's excited to continue to make our medicines accessible to all those who can benefit from them. And with that, I'll hand over the call to Merdad.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Johanna. We've had a busy start to 2024, and I'll begin by discussing the results of our EVOKE-01 study in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and our phase three OAKTREE study of obeldesivir in standard risk non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While we are disappointed that these studies did not meet their primary endpoints, we're also encouraged by what we are learning from the data to inform our clinical programs and support our commitment to deliver innovative new therapies for patients. Let me cover each of these readouts in turn.\nFirst, on slide 19, our phase III study of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE-01, missed its primary endpoint of overall survival in this hard-to-treat setting. We plan to share the detailed data at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, we'd like to highlight what we believe to be an important set of observations from EVOKE-01 that give us continued confidence in Trodelvy as a pipeline and a product and its potential to benefit some patients with lung cancer.\nWe saw a numerical improvement favoring Trodelvy, including in patients with both squamous and non-squamous histologies. This is encouraging for our ongoing phase III EVOKE-03 first-line trial evaluating Trodelvy in PD-L1 high patients in combination with pembrolizumab. Importantly, Trodelvy continues to demonstrate a potentially differentiated safety, efficacy, and tolerability profile with an adverse event profile that is consistent with our label.\nFurther, Trodelvy achieved more than three months of improvement in median overall survival in a pre-specified subgroup of patients non-responsive to their prior anti-PD-L1 therapy. This subgroup is defined as those who achieved stable disease or progressive disease as their best outcome to last prior I-O therapy and represented more than 60% of the trial population. This analysis was not alpha-controlled for formal statistical testing, and we are continuing to analyze these data. We will discuss these data with regulators and KOLs to determine the best path forward. As a reminder, we required all patients to have received prior I-O therapy regardless of driver mutation status, and responsiveness to prior I-O was a stratification factor. Additional analyses, including TROP2 expression, are ongoing, and we will share these data as quickly as possible.\nBased on these observations and the data from the ongoing EVOKE-2 study, we remain confident in Trodelvy's potential in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For now, given these findings, we currently do not plan changes to our phase III EVOKE-3 study that's enrolling as expected. Moving to slide 20, our novel twice-daily oral antiviral, obeldesivir, did not demonstrate statistically significant symptom relief in standard risk non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our phase III OAKTREE trial. Obeldesivir was well tolerated in this large study population, and we will share the data at a future medical meeting. Overall, the OAKTREE results reflect the decreasing severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms observed in standard risk patients, driven by the evolution of variants, and improved immunity to COVID-19 in our trial population.\nThe time to symptom alleviation in untreated standard risk patients is now less than a week, as compared to almost two weeks at the peak of the pandemic. As a result, it was challenging for obeldesivir to show a benefit in the standard risk population. We continue to assess whether obeldesivir could address other viral infections, given the broad antiviral activity that we have observed in preclinical data.\nMoving to another clinical update in oncology, the phase III ENHANCE-3 trial evaluating magrolimab in front-line unfit AML has been discontinued based on a futility analysis and a higher observed incidence of grade 5 serious adverse events. Following the discontinuation of ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 last year, we do not plan further development of Magrolimab in hematologic cancers. Wrapping up on clinical updates, I want to thank all of those who were involved with EVOKE-01, OAKTREE, and ENHANCE-3.\nEvery trial adds important advancements in our understanding of the treatment of these diseases and will inform our future development plans. We look forward to sharing more on that in due course. Transitioning to our HIV program on slide 21, we expect the phase III readout of PURPOSE 1, evaluating lenacapavir for HIV prevention later this year. Along with PURPOSE 2, expected in late 2024 or early 2025, PURPOSE 1 forms the basis of our potential regulatory filing.\nWe continue to target our first approval for lenacapavir in prevention in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first twice-yearly dosing regimen available for PrEP. Looking at our HIV program more broadly, you can see we will be sharing at least nine updates this year across our next-generation daily, weekly, three-monthly, and twice-yearly programs, all based on lenacapavir, our novel first-in-class long-acting capsid inhibitor.\nWe're excited to have over 75 presentations at CROI this year across Gilead-led and supported studies. Among them, some notable updates from our treatment pipeline include encouraging data from our phase II ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating our lenacapavir and bictegravir once-daily oral. We're exploring this combination as a potential additional option for virologically suppressed people living with HIV. phase I data on GS-1720, our once-weekly oral integrase inhibitor, and phase II data on lenacapavir plus islatravir, our once-weekly oral combination in development with Merck.\nIn the second half of this year, we look forward to providing an update on the phase II trial evaluating lenacapavir plus bNAbs as a twice-yearly regimen. Turning to cell therapy on slide 22, you may have seen that the FDA recently proposed safety label changes for all approved CD19 and BCMA CAR T-cell therapies, including Yescarta and Tecartus.\nThere is no change to our confidence in the benefit-risk profile of Yescarta and Tecartus. Based on analysis of our global safety database, with over 16,800 patients treated with Yescarta, there has been no causal link established between Yescarta and those reported to the FDA public safety dashboard. Additionally, no cases of T-cell malignancies have been reported with Tecartus. In the Q4 of last year, we presented 26 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December, showing that Yescarta and Tecartus continue to generate some of the longest follow-up and most robust data sets for cell therapies with the potential to transform patient lives. Also at ASH, our partner Arcelix presented impressive updated data from the phase I trial evaluating anito-cel in 38 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\nAt a median follow-up of 26.5 months, median progression-free survival was not yet reached, despite 70% of patients having one or more high-risk prognosis factors. Given its potentially differentiated safety profile, with notably no delayed neurotoxicity to date, including parkinsonism, anito-cel has the potential to become the best-in-class BCMA CAR-T. We look forward to sharing an update from the pivotal phase II iMMagine-1 study and initiating an earlier line multiple myeloma trial later this year.\nIn terms of manufacturing, while Kite is already the clear leader, we're pleased to highlight that the FDA approved our updated process that reduces the turnaround time for Yescarta in the US from 16 days down to 14 days. This further extends our leadership in cell therapy, and we continue to identify additional opportunities to reliably bring these much-needed therapies to more patients as quickly as possible.\nBeyond manufacturing, we have eight ongoing cell therapy trials, of which four are evaluating new indications and four are exploring earlier lines of therapy. As we formally wrap up 2023, on slide 23, I would like to acknowledge the work of our clinical teams who executed on our ambitious and broad portfolio that extends far beyond the list shown, including the advancement of eight new assets into the clinic, the delivery of 15 late-breaking oral presentations at major clinical congresses, and the initiation of three new phase III programs.\nFor 2024, our target milestones laid out on slide 24 include an update on ASCENT-03 in first-line PD-L1 negative metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, an update on TROPiCS-04 assessing overall survival in second-line metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer, and an update on our phase III PURPOSE 1 trial assessing lenacapavir in HIV prevention, as previously highlighted.\nWe are also looking forward to the start of phase III trials for Trodelvy in endometrial cancer and the ARTISTRY trials evaluating lenacapavir and bictegravir oral combination for HIV treatment. Our commitment to develop innovative new therapeutic options is unchanged, and we are confident that we will make progress on that commitment in 2024. Now, I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on slide 26, we closed the year with total product sales of $26.9 billion at the top end of our guidance range due to a strong contribution from Veklury. For the full year, total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 7%, driven by growth in both HIV and oncology.\nHIV increased 6% year over year, driven by Biktarvy, which grew 14% from 2022 to $11.8 billion, and oncology grew to $2.9 billion for the full year, an increase of $792 million, or 37% from 2022. Altogether, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $24.7 billion, modestly below the lower end of our full-year guidance range, largely due to quarterly pricing variability in HIV in the Q4. Importantly, HIV volumes were in line with our expectations, and we are confident in our full-year revenue growth expectations for HIV in 2024. Veklury revenue of $2.2 billion exceeded our guidance of approximately $1.9 billion and reflected higher hospitalization rates in the latter part of 2023. Compared to 2022, full-year Veklury revenue declined as expected and represented a headwind of more than $1.7 billion to total product sales.\nThis was largely offset by almost $1.7 billion in growth from our base business, resulting in roughly flat total product sales year over year. On slide 27, our non-GAAP results were largely as expected, including gross margin and operating expenses, notably R&D, which showed discipline moderation as we progressed through 2023. Non-GAAP EPS was $6.72 and within our guidance range, despite the incremental $0.10 of acquired IPR&D associated with the Arcelix and Compugen partnerships that we announced following our guidance revision in November of 2023. A quick note that our GAAP results were impacted by some restructuring expenses, primarily related to our manufacturing strategy and our activities at Kite. As we discussed in the later part of 2023, we have been taking steps to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for a strong 2024.\nAs a result, our GAAP results reflect approximately $500 million of associated expenses in 2023, or $0.40 per share, and contributed to GAAP EPS of $4.40 for the full year. Moving to our Q4 results, starting on slide 28, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $6.3 billion. Including Veklury, total product sales of $7.1 billion were down 4% from the same quarter in 2022. As expected, Veklury sales decreased year over year due to lower rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. On slide 29, you can see that on a non-GAAP basis, product gross margin was 86%, down 66 basis points from the prior year. R&D expenses were $1.5 billion, down 6% year over year. Acquired IPR&D was $347 million, reflecting payments related to our collaborations with Arcelix, Assembly Biosciences, and Compugen, and our XinThera acquisition.\nSG&A was $1.6 billion, down 21% year over year, primarily related to the 2022 charge for the termination of the EVRIS collaboration that did not repeat in 2023. Excluding this 2022 charge, non-GAAP SG&A was down 1%. Operating margin was 39%, up from 37% in the Q4 of 2022, and effective tax rate in the Q4 was 17%, flat compared to the prior year. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.72 in the Q4 compared to $1.67 in the Q4 of 2022. I'll move now to slide 30 and our guidance, which assumes a generally stable macro environment, including FX at current rates. For the full year 2024, we expect total product sales in the range of $27.1 to 27.5 billion.\nWe expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $25.8 to 26.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year over year. Within total product sales, and as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue to grow approximately 4%. We expect Veklury sales of approximately $1.3 billion, although, as always, we caution you that Veklury sales remain highly variable depending on hospitalization rates. We do not expect to update our Veklury guidance until our Q3 earnings call, absent a very clear trend in COVID-19 infections. Moving to the rest of the P&L and on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product gross margin to range between 85% and 86%, modestly lower than the 86.1% reported in 2023 due to the growing contribution from our oncology portfolio.\nWe expect R&D to grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2023, highlighting the substantial moderation in expense growth as we approach a steadier state of active phase III programs. We expect acquired IPR&D to be approximately $350 million. Consistent with our approach in 2023, we will highlight incremental acquired IPR&D expenses as we announce new transactions and update our guidance each quarter. We expect SG&A to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2023. Excluding the $525 million legal settlement in 2023, we expect SG&A to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range compared to SG&A of $5.5 billion in 2023, excluding this settlement. As a result, we expect our operating income for 2024 to be between $11.2 and $11.7 billion. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nAnd finally, we expect our non-GAAP non-diluted EPS to be between $6.85 and 7.25 per share for the full year, and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.15 and 5.55. As a reminder, for the Q1 of 2024, we expect HIV to decline sequentially in the 10 to 12% range from Q4 2023, similar to what we saw in the Q1 of 2023, and cell therapy to be flat to slightly up from Q4 of 2023. Moving to capital allocation on slide 31, our priorities have not changed. In 2023, we returned $4.8 billion to our shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividend payments and $1 billion in share repurchases. Q4 share repurchases were $150 million.\nFor 2024, we announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.77 per share, and we remain committed to growing our dividend over time in line with our earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued investments in our business both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to utilize share repurchases to offset equity dilution, as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis. With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nOf course, Andrew. We will now begin the question and answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that everyone limit one question. Everyone with the opportunity to ask a question, please press star one. To pass. For anyone who would like to repeat that question, press star two. Again, to ask a question, press star one. As a reminder, you're using a speakerphone. Sorry about that, team. As a reminder, if you are using a speakerphone, please remember to pick up your handset before asking a question. We will pause here briefly as questions are registered. Our first question comes from a line of Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nManaging Director of Senior Biotech Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Good afternoon. Regarding the 2024 product sales guidance, I understand you guys are guiding to a near $900 million sales drop-off year over year for Veklury, but the guidance expect Veklury looks to be a 5% year over year growth at the midpoint versus 7% for this year. So what do you view as some of the levers to expect Veklury product sales guidance in 2024 where we could see upside?\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Tyler. Welcome. Let's have Andy start, please. Thanks.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey, Tyler. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. Our product sales guidance for products excluding Veklury implies 4 to 6% growth year over year, again, continuing the trend of strong growth that you've seen over the last two years. I'd also highlight that it implies a substantial moderation of our operating expense growth, which is an important piece of the puzzle that we spent a lot of time talking about.\nTo your question specifically on product growth, the growth drivers for 2024 are the same as the growth drivers last year. You continue to see strong growth in our HIV business. As you see in the quarter, you really need to focus on the full year for the HIV to see the growth trend. We saw another year of very strong growth across our HIV business for the full year in 2023. We expect the same thing in 2024.\nYou heard on the call that we were expecting at least 4% growth for the HIV business next year. And then, of course, the cell therapy business and Trodelvy are expected to continue to grow as well. So those are the key growth drivers. We look forward to updating you throughout the year, but we're excited about the setup as we move into 2024.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Gilead Sciences\n\nVictoria, may we have our next question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you so much. Of course. Thank you so much for your question. Our next question comes from a line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On business development, you have noted the potential for a $5 to 6 billion deal in oncology or I&I. Where are you seeing the greatest opportunity to leverage your current clinical and commercial infrastructure? Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nGreat. Thanks, Salveen. This is Dan. Maybe I'll start and then ask others to add, but I appreciate the question. I think just to reinforce our M&A strategy, I mean, nothing has changed from a business development perspective. And particularly, that's against the context of the background of nearly doubling our clinical trials underway over the past four years, multiple late-stage results.\nAs you know, we're expecting more than 20 results still this year. And against the backdrop of no significant patent expirations in our business until early parts of the next decade. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic about pursuing business development in the three areas that we are focused on, which is obviously virology, oncology, and inflammation. We'll be driven by the science. We continue to articulate that building our late research, early development pipeline is probably one of our biggest focuses.\nAnd we'll continue to look at later-stage deals as they fit into our portfolio and our range. It might also be important to note that we are back to pre-Immunomedics levels now relative to our leverage ratios. So we're comfortable with our ability to put capital to work. But nothing has changed, and we feel we have everything within Gilead right now to achieve our ambitions over the second half of this decade.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Gilead Sciences\n\nVictoria, may we have our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOf course. The next question comes from a line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nLeon Wang\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, this is Leon. Hi, this is Leon Wang on for Carter. Thanks for taking my question. So at this point, what conviction do you have and need to sell will differentiate on neurotox or Parkinsonism versus your competitors?. If the lack of neurotox data recapitulate later this year, would that be the risking in your view, and how important would that be in the market? Thank you.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Leon. So we've got Cindy Perettie here. I'll handle that.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nThanks. Thank you for the question. I think with the anito-cel data, we expect to complete the enrollment of our iMMagine-1 study this year, where we would have then 100 patients' worth of data. And obviously, we're going to continue to look for safety signals, neurotox, as you suggested, but to date, we have not observed any. Your second part of that question was, do we see that as a differentiator? And I would definitely see that as a differentiator in the marketplace if we were to come forward with a differentiated safety profile.\nI think the other component to remind you of is we also believe it's possible to have a differentiated efficacy profile. And today, based on the D-domain and our transduction efficiency, we're able to use half the dose that we're seeing with our competitors, and that could play both with safety and efficacy. Thank you.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Gilead Sciences\n\nGreat. Victoria, are you going to answer the question, please?.\n\nOperator\n\nOf course. Our next question comes from a line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much for taking the question. We're just wondering if you could speak to your confidence level in Trodelvy in the frontline, non-small cell lung trial setting here, given the EVOKE-01 data, and if you're considering any potential changes to that frontline trial as a result. Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHi, Terence. This is Merdad. You know I think when we have looked at the data so far, and we're looking forward to sharing it with everyone as quickly as we can, probably one of the most important things in that dataset that confirmed where we were before is that we have not seen a difference in response rates between squamous cell carcinoma and non-squamous cell carcinoma.\nI think that was a bit of an overhang in the fall. As we had mentioned earlier, we had not seen that to date, and that has been bolstered by the results of EVOKE-01. So we do think that that increases our confidence that we don't need to think about look at that. Now, there are other analyses we need to do to make sure that there are other predictors of response or not, and we'll be doing that, and we'll be sharing that over time.\nBut right now, our overall confidence in Trodelvy, broadly speaking, remains very high. We have three approvals, and we have a broad development program against which we are executing really well. We continue to have additional trials that we'll read out this year in phase III, specifically the TROPiCS-04 study that we'll be looking at the bladder cancer confirmation study with hopefully an OS signal. That study could actually give us beyond confirmatory trial in the US. It allows us to open conversations with regulators outside the US. We have promised an update on ASCENT-03 in breast cancer, which we also think will broaden that. We now have a number of trials going on in a variety of indications, including ones we've mentioned in, for example, endometrial cancer.\nSo overall, what we've seen in EVOKE-01, and we're looking forward to sharing with you, really maintains our level of enthusiasm about Trodelvy's long-term potential from an efficacy and safety standpoint across the board. We have no plans to change EVOKE-03 at this time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from a line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Look, it's very well understood for folks in the biopharma community that no one can truly understand the full safety profile of any new drug based on phase I data. But this point has a lot of implications for your TAF litigation, obviously. So my question is, in a scenario where the Supreme Court takes up your petition, would that potentially be a venue where you could prove the level of evidence that's actually needed to make a decision on exception to duty and the type of decisions to make?\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nAll right. I think Andy's going to take this one.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHi, Omar. Yeah, thanks for the question. Yes, of course. I mean, in front of the Supreme Court, just like the appellate court, we'll be able to present the facts and our arguments, as you'd expect. If you look at some of the briefing documents in the appellate court, I think they spell that out very clearly in terms of what happened over time with the development of TAF and what we knew at different points in time.\nAnd that would be available, as you'd expect, not only to the appellate court but to the Supreme Court. And of course, those same facts would be presented at any trial if we ever get to that point. One other update on the TAF litigation. Again, Omar, nothing's changed from our perspective. We continue to have a lot of confidence. The one update I can provide is that one of the very first trials in the federal court has been dismissed as of yesterday, I believe. So it now looks like, and again, this is consistent, as you know, with the thousands of other cases. I think it's now over 5,300 cases that have been dismissed by the courts, over 4,300 in the California state courts, and over 1,000 in the federal courts before they get to trial.\nSo the first bellwether trial in the federal courts, Omar, would now be in November instead of April. So we'll keep you up to date. And thanks for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.\n\nOlivia Brayer\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. What were some of the dynamics that happened with Yescarta this quarter? And how should we be thinking about growth for 2024 from your cell therapy franchise just in light of the sequentially down quarter in Q4? Thanks.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nThanks a lot, Olivia, for the question. This is Cindy. We continue to be the leaders in cell therapy. And I think the piece that Johanna mentioned is that we are looking at how do we expand beyond the existing ATCs.\nSo the dynamics that we observed this quarter were capacity constraints within the existing ATCs that we have. We saw a little bit of in-class and out-of-class competition. In parallel, we have been continuing to work on expanding our ATCs. So today, we have over 400 ATCs globally. We are moving out of urban centers and those academic centers into the community to meet patients where they are. As Andy suggested, bringing up those ATCs in the community is going to be a really important part of our future strategy. But it does take a little bit longer than bringing an academic center up. So we expect to be flat to slightly up in Q1. And you'll start to see that return to growth in the second half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Yeah, I have another one on cell therapy, but more on the profitability. This is a franchise that's almost 2 billion in sales. You guys have improved the turnaround time. You've reached scale. You've treated a ton of patients. What can you tell us about the progress that you've made to making this a profitable franchise? I'm just thinking not for the current products, but also looking out five years plus. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey, Geoff. It's Andy. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. You're absolutely right. The cell therapy business has made tremendous progress over the last five or six years, and evidenced most recently by the faster turnaround time in manufacturing that we talked about on our prepared remarks, going from 16 days to 14 days. And again, it's just the beginning from our perspective of what we can continue to do with this business. So while we don't provide specific guidance, we have said when we announced the Kite transaction that we expected to be profitable, break even or profitable, and accretive by the end of year four. We got there shortly after that. All of the metrics that we look at on the business have improved over time.\nWe've continued to make significant progress on our manufacturing efficiency, manufacturing costs, despite the fact that we've opened three global manufacturing centers. And each time you do that, when you move to commercial manufacturing, it impacts your gross margin. So I'm really proud of what the team has done. And same thing on the operating costs. You see in the Q4, we announced some restructuring charges, Geoff, that hit our GAAP results.\nPart of that was a restructuring at Kite. Cindy and her team looked at the structure and made changes to the structure that we think will continue to drive growth and efficiency in the business over the long run. So maybe the last thing I'd say is that when we look at the business, this is a business that we have line of sight to biologics margins and profitability. We're really growing the business, Geoff, as you know, for long-term sustainability, growth, and less near-term profitability. But it's certainly exciting that the business is doing as well as it is.\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nEVP, Kite\n\nI think the only thing I would add to Andy's comment is beyond the three manufacturing facilities, we also have our own viral vector facility. So given the fact that viral vector has had some supply challenges, that's something that we are not suffering from. So we own the sort of end-to-end cost of goods for our products.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nSVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Gilead Sciences\n\nMay we have our next question, please, Victoria?.\n\nOperator\n\nOf course. Our next question comes from a line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nMike Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for the question. We had an HIV question. There were some comments around the dynamics of the channel mix as it relates to HIV pricing. And I was wondering if you could just remind us about what the driver of the benefit was in 2022 and 2023 and how that changed as we go into 2024 and why that's difficult. Is that a change in mix between commercial and Medicaid swapping? ,Or maybe just explain that. That would help us understand what's going on there for 2024. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences",
    "content2": "Sure. Michael, hi. It's Johanna. Let me take that one. So what you're referring to is actually we saw some pricing favorability in Q4 of 2022 and the first half of 2023. That pricing favorability was mainly driven by actually just the inflation being so high. And therefore, some of our rebates are actually based on that inflation rate. And so therefore, there was actually upside during those quarters.\nWe knew that that was not going to repeat itself. So we had kind of shared with you, I think, from Q3 on that this was going to normalize. And so that was kind of what happened in the first half of 2023. As we think about the second half of 2023, and mainly the Q4, what we did see there is very strong demand. And that continued throughout the whole year.\nBut we had some fluctuations, some quarterly variabilities, mainly due to channel mix and more government channels, resulting in lower average realized price because of higher rebates. And so you really have to look at it on a full-year basis. And so that's why it's so important to know that HIV performance will always have some quarterly variabilities. And we always need to look at the full year to really get the full picture of what's going on. HIV for the full year of 2023 grew 6% with nearly $1 billion in revenue, growth driven by Biktarvy, obviously growing at 14% and at 48% share with 3% share growth in that year, outpacing all competitors. And so we're really proud of the demand-driven results that we've seen in 2023.\nAs we think about 2024 and our predictions for 2024, we believe that our expectations are going to be in line with HIV treatment, which is still about 2 to 3 points. Layer on top of that, the demand growth from Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP. That's why we're expecting about a 4% growth in HIV. That gives you the full picture of what's going on and what happened in the past. We don't expect that on a yearly basis, but on a quarterly basis, we do expect that variability. I would expect that that will continue as we move forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Can you just talk about the TIGIT program and what drove the decision to step up your investments here?. And maybe as part of that, can you elaborate a little bit more on the decision to de-emphasize the PD-L1 high population? I guess in favor of the all-comers study. So any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey, Chris. It's Andy. Maybe I'll start on the TIGIT program and the revised agreement with Arcus that we announced last week. And then Merdad can answer the second part of your question. It's relatively simple. If you step back, you've heard us say this before, but I'd reiterate that we value the partnership that we have with Arcus and the programs that their team has developed. And the recent updates to the partnership really allow both companies to more efficiently deploy our teams and capital. We also focused on streamlining decision-making. And the additional capital allows us to expand the overall clinical study footprint.\nSo there are a number of things that both companies accomplished through the amendment. It does reinforce our support and belief in their programs broadly, not just TIGIT. There's a lot to be excited about there that you'll see play out over the coming years.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nAnd excuse me. This is Merdad. I think you're referring to the ARC-10 study. And as you may recall, we started that study together with Arcus back in 2021 outside the US with a chemo comparator arm. And at the time, there was really limited access to PD-L1 inhibitors outside the US. And so we subsequently updated that study March of last year to include PD-L1 inhibitors as the standard of care was evolving. It took us time to get this all going. And while that was happening, we had a number of competitors launch similar trials in the space with their TIGIT antibodies.\nSo as a result of all that, the enrollment for the ARC-10 trial wasn't as robust as we had hoped for and as it had been. STAR-121, which is the all-comers study, was recruiting very well. So we decided to really prioritize our efforts for that all-comers population where we think we could be first or second in class. It was really a prioritization to ensure that we could stay ahead and keep moving the molecules forward as quickly as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Brian Abrams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Abrams\n\nSenior Biotech Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. I realize this is pending KOL and regulatory discussions, but I was wondering if you could frame the potential next steps for the PD-L1 poor responders. Do you think this is a viable population for Trodelvy in second-line lung, or might you also consider running another study in that population? And along those lines, I'm curious what you're expecting to see from the updated EVOKE-02 data this year and how that might shape your overall plans for Trodelvy in lung. Thanks.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. This is Merdad again, Brian. So maybe I'll take the second part first. On EVOKE-02, as you can imagine, we showed last year ORR data. And those data are going to continue to mature as time goes by. So we should start to see more PFS data this year that will demonstrate, we hope, continued confidence in the frontline setting for Trodelvy based on that study that's running in parallel with EVOKE-03. So we've gotten a lot of confidence from EVOKE-02 to support 03.\nAnd so we are going to keep updating that to make sure we get that. It does actually reflect back on one of the earlier questions around changes to EVOKE-03. EVOKE-02 really keeps us in the right population, gathering data so that we can make sure there are no changes that are necessary. In terms of the PD1 non-responders in EVOKE-01, yeah, I think we need more time to study the data. We need to talk to the KOLs and the regulators to see.\nI wouldn't rule out the possibility that we could discuss with regulators the possibility of using these data. I want to be realistic and say that another trial may be necessary and something that we are thinking about right now. We'll let you know as we update our situation there. And of course, we'll share the data from EVOKE-01 so that we can talk about it in more detail over time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from a line of Colin Bristow with UBS. Afternoon. Thanks for. Your line is on.\n\nColin Bristow\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nEasing me in. Can you hear me?.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, we can hear you.\n\nColin Bristow\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nMaybe on the back of Brian's question, maybe on the back of Brian's question with regards to the observation that the OS benefit was greatest in those non-responsive to prior IO in the EVOKE-01 study. This seems to align with a recent study which showed that TROP2 expression levels are associated with primary resistance to checkpoint inhibition in non-small cell patients. And from that, it obviously raises the question on the potential synergy of TROP2 and anti-PD1s. I wondered if you had any thoughts on this, or do you have any data which kind of gives you comfort?Thanks.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nCMO, Gilead Sciences\n\nWe've spoken about this before. It's definitely something that we are cognizant of and following. One of the data readouts that we are continuing to collect right now from EVOKE-01 is TROP2 expression. And I think that will help us as we look at those data and share them to formulating hypotheses that may warrant changes. So TROP2 expression is definitely something that we are focused on and will continue to follow and evaluate.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to pass the conference back to Daniel for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nWell, thanks, everyone, for joining. We very much appreciate it. Before we conclude the call, let me just wrap up with a couple of comments and summary from what the team has accomplished over the past year and our setup for 2024. First, our full-year performance reinforces the continued growth and strength of the business.\nGilead's HIV portfolio is unmatched with the standard of care daily oral treatment and a rapidly advancing pipeline with potentially best-in-class long-acting regimens. In oncology, we now have a business that is annualizing at over $3 billion with clear opportunity for future growth. It's a base business last year, this year. Our strong business allows us to take bold bets in innovation. You'll see multiple updates on how those are playing out in 2024 and beyond. We're pursuing science with a high potential impact for patients. That comes with risk. But importantly, we've built a resilient business and a robust portfolio that allows for that. In 2024, we expect at least 20 key updates across our HIV and oncology portfolios.\nAnd finally, I just want to thank the Gilead teams for all the hard work in delivering our strong full-year performance and advancing our portfolio. We look forward to keeping all of you updated on our progress throughout 2024. Thanks again for joining today.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day."

The Q3 2023 Gilead Sciences earnings conference call will begin shortly. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad.\nHello everyone and welcome to the Q3 2023 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nadia and I'll be coordinating the call today. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I will now hand over to your host, Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. Jacquie, please go ahead.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for Q3 of 2023. The press release slides and supplementary data are available on the investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition, and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2023 financial guidance. All of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead. Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Jackie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Gilead teams have delivered another strong quarter that rounds out two years of continuous growth for our base business. Our track record of commercial execution continued in Q3 with our base business up 5% compared to Q3 of 2022 and up 10% year-over-year for the first nine months of 2023. In Q3, our growth was driven by our leading therapies across Virology and Oncology. Biktarvy had another very strong quarter, up 12% from the same quarter in 2022 and contributing to 9% growth overall in HIV in the first nine months of 2023.\nOncology is also driving growth and was up 33% in Q3 compared to last year. Revenue is now annualizing at more than $3 billion with growing adoption of Trodelvy, the only approved TROP2-directed ADC and our industry-leading cell therapies. This was also another very good quarter for clinical execution as we continued to advance our 60 clinical programs across virology, Oncology, and Inflammation. Some of the highlights for the quarter included the European Commission approval of Trodelvy for pretreated hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, allowing us to extend Trodelvy's reach to many more patients globally.\nThe first data for Trodelvy in combination with pembro for first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer presented at World Lung. Our phase II EVOKE-02 trial showed a strong objective response rate in the PD-L1 high cohort which supports proof of concept for our ongoing phase III EVOKE-03 trial.\nImportant new data at ESMO for Trodelvy's phase II TROPiCS-03 basket trial in our small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. All of these milestones reinforce our conviction in Trodelvy as our cornerstone oncology asset with pan-tumor potential.\nStaying with Oncology today, we presented positive data from our phase II EDGE-Gastric trial in partnership with Arcus, which further establishes proof of concept for the ongoing phase III STAR-221 trial in first-line metastatic upper GI cancers.\nAdditionally, we're encouraged by the continued strong data emerging from the ongoing phase I study of CART-ddBCMA in multiple myeloma. Together with our partner Arcellix, we look forward to providing even more data during next month's ASH conference.\nThe clinical momentum continues in Virology in HIV treatment. We reviewed promising data from the phase I study of GS-1720, our once-weekly long-acting oral integrase inhibitor to be combined with lenacapavir, and phase II ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating a once-daily oral lenacapavir and bictegravir combination. We expect to share the data with you at a medical conference in early 2024. In HIV prevention. We completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our phase III PURPOSE-1 trial investigating once every 6-month lenacapavir subcutaneous injection and announced plans to initiate the phase II PURPOSE-1 trial in 2024 to support access in Europe.\nIn COVID-19, we completed enrollment in our phase III OAKTREE trial evaluating obeldesivir in standard-risk non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We look forward to providing an update early next year. Veklury remains an important therapeutic option for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We recently received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission to extend use of Veklury in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment.\nLooking at our pipeline overall, our aggregate progress in 2023 is such that we have already completed most of the milestone events as shown on slide six. Our clinical pipeline now includes 27 programs in phase II and 19 in phase III. We are looking forward to a busy period of updates from many of these studies in 2024, including those evaluating lenacapavir, Trodelvy, and obeldesivir. In summary, it's been another strong quarter of commercial and clinical execution, resulting in important progress for Gilead and the people and communities we aim to serve. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna to cover our commercial results. Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share the details of another strong quarter for Gilead and would like to thank the teams that have delivered 10% growth in our base business in the first nine months of 2023. Our Q3 results represent the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our base business illustrated strong commercial execution and revenue growth as our Virology and Oncology products impact more patient lives. In Q3 2023, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 5% to $6.4 billion as shown on slide eight, with notable growth in our oncology and HIV businesses, partially offset by lower HCV sales.\nTotal product sales including Veklury were $7 billion with a solid base business performance contributing $305 million of growth, offset as we expected by lower Veklury sales compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to HIV on slide nine, the treatment market continued to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. And as we've discussed previously, the favorable pricing dynamics in recent quarters have begun to normalize with HIV sales growth more closely mirroring market and demand growth.\nThis was evident in Q3 where HIV sales were up 4% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, driven by higher treatment and prevention demand, and higher channel inventory partially offset by lower average realized price due to a shift in channel mix. Sequentially, sales were up 1%. Looking to the full year, we continue to expect HIV product sales to grow slightly more than the 5% reported in 2022. Turning to slide 10, Q3 Biktarvy sales were $3.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as higher channel inventory. Sequentially, sales were up 4%. Once again, Biktarvy gained market share, up over 2% year-over-year in the US to over 47% share in Q3.\nThanks to its robust clinical profile, Biktarvy remains the number one prescribed regimen for new starts and number one in treatment switches across most major markets including the US. Descovy sales in Q3 were $511 million, up 2% year-over-year with strong year-over-year growth in demand for Descovy for PrEP, offset by less favorable pricing dynamics to ensure broad access ahead of the potential launch of lenacapavir as early as late 2025. The US PrEP market grew about 15% year-over-year, and Descovy for PrEP continues to maintain more than 40% market share due to its strong clinical profile and despite the availability of other regimens including generics.\nMoving to the Liver Disease portfolio on slide 11, sales were down 10% year-over-year to $706 million, primarily due to the resolution of a rebate claim in HCV recognized in Q3 2022 as well as other pricing dynamics. From a demand perspective, HCV new starts increased compared to Q3 2022 in both the US and Europe, driven by our continued efforts to link HCV patients to care. Given the curative nature of our treatment, we expect HCV new starts to trend down over time but are pleased that we are maintaining 50% to 60% market shares in the US and Europe, and that our Liver portfolio more broadly has stabilized. From a revenue perspective.\nOn to slide 12, Veklury sales continue to be highly variable and declined 31% year-over-year in Q3 to $636 million. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, sales were up 149%, driven by an uptick in hospitalizations during Q3. And over the last few weeks, we have seen a slowdown in COVID-19 related hospitalization. Veklury's strong clinical profile continues to be recognized, most recently by the FDA and the European Commission for use in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment. While the COVID-19 environment remains ever changing, Veklury's performance in Q3 further reinforces its established role as a key part of the standard of care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\nMoving to slide 13, our Oncology business achieved another strong quarter with sales up 33% year-over-year to $769 million, representing an annual run rate that now exceeds $3 billion. With clear momentum and a solid infrastructure in place, in addition to our compelling clinical pipeline, we look forward to providing more patients with potentially new and effective options. Looking at Trodelvy on slide 14, sales were up 58% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $283 million.\nAs a reminder, Trodelvy is the only approved TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate and To date we have delivered this therapy To more than 20,000 patients, reinforcing the clinically meaningful benefit Trodelvy can provide across multiple tumor types. Trodelvy remains the leading regimen in second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer across both the US and Europe. In pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, Trodelvy is showing particular strength in the IHC0 setting and as a later-line treatment in the HER2-low setting consistent with expectations altogether.\nThese dynamics reflect the notable work the team has done to raise awareness in both indications as well as the strength of Trodelvy's clinical profile. Turning to slide 15 and on behalf of Cindy and the Kite team, Cell Therapy sales in Q3 were $486 million, up 22% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting strong demand with particular strength outside the US in Q3. Yescarta sales grew 23% year-over-year to $391 million, primarily driven by strong growth ex-US in second and third line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.\nTecartus sales were $96 million up 18% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand in both the US and Europe for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma as well as adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given the strong clinical data, it's surprising that only about 10% of eligible second-line large B-cell lymphoma patients in the US are treated with the cell therapy, and it is clear that there is still a significant opportunity to drive adoption.\nAs cell therapies are offered and delivered to more and more patients. We are confident that Kite remains well positioned to benefit from this expansion with its differentiated overall survival data for Yescarta and industry-leading manufacturing capabilities. We understand the importance of delivering these potentially curative medicines as quickly as possible to patients with severe and challenging diseases. And to that end, we continue to identify opportunities to bring our therapies to patients faster and are actively working on initiatives to shorten even further our industry-leading 16-day median turnaround time in the US.\nWrapping up Q3, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of commercial teams and our cross-functional partners across Gilead and Kite. Thanks to their efforts, our therapies are positively impacting more and more people, driven by growing market share and expanding reach as we bring our therapies to new geographies around the world. With that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Johanna. The clinical highlight of our Q3 was the release of our promising phase II data for Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting Trodelvy's potential to bring a much needed treatment alternative for patients. More broadly, we continue to progress our increasingly diverse pipeline of 60 ongoing clinical programs spanning Virology, Oncology, and Inflammation. Starting with our Virology programs on slide 17, we have 10 clinical programs with our long-acting capsid inhibitor lenacapavir, including two phase III studies underway in PrEP.\nI'm pleased to share that we have completed enrollment earlier than anticipated for our phase III PURPOSE-1 trial evaluating lenacapavir for prevention in adolescent girls and young women. Our phase III PURPOSE-2 trial in cis men, trans women and men, and non-binary people continues to enroll well, and we could have an opportunity to share data from one or both PURPOSE trials in late 2024 ahead of schedule. We are targeting our first approval for lenacapavir prevention in late 2025, potentially making lenacapavir the first six-monthly dosing regimen available for PrEP.\nTurning to treatment, we continue to make strong progress on evaluating nine candidate partners for lenacapavir. Of the remaining candidates, six are already in phase I or II. We expect to share updates on at least four of these in 2024, including data from our phase I trial of GS-1720, our once-weekly long-acting oral integrase inhibitor to be combined with lenacapavir, and from our phase II ARTISTRY-1 trial evaluating a once-daily oral combination of lenacapavir and bictegravir for virologically suppressed treatment-experienced people living with HIV.\nWe plan to share results from both trials at a conference in early 2024, and we look forward to advancing these programs into the next phase of development. We're also pleased to share that enrollment for our phase II program evaluating our lenacapavir plus bNAbs combination dosed every six months is progressing very well and is another program we expect to update you on next year. Putting this all together, our data continues to support our confidence that lenacapavir has the potential to transform HIV treatment and prevention globally.\nTurning to Oncology on slide 18, to date, Trodelvy has been delivered to more than 20,000 patients across three approved indications since our launch three years ago. Trodelvy remains the first and only marketed TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate to achieve meaningful overall survival benefit in two of its indications. With that said, we're seeing both growing real-world evidence and clinical trial data supporting not only the approach we're taking for Trodelvy's clinical development across tumor types, but also Trodelvy's unique ADC construct.\nIn particular, Trodelvy is the only ADC to have a high seven to eight drug-to-antibody ratio that's able to deliver a highly potent SN-38 payload directly into the tumor microenvironment through its hydrolyzable linker. As a result, in our studies to date, Trodelvy has shown a potentially differentiated safety profile with regards to ILD and stomatitis. We look forward to sharing more emerging Trodelvy data in 2024 as we continue to expand Trodelvy across tumor types and lines of therapy. Our comprehensive clinical development program for Trodelvy consists of more than 30 active or planned clinical trials across eight tumor types.\nIn 2023, we've shared several data sets demonstrating clear signals of activity for Trodelvy across several indications. For example, in the ASCO meeting this past June, we presented data for Trodelvy that demonstrated encouraging preliminary ORR and PFS data in relapsed or refractory endometrial cancer patients in the phase II TROPiCS-03 basket trial. More recently, at the ESMO meeting, we presented additional early data from TROPiCS-03 showing promising ORR in both relapsed or refractory head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and previously treated extensive stage small cell lung cancer.\nWe reported strong data from EVOKE-02 at World Lung in September shown on slide 19, establishing clear proof of concept for Trodelvy plus pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. In the PD-L1 high cohort, Trodelvy plus pembro demonstrated an ORR of 69% including unconfirmed responses. This compares favorably to the historical pembro monotherapy benchmark with response rates of 45% and 39% in KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042, respectively.\nAs a reminder, we are currently enrolling patients with first-line PD-L1 high metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in our registrational phase III EVOKE-03 study. Preliminary data from the PD-L1 TPS <50% cohort has also been encouraging, demonstrating an ORR of 44% similar to previous trials that evaluated pembro plus chemotherapy.\nThese results inform our plans to expand into broader first-line non-small cell lung cancer patient populations across all PD-L1 expression levels. We're looking forward to sharing further analysis from EVOKE-02 that will highlight the efficacy of Trodelvy and pembro across both squamous and non-squamous histologies in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients.\nMoving to our TIGIT program on slide 20, an initial update of one arm of the phase II EDGE-Gastric study was presented in an ASCO plenary session earlier today. The study found that the addition of dom and zim to a FOLFOX chemo regimen showed an encouraging 77% six-month PFS and 59% ORR, including unconfirmed responses in first-line metastatic upper GI cancer. In patients with PD-L1 high tumors. The ORR was an impressive 80% and the six-month PFS was 93%. We're pleased to see that dom and zim added to the standard of care was generally well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to anti-PD-1 plus FOLFOX.\nThese results increase our confidence in the ongoing registrational phase III STAR-221 trial in the similar first-line gastric, gastroesophageal junction, and esophageal adenocarcinoma population and our broader anti-TIGIT program. Although anti-TIGIT will not work in every tumor type, we're excited to see that dom has shown encouraging efficacy and tolerability in the tumor types we have advanced into phase III studies including first-line non-small cell lung cancer and upper GI cancer.\nTurning to Cell Therapy on slide 21, we are continuing to work to expand the benefits of cell therapy to even more patients with eight ongoing trials in earlier lines, new indications, or new settings. We also have an extensive early-stage pipeline where we are exploring allogeneic CAR T's, including healthy donor and iPSC-derived cell therapies as well as natural killer and invariant natural killer T-cell therapies. Beyond therapies, we continue to invest in manufacturing innovation to maintain our position as the world's leading cell therapy manufacturer and drive more rapid treatment for patients.\nWe will continue to explore emerging disease areas in cell therapy where we have the potential to apply our expertise to the treatment of difficult diseases. This includes multiple myeloma, where we are pleased that the phase II iMMagine-1 trial CART-ddBCMA has resumed enrollment and we share in Arcellx’s confidence in the therapeutic profile of CART-ddBCMA to be able to deliver benefit to patients.\nTo that end, the data unveiled in last week's abstract release of the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting further reinforced CART-ddBCMA's robust efficacy and safety profile, where, at 22 months follow-up in the ongoing phase I trial, 2/3 of patients continue to respond and median survival has not yet been reached. We look forward to additional data and even longer median follow-up next month. In the meantime, we are further strengthening the body of clinical evidence highlighting the long-term durability and survival benefits of both Yescarta and Tecartus at the ASH meeting in December.\nFinally, and before I hand over to Andy, the team's progress on key 2023 clinical milestones is shown on slide 22. As is expected, with a diverse and large clinical portfolio, not all our programs will benefit patients the way we hope they will, and the ENHANCE and ENHANCE-2 programs evaluating magrolumab have both been discontinued based on futility analyses. The ENHANCE-3 study remains under partial clinical hold, and frontline unfit AML, and we continue to evaluate the progress of this and other phase II solid tumor trials for magrolumab.\nWith regards to some of the remaining milestones for 2023 as referenced previously, we look forward to sharing data from ARTISTRY-1 at a medical conference in 2024. For our HIV prevention studies. We continue to expect to have our first patient in for the PURPOSE-3 and PURPOSE-4 clinical trials by the end of this year.\nAdditionally, we remain on track to initiate our phase II PALEKONA trial, evaluating our potential first in class TPL2 inhibitor for ulcerative colitis later this year. Our TPL2 inhibitor represents one of our many oral agents for inflammation.\nLooking beyond 2023, we will share our target 2024 milestones in due course, but it's already clear that it will be a rich year for data updates for Gilead, including potential updates or regulatory filings for obeldesivir, lenacapavir, Trodelvy, and CART-ddBCMA. With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another solid quarter as shown on slide 24 with total product sales excluding Veklury up 5% year-over-year driven by growth across Oncology and HIV, partially offset by lower HCV sales. Total product sales were $7 billion, flat year-over-year, with lower Veklury sales offsetting more than $300 million of growth in our base business. Our non-GAAP results are shown on slide 25. Product gross margin was 86%, down 85 basis points from last year.\nR&D was $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing clinical trial activities. Q3 R&D expenses also reflected some sizable wind-down costs related to the discontinuation of two phase III magrolumab ENHANCE studies, and faster than anticipated enrollment in our phase III PURPOSE-1 and OAKTREE studies, both of which have recently completed enrollment and could accelerate timelines for data readouts in due course.\nAcquired IPR&D was $91 million, reflecting the Tentarix collaboration announced in August in addition to other payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased commercial investments, namely in Oncology. Moving to tax. Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 7%, primarily reflecting a decrease in tax reserves as a result of reaching an agreement with a tax authority on certain tax positions. Excluding this settlement, our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been approximately 16%.\nOur non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.29 compared to $1.90 for the same period last year. This was primarily driven by growth in our base business, lower tax, and lower acquired IPR&D expenses compared to Q3 of 2022, partially offset by lower Veklury sales and higher R&D and commercial investments. Moving to slide 26, year-to-date, base business revenue has grown 10% year-over-year, highlighting strong performance across Virology and Oncology.\nFrom an OpEx perspective, the investment we have made this year in R&D is notable with a robust and diverse clinical pipeline, and with our commercial sales and marketing organizations scaled to meet growing demand for our on-market oncology portfolio, we continue to expect a moderation of expense growth in 2024 and beyond. Moving to slide 27, we are updating many of our guidance ranges to reflect our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the rest of the year. Total product sales is now expected to be in the range of $26.7 to 26.9 billion, up from $26.3 to 26.7 billion previously. We are increasing total product sales excluding Veklury at the midpoint.\nWe now expect the range to be between $24.8 to 25 billion, up from $24.6 to 25 billion previously. This range represents growth of 7% to 8% for our base business year-over-year and an increase of $650 million at the midpoint from the initial guidance we issued in February. On Veklury, based on our results year to date, we now expect full year Veklury sales of approximately $1.9 billion. As always, this remains highly variable and correlated with COVID-related hospitalizations.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. On R&D, reflecting the accelerated enrollments and magrolumab discontinuation expenses, our full-year non-GAAP R&D expense is now expected to grow approximately 15% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding these items, our full-year R&D expense is consistent with our prior guidance in the low double digits.\nReflecting the Tentarix collaboration closed in Q3 as well as previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts and known milestone payments from existing collaborations, we now expect non-GAAP acquired IPR&D of approximately $1 billion in 2023. Similar to prior quarters, we will update expected acquired IPR&D expenses if they are incurred during Q4. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2022. As a reminder, this includes the one-time legal settlement accrual of $525 million in Q2.\nExcluding this, we continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 to be down a low single-digit percentage compared to 2022. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $10.5 to 10.8 billion as compared to $10.4 to 10.9 billion previously, driven by higher R&D expenses offset by higher product sales. Given certain one-time tax benefits in 2023, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 16% for the full year. Altogether, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.65 and 6.85 per share as compared to $6.45 and 6.80 per share previously.\nAs shown on slide 28, the chart highlights the continued strength of our business with higher total product sales guidance flowing into the bottom line, which, together with a lower expected tax rate, more than offsets the higher R&D expenses in Q3. On a GAAP basis, our diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.55 and 4.75 per share. Moving to slide 29, our capital allocation priorities remain focused and unchanged. In Q3, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend, and repurchase of shares totaling $3.7 billion, year to date. In Q3, we repaid $2.25 billion of Senior Notes and issued $2 billion in Senior Notes maturing in 2033, and 2053.\nOverall, Q3 was another solid quarter of commercial and clinical execution in an extremely strong 2023 for Gilead. So far, our planning for 2024 is well underway, and we've taken steps in Q3 to continue to evolve our business model and expense structure to set us up for strong execution next year. 2023 has been a year of considerable investment, notably in R&D, and we are excited to finally be at the point where many of our key programs will start reading out data. With that in mind, we are preparing for a catalyst-rich 2024, and we look forward to sharing more early next year. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to retract your question, please press star followed by two. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure your phone is unmuted locally. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question.\nOur first question today goes to Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Jeff, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, great. Hi everyone. Thanks for the question. I guess this is for maybe Johanna or for Merdad. Just on lenacapavir you know your competitors highlighted some of the derm pot, and I wanted to get your perspective on what you've seen in clinical studies. You know, really as well as the early commercial experience. I wasn't sure if you guys viewed that as a non-issue or something to navigate as you develop lenacapavir for PrEP or various doublets in HIV treatment. Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Hey Geoff, this is Merdad. Thanks for the question. I would say that our DDI profile has been pretty well characterized and is in our label and laid out. As you noted, lenacapavir is metabolized by CYP3A, and like many other drugs in the class, and we've that's been available and labeled for quite some time. We don't anticipate any changes to our programs based on that. There are no adaptations that we are making in our clinical development program based on that.\nAs you know, we're well on our way in our PURPOSE-1 and 2 lenacapavir for PrEP studies and have the approval in highly treatment-experienced people and have not made any modifications based on any DDI concerns in those trials. I'd encourage folks to take a look at the label you can see what's laid out fairly clearly there.\n\n[Company Representative] (Gilead Sciences)\n\nCompany Representative, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah. Maybe just to add to what Merdad said. We launched Sunlenca, so lenacapavir for heavily treatment-experienced earlier this year. As per Merdad's comments, the label has no contraindication specific to what you were referring to opioids or ED drugs. The launch thus far is well underway, and access is increasing every day across the other markets also including Japan and Europe. We're excited to have an option for these patients that unfortunately have really no other option at this point in time. Very small market opportunity today with the potential for lenacapavir for PrEP as early as late 2025. Very excited as we continue our plans for that.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Michael Yee of Jefferies. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Great. Appreciate the question, maybe for Merdad. Coming away from ESMO and some of the recent conferences. Obviously, a ton of TROP2 data and there's a lot of talk around the benefit particularly in lung for non-squamous versus squamous, and some of your competitors have modified their studies to be more focused on non-squamous. Can you maybe just talk about how you see the benefits here in the different populations and whether you would consider emphasizing or modifying to be a non-squamous as well to improve probability of success. Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Michael, for the question. Yeah, look, we had a really interesting ESMO, I think, for all concerned, and I think something that we've been saying for quite some time is that not all TROP2 ADCs are equivalent, right? It's really important to note that there are differences between Trodelvy and the other TROP2 ADCs in all three components. The affinity of the antibody is two orders of magnitude better. We have a different linker, and we have a different payload. That has played out in many ways along the safety spectrum where we have different adverse event profiles of the two drugs that have clearly emerged.\nIt's possible now that we're starting to see divergence on the efficacy side as well. Recall that we have shared our EVOKE-02 data, which comprise both squamous and non-squamous patients. We have enrolled both squamous and non-squamous patients in our trials, and as one would expect, we do stratify those patients in the studies and will continue to do so. But we're very confident in our approach and with what we've seen so far and really look forward to being able to share more data from EVOKE-01 next year.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Daina Graybosch of Leerink Partners. Daina, please. The line is open.\n\nDaina Graybosch\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThank you. A question about Kite. I wonder if you can talk through. The specific barriers that are limiting uptake of CAR T in the second line large B-cell lymphoma indication, and what do you think will be required to upshift the earlier line demand for cell therapy in large B-cell lymphoma and maybe even in multiple myeloma as well?\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nExecutive Vice President of Kite, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you very much for the question, Dana. I think some of the specific barriers that we're observing are more in the US. So I might first talk about what we're observing in Europe, where we have socialized medicine. We're seeing uptake as soon as we are granted access and reimbursement. And it goes very quickly into the system because it's a non-fragmented healthcare system. In the US, things look a little bit different given the fragmentation of the health care system. So the barriers that we're observing in the US are really our ability to treat patients where they are. So moving into community oncology. Today, 80% of oncology patients are seen in the community.\nMost of our authorized treatment centers exist in large academic hospitals. So what we're doing for the future and what we think is going to be very important is that we're able to have authorized treatment centers in the community closer to patients. That's one important piece. We continue to open up new treatment centers in the United States. In fact, this year we should end with somewhere around 140 treatment centers in the US, and that will continue to grow in 2024. I think the second piece for barriers is converting stem cell transplants. Physicians who are transplanting patients will have a better outcome via the data if they have CAR T.\nWe're working with transplanters on education and really making sure those patients have access to CAR T in the earlier lines. I think those are two of the larger barriers that we're observing today. And the last piece, I would say, is the excitement with multiple myeloma therapies coming forward. You can imagine the ATCs now are seeing both lymphoma patients as well as multiple myeloma patients. And that's causing a crunch within those authorized treatment centers. And that's why it's important in the academic medical centers that we're able to expand the number of beds and secondly, open new authorized treatment centers that can serve both lymphoma and multiple myeloma.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Chris Schott of JP Morgan. Chris, please. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on HIV channel mix dynamics this quarter and how you're thinking about that for Q4 and beyond? I know channel's been a bit of a tailwind over the past year or two. Seems like we're now maybe starting to see some headwinds, at least sequentially. And I just was wondering how you think about that progressing from here. Thanks so much.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure, Chris, thanks for the question. So you're right, as expected, we've seen some of those favorable pricing dynamics that we'd seen in the last couple of quarters, including 2022. Eue to the channel mix kind of beginning to normalize. You should expect to see kind of the same play from Q3 into Q4. One of the reasons for that had to do with some of the channel, specifically around the channel mix to what you referenced, having to do with some of our government channels being less utilized where we have higher rebates and therefore, we had pricing variability. We believe a lot of that had to do with stabilization post-COVID-19 around employment rates, inflation, et cetera.\nSo we had benefits that we saw over that, probably I would say six, you know, four to six quarters or so. As we kind of shared with you in Q2, we are seeing that normalize out for the second half of this year. I think you should expect that not only for the next quarter, but then, you know, as we go into 2024. Therefore because of all that, we believe that our HIV sales growth is closely mirroring now more of the market and the demand growth where we're seeing real strength both from a market standpoint in treatment and prevention. We're seeing about 2 to 3 points growth in the market when you look at retail and non-retail market, and then, of course, 15% growth in the PrEP market.\nThen from a demand standpoint, I think obviously with Biktarvy growing at 12 points year on year and Descovy continuing to hold on to a very strong share over 40% or so in a competitive market with generics, and of course new formulations. So more to come as we go into Q4, but hopefully that gives you a better picture of some of the mix of channels.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you. May we have our next caller, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAdam Jolly\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, thanks for taking our question. This is Adam on for Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. Also on TROP2. Just in light of competitor data, can you provide some more color on just latest thoughts on the competitive dynamics within the class? For example, if AstraZeneca gets a label for HR-positive breast cancer in the second line and Trodelvy only has a label for the third line, won't that displace Trodelvy? Thanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nCan I start? Yeah. Good question, Adam. So I'm assuming you're referring to some of the data we saw at ESMO with Dato-DXd. We don't believe there is material impact for now anyway, or even in the future for Trodelvy. And the reason for that really has to do with the data itself and the lines of therapy. To your point, I think we've proven very clearly with Trodelvy in second-line TNBC and beyond around the overall survival data that we've shown, and then of course showing OS again in HR+/HER2-, although in later lines. I think what we're seeing today in the marketplace is not only are we the leaders in TNBC, we're also leading from an IHC0 population.\nAnd then of course looking at sequencing of ADCs post-Enhertu, as expected, in the HR+/HER2- population. So, quite pleased with our positioning, and we don't believe the data that we've seen thus far is going to have a direct impact there.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, I would just add that we continue to expand our programs and continue to want to generate additional data for Trodelvy. So we are very comfortable with where we are, and I think our ability to interact with our caregivers and patients now, having been on the market for quite some time, is really helping us Make sure that we get Trodelvy to as many patients who could benefit from it as possible.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nOf course. Our next question goes to Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a question here on the pipeline, just given two data releases that came out. So on the TIGIT gastric data that was presented today, how do we think of or how do you think about the terms the opportunity, the competitiveness versus standard of care, combos, and next steps? And then with regard to the multiple myeloma for Arcellx that was presented. It looks to be tracking a Carvykti-like profile in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Could you just walk us through next steps, path to market, competitive positioning here? Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Maybe I'll start with TIGIT and I'll hand it off to Cindy for the multiple myeloma discussion. Yeah, I think, look, we find the data that we presented today at the ASCO plenary to really be promising for continued momentum for TIGIT. The data from an ORR standpoint and I think importantly the landmark PFS analysis are very promising. It's early data, it's single arm data, and I think those are all caveats that are appropriate when looking at these. But when you think about the context around what the standard of care PFS and OS are, we think there's certainly promising signals that we could do better than that.\nSo obviously what we need to do next is allow these data to mature In ARC-21. Then, of course, we have the STAR-221 study that is our phase III study where we will be comparing to standard of care in a randomized phase III trial. We think the data Shown today really will help us with momentum in accruing that trial and hopefully demonstrating the promise of TIGIT added on to standard of care. A standard of care like regimen with zim and FOLFOX. We're excited about that phase III outcome, and it really gives us the opportunity to be, you know, we think ahead on that indication compared to the competition in TIGIT. And Cindy, do you want to?\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nExecutive Vice President of Kite, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, happy to. Thank you. So this is early days, obviously, for the ddBCMA molecule. We have 38 patients worth of data. If I compare it to Carvykti, the population looks more like the LEGEND-2 population. We have 34% extramedullary disease, which is a high-risk prognosis patient. And if you look at the LEGEND-2 data, they had 30%. Our overall response rate to date in those 38 patients at 22 months is 100%, and in the LEGEND-2 data is 88% at 25 months. So I do think there is a potential to differentiate on efficacy. We're seeing a differentiation as it relates to the safety profile around the Parkinson's syndrome. We are not observing that in any of our patients to date.\nObviously we're going to continue to watch that as we enroll the iMMagine-1 study and move into our next study studies as well. Multiple myeloma is a large market. There is enough room in multiple myeloma to have multiple competitors. But we also feel like we will have a differentiated molecule with Arcellx. So we're looking forward to generating more data and talking to folks about it at ASH.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Nadia. We're ready for our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Tyler, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey guys, thanks for the presentation. I have another question actually on the myeloma program. So assuming that Arcellx CART-ddBCMA data continue to look great at ASH and the iMMagine-1 trial data later next year and leads to approval, how prepared have you guys gotten on the manufacturing front in the past year? Do you expect the launch to have a similar trajectory to Yescarta in terms of supply, or be significantly better?\n\nCindy Perettie\n\nExecutive Vice President of Kite, Gilead Sciences\n\nThere's a number of things that we have learned over the course of the years with Yescarta and around manufacturing, all of which we're applying that knowledge to the manufacturing of the CART-ddBCMA CAR T. So we plan to launch that out of our facilities at Kite and expect to have a strong launch again. We will be applying the Yescarta learnings. So our goal is to be significantly better than we were at the launch of Yescarta.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Nadia. We're ready for our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question goes to Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Brian, please. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi there. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like the long-acting HIV combos are moving ahead really well. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the strategic role that the lenacapavir bictegravir daily oral or the weekly GS-1720 based combo could play in the HIV competitive landscape. Do you think these could move beyond treatment experienced patients on complex regimens into the earlier lines? Thanks.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Maybe, Johanna, do you want to talk about Biktarvy and I'll do the weekly?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Brian. I think the way we're looking at lenacapavir bictegravir in the virologically suppressed really has to do with, we set the standard of care with Biktarvy, and the opportunity now is to ensure that if for some reason there was a reason to switch Biktarvy from a tolerability profile or anything else, that they have an option to go to that has a really interesting combination, right? When you think about a capsid inhibitor as well as an integrase inhibitor. So for us it's really about the optionality for patients and making sure that this could offer something a little bit different in the daily oral market.\nI do think that this will also be a longer-term strategy for us as we think about beyond Biktarvy's LOE in 2033. I would go there and on the weekly just to start, and then I'll kick it over to Merdad to share with you our plans there on the weekly oral. It's clear from the patient research that we've done in treatment that we really do see benefit not only the daily oral market, but also in the oral weekly or even potentially even a little bit longer as we think about what patients are asking for today.\nSo as much as we're very interested in the long actings that are every three months or every six months, we are also making sure that we meet the needs of patients and their request as they're looking at for some really don't like any injectables or sub Q, and really looking at that weekly oral as potentially extending a little bit the time they don't think about the fact that they have HIV.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, just minor things to add, I would say. You know, we have been focusing our development on what people living with HIV and people who are looking for PrEP options have told us that they're interested in. And that's longer acting oral options and injectable options that are every three months, every six months. And that's what we've been focusing our development program on. And we want to make sure that we provide that optionality to different folks. The other thing about the BIC/Len to remember is remember that Len is a new class of antiretroviral and that provides caregivers the option to leverage that that new class for the appropriate people living with HIV.\nSo you know, our goal as the leader in HIV is to continue to provide as many of the relevant options to people living with HIV and people looking for prevention options as we think are going to be reasonable and valuable. And remember that we think the weekly oral is important enough that we have two programs. So you mentioned GS-1720. Remember we also have program with islatravir and lenacapavir. So we're very happy with the progress we've made as you noted and really on track to provide better options.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terence, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nFor taking the question. I was just wondering if you can provide any preliminary thoughts on 2024 spend or margins Andy? Thanks so much.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences",
    "content2": "Hey, Terrence, thanks for the question. Happy to take that. Obviously, in late January or early February, as we customarily do, we'll provide very specific guidance in 2024. What we've said, and I would continue to reiterate, is that as you've seen our expenses increase over the last couple of years, as our portfolio has increased, and again from our perspective, a very necessary, an appropriate increase as we developed what we feel is one of the best and broadest pipelines in the industry, both in Virology, Oncology, across Cell Therapy, and at Gilead. We're finally at the level where we're spending on par with our peers, especially on the R&D side.\nYou saw that in Q3. As you think about expenses going forward, we expect that you will see more moderate growth in expenses over time. We're doing a lot to manage our expenses, as you heard on the last couple of quarters. Maybe the best evidence of that, Terrence, is if you look at our Q1 R&D expenses, our Q3 R&D expenses are essentially flat. So you saw a little bit of a step down from Q1. In Q2 and Q3, we're flat. So you already see that we're kind of, as we said, we're approaching kind of the peak spend, recognizing that we have 60 different clinical programs, if I remember correctly, we have 27 programs in phase II, 19 programs in phase III.\nThat is very different than than the Gilead of prior years that you remember. And it's part of what makes us so excited about where we're going as a company. The final thing I'd say is you're already seeing the benefits of those investments and the commercial performance that we've talked about for the last two years. We expect that you will continue to see those benefits in our commercial performance across the entire business, and you're going to see a moderation of expense growth. Again, we'll provide much more specific detail early next year and look forward to talking about this further.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you, Nadia. Our next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Evan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want one on kind of capital allocation as a function of competitiveness in your respective markets. For example, you have a great moat in Virology. How do you think about investment there, say, versus Oncology, where it's a more competitive marketplace and where we're seeing incremental kind of benefit over time? Maybe some thoughts there. Thank you so much.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey Evan, it's Andy. I'll start. Others may want to jump in as well. Look, I mean what we've said historically, and I'd reiterate, is we're always going to follow the science. We are completely committed to Virology, not just HIV, but Virology broadly. You see that, for instance, with our progress with obeldesivir as well as other programs. We've also said in virology that a lot of what happens in virology happens in our internal research and that there are less opportunities externally to invest in. That doesn't mean that we won't continue to look for them. We're going to continue to invest in Oncology. We have a much larger Oncology organization today.\nWe've increased our internal research and development, and we're still very focused as the third pillar on Inflammation. I would remind people that we have a number of early Inflammation programs, including a number in phase II that we're excited about. Merdad highlighted the TPL2 program in his remarks earlier. That's just one of the programs that we expect to build out over time. We'll follow the science. We're going to apply capital to each of those areas. If you look back, our capital investment has risen and fallen over time in each of those areas as we've looked at different opportunities.\nOf course, we're going to continue to invest in Cell Therapy as part of Oncology and more broadly. I should have highlighted that earlier. You know, the short summary is we'll follow the science, but all of the areas will receive additional capital over time. Merdad, do you want to add anything to that?\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nI would just add that our goal has been to diversify the portfolio. We remain committed and think one of our key competitive advantages is our track record and strength in virology. I would agree with you, Evan, that that's critical to our continued success and growth. We also believe that having more diversity in our portfolio, whether it's oncology or inflammation, is going to be really important to our long-term future. Our capital allocation will happen on where the best data are, and we make those trade-offs virtually every day.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, I think we have time for one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question goes to Joe Catanzaro of Piper Sandler. Joe, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Catanzaro\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey everybody. Appreciate you taking my question. I actually had one on Trodelvy within bladder cancer and appreciate this is a smaller proportion of Trodelvy sales, but just wanted to ask about the potential impact of Padcev EV-302 data and it moving into the frontline and what you could potentially see there with Trodelvy both maybe in the near term and longer term. Thanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nMaybe I'll start and then throw it over to Merdad first from a clinical standpoint and what we're thinking from a commercial standpoint with the data that we saw, I think the standard of care is going to change in first line, clearly with that data. We see that as a potential opportunity to actually move up Trodelvy in lines of therapy. Right now in the US, we do have accelerated approval in the US, and we're seeing about 15% to 16% share in bladder cancer, but later lines of therapy, the third line plus.\nI think, with the opportunity to have Padcev kind of move up in the first line setting with pembro, I think it'll be interesting to see how Trodelvy kind of moves up as we've seen a lot of sequencing from ADCs here as well. That's in the here and now, and maybe Merdad, you want to comment on the clinical development?\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, look, I think it's great news for patients with the data that's come out, and we think it does change the paradigm for bladder cancer. I think the other thing I would add to what Johanna said is that. We're looking with interest. We don't have data on sequencing. We're certainly hearing about sequencing. There were data that were shown at ESMO around combining Padcev and Trodelvy, where the tolerability profile looked good, and the responses looked good. Small study, but we think there continues to be opportunity there for us, and having this clarity will help us design where we're going to go from here after our confirmatory trial in second line completes.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That's all the questions that we have time for today. I'll now hand back to Dan for any closing comments.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nChairman and CEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nWell, just want to thank the team here and all of you for joining and just maybe end with this reflection, which is Gilead. I don't think we could be more excited about as we wrap up 2023 and head into 2024, about the evolution of our commercial and clinical execution. In particular, 2024 will be a year that's full of key clinical catalysts across our portfolio. That's really been a culmination over the past several years of investing in a robust and diversified portfolio, many of which were phase two studies that led to phase two studies that led to phase three studies that we'll be reading out over the course of not only next year, but the years to come.\nWe'll provide more details on all of our 2024 clinical milestones early next year, but in the meantime, maybe just a couple to highlight in a busy year. Obviously, on Trodelvy, where the clinical data increasingly highlight that all Trop-2 ADCs are not all, we'll be rolling out data across a variety of disease states in oncology, and we're excited to share data on lung cancer in the first half of 2024. Maybe to highlight one other one, lenacapavir will have a rich year of data on the treatment combination candidates. We continue to target being first to market with our six-month long-acting PrEPs, starting with readouts next year on our phase III trials and a commercial launch as early as late 2025.\nWith that, as always, feel free to reach out to the IR team here at Gilead if you have any questions or feedback for our team, and we'll look forward to updating you again early in the new year. Thank you for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your line."

Thank you for attending Gilead Sciences Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sara, and I'll be your moderator today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2023. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day, our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Cindy Perettie, the Executive Vice President of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital and 2023 financial guidance all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate you taking the time to catch up with Gilead in the midst of a busy earnings period. This was another very strong quarter for Gilead in terms of both business performance and clinical execution. Thank you to the Gilead teams that drove this progress with their dedication to improving the health of individuals and communities worldwide. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 11% year-over-year and closed a very strong first half performance in the base business. As we look to the full year, we are increasing guidance for total product sales.\nWe now expect even stronger growth in our base business of 6.5% to 8% and which is expected to more than offset our revised expectations for Veklury. As a result, our guidance for base business product sales has increased $550 million at the midpoint. In the second quarter, HIV contributed about 2/3 of the $615 million growth in our core business, growing 9% year-over-year. Oncology grew 38% year-over-year and with product sales of $728 million in the second quarter, now has an annual run rate of approximately $3 billion.\nMoving to clinical progress. The second quarter was very active on the regulatory front with approvals, positive opinions or recommendations for 6 of our therapies, Trodelvy, Yescarta, Tecartus, Sunlenca, Hepcludex and Veklury. This regulatory progress highlights the strength of our increasingly diverse portfolio. It also reflects the ability of our teams to successfully navigate regulatory processes across the therapeutic areas and key geographies with speed and efficiency. In addition to this progress, we shared positive pipeline updates at ASCO, which included overall survival data for Yescarta, the only large B-cell lymphoma cell therapy to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit versus standard of care in the second-line setting. Promising Trodelvy data in endometrial cancer, reinforcing our belief in Trodelvy as a cornerstone asset with pan tumor potential and updated TIGIT data from the full study population of ARC-7, establishing domvanalimab's proof-of-concept in lung cancer.\nWe have also shared long-term data for Hepcludex for hepatitis delta virus showing improved response rates at week 96 compared to week 48. These data support new guidelines recommending Hepcludex from people living with chronic HTV in the EU. With a broad portfolio of novel mechanisms and a commitment to pursuing areas of high unmet need, we know that some pipeline setbacks are to be expected. As we announced last month, we have discontinued the Phase III ENHANCE study in higher-risk MDS due to futility and a second interim analysis.\nAs you know, MDS is 1 of the most attractable forms of blood cancer, and we are disappointed that the study was not able to deliver new hope for patients with the disease. We will take a thorough data-driven approach regarding next steps as we carry out the ongoing analysis of magrolimab. Overall, we are executing well on our clinical commitments, and our current performance speaks to the strength of our combined oncology portfolio. We have a rich pipeline of activity in the second half, including an initial look at a subset of EVOKE-02 data on Trodelvy plus pembro in first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nBefore I hand over to Johanna, I'd like to welcome Cindy Perettie, our Head of Cell Therapy to our first Gilead earnings conference call. Cindy has now been with Gilead for 2 months and brings a wealth of oncology and leadership experience from Roche Foundation Medicine and the [ Cerro Cana ] Research Institute. We're delighted to have Cindy join our Gilead leadership team, and it's great to have her with us on the call today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Johanna for a discussion of our commercial results. Johanna?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Gilead. WIth solid performance across our commercial portfolio, leading to an increase in our full year expectations for both the base and overall business. For the second quarter of 2023, as shown on Slide 7, total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 11% year-over-year to $6.3 billion with year-over-year growth in each of our core franchises. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for our base business, reinforcing the strength of our virology and oncology portfolio. The strong growth more than offset the decline in Veklury sales which were as expected, given the lower hospitalizations. Altogether, total product sales, including Veklury, was $6.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year.\nStarting with HIV on Slide 8. Second quarter sales of $4.6 billion were up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher average realized price in part due to channel mix and higher demand partially offset by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 10%, driven by favorable pricing and inventory build following the typical first quarter dynamics. Overall, the global HIV treatment market continues to grow in line with our expectations of 2% to 3% annually. Specifically in the U.S. the market overall grew more than 2% in the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2022, reflecting growth in the nonretail channels more than offsetting a roughly flat retail market.\nHIV product sales grew 11% in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022, helped by favorable pricing dynamics, including the phasing of certain government purchases and channel mix. Looking forward, we expect HIV product sales growth to more closely mirror market growth in the second half. Therefore, we are increasing our full year expectations for HIV and now expect full year HIV product growth for 2023 to be modestly higher than the 5% we reported in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 9. Biktarvy sales of $3 billion were up 17% year-over-year, driven by higher demand and favorable pricing dynamics partially offset by lower channel inventory. With the market share up almost 3% year-over-year in the U.S., Biktarvy remains the treatment of choice for HIV with more than 46% market share. This represents the 20th consecutive quarter of share gains in the U.S. with a year-over-year growth rate that has once again outpaced new and existing regimens. Similarly, we continue to see solid share gains across other major markets as Biktarvy maintains its leading position for new starts as well as for those switching therapies. Descovy sales were $516 million, up 12% year-over-year.\nWith awareness and utilization of HIV prevention higher than ever, the U.S. market grew once again. And amidst this growth, we're pleased to see strong demand for Descovy for PrEP, up 14% year-over-year in the U.S. with a strong market share that has remained over 40%. With this strong foundation, we look forward to potentially adding lenacapavir as a 6 monthly subcutaneous option for prevention as early as 2025.\nMoving to the liver disease portfolio on Slide 10. Sales were up 4% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to $711 million. We remain committed to eliminating HCV globally with our market-leading portfolio of medicines, and our efforts to increase awareness contributed to higher patient starts in the U.S., Europe and Asia in the second quarter. HBV and HDV also contributed to growth in the liver disease portfolio driven by higher demand. Liver disease remains an important part of our portfolio, benefiting hundreds of thousands of patients. We're pleased to have received full marketing authorization for Hepcludex in HDV in Europe. A further recognition of the benefit this medicine brings to patients who have very limited therapeutic options.\nAcross our portfolio of HCV, HBV and HDV products, the liver disease contribution to our commercial performance continues to stabilize overall to a run rate of more than $2.5 billion in sales a year.\nOn to Slide 11. The Veklury sales declined in the second quarter as expected, reflecting lower hospitalization rates with sales of $256 million, down 43% year-over-year. For those patients hospitalized and treated for COVID-19, a majority continue to receive Veklury, a testament to Veklury's robust clinical profile. Most recently, this has included decisions by the U.S. FDA and the European Commission to expand Veklury's indication to reach patients with renal impairment, including those on dialysis.\nMoving to oncology on Slide 12. It is remarkable to observe that in less than 5 years, our oncology business has grown from less than $300 million and is now approaching an annualized run rate of $3 billion. With tens of thousands of patients treated with Gilead and Kite oncology therapies to date. Beyond our well-established leadership in cell therapy, we have the only Trop-2 directed ADC on the market with Trodelvy and combined, our oncology portfolio extends the option for patients in 8 indications.\nLooking in more detail at Trodelvy on Slide 13. Sales were up 63% year-over-year, and 17% sequentially to $260 million, representing an annual run rate that exceeds $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the launch in pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with strong awareness of our approval in the U.S. We look forward to reaching even more patients in Europe following last week's marketing authorization from the European Commission.\nAdditionally, we're beginning discussions with health authorities in Japan with plans to file for approval in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer later this year. With a strong sales force in place and robust data sets across multiple tumor types, Trodelvy remains well positioned to maintain and expand its reach. And Gilead continues to build on our experience in breast and bladder cancers with a view to other indications over time as the development program evolves.\nTurning to cell therapy on Slide 14. Sales in the second quarter were $469 million, up 27% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Yescarta showed continued growth with sales up 29% year-over-year to $380 million, primarily driven by strong underlying demand in the second and third-line setting for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, both in existing as well as new markets. Tecartus sales were $88 million, up 21% year-over-year, reflecting increased demand for relapsed or refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as mantle cell lymphoma, primarily outside of the U.S. We are excited about the opportunity ahead as the body of evidence supporting broader adoption of cell therapies continues to grow. The work that Kite has been leading to raise awareness and adoption of cell therapy will be accelerated by other providers as they ramp up their manufacturing capabilities. This overall expansion in supply will predictably impact our market share in the near term, but overall cost share is the most important driver of our business over time, as cell therapy is offered and delivered to more patients. we are confident that Kite cell therapies will remain differentiated in terms of our manufacturing reliability and efficacy.\nWrapping up the second quarter, I'd like to acknowledge the commercial teams and our partners across Gilead and Kite that once again delivered an extremely strong performance, reflecting both solid execution and the compelling portfolio of Gilead products that positively impacts millions of people around the world.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad?\n\nMerdad V. Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Johanna. I'm pleased to highlight the ongoing progress our teams have made with 64 ongoing clinical programs and 21 Phase III trials. Notably, we presented multiple positive data readouts at medical conferences in the second quarter such as updated overall survival data for Trodelvy in pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, OS data for Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma and long-term data from [ balebertide ] in HDV. As we move into the second half of 2023, we remain focused on execution, investing in capabilities to increase our productivity and portfolio prioritization. We also look forward to sharing an update on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, including EVOKE-02 data at World Conference on Lung Cancer in September.\nTurning first to Virology on Slide 16. We're proud of the role Gilead has played in transforming HIV care. We continue to innovate based on our commitment to both the HIV community and to those who could benefit from a prevention regimen with our ongoing work to deliver new, effective and convenient options. Unique profile of Lenacapavir, our first-in-class capsid inhibitor enables the prevention and treatment clinical programs we're focused on.\nIn HIV treatment, -- the [ ARTISTRY-1 ] trial evaluating an oral once-daily bictegravir and lenacapavir combination regimen is progressing well. We expect to provide an update on the Phase II portion of the study later this year. This novel regimen aims to provide an effective and simpler regimen for the 6% to 8% of biologically suppressed individuals who are currently on complex multi-tablet regimens to manage their HIV.\nWe continue to advance in our goal of providing longer-acting HIV treatment options through the development of lenacapavir combination regimens with integrase inhibitors, NRTIs and NNRTI as well as the Phase II study of our 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies. In HIV prevention, recruitment for our Phase III purpose 1 and 2 clinical trials evaluating every 6 months single-agent subcutaneous lenacapavir continues to exceed our expectations in the second quarter. We look forward to potentially providing a data update in the late 2024 to early 2025 time frame as we target approval in late 2025.\nMoving on to Slide 17. I'm pleased to note that the European Association for the Study of the Liver, or EASL, has updated its HDV guidelines to recommend that all patients in the EU with chronic HDV infection should be considered for antiviral treatment. Recently, Hepcludex was granted full approval by the European Commission and remains the only approved therapy for chronic HDV infection in the EU. The updated guidelines were supported by Hepcludex's 48-week data, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June.\nGilead also presented data demonstrating that 96-week treatment with bulevirtide, improved biologic and biochemical responses with no evidence of treatment emergent resistance including in those who were previously non or partial responders. These data reinforce our confidence in bulevirtide and its potentially longer-term benefit for patients with HDV. As a reminder, bulevirtide is not yet approved in the U.S.\nTurning to oncology on Slide 18. Trodelvy remains the first and only approved TROP2 directed ADC with indications across 3 tumor types. It's also the only TROP-2 directed ADC to show overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy in 2 tumor types. We have now treated over 20,000 patients and evaluated more than 2,300 patients in our clinical trials. Trodelvy's robust dataset informs a well-characterized safety profile with low discontinuation rates observed across multiple indications and no required increasing monitoring for severe interstitial lung disease.\nAt ASCO, we presented additional data demonstrating Trodelvy's potential, including in pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We presented the final analysis from our Phase III TROPiCS-02 trial, supporting the marketing authorization we just received from the European Commission last week. In bladder cancer, we shared an analysis of TROPHY-U01, supporting Trodelvy's efficacy in post-platinum post-IO metastatic urothelial cancer across a range of TROP2 expression.\nWith our accelerated approval in bladder cancer, we hope to provide a data update from the ongoing confirmatory Phase III TROPiCS-04 trial and initiate global filings for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer by the end of next year. In heavily pretreated endometrial cancer, we presented promising efficacy data from our Phase II TROPiCS-03 basket trial, demonstrating the expanding pan-tumor potential of Trodelvy.\nMoving to Slide 19. Our comprehensive clinical development program in non-small cell lung cancer includes several signal seeking and ongoing Phase III clinical trials. We know non-small cell lung cancer is not only an area of significant unmet need as the #1 cause of cancer-related gas, but also an area we believe Trodelvy has the potential to transform standard of care as a combination partner to an I-O backbone in the first-line setting as well as a single agent in the post-IO setting.\nOn Slide 20, we highlight the growing number of lung-related catalysts. I'm particularly excited to highlight that we've added a new milestone with a preliminary readout from our Phase II EVOKE-2 trial at the World Conference on Lung Cancer. This study is evaluating Trodelvy plus pembrolizumab with or without chemo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. We will be sharing data from the first 2 cohorts evaluating Trodelvy in combination with pembro in PD-L1 high and PD-L1 low patients.\nThe abstract expected to be released later in August will be an initial subset of a small number of patients. Our presentation scheduled for Sunday, September 10 at World Lung will include data at a later cutoff date with more patients.\nTurning to domvanalimab or Dom, on Slide 21, we presented data from the last interim analysis of the full 150 patients enrolled in the Phase II ARC-7 study at ASCO in June. The data continue to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer when DOM, our [ FC silent ] anti-TIGIT is combined with an investigational anti-PD-1 agent as compared to the PD-1 inhibitor alone. These data form the basis for our DOM program, encompassing Phase III trials in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and upper GI cancers.\nMoving to cell therapy on Slide 22. Yescarta continues to strengthen its position as a cell therapy of choice for large B-cell lymphoma. At ASCO in June, we presented overall survival data from the landmark Phase III ZUMA-7 trial of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 4 years, a onetime treatment with Yescarta demonstrated a statistically significant longer overall survival compared to standard of care with a 27% reduction in risk of death, representing a 38% relative improvement.\nMoreover, majority of the patients in the standard of care arm eventually received a cell therapy off protocol. And of those, 77% received Yescarta. Overall, Yescarta is the first treatment in nearly 30 years to demonstrate a significant improvement in survival for this patient population, and these data add to the growing body of evidence that position cell therapy is potentially curative in some populations. With a strong pipeline of 6 ongoing Phase II and III trials across lines of therapy, new tumor types and earlier-stage assets, Kite continues to innovate and execute on expanding the potential benefit of cell therapies to new patients, both through internal or acquired innovation and through collaborations. We're working closely with 1 of these partners or [ Selex ] to support their efforts regarding the Imagine One clinical hold.\nWe remain confident in the therapeutic profile for CAR T DCMA and the IMAGINE 1 trial based on the data demonstrated to date and share in our Selex commitment to delivering this novel therapy to multiple myeloma patients.\nTurning to Slide 23. We highlight our progress against key clinical milestones for 2023 so far. We are, of course, disappointed by the outcome of the interim analysis of the ENHANCE trial evaluating magrolimab in higher-risk MDS given the need for treatment options. We will continue to monitor and report on the other magrolimab trials. Importantly, while not every trial will be positive, our efforts at building a well-diversified portfolio gives us multiple opportunities to improve the lives of patients. We're excited about our momentum in making oncology and inflammation important contributors to our future and continue to make strong progress on delivering our key clinical catalysts for this year.\nBeyond our near-term milestones, I'd also like to highlight our growing pipeline of early-stage inflammation assets, including our oral alpha 4 beta 7 and the progression of our [ IRAK4 inhibitor a dedosertib ] into Phase II as well as the advancement of the BTLA agonist program from the MiroBio acquisition into Phase 1. We're excited by this differentiated inflammation pipeline and the potential to impact important gaps in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.\nOverall, we believe we have a very ambitious clinical portfolio that is well diversified across indication and stage. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nChief Financial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 25. And as you heard from Dan and Johanna, our base business continued to perform very well in the second quarter, with total product sales, excluding Veklury, up 11% year-over-year driven by growth across all of our product families. FX was still a headwind, albeit more modest impacting growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Total product sales were $6.6 million, up 7% year-over-year and strong execution in our base business more than offset the lower Veklury sales as well as FX impact of $82 million.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. On a non-GAAP basis on Slide 26. Product gross margin was 86.9%, up 131 basis points from last year. R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year due to higher expenses associated with our broad clinical pipeline, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies. As a reminder, we have 21 ongoing Phase III trials, highlighting the investment we continue to make in Gilead's near- and long-term growth profile. As mentioned earlier this year, we will continue to manage expenses carefully. And in R&D, with a number of significant mid- to late-stage trials ongoing, we'll continue to follow the science, pivoting investment if and when the data warrants. Acquired IP R&D was $236 million, reflecting the [ Zandera ] acquisition and expansion of the Arcus collaboration into inflammation in addition to milestone payments associated with ongoing partnerships. SG&A was $1.8 billion, up 45% year-over-year, including the $525 million legal accrual for settlements with certain plaintiffs in the HIV antitrust litigation, as well as increased commercial activities in oncology and HIV. Excluding the legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year.\nMoving to tax. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 21%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34 in the second quarter of 2023 including approximately $0.32 of expense associated with the legal settlement accrual, partially offset by higher product sales. This compared to $1.58 of earnings for the same period last year. Overall, we had a very strong first half, and as highlighted on Slide 27, with solid performance in each of our core franchises across virology and oncology driving 13% year-over-year growth, excluding Veklury. Given these strong first half results, we have updated our full year sales guidance.\nMoving to Slide 28. We now expect total product sales in the range of $26.3 million to $26.7 billion, up from $26 million to $26.5 billion previously. We expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, in the range of $24.6 billion to $25 billion, up from $24 billion to $24.5 billion previously. This new range represents growth of 6.5% to 8% for our base business year-over-year compared to 4% to 6% previously. On Veklury, the second quarter and first half were below our internal expectations. Based on COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations to date, we have lowered our guidance for the full year to approximately $1.7 billion to bring second half expectations more in line with our first half experience. As a reminder, Veklury is highly correlated with COVID-related hospitalizations and as such, its utilization remains variable. We will share another update with you on our third quarter call.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 86%. There is also no change to our non-GAAP R&D guidance where we expect expenses to increase by a low double-digit percent compared to 2022. Reflecting the onetime legal settlement accrual of $525 million in the second quarter, we now expect non-GAAP SG&A expense to increase a high single-digit percent compared to 2022. Excluding this legal settlement accrual, non-GAAP SG&A expense for 2023 is expected to be down a low single-digit percent compared to 2022, consistent with our prior guidance. Non-GAAP acquired IP R&D has been updated to reflect the [ Zenthera ] acquisition and expanded Arcus collaboration, adding about $200 million or $0.17 per share. For 2023, we now expect acquired IP R&D to be approximately $900 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IP R&D amounts as well as known milestone payments from existing collaborations.\nSimilar to prior quarters, we will continue to include expected acquired IP R&D expenses if we announce additional transactions over the course of the year. We now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $10.4 billion to $10.9 billion or roughly $650 million lower at the midpoint due to the $525 million onetime legal settlement accrual and $200 million in additional acquired IP R&D expense, neither of which were reflected in our previous full year guidance.\nMoving to tax. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. Reflecting an expected decrease in our tax reserves for the second half of the year. Altogether, we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.45 and $6.80 per share down from $6.60 and $7 previously, as shown on Slide 29. The chart illustrates the underlying strength of our business with the higher product sales guidance flowing through to the bottom line in addition to lower expected tax rate. This is, however, offset by both acquired IP R&D at $0.17 per share and the legal settlement accrual at $0.32 per share in nonrecurring cost. On a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.50 and $4.85.\nMoving to Slide 30. You can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through our dividend and repurchase of shares. We believe we have built a strong pipeline that will enable Gilead to deliver near- and long-term growth. And of course, we'll continue to remain opportunistic as we look to access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. We remain committed to growing our dividend and to using share repurchases primarily to offset equity dilution, although we will also be opportunistic from time to time. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.",

    "content": "Q1 2023 Gilead Sciences Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2023 Gilead Sciences Inc Earnings Call\n\nGILDNASDAQAPR 27, 4:30 PM\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nCEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nQ1 2023, our base business grew at 15% excluding Veklury, with total product sales of $6.3 billion, reflecting outperformance across the portfolio on a year-over-year basis. Roughly two-thirds of the $735 million increase in our base business sales were driven by HIV, and the other third was driven by oncology. Once again we're seeing the tangible impact of our transformation and the successful diversification of our business.\nWe saw year-over-year growth in HIV up 13%, liver disease which includes therapies for HCV, HBV, and HDV up 6%, cell therapy up 64%, and Trodelvy up 52%. As expected, Veklury revenues continue to track lower rates of COVID-19 hospitalizations. As a result, revenue of $573 million was down 63% from Q1 of last year.\nOn the clinical side, we received another FDA approval for Trodelvy in early February. This latest approval was for a third indication, pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. It's early days, but this has been a very strong commercial launch for Trodelvy in the US so far. This further highlights the critical patient need that Trodelvy is addressing in this late stage population as well as the effectiveness of our commercial oncology team. We continue to prepare for Trodelvy's approval in pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in Europe in the second half of this year. Another key milestone for the quarter was the announcement of the primary overall survival data from the landmark phase III ZUMA-7 study.\nYescarta is now the first and only treatment in nearly 30 years to show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for initial treatment of relapse or refractory large B-cell lymphoma patients versus historical standard of care in a curative setting. Full results will be presented at this year's ASCO.\nTurning to clinical progress in virology, we continue to add to the body of evidence for lenacapavir's effectiveness as part of a six-month subcutaneous therapy. At this year's CROI, the team shared positive phase Ib data on the investigational lenacapavir and bNAb combination. The bNAb combination is of course just one of the eight long-acting combination options that we're exploring for lenacapavir, and we are pleased with our progress so far.\nIn the meantime, following our first approval of lenacapavir, Sunlenca for heavily treatment experienced people living with HIV, we are seeing strong engagement from KOLs and physicians who are interested in the full potential of lenacapavir for prevention and treatment. As you know, this first approval addresses a significant unmet need for a small number of people living with HIV who have very limited options available to them, and we look forward to making lenacapavir available to many more people, beginning with the potential approval and prevention in the 2025 timeframe. We see lenacapavir as having the most promising potential yet in the ongoing efforts to end the HIV epidemic, and we're looking forward to working with others to make it broadly available as soon as possible. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our first quarter commercial performance.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nJohanna thanks Dan and good afternoon everyone. The commercial organization delivered a very strong start to the year and continue to build on the momentum we saw in 2022 to set a firm foundation for continued execution and growth in 2023. As our results show on Slide 7, each of our core franchises delivered year.\nYear-over-year growth led by HIV and.\nOncology and total product sales excluding Veklury totaled $5.7 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Including Veklury, total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3%, driven by lower Veklury sales associated with fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations.\nOn slide 8, HIV sales were up 13% year-over-year to $4.2 billion.\nDriven by favorable pricing dynamics, higher demand.\nLower inventory drawdowns. Quarter over quarter sales were down 12%, associated with the normal seasonality we typically experience in the first quarter.\nAs a reminder at the start of.\nThe year, patient copays and deductibles reset.\nWhich have an impact on average realized prices and market growth. We expect these pricing impacts to normalize through the remainder of the year, and we also see typically a buildup in inventory in the fourth quarter followed by meaningful inventory drawdowns in the first quarter. Following a focused effort to better manage.\nThis dynamic, we're pleased to see less.\nOf an impact than we have historically on both a quarter-over-quarter and.\nYear-over-year basis, highlighting our goal.\nOf better matching product delivery with end user demand. We expect these efforts to contribute to.\nA more stable quarter over quarter growth.\nIn our HIV business as compared to prior years.\nTurning to Sunlenca, Q1 sales of $4 million were very much in line with our expectations. Sunlenca is an important option for the small number of people living with HIV who have developed resistance and have few if any other options.\nWe're leveraging the launch to engage with.\nProviders and the community ahead of lenacapavir's potential launches in prevention and treatment.\nOverall, the HIV treatment market grew approximately 2% year-over-year in the US and almost 4% in Europe, tracking in.\nline with our expectations for annual growth.\nOf 2% to 3%. In prevention, awareness continues to grow, with the US PrEP market up over 19% year-over-year.\nMoving to Slide 9, Biktarvy sales of $2.7 billion were up 24% year over.\nYear, driven by higher demand as well.\nAs favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. Biktarvy continues to cement itself as a therapy of choice for people living with HIV, now capturing a treatment market share of 46% in the US, up 3% year-over-year and representing a growth rate that has impressively outpaced new and existing regimens. Moreover, Biktarvy has maintained its leading position for new starts across the US, Europe, and other major markets as well as in treatment switches across most major markets.\nIncluding the US.\nOn Descovy sales were $449 million in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Demand for Descovy for PrEP remains strong, up 14% year-over-year. Descovy for PrEP once again maintained its greater than 40% market share. The continued resilience of our PrEP business despite availability of other prevention options including generics provides a solid foundation as we make progress towards the potential approval and.\nLaunch of lenacapavir for PrEP.\nMoving to Slide 10, the liver disease portfolio was up 6% year-over-year to $675 million, highlighting the continuing contribution.\nOf our viral hepatitis medicines to patients.\nThe Gilead portfolio in HCV sales were $445 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by favorable pricing dynamics and timing of purchases by the Department of Corrections. HBV and HDV sales were $230 million, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to pricing dynamics. Outside of the US.\nWe continue to expect HCV starts to trend down over time given the curative nature of therapy, with some offset from HPV and HCV. In the meantime, we're pleased to observe solid and stable market shares across all.\nOf our liver portfolio.\nOnto slide 11 and as we expected, Veklury sales of $573 million were down year-over-year.\nSequentially, as COVID-related infections became.\nLess severe and hospitalizations remained below peak levels. As a reminder, the winter surge occurred earlier than we had expected, beginning in.\nThe fourth quarter and lasting only through the beginning of Q1.\nAs Veclury's use tracks hospitalizations, its sales.\nAre volatile and highly subject to surges.\nThe overall path of the pandemic.\nVeklury is backed by clinical data and.\nReal world evidence that reinforces its clinical profile.\nDespite the lower hospitalization rates in the quarter, Veklury's share of hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19 grew modestly, maintaining.\nWell over 50% share in the United States.\nMoving to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy on slide 12, sales of $222 million were up 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by strong growth both.\nIn the US and Europe.\nFollowing US approval in early February, we're off to a strong start with Trodelvy in pretreated HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. As some clinicians move quickly to make this new option available for patients in this setting.\nWe look forward to extending Trodelvy's reach to these patients in Europe, where a decision is expected later this year. Of course, our efforts here are underpinned by the successes and learnings in metastatic triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC.\nFrom our expansion of the field force.\nLast year, and the strong body of data across a number of tumor types, more physicians are recognizing Trodelvy's clinically meaningful overall survival benefit. This recognition is not just in metastatic TNBC but also in HR-positive HER2-negative.\nTriple-negative metastatic breast cancer regardless of HER2-negative status.\nNow on to slide 13, cell therapy.\nSales in Q1 were $448.\nmillion, up 64% year-over-year and 7% quarter over quarter. We're pleased with the continued growth of.\nYescarta, with sales up 70% year over.\nYear to $359 million, primarily driven by growth in the second- and third-line setting for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Sequentially, sales were up 6%, driven in.\nPart by strong demand and favorable pricing.\nDynamics, both primarily in Europe. Turning to CAR-Ts, sales were $89 million, up 40% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by growing demand for both relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and.\nAdult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nLooking ahead, we continue to work to.\nRaise awareness of cell therapies and increase class share.\nWe believe that compelling data, including ZUMA-7's recent positive overall survival results, in.\nAddition to peer data sets in the.\nCell therapy space, will support broader adoption over time. In summary, it's been a positive start to the year with our current product portfolio of virology and oncology medicines delivering strong performance. We look forward to maintaining this momentum through the rest of the year and beyond. With that I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\nMerdad,\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nthank you, Johanna. We're off to a strong start in 2023 with our first regulatory approval of the year for Trodelvy for certain HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients in the US and an additional 10 trials initiated so far this year, including four phase III studies. This brings our clinical pipeline to 61 ongoing clinical programs, starting with virology. On slide 15, we presented late-breaking data among 83 abstracts at CROI in Seattle in February, highlighting Gilead's continued expertise and leadership across HIV, viral hepatitis, and COVID-19. In HIV, we shared several data readouts from our lenacapavir-based development programs in prevention and treatment. In prevention, we presented preclinical in vivo data providing further validation that a subcutaneous injection of lenacapavir can confer long-acting protection in an animal model.\nWe believe lenacapavir as a single agent has the potential to be the first once every six month option for HIV prevention. We're currently testing this in our pivotal phase III purpose trials. In treatment, we shared phase Ib proof of concept data on twice yearly lenacapavir in combination with two investigational broadly neutralizing antibodies. At week 26, 90% of trial participants receiving this combination maintain virologic suppression. Further treatment with the investigational regimen was generally well tolerated.\nMoving to COVID-19 on slide 16, we also shared positive data from three retrospective real-world analyses of Veklury at CROI. These analyses showed that initiation of Veklury within the first two days of hospital admission reduced death and hospital readmission rates among all patients with COVID-19. The right-hand side of the slide highlights that both of our oral phase III trials evaluating GS-5245 or obeldesivir, our investigational oral COVID nucleoside in standard risk patients, and in high risk patients are now enrolling. Given uncertainties in the global epidemiology of COVID-19, we continue to be cautious with regards to the length of time it could take to fully enroll these trials.\nMoving on to slide 17, Trodelvy continues to build momentum as the cornerstone of our solid tumor portfolio. As expected, the FDA approved Trodelvy for its third indication. Trodelvy is now approved in adults with HR positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer who previously received endocrine based therapy and at least two additional systemic therapies for metastatic disease. This FDA approval is based on the overall survival benefit seen in the phase III TROPiCS-02 trial. We've already received acceptance of our European filing and continue to expect a regulatory decision from the European Commission in the second half of this year. The phase III EVOKE-01 trial evaluating the potential for Trodelvy in second line non small cell lung cancer is ongoing. Additionally, we recently had FPI for the phase III EVOKE-03 study, also known as KEYNOTE-D46.\nThis trial is being led by Merck to evaluate Trodelvy in combination with pembrolizumab and first-line PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, we're excited to announce that over 30 abstracts, including an oral presentation of the updated ARC-7 trial data, have been accepted at ASCO this year. Not only do these data highlight elements of our investigational Trodelvy and domvanalimab programs in breast, bladder, and lung cancers, the abstracts include new insights on many of our promising targets, including our cell therapy portfolio. Speaking of which, on slide 18, I'm pleased to discuss the clinical progress we've made within cell therapy. Recently we highlighted new overall survival data from the phase III ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta for the initial treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. These data will be presented as an oral late breaker at ASCO.\nYescarta is the first and only therapy of any kind to show a statistically significant overall survival benefit versus standard of care in almost 30 years.\nAs we work to extend our leadership in cell therapy within our current portfolio, we're also building out our earlier stage programs. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we closed our agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Arcellix's CAR T DD-BCMA for the treatment of patients with relapse or refractory multiple myeloma. Also, we closed our acquisition of Tmunity Therapeutics in February, extending our preclinical and clinical pipeline in blood cancers and solid tumors. We're currently working to integrate the Tmunity team with their assets into our broader innovation pipeline. Wrapping up on slide 19, we're sharing the updated key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023, which as you can see span FPIS data readouts, updates, and regulatory approvals across oncology, virology, and inflammation.\nOverall, this highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey, the 61 clinical programs that are well diversified across indication and stage. We have an ambitious clinical program, and I'd like to thank the Gilead team that has worked tirelessly to execute and accelerate the progress of our portfolio. We look forward to updating you as we progress through 2023, and with that, I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nAndy, thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon everyone. Starting on slide 21, the first quarter was a strong commercial start to the year with total product sales excluding Veklury up 15% year-over-year despite continued FX headwinds. Overall, our base business demonstrated growth in each of our product families, including almost 60% growth in oncology and 13% growth in HIV. Total product sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% due to lower Veklury sales, partially offset by growth in our base business. FX negatively impacted first quarter total product sales by $106 million, representing approximately 160 basis points of growth. Turning to slide 22, non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.2%, down 1.2 percentage points from last year due to, among other things, the timing of the Biktarvy royalty initiation in the first quarter of 2022 and product mix, partially offset by inventory benefits.\nMoving to OpEx, expenses were higher than we anticipated in the first quarter due to R&D investments and inflationary pressures. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year due to higher expenses, including the acceleration of certain late-stage clinical studies as well as about $50 million in one-time items. As Merdad mentioned, we have started 10 new trials so far this year, including four phase III programs. This brings the total number of ongoing phase III studies to 22, highlighting the investment we are making in Gilead's future growth. Clinical trial enrollment for a number of new and ongoing Trodelvy and lenacapavir trials was faster than we expected, with a notable acceleration, for example, in certain lenacapavir trials in March.\nOur clinical team has been working hard to rapidly advance our studies and bring new therapeutic options to patients as fast as we can. This includes working to close the gap that some peers have in certain programs, and we believe we are starting to see the impact of these acceleration efforts in our trials, although this did contribute to higher R&D expenses in the first quarter.\nConsistent with past practice, we will continue to manage expenses carefully, including the ongoing process of prioritizing programs based on potential impact and data. We have taken the last several years to build the most diverse and robust clinical pipeline in Gilead's history. Now, with well over 100 trials across our three targeted therapeutic areas, we are excited to see so many of these programs in later stage trials with a number of data readouts, building momentum over the next several years.\nNon-GAAP acquired IPR&D was $481 million, primarily driven by expenses related to our acquisition of Tmunity as well as upfront and milestone payments associated with the Arcellix and Neurex collaboration. Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year, primarily due to the commercial expansion and investments in our oncology business, in addition to higher branded prescription drug fee expenses and higher corporate expenses that continue to be impacted by inflation. Moving to taxes. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 was 18.9%, lower than expected, driven by discrete tax benefits recorded in Q1. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.37 in Q1 2023 compared to $2.12 for the same period last year, reflecting higher operating expenses and lower product gross margin. I'll move now to guidance for the full year 2023.\nOn slide 23, there is no change to our revenue guidance. We continue to expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion, and we continue to expect total product sales excluding Veklury in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year. On Veklury, Q1 was modestly below our internal expectations, and our $2 billion full year guidance assumes an increase in infections at some point later this year not dissimilar from what we saw in 2022. We know from experience that COVID-19 related sales are extremely volatile, and we are leaving our guidance unchanged pending additional data points as we move through the year.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L, we continue to target non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 86%. As discussed, we now expect full-year 2023 non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase a low double-digit percentage compared to 2022. This results in an overall R&D investment for the full year in the low 20s as a percentage of total revenue. We believe this is a more appropriate level of investment for a company with a broad late-stage clinical portfolio that is targeting attractive opportunities and sustainable revenue growth. We continue to expect non-GAAP acquired IPR&D to be approximately $700 million, reflecting previously committed acquired IPR&D amounts similar to prior quarters. We will continue to include expected acquired IPR&D expenses as we announce additional transactions over the course of the year.\nMoving to non-GAAP SG&A, there is no change to our prior guidance where we expect a full year decline by a low single digit percentage compared to 2022, although we will continue to look for opportunities to partially offset the higher R&D investments we now plan for this year.\nOverall, there is no change to our expectations for non-GAAP operating income in the range of $11 billion to 11.6 billion. Additionally, there is no change to our tax guidance, and we continue to target a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Finally, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.60 to $7 per share, reflecting first, that the initial guidance model we shared with you in early February allowed for a broad range of potential revenue and expense scenarios, and second, that we're committed to finding room in our overall P&L to absorb the higher R&D investments that we are choosing to prioritize in 2023.\nOn a GAAP basis, we expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to 5.15. Moving to slide 24, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in Q1 through our dividend and repurchase of shares.\nFinally, on business development, there's no change to our philosophy. We are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we've built, acquired, or partnered, and the growth it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high quality assets through partnerships or to make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business. And now I'll hand it over to Dan for some closing remarks.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nCEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Andy. Before we open for Q&A, I'll just summarize our prepared remarks by noting that this is another quarter where we demonstrated the continued impact of our transformation. Going forward, we are committed to building on the track record of strong commercial and clinical execution that we've shown in recent quarters, thanks to the dedication of the Gilead and Kite teams around the world. With this positive momentum, we look forward to delivering on our portfolio while maintaining financial discipline. With that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on a telephone keypad. If you choose to withdraw your question, please press star followed by two. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure your phone is unmuted locally. We ask you please limit yourselves to one question per person. Our first question today goes to Michael Yee of Jefferies. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDennis Ding\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, this is Dennis Ding on for Mike.\nThanks for taking the questions.\nTwo from us.\nMaybe number one, what are your expectations for the competitor Trop-2 data that's coming imminently? And now what would you like to.\nSee, and how would you differentiate, and could you perhaps look at PFS like your competitor?\nAnd then number two, can you just?\nTalk about the progress of your lung.\nActing oral integrase inhibitors for HIV?\nAre they in the clinic yet?\nThank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks for those questions. So in terms of the competitor Trop-2 data, I think it's a little early for us to be doing comparisons across data we haven't seen yet. We're really comfortable with the data we've already shown and have certainly led to approvals in breast cancer with OS benefits. So you know, you can see from the uptake of Trodelvy in the breast cancer market that being approved and having those OS data has had an impact for patients. And we're very comfortable with where we are. Of course we'll keep an eye on those emerging data as they become available in every indication.\nAnd then in terms of the long-acting orals, we, as you know, we have a number of programs in the clinic for our long-acting portfolio, both oral and injectable, and we've moved several of them, including an oral program, into the clinic, and we'll be sharing those data as they become available. Very excited about that portfolio. We remain committed to and really excited about our long-acting portfolio to leverage lenacapavir's unique profile to go into both oral long-acting as well as parenteral long-acting formulations. So stay tuned as those data develop. We'll gladly share.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question please?\nCan I remind all our callers.\nTo please limit themselves to one question so that we can get to as.\nMany folks in the queue as possible.\nThanks Nadia.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Brian Abrams of RBC. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Abrams\n\nSenior Biotech Analyst, RBC\n\nOh, hey, good afternoon.\nThanks so much for taking my question regarding Trodelvy. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing.\nWith regards to its use across the.\nDifferent lines of therapy. Post HR-positive, HER2-negative approval.\nI guess along those lines, as you think about moving this to earlier.\nLines in this indication, what's your latest?\nThoughts on the potential trial design for ARC-7 to optimize in terms of.\nOptimizing the right patient population to expedite.\nTrial enrollment and support meaningful commercial.\nExpansion.\nThanks.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nCEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks so much, Brian.\nDan O'Day here. I'm going to have Johanna answer the first part of your question and then Merdad the second. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Dan. So basically we're really pleased with the early launch results that we've seen so far in HR-positive, HER2-negative. And what we've been seeing is strong initial uptake basically in fourth line plus with some share even in third line. And I think that's really important for us as we think about even earlier trials moving up lines of therapy. But I think the data with the overall survival that we've shown, in addition to the work that we've done in metastatic TNBC, also showing overall survival, has really helped because we've had strong awareness obviously of Trodelvy in the community as well as in academic centers. And the expanded field team work that we did last year has really helped us make sure that we solidified the launch of HR-positive, HER2-negative. So still early.\nWe only have a couple of months in, but definitely on the right track, and we're really seeing physicians.\nUnderstand the benefits of Trodelvy and what they can bring for their patients in this setting.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah.\nAnd then in terms of ARC-7.\nAs we design and move into earlier lines of therapy in that study, as you know, we're going to be looking at the chemo naive population, and we do anticipate that study getting started the second half of this year. So things are moving along very nicely, and we are really excited about that program. The final details in terms of design will be rolled out. I think we're crossing the t's and dotting the i's right now in terms of that final protocol. So you'll see that posted and available in short order.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Chris, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\nThanks so much for the question. I just had one on OpEx. Can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about Gilead's operating cost going forward? It sounds like you're obviously accelerating some R&D programs and you've got this double-digit step-up in R&D this year as we think about operating margin dynamics kind of going forward, I guess off of the 2023 levels. Can we start to think about margin expansion going forward or do we need to maybe think about another year or two of investment before we can think about margin expansion for the company? Thank you.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey Chris, it's Andy Dickinson. Thanks for the question. It's a great question. Maybe just stepping back again, highlight and reinforce that we've built a large and diverse portfolio that really positions us for significant growth both in the short term as well as in the long run. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we're really investing and kind of leaning into that. We had an accelerated or significant focused efforts to accelerate some of our clinical development, which is starting to pay dividends. You're also seeing the validation of this approach in our commercial results that Johanna highlighted, in the strength across our base business. So to your point, we are now, this year, I think we already have 22 phase III trials underway, which is significantly more than we have as a company historically. Actually, frankly, a healthy level.\nI highlighted in my comments that this year we're targeting kind of low-20s percentage points of revenue for our R&D investment, and that's a reasonably good place to be. We believe it's in line with peers. Over the long run, there will be years when we have expenses that are greater than that and years lower. Over the cycle, I think that's kind of what we're targeting.\nSo.\nAnd then maybe to your question in operating margin, we still have a very healthy operating margin, as you know. Again, there's apples and oranges comparisons with the new IPR&D rules. But we do expect to see our operating margin strengthen again over time as we get through this bolus of phase III trials that we have underway. And that drives growth above and beyond what you've already seen in the last 18 months, which we think is off to a great start. So more to come. It's going to take a little more time to get through it to your point, but we're in a very good spot from our perspective.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Salveen, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Goldman Sachs)\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon, this is Anand for Salveen. Thanks for taking our question. Just on the TIGIT combo data at ASCO, how do you view this update? Is it more incremental? And then just on the Roche OS data, which is now expected in Q3, how much read through do you anticipate on that front? Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, thanks.\nWhat we have said, and I think what we're planning, is we will have an updated data set from a more recent cut, so there'll be additional data compared with what was presented, what we talked about last year.\nAt the ASCO plenary. So there should be more mature data with a larger patient population. So that should help reinforce our confidence in terms of the Roche data. I think it's a great question. Look, I think we believe in our own data as well as all of the other public data that are out there in terms of TIGIT bringing benefit, certainly in terms of response rates and other parameters. Certainly in our data set we've seen those PFS benefits, and our expectation is that the Roche data will continue to demonstrate benefit, adding TIGITs to PD-1 inhibitors, so PD-L1 inhibitors in their case. So we will be looking forward to seeing those OS data, and I think that should help to provide additional confidence to.\nAll the TIGIT antibodies out there.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Geoff, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Pharmaceuticals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question.\nMerdad. You guys have been very successful commercially with Kite, and it looks like the pipeline has some logical next steps in terms of liquid tumors. I guess what I wanted to ask you is what's your appetite for leveraging the expertise to look at non-oncology indications like rare diseases or maybe towards solid tumors? And why do you think the field has mostly evaluated the same targets in.\nMyeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, et cetera?\nThank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks, Goeff.\nYeah, it's a very complicated question. I'll try to give a very brief answer. Look, I think that leveraging the engineered T cells so far in hematology has demonstrated really great efficacy and a reasonable tolerability profile for that patient population. I think it's all about therapeutic index. As you start to go into broader indications where treatment options different and the disease state is different, I think there are different considerations for therapeutic index. So as we look into different populations, we're going to keep a very close eye on the appropriate therapeutic index for a given patient. Whether you're talking about lupus or anything else outside of oncology, related to your question.\nFrom our perspective, maybe the broader perspective that I would offer is that we do believe that modulating the immune system will lead to better outcomes in patients. Whether you're talking about agonizing or antagonizing. In immunologic disorders, we do believe that getting to better and more targeted.\nImmune blockade is going to be better for patients. So from our perspective, there is not only cell therapy in play. I think that's what we like about our portfolio: that we have, we're not modality restricted, and you've seen the deals we've done. We have our BTLA antibody and the rest of our portfolio in inflammation. We are going to be pursuing the best outcome for patients, regardless modality. Certainly cell therapy will be one of those.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Terrence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Terrence, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerrence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nJust one for me on Yescarta. I was wondering if you can give us any more color in terms of.\nThe breakdown between second line versus third line.\nRight now, obviously you're seeing some nice momentum and then on the manufacturing footprint.\nMaybe just any color there in terms of total number of patients you can supply in a year? Obviously that's been an issue for some of the other CAR T therapies out.\nThere, but just want to understand kind of longer-term supply dynamics. Thank you.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure.\nSo let me start, and then maybe Andy can touch on the manufacturing piece of the puzzle. So thanks for your question, Terrence. I think what we've seen is really strong growth across second line and third line, and obviously a little slower coming into second, nice momentum into second line as well. And I think the OS data from ZUMA-7 coming through, that will be presented at ASCO, will only help continue that and really differentiate it versus current standard of care. But what we have seen is growth that has really picked up quite nicely.\nYou're seeing it both in the US as well as Europe, and really happy to say, actually, although we just got recent approval for second line in Europe late last year, we're getting a lot of markets coming in from reimbursement, accelerating reimbursement because of the importance of this data for patients. And actually one example of that is actually just today with the NICE approval for second line therapy with Yescarta. So we're very excited about where this is going. There's still a lot of growth opportunity in second line. And obviously the team is really working diligently to make sure that physicians are well educated, to make sure that they understand the benefits and the overall survival over long term for these patients. So more to come on that.\nWith that, I'll just turn it.\nOver to Andy for manufacturing.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah. Thanks, Johanna. And hey, Terrence, nice to talk to you again. On manufacturing. What I would say is that it's a real area of competitive strength for Kite and for us. As you know, we have three approved manufacturing centers globally, two in the United States, one on each coast, and then the one in the Netherlands. All of them are fully operational. We're already moving in our Maryland facility to partial automation of our manufacturing process, which is off to a great start. And we just have an outstanding team. So we have not had capacity constraints either on the manufacturing of the cells or on the viral vector. So remember, we have both an outsourced and an internal viral vector supply. We manufacture our own viral vector at our Oceanside, California biologics facility.\nSo I don't think, Terrence, we've shared specifically the capacity of our manufacturing footprint, but rest assured, we have adequate capacity to serve the market today. Our team does a great job of forecasting where the market's going. We're always one or two steps ahead and we don't expect that to change. So, you know, from a manufacturing standpoint, the Kite team has just really done an outstanding job.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, may we have our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Tim, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAdam Wolfe\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thanks for taking a question. This is Adam, on behalf of Tim. So on Biktarvy, it doesn't lose a until the next decade, but it's possible it gets targeted by the IRA before then. We know that Medicare only accounts for a limited portion of Biktarvy's volume. Is it possible that the pricing impact extends to commercial patients also? Are there other aspects of the IRA that you think investors are discounting beyond the negotiation piece?\nThanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSo I'll take that one, Adam. So, yes, we do believe that the IRA will have an impact on Biktarvy, although we do believe it will be later this decade and probably the earliest could be 2028 or so.\nAgain, what you said is absolutely true. It is only on our Medicare business. And obviously there's a lot of things that can happen between now and then. It's still early in understanding exactly how it's going to play out, including the pricing negotiations that will happen. As to the spillover effect that you mentioned, we've had situations, obviously, in other channels today where we have higher discounts than in our commercial channels. And we've been able to manage that specific to the patient populations within those channels. And so we believe we'll be able to do that again and mitigate the risk of spillover. And so, yeah, so I think that that's kind of what we're managing.\nIn addition to the fact that our portfolio as much as Biktarvy is out to 2033, and that will, I think, really continue to be the standard of care for daily orals, we're also expanding our portfolio. As you think about where we're going with lenacapavir with different combinations in treatment and obviously with our prevention work. So more to come on that. But I think we're more than prepared to manage the situation and have a couple more years to figure out some of the different dynamics within the IRA.\nMay we have our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Umer Raffat of Evercore. Umer, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, guys.\nThanks for taking my question. I want to touch up on Trodelvy real quick in terms of how the prescription trends are tracking in TNBC in particular, especially in light of your competitor Daiichi saying they now have number one patient share in HER2-low and growing. So I'm just curious how that's shaking out because I know you got a new indication this quarter. And secondly also there's a lot of renewed interest in CAR T especially as it relates to immunology. But as I think of immunology and the price points, maybe 3x HUMIRA.\nSo that'll be $150,000.\nBut conversely, I would imagine each cell.\nTherapy dose would be at least 100,000.\nSo how do you think about economics as you head into potentially immunology indications? Thank you very much.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSo, Umer, I'll take the first part.\nOf that, specific to Trodelvy and what we're seeing in TNBC and metastatic TNBC. So what we've seen is actually continued growth in TNBC for Trodelvy. And really that has a lot to do with the expansion of our field force. But also the continued data that comes through. Right. The OS data in TNBC is one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is obviously the OS that we've shown also in HR-positive. So really the breast cancer community understanding Trodelvy better in that we haven't split the market, and neither have physicians at this point really split the market between, you know, HER2-low kind of population. So what we look at is each indication TNBC and HR-positive, HER2-negative. And what we're seeing in metastatic TNBC in the lines of therapy.\nThat second line plus is really Trodelvy established itself as the standard of care in this setting, and it continues to do that.\nSo I do think, just remembering in TNBC, the split between IHC 0 and IHC 1 and 2 is 65, 35. So much more represented.\nSo less represented by maybe some of our competitors. Having said that, we work across the spectrum, which I think is really important to remember. So that's the Trodelvy dynamics right now in metastatic TNBC.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nCEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nGreat, Umer. This is Dan O'Day too, I think. I appreciate your question. On the second one, I'll dovetail onto what Merdad said before about the importance of therapeutic index. But before I do that, let me just articulate, you know, the tremendous benefit that CAR T is providing in large B-cell lymphoma from a pharmacoeconomic standpoint. The fact that we now have patients in very late stage disease, 50% of them surviving out to five years, and essentially a flat line survival curve. You can imagine the benefit from both mortality perspective and cost to the system at the current price point in large B-cell lymphoma. I think any price point in other therapeutic areas would be based upon the clinical benefits that that brings to those particular patients.\nOf course, we understand that, you know, this wouldn't necessarily be a broad scale use across all different types of patients. There will be patient segments where the therapeutic index is more important. And for those patients, you know, we would look at the level of benefit that brings both to the patient and to the healthcare system and then price it accordingly. Of course, I think it's hypothetical at this stage, but given the benefit that we're seeing in cancer, we would take the same approach to other disease states.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nAs we move to our next question.\nJust another reminder, please, to limit yourself to one question. We do have 10 folks still hoping.\nTo ask a question on the call.\nWe'd like to get to as many as possible.\nSo with that, Nadia, may we have.\nOur next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nOf course, the next question goes to Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Tyler, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much for taking the question.\nI guess, given Legend's tremendous top-line data from the second line, I figured I would ask for your latest thoughts on that opportunity and how you plan to differentiate in that setting with the Arcellix program.\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHey Tyler, it's Andy Dickinson. I'll take the question. On behalf of the Kite team.\nObviously we and others want to see the full data set. We read the same releases that you've read and we continue to believe that Arcellix and now Kite have a very interesting program that has the potential to.\nBe very competitive in that area to get on par or better potentially than the J&J Legend product. And as Dan said earlier, it doesn't come as surprise to us that cell therapy is delivering that magnitude of benefit to patients across different disease areas. And it's exciting to see where cell therapy may go in terms of becoming the standard of care. And second line BCMA potentially over time, which of course increases the size, the potential opportunity for the Arcellix and Kite team. So look forward to seeing more on the data. Look forward to carrying our program forward together with the Arcellix team and updating you over time. But certainly look like a fantastic data set and great for patients.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks Nadia. Our next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer & Co. Hartaj, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nHartaj Singh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co\n\nGreat, thank you. Thanks for the question. You know, I just had a quick question on Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer. I know those trials are still about a year, two years from reading out, but can you just remind us of the scientific rationale behind Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer and just opine a little bit on just the EVOKE-01 and EVOKE-03 trials.\nThank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure.\nHartaj, yeah, I think there are several things that give us a lot of confidence in terms of moving forward in non-small cell lung cancer. Certainly, the distribution of TROP2 has demonstrated broad expression in non-small cell lung cancer, not too dissimilar from breast cancer. I think that gives us a lot of incentive to believe that the expression of TROP2 in those tumors is going to give us efficacy by delivering the payload to those cells. Secondly, we've seen both internal and external data for TROP2-targeted ADCs that support the value of bringing TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate to non-small cell lung cancer. Our approach, which has been broad and we're very excited about, I think is going really well is we are, as you know, in EVOKE-01 going into second-line non-small cell lung cancer and that study's going very well.\nWe are then, as well, looking in frontline lung cancer in our other trials and looking at combinations of.\nPD1s with.\nTrodelvy in those tumors in non-small cell. We think that the potential for Trodelvy in those tumors is very high. We believe that we'll start to see those data start to roll out from our second-line studies first, as you would imagine, and then we'll continue to build on that as we go.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you.\nMay we have our next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question goes to Brian Skorney of Baird. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCharlie Muro\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHi, thanks for taking our question.\nThis is Charlie Muro for Brian.\nI had a question about lenacapavir. So with regards recent data with the.\nbNAbs, it seemed like one case out of 20 experienced a viral rebound. So I was wondering how that might.\nInform which combinations you are thinking about.\nMoving forward with regard to overcoming resistance. Kind of along that same line.\nWhat kind of expectations do you have?\nFor the size of the long-acting market in HIV? Thank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nYeah, very important that that breakthrough was not associated with lenacapavir resistance. Right. And I think that's, that's really important to keep in mind. Look, bNAbs are relatively.\nNew clinical tools to look for options for people in terms of treating HIV, and it's one of the many approaches we're taking. Our approach has been to move a broader portfolio of small molecules to complement that early foray into long acting with the bNAbs where we believe that.\nThe.\nTried and true mechanisms that we have used again both orally or parenterally should provide us with an opportunity to bring treatment options to people living with HIV that will be associated with low resistance rates and high efficacy. So that's what we're testing out. As we find the ideal partners, and I use the plural intentionally, we will be moving that forward. And so I would look at those. The bNAb data is an early first approach to a long-acting treatment for people living with HIV.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences",
    "content2": "Maybe just to cover Charlie, the second part of your question, around the size of the market.\nI'm going to split it out.\nWhen you think about the market from a treatment standpoint, we do believe that the long acting market probably by the end of this decade we'll look about.\n50, 50 or so.\nWe think that there are definitely patients out there that are looking for not to be reminded that they have HIV, and an opportunity to think about the next generation long acting to really bring to patients what they're looking for. I think that's the kind of last unmet medical need in this space at this point in time. I also think Biktarvy will continue to be the standard of care in the daily oral market where there's still a lot of patients that actually do want to take their medicine every single day to make sure that they know that they're taking something to put at bay their HIV. Just to touch on the expansion from a PrEP standpoint, I just wanted the prevention market very different in our view and from discussions we've had with community partners, and people that are at risk of HIV.\nWhat we're seeing here is probably the split is different, but the market expansion is also very different. So the split is probably going to go towards 70, 30 by the end of this decade is what we assume. That has a lot to do with the fact that these are not patients. These are people at risk, and they don't necessarily want to take a pill a day for something they don't have. And so that makes a lot of sense. So something every six months aligned with physician visits could be an ideal scenario in this setting. And then from an expansion standpoint, as you well know, we've talked about this a lot. If you look at the CDC assumptions around the number of people that are at risk in the US, we've only kind of captured about 25% of those.\nFolks that are currently.\nUnder medication.\nUnfortunately, there's still 75% that are not and that are at risk. So there's an incredible opportunity, especially with something every six months, to really expand in this marketplace and make sure that we truly work together to end this epidemic. Very exciting times to come. Within the next two years, hopefully we'll have lenacapavir as the data reads out and approvals in prevention, and then just a bit after that in treatment with different partners that Merdad was mentioning. Very exciting time.\nSuper.\nWe'll move to our next question please. Nadia.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Steve Seedhouse of Raymond James. Steve, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Deschner\n\nVP and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Raymond James\n\nHi there, this is Ryan Deschner on.\nFor Steve Seedhouse.\nThanks for the question.\nCurious what the current non-hospitalized vs. hospitalized usage split for Veklury is and.\nDo you anticipate a large amount of potential cannibalization in the non-hospitalized usage coming from obeldesivir if its clinical development is successful?\nThanks.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nThanks.\nSo Ryan, I'll take that question. So what we have seen in the last year or so is somewhat of a lessening of the severity of infections and therefore from a hospitalization standpoint, obviously less hospitalizations as well.\nSo we've seen a couple of different things. So obviously much fewer hospitalizations of late. And we've seen that obviously in the numbers because as you well know, Biktarvy tracks very closely to hospitalizations. And what we've seen is that despite the fact that hospitalizations have come down versus our expectations in Q1, the actual usage of Veklury has gone up. And that's super interesting. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of the data that keeps delivering for Veklury around the updates of guidelines, the strength of our data, real world data that's come out continuously showing reduction in mortality and reduction in readmissions to hospitalization. So very powerful data, but definitely a bit of a play there. Our outpatient use with Biktarvy is still quite small in the single digit or so.\nHaving said that, it is growing, but it's really the only antiviral that is approved in hospitalized settings for COVID-19. And so that continues to drive. I think as we think about our oral COVID-19 program, I think we are thinking more the non-hospitalized setting, which I think would then complement what we have in our portfolio that works really nicely both in the non-hospitalized setting and the hospitalized setting to make sure that patients at risk have what they need if they do get infected.\nNadia, may we have our next caller please?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. The next question goes to Olivia Brayer of Cantor Fitzgerald. Olivia, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nOlivia Brayer\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHey, good afternoon and thank you for the question.\nHave you guys started to think through a commercial rollout strategy for Magrolumab, especially?\nWhen you look beyond the initial academic.\nCenters, and is there anything you can do to help drive initial adoption of transfusion guidelines in that community setting specifically?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSo I'll take that one, Olivia. As we think about magrolumab, we are excited. Obviously we're waiting for the data to read out, but we are excited and we have started thinking about our commercial model for sure. I think a couple of pieces to that one. One is the strength of the community and making sure we understand kind of what that looks like, but also the.\nStrength that Kite brings in this play as well.\nSo we're not starting from scratch. Right. We are going to partner very closely with our Kite colleagues to make sure that there's a lot of learnings there that I think we can apply and a lot of overlap from a physician standpoint that we've been working through. So a lot of those pieces are in play. And the last piece I would say just to add to the commercial model. And our thinking also has to do with the fact that we're also trying to get ahead of the game and better understanding. Right. These are diseases that sometimes community physicians will not see on a regular basis.\nHow do we make sure that we understand the when and where, and making sure that the commercial model supports that timing as well, and being a little bit smarter in our approach from an execution standpoint? So all those pieces are coming into play, but obviously we're excited and anxious for the data, but we will be sure that we are ready for not only the data but the approvals as well.\nNadia, we'll try and squeeze in just a few more here.\n\nOperator\n\nOf course. The next question goes to Colin Bristow of UBS. Colin, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (UBS)\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOh, hi, this is Ting for Colin.\nThanks for taking our question. So, Guru Nab, can you specify how many interims were planned in total for the ENHANCE trial and for the interim update in the back half of the year? Will there be actual data disclosure or just a high-level update?\nWhat's your expectation?\nAlso, what's your expectation of the CR and overall survival for the azacitidine control arm? There were some chatter around if azacitidine arm outperformed in Takeda's phase III trial where they used a more intensive dosing regimen. So what's your thought over this?\nThank you.\n\nMerdad Parsey\n\nEVP and Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. So.\nIn terms of the interim analyses.\nIt's a good reminder that the study is powered for the final analysis. And so our expectation for any study that has interim analyses is that we run to the final analysis, which I think we've guided to occurring next year. When an interim analysis occurs, we generally will not see the data. Generally what happens is that the DSMB will tell us to either continue or potentially discontinue. If obviously we discontinue, we'd share that, but if it's just continue, we would continue the trial and there will be nothing other than that to share because we don't have any data to share since we won't have seen it. So our expectation is that we run to the end of the trial. It would certainly be upside if we saw something earlier than that. And then I think in terms of.\nThe expectations, you're absolutely right. I think everyone has looked at the Takeda data and are wary as to the efficacy of azacitidine in performing in that patient population. And so.\nWe're going to have to wait and see what that looks like at the end of the trial.\nI guess buttressed by the fact that we have, you know, the DSMB has told us to continue the trial, gives me a little bit of more confidence that we are going to see a treatment effect, but that's a very indirect assessment, so we're going to have to see. But we are powered for.\nYou know, we've made some assumptions in terms of how we power the trial, so hopefully we'll be able to detect a difference between the two.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences\n\nNadia, maybe just time for one last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question goes to Mohit Bansal of Wells Fargo. Mohit, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe a question on BD at this point. I mean, how are you thinking about.\nBD? I know in the past you talked about there's no urgency there and you could be thinking about tuck-in. But has anything changed at this point now that you're in a good position with the growth coming back? Is there an updated thought there?\n\nAndrew Dickinson\n\nCFO, Gilead Sciences\n\nHi Mohit, it's Andy. Thank you for the question. Nothing's changed from our recent updates. I mean, we think that BD is an important part of the puzzle for us going forward. It's important to continue to bring new and exciting innovation and products into our portfolio over time. We don't expect that to stop. That said, and to your point, we have made extraordinary progress over the last four years that we're really proud of. And so the breadth, given the breadth and depth of our pipeline, you should expect that we will do less over the coming years than we did over the last three or four years. But we will still be active. And what we said recently, and I'd reinforce is that we will do ordinary course licensing deals. Obviously you saw the Tmunity and our select deals last year.\nWe've talked about the MiroBio deal, all of which we're very excited about. And then we expect from time to time to do small acquisitions. But you know, our portfolio, to your point, is in a great spot. We're very excited about what that's going to do to drive growth, and we will always look for opportunities to add to it if we can in a thoughtful way that we think will benefit patients and our shareholders. But that's the way I would think about it at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I'll now hand back to Dan for any closing comments.\n\nDaniel O'Day\n\nCEO, Gilead Sciences\n\nThank you so much. I just want to thank you all for joining today for your continued interest in Gilead. You know, look, bottom line is we've had a very strong start to the year building on the momentum from 2022. You know, we collectively at Gilead and Kite believe we have a very strong and firm foundation for continued growth in 2023. If we didn't get to your questions or you have additional follow-up questions, please reach out to Jackie and the IR team, and we'd be more than happy to support you. Thank you very much for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nSa."

Thank you for attending today's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Gilead Sciences Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hannah, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross. Please go ahead.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of IR, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.\nThe speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital and 2023 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We had the opportunity to connect with many of you a few weeks ago in San Francisco, and I'm excited to be able to reconnect now to share our strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 in addition to our guidance for 2023. These show the tangible impact of our business transformation, notably the growth trajectory for our HIV portfolio and our fast-growing oncology business.\nThe team will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I'm very pleased to highlight on Slide 4, the strongest full year growth in our base business in 2015 when growth was driven by the peak of HCV sales. Full year 2022 sales of Biktarvy grew 20% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, exceeding $10 billion for the first time. Excluding Biktarvy, our base business in 2022 grew 8% year-over-year, and I'm pleased to share that our initial 2023 guidance points to base business growth between 4% and 6%.\nAndy will share our revenue guidance in detail, but I do want to take this opportunity to recognize the Gilead teams for the progress we made in returning to growth. Thanks to their commitment to improving the health of people and communities around the world, Gilead is now poised to extend its reach to more patients and more challenging diseases and conditions than ever before.\nBeyond our financial results, our clinical progress in 2022 reinforces how far we've come. At the end of the year, Sunlenca received its first approval in the U.S. for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV infection. This follows the European approval in the third quarter. Sunlenca is the first 6-monthly subcutaneous medicine to be approved and we believe it represents the most exciting innovation in HIV therapeutics in recent years with significant potential across prevention and treatment.\nWe look forward to partnering with the HIV community to increase awareness of Sunlenca and to advancing our portfolio of long-acting options. We are anticipating another potential approval any day now with the upcoming PDUFA date for Trodelvy in pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. We also expect to hear from European regulators later this year.\nIn the meantime, Trodelvy's commercial momentum is building with full year 2022 sales growth of 79%. In cell therapy, we continue to reinforce our leadership and to execute on plans to broaden availability with Yescarta most recently approved in Japan for second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.\nMerdad will talk you through our pipeline updates and key milestones in a few moments. For now, I'll simply note the significant expansion in our clinical programs, which have more than doubled in the last 4 years. We continue to add further programs, including our new preclinical candidate to partner with lenacapavir for our long-acting HIV treatment programs, the new Phase III Oaktree study for our novel oral COVID-19 nucleoside and the 5 Phase III trials that we expect to initiate this year.\nBefore I hand over to Johanna, I want to briefly review the clinical goals we shared with you a year ago. The Gilead and Kite teams have done a terrific job in both delivering as planned and acting with agility in response to changing circumstances. We had an impressive year of disciplined and determined execution in 2022 and fully expect to further strengthen our track record of execution in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Johanna for a review of our fourth quarter and full year commercial performance. Johanna?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our commercial results, I want to acknowledge our Gilead team for delivering another outstanding quarter and closing out a very successful year. 2022 was an exceptional year for Gilead, with our virology franchise well positioned to continue its leadership for years to come and significant progress in executing our oncology strategy and bringing new medicines to improve the lives of more patients all around the world.\nStarting on Slide 7. We had a very strong quarter, delivering a total product sales, excluding Biktarvy, of $6.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year or 12% excluding the impact of FX and the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla with solid growth in each of our core franchises and growth across all geographies, once again, led by HIV and oncology. Quarter-over-quarter, sales grew 5%, driven by HIV, Trodelvy and cell therapy, partially offset by HCV.\nFor the full year, total product sales, excluding Biktarvy, were $23.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year or 11% excluding the impact of FX and the Truvada, Atripla LOE, driven by HIV and oncology. As expected, full year Biktarvy sales were down meaningfully in 2022 compared to 2021. That said, Biktarvy's performance has been more sustainable than we previously expected and it's clear that it continues to play an essential role for hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19. In 2022, Biktarvy delivered $3.9 billion, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Overall, full year total product sales of $27 billion was flat compared to 2021 as growth in our base business was offset by the decline in Biktarvy sale.\nOn Slide 8, HIV sales for the fourth quarter were $4.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics. This was offset in part by a smaller than usual inventory build in the fourth quarter, reflecting our early efforts on seasonal inventory management. Sequentially, HIV sales in the fourth quarter were up 6%, primarily driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics as well as higher demand. For the full year, HIV sales of $17.2 billion were up 5% year-over-year due to higher demand, primarily related to the continued strength of Biktarvy in addition to channel mix leading to higher average realized price. This was partially offset by inventory dynamics and FX.\nOverall, the HIV treatment market in the fourth quarter grew 1.5% year-over-year in the U.S. and over 2% in Europe. On an annual basis, the market has grown in line with our expectations of 2% to 3%.\nMoving to prevention. The U.S. PrEP market grew 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting growing awareness. Descovy sales for the fourth quarter were $537 million, up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Notably, despite generics and other entrants, demand for Descovy for PrEP continues to increase, up more than 20% for the full year in addition to maintaining a stable market share of over 40%.\nWith these trends and the TAF IP settlement last year, Descovy position in the growing PrEP market has only strengthened. Overall, this provides a strong foundation as we look to the potential launch of lenacapavir for PrEP as a true long-acting every 6-month regimen in the middle part of the decade.\nMoving to Trodelvy on Slide 9. Sales for the quarter were $2.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing dynamics offset in part by lower channel inventory. Quarter-over-quarter, sales were up 6% similarly driven by higher demand as well as favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. In every quarter since our launch, we've seen Biktarvy continue to gain market share, and the fourth quarter was no exception, getting more than 3 percentage points in share year-over-year.\nThis continued momentum is a testament to the Biktarvy's differentiated clinical profile, reinforced by the long-term 5-year data we presented last year. Notably, in the U.S., Europe and other major markets, Biktarvy remains the #1 regimen for new starts, in addition to its #1 position in treatment switches across most of the major markets, including the U.S. At the end of 2022, there are almost 1 million people managing their HIV with Biktarvy worldwide.\nTaken all together, this has led Biktarvy for the first time to achieve full year sales of over $10 billion in 2022. Looking ahead, we're confident that Biktarvy will remain the leading medicine for the treatment of HIV in the U.S., Europe and other major markets for years to come.\nNow looking ahead for the first quarter of 2023 for HIV, a few points I just wanted to call out. First, with respect to pricing dynamics, as we enter the new year, we expect the typical first quarter reset in patient co-pay and deductible. As always, these will have an unfavorable impact on average realized price in the first quarter. Second, a reminder that we've historically seen inventory buildup in Q4 that has led to notable drawdown by wholesalers in Q1. While we've implemented new processes to better manage inventory dynamics from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we continue to expect an inventory drawdown to occur in Q1, albeit at more modest levels compared to prior year.\nSo with this in mind, we expect HIV sales for the first quarter to decline by low teens sequentially from the fourth quarter. This compares to the 18% sequential decline we reported in the first quarter of 2022.\nFor the full year 2023, I'd like to remind you that some of our HIV performance in '22 was driven by shift in channel mix that had a favorable impact on average realized price, contributing in part to the 5% year-over-year revenue growth we reported in 2022.\nWe expect channel mix in 2023 to be relatively similar to last year, and therefore, do not expect HIV growth to benefit from changes in average realized price like we saw in 2022. As a result, we continue to expect HIV to grow in 2023, albeit at a modestly lower growth rate than 2022.\nAs we think about the future of the HIV market, Gilead is well positioned to provide many people living with HIV and those at risk of HIV with multiple options for care. To that end, we're excited about the recent approvals for Sunlenca in the U.S. and Europe for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV infection. This first indication represents only 1% to 2% of people living with HIV, there's a huge unmet medical need. These individuals have cycled through multiple antiretroviral regimen and until now have had very few, if any, effective options left available. Sunlenca is now approved in the U.S., U.K. and European markets, and we're working as quickly as possible with regulators and reimbursement bodies to make Sunlenca available in many more countries.\nWe believe this first launch of Sunlenca represents a key milestone for Gilead and looking forward in the treatment and potential prevention of HIV. With Sunlenca, a true long-acting regimen is a reality. As awareness and familiarity of Sunlenca's every 6-months subcutaneous administration grow among health care providers, community groups and people living with and at risk of HIV, we believe Sunlenca is well positioned for the future.\nTurning to HCV on Slide 10. Sales for the fourth quarter were $439 million, up 12% year-over-year, reflecting timing of Department of Corrections or DOC purchases and favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S.\nQuarter-over-quarter, HCV sales were down 16%, primarily due to resolution of a rebate claim in Europe in the third quarter of 2022 that did not repeat as well as other pricing dynamics in the U.S., offset in part by timing of DOC purchases.\nGoing forward, we continue to expect new starts to decline, but are encouraged that our market share remains over 50% in both U.S. and Europe.\nSales of HPV and HDV for the fourth quarter were $255 million, as shown on Slide 11. Sales were down 4% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, primarily due to lower Vemlidy demand and pricing dynamics outside of the U.S.\nMoving to Biktarvy on Slide 12. Sales for the fourth quarter were $1 billion with a full year totaling $3.9 billion. It's clear that as the pandemic has evolved, Biktarvy's will in the treatment of COVID-19 has remained unchanged as a key part of the standard of care for hospitalized patients. In fact, Biktarvy is still the only antiviral approved in this setting. And in the U.S., Biktarvy continues to be used in over 50% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID-19. We're excited to continue to work on our oral COVID-19 nucleoside, which Merdad will discuss shortly.\nMoving to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy Slide 13. Sales of $195 million in the fourth quarter grew 65% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. For the full year, Trodelvy sales were $680 million, up 79% year-over-year. As we continue to broaden access to Trodelvy around the world, we're encouraged by the growing demand in existing markets. Trodelvy is now reimbursed across the major European markets. And in the U.S., demand was up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our growth rate almost doubled from the prior quarter, reflecting the solid contribution of our expanded field force and growing awareness.\nWe're also excited by the expected decision from the FDA later this month, which could expand Trodelvy's potentially clinically meaningful benefit into the pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer setting. We estimate this represents at least 6,000 addressable patients in the U.S., and our U.S. field force has just wrapped up its launch meeting and is energized for the upcoming approval.\nThe opportunity for Trodelvy to benefit patients with pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic disease is supported by the recent NCCN Category 1 preferred recommendation for Trodelvy based on the TROPiCS-02 data. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency recently validated our marketing authorization application for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative and we look forward to a decision later this year.\nNow on to Slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy sales in the fourth quarter were $419 million, up 75% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Full year, cell therapy sales were $1.5 billion, up 68% year-over-year. The growth in the fourth quarter and full year were driven by continued uptake of Yescarta in large B-cell lymphoma, notably in the U.S. Growing physician familiarity with Yescarta data and Kite's industry-leading manufacturing continue to be key growth drivers. Yescarta sales was $337 million, up 85% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 6% sequentially.\nWe're pleased to see not only strong momentum in second-line LBCL in the U.S. but also continued uptake in third-line LBCL in both the U.S. and across European markets. Yescarta sales were $82 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% quarter-over-quarter with growing volume demand in both mantle cell lymphoma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Year-over-year, Yescarta sales were up 44%.\nWe're pleased to see the building momentum of CAR T cell therapy as a treatment class with curative potential and Yescarta and Tecartus as the leading cell therapies of choice globally. More patients are getting access due to Kite's industry-leading reliable manufacturing capabilities and the team's expanding footprint of authorized treatment centers around the world.\nAnd just last week, U.K.'s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, recommended Yescarta for routine use in third-line large B-cell lymphoma. This makes Yescarta the first CAR T available for commissioning in England. Approvals and reimbursement into additional indications that are currently available in the U.S., the other markets is expected to continue over the next year.\nYescarta was recently approved for second-line LBCL in Japan, which has the potential to be the second largest cell therapy market outside of the U.S., and we look forward to the transfer of the marketing authorization to Gilead and Kite later this year.\nIn the interim, although it's still early days, we'll continue to work with our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, to make Yescarta available to approximately 7,000 patients in the second-line plus setting. Kite will begin manufacturing supply for the Japanese market through our El Segundo, California facility.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline. Merdad?\n\nMerdad V. Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Johanna. I'm pleased to be starting 2023 with all the momentum in 2022 behind us. With the positive data readouts for Trodelvy and domvanalimab and the recent approvals for lenacapavir, the team is really excited to progress our programs in 2023 and beyond.\nStarting with virology on Slide 16 and as I just mentioned, lenacapavir received its first U.S. FDA approval for people living with multidrug-resistant HIV in combination with other antiretrovirals. Marketed as Sunlenca, lenacapavir is the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous HIV treatment, bringing a much needed option for people living with multidrug-resistant HIV that until now have limited alternatives.\nCombined with the approval from the European Commission, the FDA approval is an important validation while we continue to progress our other lenacapavir-based treatment and prevention programs. For HIV treatment, we currently have 10 partner agents for lenacapavir in various stages of development, including 2 new integrase inhibitors or INSTIs in the pre-IND space. We expect to share data this year from the Phase Ib proof-of-concept study for lenacapavir in 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies, or bnAbs, directed at HIV. And in PrEP, our clinical development of lenacapavir as a monotherapy for HIV prevention continues to progress with 2 trials underway and 2 additional trials expected to achieve FPI in the second half of 2023.\nMoving to Slide 17. We continue to progress our novel oral nucleoside for COVID-19 GS-5245. Treatments such as Gilead Biktarvy and vaccinations have improved the outlook for patients with COVID-19, but there's still a significant need for effective and convenient oral treatment options.\nWe've been working with the FDA and other global regulators to launch a clinical development program that could enable global filings. We've initiated the Phase II BIRCH trial in high-risk patients, defined as unvaccinated patients with 1 or more risk factors, or vaccinated patients with 2 or more risk factors. The Phase III Oaktree trial will evaluate standard risk patients, which includes people aged 12 and older with no CDC-defined risk factors. We expect this trial to enroll its first patient in the U.S. in the first quarter, and we'll share progress when we can, which depends in part on the prevalence of COVID-19 near study sites.\nMoving to oncology on Slide 18 and starting with Trodelvy. We continue to build on the momentum of our TROPICS-02 data, and we announced the European Medicine Agency's validation of our marketing authorization application for pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in early January. As Johanna noted, we expect a regulatory decision of our sBLA in the U.S. later this month, and a decision in Europe in the latter part of the year. Trodelvy has already changed the standard of care for many patients with metastatic TNBC and advanced bladder cancer. And we expect that these regulatory approvals will be an important step forward in bringing this potentially practice-changing therapy to certain HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients.\nMoreover, recently presented data demonstrated Trodelvy's PFS and OS benefit was consistent across a range of tumor Trop-2 expression levels. This late-breaking post-hoc analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium was consistent with Trodelvy data in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, where baseline Trop-2 expression was not associated with treatment response.\nMoving on to Slide 19. We were pleased to share data from the fourth interim analysis of the ARC-7 trial with our partner, Arcus, in December as presented at the ASCO plenary session. ARC-7 is a randomized Phase II proof-of-concept study that enrolled 150 patients, the largest data set in anti-TIGIT studies released to date with more than 100 patients across the 2 dom containing arms. We are pleased to see both dom containing arms demonstrate clinically meaningful differentiation compared to Zim monotherapy across all efficacy measures evaluated, clearly establishing the addition of dombinilumab improved the clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in this population.\nWe are also encouraged by the consistency of the safety data in the dom-containing treatment arms which showed no unexpected safety signals. This is an ongoing trial, and we look forward to sharing updated data at ASCO 2023. While these efficacy and safety data will mature over time, this fourth interim analysis fully supports our joint dom's clinical development program and the importance of interrupting the TIGIT pathway.\nBased on the totality of the data seen to date, we're very confident that dom with an Fc silent design has the potential to be differentiated compared to other anti-TIGIT molecules in this space. The ongoing Phase III trials of dom added to anti-PD-1 treatment in non-small cell lung cancer will provide the opportunity to confirm this activity. We're moving very quickly with our partners in both proof-of-concept studies as well as late-stage trials, including the 4 ongoing Phase III trials.\nMoving to magrolimab, our anti-CD47 therapeutic on Slide 20. We have 3 ongoing pivotal trials and 6 proof-of-concept studies across 6 solid tumor indications. As we shared last month, the independent data monitoring committee met to review data from the first interim analysis from the ENHANCE study in first-line high-risk MDS. I'm pleased to share that there were no new safety signals, and the study continues unchanged.\nAs a reminder, based on previous discussions with the FDA, we are now pursuing mature OS data for filing. The study is powered for the final OS analysis and Gilead remains blinded to the data to preserve study integrity. We will update you again in the second half of 2023 after the second interim analysis, noting that these interim analyses are event-driven, so timing is provisional.\nMoving on to Slide 21. And on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share details of another strong quarter of clinical progress in our cell therapy programs. At ASH, Kite had more than 25 data presentations, further demonstrating the transformative impact of cell therapies, including 3-year follow-up data from ZUMA-5, showing that 52% of patients with indolent lymphomas treated with Yescarta continue to respond.\nFollowing the compelling ZUMA-12 data on Yescarta in frontline LBCL shared at ASH in 2021, we expect to achieve FPI in our Phase III ZUMA-23 trial in frontline high-risk LBCL in the first half of the year. We are also progressing our Phase II ZUMA-24 outpatient study in second-line LBCL and look forward to sharing interim safety data in the first half of this year. While there is still so much we can explore with the Yescarta and Tecartus, we are also building up the pipeline to ensure that Kite will extend its leadership into new indications and next-generation cell therapy technologies.\nIn December, we announced a strategic collaboration with Arcellx for the late-stage clinical product candidate, CART-ddBCMA, which is currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. If approved, together with our industry-leading manufacturing capabilities, we believe we can reliably and consistently deliver much needed therapy to patients.\nAdditionally, we announced the pending acquisition of Tmunity Therapeutics, which adds an armored CAR T platform and rapid manufacturing technology to Kite. The Arcellx transaction closed earlier this week, and Tmunity is expected to close later this quarter. Both highlight Kite's continued leadership in cell therapy and our commitment to building a robust and exciting pipeline in cell therapies.\nWrapping up on Slide 22. We are sharing the key pipeline milestones that we expect in 2023, which, as you can see, spans FPIs, data readouts, updates and regulatory approvals across oncology and urology. This highlights the progress that Gilead has made on its transformation journey with 59 clinical programs that are well diversified across indications and stage. As the clinical pipeline has grown, our focus on execution has intensified, and we look forward to updating you on our programs as we progress through 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Andy. Andy?\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, driven by Biktarvy, Veklury and oncology. For the full year, our sales, excluding Veklury, grew 8%, which is by far the strongest full year growth rate Gilead has reported since HCV sales peaked in 2015. Of note, and excluding the impact of the Atripla and Truvada LOEs, HIV grew 8% year-over-year, driven by continued strong performance of Biktarvy, which grew 20% from 2021 to $10.4 billion. Biktarvy continues to demonstrate strong potential for further growth in 2023 and beyond. Oncology full year revenues exceeded $2 billion for the first time and grew 71% from 2021.\nMoving to our quarterly results starting on Slide 24. The fourth quarter demonstrated another strong performance across our business. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 9% year-over-year despite an approximately $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude FX in addition to the impact of HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth for the fourth quarter was 12% compared with the prior year.\nMoving to Slide 25. Veklury was down, as expected, year-over-year although it grew 8% on a sequential basis from the third quarter, highlighting that Veklury will continue to play an important role even as COVID-19 progresses into its endemic phase.\nNon-GAAP product gross margin was 86.8%, up more than 16 percentage points from last year, primarily due to a $1.25 billion charge related to a legal settlement recorded in COGS in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 were $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period in 2021. Higher R&D expenses were driven by timing of clinical investments, mainly in oncology in addition to the impact of inflation on expenses.\nFourth quarter acquired IP R&D was $158 million, primarily reflecting the MacroGenics collaboration and the license amendment with Jounce. And lower than prior year due to the $625 million charge related to the exercise of opt-in rights for Arcus assets in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNon-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a charge of $406 million associated with the termination of the Trodelvy collaboration with Everest Medicines. This $406 million charge includes the $280 million that we agreed to pay Everest to acquire the development and commercial rights to Trodelvy in China and other Asian territories in addition to some other termination-related expenses. Excluding this Everest impact, SG&A was down 2% year-over-year.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 37%, down sequentially due to the factors referenced earlier, including the $406 million Everest charge and up year-over-year. Excluding the Everest charge, non-GAAP operating margin was 42%.\nNon-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 16.8%, lower than the prior year, driven by discrete tax charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOverall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.67 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Of note, the Everest contract termination impacted non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.25 a share. This was not reflected in the guidance we shared back in October.\nMoving to the full year on Slide 26. Total product sales were $27 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $23.1 billion, up 8% compared to 2021, primarily driven by Biktarvy and oncology. Excluding around $380 million of FX headwinds and the $350 million impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 11% as compared to 2021.\nI touched on the main P&L impacts in the overview, but will highlight on Slide 27 that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.26 per share compared to $7.18 per share reported in 2021.\nI'll move now to guidance on Slide 28. We recognize that the macro environment continues to be uncertain. Our initial 2023 guidance assumes an overall stable macro environment and relatively stable FX at current rates. While inflation is expected to moderate, our 2023 guidance reflects a full year of higher expenses experienced in 2022 associated with inflation. With that in mind, we expect total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.5 billion. For total product sales, excluding Veklury, we expect sales in the range of $24 billion to $24.5 billion, representing growth of 4% to 6% for our base business year-over-year.\nAnd we expect Veklury sales of approximately $2 billion. As always, Veklury sales will continue to track hospitalization rates and will remain highly variable depending on the frequency and severity of surges. Notably, we have seen a decline in hospitalization rates in recent weeks, and we'll continue to monitor the landscape carefully. As a result and similar to last year, we will update you on our Veklury expectations on a quarterly basis.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 86%, just slightly below our 2022 results and primarily reflecting the growing contribution from oncology. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to increase by a high single-digit percentage compared to 2022 levels, reflecting our ongoing investment in strategic areas of growth and an increase in activity from later-stage trials.\nAs a reminder, we had 8 Phase III trials started in 2022, and we expect to have 23 active Phase III trials by the end of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect R&D growth to moderate although we will step up investments as needed to support promising programs based on clinical data.\nAcquired IP R&D includes previously announced payments for Arcellx, Tmunity and milestone payments for existing collaborations. Consistent with our approach in 2022, we will continue to share our expected acquired IP R&D expenses as we announced additional transactions.\nFinally, we expect SG&A to decrease by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2022. However, this is primarily due to some expenses reported in 2022 that we don't expect to repeat in 2023. If we normalize the 2022 SG&A expense for these items, we expect full year 2023 SG&A expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage on a basis of approximately $5.1 billion in 2022. Altogether, we expect our non-GAAP operating income for 2023 to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% again this year.\nAnd finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.60 and $7 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.30 and $5.70 per share.\nMoving to capital allocation on Slide 29. Our priorities have not changed. In 2022, we returned over $5 billion to shareholders. This included dividend payments and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchases were approximately $800 million.\nFor 2023, we have announced today a 2.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.75 per share and remain committed to growing our dividend over time in line with earnings growth. You can also expect to see continued judicious investments in our business, both internally and externally through select partnerships and business development transactions. Finally, we will continue to use share repurchases to offset equity dilution as well as additional repurchases on an opportunistic basis.\nWith that, I'll invite the operator to open the call up for questions.",

My name is Amber, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to our host, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Jacquie, please proceed.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of IR, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter of 2022. The press release slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of KITE.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to Gilead's business financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release and our supplemental data sheet, as well as on the Gilead website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to connect with all of you today to share the details of another very strong quarter. Thanks to strong commercial and clinical execution by our teams, the positive momentum continues to build.\nTotal product sales, excluding Veklury were $6.1 billion, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. The total, including Veklury, was $7 billion. If we exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the tail end of the loss of exclusivity for Truvada and Atripla and HIV, total product sales excluding Veklury grew 15% from the third quarter of last year. The majority of this growth was driven by HIV, and over 40% of the $620 million increase in sales came from oncology.\nThe team will share more details, but this has been a great quarter for commercial execution, including continued share gains for Biktarvy, growing momentum for Trodelvy, another impressive quarter for cell therapy and a strong quarter for Veklury. We also saw continued clinical momentum this quarter. Some of the highlights include the FDA priority review granted to Trodelvy for late-line HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, the EU approvals for Yescarta for second-line relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma; and Tecartus in adult acute lymphoblastic lymphoma.\nAnd in virology, lenacapavir received its first regulatory approval in Europe. Marketed as Sunlenca, it is approved for heavily treatment-experienced people living with multidrug-resistant HIV, making it the first approved casted inhibitor and the first therapy with a 6-month dosing schedule for HIV treatment.\nWe are taking multiple important steps to advance our ambitious clinical pipeline; including, in oncology, we are expanding our lung program with 8 trials now active and 3 more planned to start in the coming months. We plan to resume our Phase II trial investigating a once-weekly oral combination of Merck's Islatravir and our Lenacapavir. This will be one of many ongoing combination studies we have for long-acting HIV treatment in addition to our extensive program for prevention.\nAnd we continue to further strengthen our early-stage portfolio, adding a BTLA agonist for inflammation from MiroBio and an option for a bispecific antibody for oncology for MacroGenics.\nMoving to our clinical goals for 2022 on Slide 5. We're on track to start the 2 remaining Phase III trials, namely EVOKE-03 for first-line non-small cell lung cancer and ZUMA-23 for first-line high-risk LBCL. We continue to expect another interim readout for the Phase II R7 study in first-line non-small cell lung cancer before the end of the year.\nOverall, this has been another very strong quarter and a very strong year for Gilead. We're seeing impressive growth of our base business with continued share gains for Biktarvy and excellent performance for cell therapy, and growing demand for Trodelvy. On the clinical side, we've had the first approval for lenacapavir, a foundational asset for the future of our HIV franchise.\nTrodelvy is now in a priority review for HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the U.S., and we're executing on an extensive development program across virology, oncology and inflammation. Finally, the recent TAF settlement is expected to significantly extend the exclusivity of key components of our HIV franchise in the U.S.\nI'd like to take this opportunity to thank the Gilead and KITE teams for their outstanding clinical and commercial execution. This consistent execution of our strategy, along with a very robust portfolio, has led to some terrific progress in 2022, and we look forward to building on that momentum through the rest of the year and beyond.\nWith that, I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our third quarter commercial performance.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone.\nBefore I jump into the commercial results for the third quarter, I wanted to begin by acknowledging our team for another exceptional quarter. We're making important progress in our goals of ensuring the strength and sustainability of our virology franchise while also continuing to build our expertise and market presence in oncology.\nTurning to Slide 7. We had a very strong quarter with total product sales, excluding Veklury of $6.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year or 15% excluding FX and the residual impact of the HIV LOEs, with growth in each of our core franchise areas and notable strength in HIV and oncology. Sequentially, total product sales, excluding Veklury grew 6%, driven by HIV, HCV and oncology. Growth excluding FX impact and the LOEs was 8%.\nOn Slide 8, HIV sales of $4.5 billion were up 7% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of both FX and the LOEs, HIV revenue grew 10% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, this was primarily channel mix-driven by U.S. government utilization leading to higher average realized price in addition to higher demand. Overall, despite the quarter-over-quarter shift in average realized price, government plans continue to represent approximately 60% of our U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions, including Medicare in the low 20s.\nHIV revenue growth was driven by the U.S. while Europe was down year-over-year due to FX and less favorable pricing dynamics, offset in part by higher demand. Quarter-over-quarter, HIV sales were up 6%, similarly driven by channel mix and inventory dynamics as well as higher demand.\nTurning to the market more broadly. We are encouraged that on a year-over-year basis, the HIV treatment market across the U.S. and Europe has grown for 5 consecutive quarters. This reflects the work we have been doing with our partners to bring people living with HIV and people at risk of HIV back into care following the pandemic. The market growth we are seeing suggests that activity has returned to pre-COVID trends.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the market grew 2% year-over-year, both in the U.S. and Europe. Looking forward, we continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range.\nDescovy sales were $500 million, up 16% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, and perhaps market share remains stable despite generic and other entrants. For the quarter, the PrEP market continues to demonstrate robust growth largely driven by the growing awareness for PrEP and demand well above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, the PrEP market grew 19% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.\nOn to Slide 9. Third quarter Biktarvy sales were $2.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year, driven by higher demand in both the U.S. and Europe and favorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, sales were up 8% due to higher demand as well as favorable inventory and pricing dynamics. Once again, Biktarvy continues to command a leading position in the treatment of HIV with another record quarter growing to 45% market share in the U.S., up 4 percentage points year-over-year. Moreover, Biktarvy remains the leading medicine for those seeking to switch to a new regimen in the U.S. as well as those starting treatment in both the U.S. and Europe, most notably, capturing 10 new starts for every 1 person prescribed another medicine in the U.S.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, I'd like to call out a few points. First, given the historic trend towards a significant inventory build in the fourth quarter followed by inventory drawdown in the first quarter, we are renewing our focus on inventory management in an effort to better align the timing of product delivery with end user demand.\nSecond, while we continue to see strong market share gains for Biktarvy in addition to solid growth in both the treatment and prevention market, we will remind you that some of our second and third quarter performance has been driven by shifts in channel mix that have had a favorable impact on average realized price. Given the favorable trends we observed over the last 2 quarters, we do expect the channel mix to be more stable in the fourth quarter.\nWith these factors in mind and also allowing for further FX impact, we expect fourth quarter HIV sales to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, noting that full year 2022 HIV growth is therefore expected to be approximately 4% or 7% excluding the LOEs and FX headwinds year-to-date.\nIn summary, we're extremely proud of the portfolio we have built in HIV and excited about the way Gilead is positioned for 2023 and beyond. Specifically, the Biktarvy's clinical profile continues to impress, evidenced by ongoing strong growth rates, even though its annual revenue run rate is now in excess of $10 billion. Descovy for PrEP maintained over 40% market share despite competition and generic entrants. And most recently, lenacapavir approval as Sunlenca for heavily treatment-experienced people living with multidrug-resistant HIV in the EU.\nThis is an important option for a group that has very few treatment options and is a great opportunity for physicians and the HIV community to get more familiar with a 6 monthly subcutaneous HIV therapy. We believe this sets the stage well for our other planned lenacapavir-based treatment and prevention regimens.\nAll of this, combined with the treatment and prevention market showing solid recovery, the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla now behind us and the recent task settlement extending projected U.S. LOEs for Descovy and into the early 2030s and Genvoya's patent to 2029 in the U.S. All of this truly underpins our confidence that Gilead is well positioned for growth and continued leadership in the HIV market.\nNow on to Slide 10. HCV sales for the third quarter were $524 million, up 22% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a prior year rebate claim in Europe and other favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Offsetting these benefits, there were fewer patient starts in both the U.S. and Europe, consistent with our expectations for both the quarter and the general trend that you should expect in HCV going forward.\nDespite the trend in patients start, we're pleased to maintain HCV market share of more than 50% in both the U.S. and Europe and third quarter share increased on a year-over-year basis. For HBV and HDV on Slide 11, sales were up 7% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by favorable inventory dynamics.\nMoving to Veklury on Slide 12. Third quarter revenues were $925 million. As expected, sales were down year-over-year, given lower U.S. hospitalizations as compared to the same period last year. Indeed, though hospitalizations are below the peak seen at the start of the year, it's clear with the sequential increase that the path of the pandemic remains difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we're proud of the role Veklury continues to play in the fight against COVID-19.\nIn the U.S., Veklury is used in approximately 60% of hospitalized patients who are being treated for COVID. Now outside the U.S., Veklury's benefit to patients continues to be recognized by health authorities, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency based in part on the Pine Trees data, which demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization after 3-day IV treatment in the outpatient setting. These factors continue to support the clear utilization where it's needed.\nMoving to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13. Sales of $180 million grew 78% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to work with regulators, payers and clinicians around the world to broaden access. Since its approval in second-line metastatic TNBC late last year in Europe, Trodelvy is now reimbursed in 13 countries outside the U.S. with additional markets in Europe and elsewhere expected to come online shortly.\nWe've also begun work on establishing the right infrastructure to support a potential launch into pretreated HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, reinforcing the significant unmet need in this population and the clinically meaningful overall survival data demonstrated in the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study. FDA has accepted our supplemental biologics license application as priority review, and we look to a decision in February of next year. We're excited by the potential for many more patients to benefit from Trodelvy.\nNow on to Slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the KITE team, I'm pleased to share that cell therapy sales in the third quarter were $398 million, up 79% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. These strong results were driven by continued growth in large B-cell lymphoma and KITE's ability to reliably meet customer demand. Together with our recently FDA-approved viral vector manufacturing facility in Oceanside, KITE remains well-positioned to ensure clinical and commercial supply availability, while it continues to execute on its geographic expansion.\nFor the quarter, Yescarta sales of $317 million were up 81% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter, driven by a continued successful launch in second-line LBCL in the U.S. and partially offset by FX headwinds in Europe. Just last week, Yescarta was approved in the EU for second-line LBCL, and we look forward to launching there in the months ahead. Tecartus grew 72% year-over-year to deliver $81 million in sales, driven by growth in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In early September, the European marketing authorization for Tecartus in relapsed or refractory ALL was granted.\nWe continue to broaden awareness and access to our cell therapy through indication and authorized treatment center expansion in existing markets as well as through geographic expansion, as demonstrated by our most recent regulatory applications in Brazil, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. As always, Christi is available for Q&A later on the call.\nOverall, this was an incredibly strong quarter for Gilead Oncology with revenue of $578 million, up 10% from last quarter and 79% from last year. This represents an almost $2.4 billion annual run rate as we move into the last few months of 2022 and hint that the possibilities ahead as we continue to execute on our commercial and clinical oncology goals.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\n\nMerdad V. Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Johanna. Before I start, I'd like to recognize the strong execution of our internal team and external partners across a broad range of activities that's diversified across therapeutic area and clinical stage with milestones spanning study initiations, the sBLA submission for Trodelvy, 2 EC approvals in cell therapy and our first approval for lenacapavir in the EU.\nOn Slide 16, you can see that we've made a lot of progress so far this year, meeting nearly all of our milestones. Regarding our BLA filing for Hepcludex, we received a complete response letter from the FDA, citing concerns about the manufacture and delivery of Hepcludex. We will take the time to fully digest the CRL, but note that no new safety or efficacy clinical trials were requested by the FDA. We plan to resubmit as quickly as possible, and we'll work with the agency on the path forward. We remain confident in Bulevirtide and the potential benefits it can bring to people living with HDV, and we'll share an update on the U.S. regulatory pathway when we can.\nMoving on to HIV on Slide 17. We're thrilled that lenacapavir received its first marketing authorization from the European Commission as Sunlenca for people living with multidrug-resistant HIV in combination with other antiretrovirals. Sunlenca is a first-in-class capsid inhibitor. It's the first and only twice yearly subcutaneous HIV treatment and as a much-needed option for those people living with HIV with limited alternatives.\nWe continue to expect a decision on our NDA from lenacapavir from FDA in late December of this year. In the meantime, this first regulatory approval from the EC is an important validation while we continue to progress our other lenacapavir-based treatment and prevention programs.\nFor HIV treatment, a new clinical development plan, allowing a lower dose of islatravir, Merck's investigational NRTTI is moving forward after FDA review. As such, we're planning to resume the Phase II trial investigating oral once-weekly lenacapavir and islatravir combination.\nOur internal combination programs are also ongoing and we expect to share data next year from the Phase Ib proof-of-concept study for lenacapavir in 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies or bNAb, directed at HIV. In prevention, our clinical development continues to progress with 4 in process or planned clinical trials evaluating every 6-month subcutaneous lenacapavir.\nMoving to Slide 18. Veklury continues to be recognized as the standard of care for patients with severe COVID-19 with updated guidelines for Veklury from the World Health Organization. Additionally, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on the use of Veklury for the treatment of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Although novel treatments and vaccinations have improved the COVID-19 outlook, there is a continued need for effective and convenient oral treatment options for patients. I'm pleased to share that the FDA has just granted our novel oral nucleoside GS-5245 Fast Track designation which aims to expedite development of promising new medicines. We continue to be in active discussions with the FDA and other global regulators on potential clinical pathways, including a Phase III study that we expect to start within the next several months, either globally or outside the U.S.\nOn Slide 19, we show the Phase III TROPiCS-02 results in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. It was a late breaking presentation at ESMO in September. Trodelvy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 3.2-month overall survival benefit. Patients with metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer who progressed on endocrine-based therapies in chemotherapy have limited options. As a reminder, the patients enrolled in TROPiCS-02 were heavily pretreated with a meeting of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens in addition to prior CDK4/6 inhibitors.\nImportantly, the FDA recently accepted our sBLA for Trodelvy in HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and granted it a priority review. The PDUFA date is currently set for February 2023. We continue to work with regulatory agencies outside the U.S. to potentially make this medicine available to eligible patients. Additionally, following the acquisition of Trodelvy's Asian commercialization and development rights from Everest Medicines, we expect data from our Phase III metastatic TNBC China bridging trial in the next few months and our Phase III HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer study in mid-2023.\nMoving to lung cancer on Slide 20. You can see that we expect to have at least 9 active clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer by the end of 2022, including 5 with Trodelvy, as well as programs with Zimberelimab and Domvanalimab and Etruma; Merck's KEYTRUDA; AstraZeneca's Durvalumab and our own magrolimab. 8 trials are already underway, including the Phase III EVOKE-01 study and second to third line non-small cell lung cancer and our Phase II EVOKE-02 study in first-line non-small cell lung cancer without actionable mutations.\nOur partner, Merck, also plans to initiate the Phase III EVOKE-03 study later this year to evaluate the combination of Trodelvy and KEYTRUDA in first-line patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1. Additionally, with our partner, Arcus, we're looking forward to the fourth interim analysis of the Phase II ARC-7 trial, evaluating ZIM and DOM in PD-L1 high non-small cell lung cancer before the end of the year. Data from ARC-7 are expected to support our ongoing Phase III studies for DOM-based combinations in lung cancer, including STAR-121, which just achieved first patient in.\nLung cancer is a disease area with high unmet need, and we believe we have multiple promising MOAs and potential combinations that could help bring additional new treatment options to patients. To explore these opportunities, we plan to initiate 2 Phase II signal-seeking platform studies, VELOCITY and the Arcus led Edge 1 in the coming months. Overall, we have initiated a comprehensive evaluation of the assets in our portfolio to address the significant unmet need in lung cancer and look forward to sharing updates in the coming years.\nMoving to Slide 21. And on behalf of Christi and the KITE team, we're highlighting our expanding clinical pipeline as we build on the growing momentum and adoption of cell therapy based on the significant survival benefit that Yescarta and Tecartus are delivering to patients. We believe there are still opportunities to bring Yescarta and Tecartus to more patients by moving into earlier lines as well as new indications. As you can see, we have recently enrolled patients in several studies, including ZUMA-24, a Phase II study to evaluate Yescarta in an outpatient setting for second-line LBCL and ZUMA-22, a Phase III study for Yescarta in second-line plus high-risk follicular lymphoma.\nWe also expect to begin screening for patients for the ZUMA-23 study of Yescarta in Q4. The decision to initiate a Phase III trial in first-line HR LBCL was based on the encouraging data from ZUMA-12 where Yescarta demonstrated 89% ORR and 78% CR.\nAdditional studies include an evaluation of Tecartus in rare B-cell malignancies and KITE 363 is evaluating a CD19/20 bicistronic CAR-T in post-CD19 third line plus LBCL. We're committed to continuously improving the safety and efficacy of our cell therapies through both internal pipeline and external partnerships.\nOn Slide 22, we turn to hematology and highlight the breadth of our programs across MDS and AML. For magrolimab, we fully enrolled our Phase III ENHANCE study in MDS ahead of schedule. Our discussions with the FDA and other regulators continue, and we expect to share an update in early 2023. Moreover, enrollment for the 2 AML trials, ENHANCE-2 and 3 is well underway, and we're targeting top line data in 2024.\nA few weeks ago, we announced our oncology collaboration with MacroGenics to develop bispecific antibodies. This includes the exclusive option to license MGD024, a bispecific antibody that binds to CD123 and CD3, currently in Phase I, as well as 2 additional research programs. This complements magrolimab and furthers our work as we explore therapies that could translate into better clinical outcomes for patients with AML and MDS.\nFinally, we were pleased that FDA granted KITE-222 orphan drug designation at the end of September. It's the first CLL1 targeted CAR-T and is currently enrolling patients in a Phase I study.\nOn Slide 23, I want to take a moment to welcome MiroBio to Gilead. We completed the acquisition a few weeks ago and pleased to add the MiroBio team to the Gilead Research family and bring their proprietary discovery platform an immune inhibitory receptor agonist to our portfolio. This acquisition complements our inflammatory disease cornerstones, including IBD, RA and systemic lupus and opens opportunities in other indications. We're excited to continue to explore and develop these antibody agonists, which we believe have the potential to induce immunosuppressive signaling and restore tolerance in autoimmunity.\nWrapping up, I'll note that we now have 60 clinical programs underway here at Gilead, spanning a broad range of indications across virology, oncology and inflammation. We've accomplished a lot in 2022 and yet feel we're really just getting started in exploring the possibilities offered by our portfolio.\nWith that, Andy?\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe are pleased to share another strong quarter of results, with sequential and year-over-year growth in every franchise across our core business. As shown on Slide 25, product sales, excluding Veklury, grew 11% year-over-year despite a $130 million headwind from FX. If we exclude this FX impact, in addition to the impact of previous HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year-over-year was 15%.\nMoving to Slide 26. You can see that Veklury was down as expected year-over-year, although it more than doubled on a sequential basis from the second quarter. I'll note that with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the total FX impact on revenue, net of hedges, was higher than expected at approximately $200 million compared to the third quarter of last year.\nNon-GAAP product gross margin was 87%, down 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the third quarter 2021 reversal of a previously recorded litigation reserve. Additionally, non-GAAP product gross margin was impacted by higher Biktarvy-related royalty expense and lower Veklury sales. Non-GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially due to higher HIV and Veklury product sales. Non-GAAP R&D, excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was $1.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year primarily due to investments in oncology. Sequentially, R&D excluding acquired IPR&D expenses was up 6%, driven by investments in oncology and COVID treatments. Acquired IPR&D, reflecting acquisitions milestones and upfront payments for the quarter was $448 million and includes $389 million of expense related to the MiroBio acquisition.\nNon-GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 47%, down year-over-year and driven primarily by higher acquired IPR&D expenses and lower Veklury sales. Sequentially, non-GAAP operating margin increased 400 basis points due to higher HIV and Veklury sales, partially offset by higher acquired IPR&D expenses. Non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 22.4%, higher than normal due to the nondeductibility of the upfront MiroBio payment. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.90 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $2.65 for the same period last year. Of note, the MiroBio transaction impacted post-tax EPS by $0.31 a share and this was not reflected in the full year guidance we shared back in August.\nOn Slide 27, we take a quick look at our performance year-to-date, which shows total product sales, excluding Veklury at $16.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. If we exclude the approximately $385 million of FX headwinds year-to-date as compared to the same period last year, in addition to the impact of the HIV LOEs, the underlying growth year-to-date is 11%. Veklury, as expected, is down year-to-date highlighting the lower demand for COVID-19 treatment in this stage of the pandemic.\nMoving to Slide 28. We are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and our expectations for Q4, including our latest view of FX. For revenues, we now expect total product sales of $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion, up from our previous range of $24.5 billion to $25 billion. This reflects the strong performance year-to-date, notably very strong growth in HIV, Veklury in cell therapy and incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment, including FX, which will once again be a headwind in the fourth quarter.\nIn HIV, as Johanna discussed, we expect HIV revenue in Q4 to be roughly flat on a sequential basis. In cell therapy, we expect slower growth on a sequential basis, primarily due to stabilizing demand following the second-line LBCL launch and FX headwinds. Additionally, we are taking a cautious view with regards to both the current shortage of fludarabine, which we expect to be partially mitigated later in the fourth quarter, and the competitive landscape as our peers improve their manufacturing reliability.\nMoving to Veklury. And with year-to-date revenue of $2.9 billion, we are increasing our expectations to approximately $3.4 billion for the full year. Note that we expect Veklury sales to continue to track hospitalization rates, and our guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from the third quarter levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion, representing growth of 5% to 6% year-over-year compared to our prior range of $22 billion to $22.5 billion.\nAs for the rest of the non-GAAP P&L, product gross margin is now expected to be in the 86% to 87% range compared to our prior guidance of approximately 85% to 86%. There is no change to our R&D guidance, where we expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion.\nMoving to acquired IPR&D, we are not issuing guidance for the full year. And similar to what we did with MiroBio this quarter, we'll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we've included here is the year-to-date acquired IPR&D amount, including approximately $0.04 per share associated with the MacroGenics collaboration that we announced last week. The guidance shared today does not include any upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might close in the fourth quarter.\nFor SG&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we continue to expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion for the full year, up from $11 billion to $11.6 billion previously.\nAnd finally, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.95 to $7.15 per share, up from $6.35 to $6.75 previously. This EPS guidance range is approaching our 2021 non-GAAP EPS results despite an expected $2.2 billion decline in Veklury revenue and a more than $0.5 billion in total FX headwinds anticipated through the end of the year as compared to 2021 rates.\nThis highlights the strength of our core business, which is now expected to grow in the 5% to 6% range in 2022. On a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $3.35 and $3.55 per share compared to $2.90 and $3.30 per share previously.\nFinally, on Slide 29, you can see that there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $928 million in dividend payments and $180 million in share repurchases. As we announced previously, we repaid $1 billion of debt early in the third quarter and have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition.\nWith that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.",

Welcome to Gilead Sciences Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Jacquie Ross, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of IR, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2022. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.\nThe speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business; financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations; financial projections and use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We really appreciate you joining today. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results, which highlighted a quarter of strong commercial and clinical execution. This was a very strong quarter for our business, delivering revenue of USD 6.1 billion. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 7% year-over-year.\nIf we look at the underlying business and also exclude the impact of the HIV LOEs and the currency headwinds in the second quarter, growth was actually 11%. Our HIV portfolio continues to deliver, and this quarter was no exception with higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Biktarvy sales grew by 28% year-over-year, and we expect to see continued market growth for treatment and prevention with the ongoing market recovery.\nThis was a record quarter for our oncology business. Revenues topped $0.5 billion for the first time with a strong contribution from Trodelvy and a standout performance by our cell therapies. Yescarta was approved by the FDA for second-line relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma in April. This increased awareness and go demand not only for Yescarta's second-line patients but also for those in later lines of treatment. Yescarta is a potentially curative therapy, and Kite has uniquely and effectively scaled manufacturing to meet the needs of patients through the benefit.\nTurning to our clinical progress. Our NDA submission has been accepted by the FDA for lenacapavir for heavily treatment-experienced people living with HIV, and we are now expecting the decision in late December. If approved, lenacapavir will be the first approved capsid inhibitor and the first therapy with a 6-month dosing schedule for HIV treatment.\nMoving to Trodelvy. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding a potential regulatory pathway for late-stage hormone-receptor-positive HER2-negative patients, and we will update you as things progress. We have also begun screening patients in a ASCENT-03 and ASCENT-04 evaluating Trodelvy in the first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients. We dosed the first patient in our new Phase II study evaluating Trodelvy in non-small cell lung cancer, EVOKE-02. And earlier this month, we dosed the first patient in a new Trodelvy combination arm in our ongoing magrolimab triple-negative breast cancer study.\nAlso from magrolimab, we are targeting an interim analysis no later than early 2023 for ENHANCE, our Phase III study in first-line, high-risk MDS. Additionally, we dosed the first patient for ENHANCE-3, a Phase III magrolimab study for first-line unfit AML.\nMoving to Slide 5. Later this year, we expect to initiate an additional 5 studies for Trodelvy in a mix of monotherapy and combination studies. We also plan to start enrolling patients in 3 cell therapy trials and 2 domvanalimab combination trials. The extent of existing and planned studies really highlights the scale of our ambitious oncology program.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank the teams across Gilead and Kite for a terrific quarter of commercial execution and for the continued momentum in our clinical programs to continue to lay the critical groundwork for Gilead's future success.\nWith that, I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our second quarter commercial performance.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. We had a very strong second quarter with total product sales excluding Veklury of $5.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by HIV, cell therapy and Trodelvy and offset in part by HCV. Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 14%, driven by the seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics we see coming out of the first quarter of every year, primarily in our HIV business, as well as higher demand across our total portfolio.\nOn Slide 8, HIV sales were up 7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, primarily driven by channel mix associated with lower government utilization, leading to a higher average realized price as well as higher demand for both treatment and PrEP. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla, HIV sales increased 11%.\nQuarter-over-quarter, HIV sales were up 14% due to demand and channel mix, leading to higher average realized price as well as the favorable seasonal inventory dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. Year-over-year, the HIV treatment market grew over 4% in the U.S. and was largely flat in Europe but sequentially grew over 2% in the U.S. and 1% in Europe. We're encouraged to see the market recovering and on a year-on-year basis, continue to expect annual treatment market growth in the 2% to 3% range.\nDescovy sales in the second quarter were $460 million, up 6% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. We're pleased to see continued PrEP market growth with broader awareness and market volumes that are well above pre-pandemic levels. For the quarter, the overall market growth was up 25% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, highlighting both robust recovery and growing adoption of PrEP.\nDespite generic and other market participants, Descovy share in PrEP is holding in the mid-40% range. As awareness continues to grow and the overall market expands, we expect Descovy to continue to play an important role in PrEP and really look forward to adding lenacapavir as a potential long-acting alternative for those seeking preventative care as early as 2025.\nOn to Slide 9. Biktarvy grew 28% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, primarily driven by strong demand and channel mix. Biktarvy's market share in the U.S. grew from 40% in Q2 of last year to 44% in the second quarter of 2022 and continued by a wide margin to be the leading treatment for HIV as well as the fastest growing. In fact, Biktarvy's differentiated clinical profile was once again reinforced this past weekend at the International AIDS Conference in Montreal.\nAt 5 years, Biktarvy had 0 cases of treatment failure due to resistance as well as sustained efficacy and a demonstrated safety profile in people living with HIV. Notably, this 5-year trial duration demonstrating 0 cases of resistance is unprecedented for an HIV regimen. Share also increased sequentially, up 1% from the first quarter of 2022, contributing to 19% growth in Biktarvy revenue quarter-over-quarter in addition to the channel mix and the seasonal inventory dynamics we referenced earlier.\nMoving to Slide 10. HCV sales in the quarter were down 18% year-over-year due to the channel mix leading to lower average realized price and fewer patient starts, partially offset by higher volume in Eastern Europe. Sequentially, HCV was up 12%, driven by the timing of a large order in addition to higher patient start. Overall in HCV, we maintained steady market share of 50% to 60% both in the U.S. as well as Europe.\nFor HBV and HDV on Slide 11, sales were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable adjustments associated with the recent volume-based procurement updates in China and offset by higher year-over-year demand and volume growth in all other regions.\nVeklury revenues in the second quarter were $445 million, as shown on Slide 12. As expected, sales declined both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as hospitalization rates declined in most geographies. Additionally, U.S. revenue reflected inventory drawdown in the second quarter.\nWhile COVID-19 is still prevalent, the most recent subvariants have been less severe and contributed to pure hospitalized patients, although roughly 60% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are being treated in the U.S. are receiving Veklury.\nWe continue to be committed to supporting patients with COVID-19 globally. Last month, we signed our second joint procurement agreement with the European Commission that enables participating countries to purchase Veklury for a period of up to 18 months. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a positive opinion recommending Veklury received full marketing authorization for the treatment of appropriate patients with COVID-19. This builds on our prior conditional authorization, and we look forward to the final decision by the European Commission later this year.\nWe're proud of our track record of meeting global demand for Veklury since the fall of 2020, and we'll maintain a readiness to supply Veklury where it's needed and have increased our full year guidance to reflect anticipated patient need in the second half.\nTurning to oncology and beginning with Trodelvy on Slide 13. Sales of $159 million grew 79% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially, Trodelvy grew 41% outside of the U.S. with particularly strong growth in Germany and France due to increased awareness and adoption. Sequential 7% volume growth in the U.S. was offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics. We expect to see continued growth in the second half, driven by the impact of our expanded sales force in the U.S. as well as reimbursement approvals in the EU.\nWe're committed to broadening access for Trodelvy and continue to work with regulators and payers around the world. We're pleased with the recent decisions by both NCCN in the U.S. and NICE in the U.K., recognizing the significant clinical benefit of Trodelvy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on the Phase III ASCENT trial. These decisions add to the building support for Trodelvy's use following positive health technology assessments in a number of other countries.\nTrodelvy is the first ADC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in this metastatic TNBC patient population. In fact, the NCCN guidelines elevated Trodelvy to a Category 1 recommendation for second-line and later metastatic TNBC, its highest recommendation available. Additionally, while Trodelvy is not approved by the FDA for use in HR-positive/HER2-negative setting, we're pleased that the NCCN has issued a Category 2A recommendation for Trodelvy's use for these patients with advanced disease.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to share some incredibly strong results on behalf of Christi and the Kite team. Cell therapy sales for the second quarter were $368 million, up 68% year-over-year and 34% sequentially, driven by a very strong U.S. second-line launch for Yescarta in relapsed/refractory LBCL, which exceeded our expectations and continued strong growth in third-line plus Yescarta. As a reminder, strong data and an NCCN recommendation, which predated the second-line approval, helped drive our impressive early uptake, especially in large volume authorized treatment centers with a high familiarity with CAR T therapies.\nAdditionally, Yescarta second-line LBCL is already available in 2 other large markets: in France through the early access program and in Germany through reimbursement decisions ahead of approval. The decision on Yescarta second-line LBCL approval in Europe is expected later this fall.\nThird-line plus LBCL deliveries also increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growing overall awareness and confidence in the use of Yescarta. This follows the presentation of 5-year ZUMA-1 data at last year's American Society of Hematology meeting and more recently, our second-line approval in the U.S.\nFor the quarter overall, Yescarta sales of $295 million were up 66% year-over-year and 40% sequentially. Of note, Yescarta deliveries increased 67% year-over-year and 39% sequentially, demonstrating the effectiveness of Kite's manufacturing expansion strategy and our ability to meet demand for our cell therapies. We're proud of our reputation for consistent and reliable deliveries that further differentiates Kite's cell therapies and was a continued source of strength in Q2. While we saw very strong demand in the first half of 2022, we expect this growth to normalize in Q3 as second-line usage expand beyond the early adopters and more towards community referrals.\nTurning to Tecartus. Sales for the quarter were $73 million, up 78% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by continued demand and expansion into new geographies for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma as well as uptake in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. Christi is available for Q&A later on the call. In summary, this was a really strong quarter for the entire Gilead and Kite commercial organization.\nAnd so with that, I'll hand the call over to Merdad for an update on our pipeline.\n\nMerdad V. Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Johanna. From a clinical perspective, we made solid progress in the second quarter, including a wealth of data updates spanning our oncology and virology portfolios.\nStarting with HIV on Slide 16. We're very pleased to share that our NDA submission for lenacapavir for heavily treatment-experienced people living with HIV was accepted last week, and we now have a PDUFA date set for the end of December. Outside the U.S., we received a positive CHMP opinion for this indication based on data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA trial. Week 26 data from this trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May with updated 1-year data presented at the conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections earlier this year.\nIn this very difficult-to-treat population, 83% to 86% of those treated with lenacapavir achieved biologic expression at 1 year, sustaining the rates achieved at week 26. We continue to expect a decision from the European Commission later this year.\nLooking to Trodelvy on Slide 17. We shared new data at ASCO that increases our confidence in Trodelvy's potential applicability across a broad range of tumor types. These positive data from the Phase III ASCENT study reinforced Trodelvy's survival and health-related quality-of-life benefit over treatment of physician's choice in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\nWe also highlighted positive PFS and quality-of-life data from our Phase III TROPiCS-02 study, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in late-line, endocrine-resistant patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who had received a median of 3 prior lines of treatment in the metastatic setting after having failed hormone therapy. This study also demonstrated a positive trend in overall survival at the first interim analysis.\nThe TROPiCS-02 data, coupled with the NCCN recommendation, support Trodelvy's potential as a treatment option for late-line HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. As Dan mentioned, our discussions with the FDA are ongoing on the potential regulatory path, and we'll update you when we can. In the meantime, TROPiCS-02 continues with patients being followed for subsequent planned OS analyses.\nSeparately, we continue to expand our Trodelvy clinical program. We began screening for patients in ASCENT-03, evaluating Trodelvy in first-line metastatic TNBC patients who have PD-L1 negative tumors as well as in the ASCENT-04 study evaluating first-line patients with PD-L1 positive metastatic TNBC.\nMoving to Trodelvy in bladder cancer. The ongoing Phase III TROPiCS-04 study is our confirmatory trial designed to enable global registration for Trodelvy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. This study follows an encouraging data -- the encouraging data from TROPHY U-01, supporting accelerated approval of Trodelvy in the U.S. for patients with MUC. Pending results from our first-line expansion cohorts in the Phase II TROPHY U-01 study, we plan to open 2 Phase III studies in frontline MUC.\nIn our Trodelvy 1 program, we initiated the Phase II EVOKE-02 non-small cell lung cancer study in the second quarter, evaluating the combination of Trodelvy with Merck's KEYTRUDA in patients without actionable genomic mutations. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect to begin enrolling patients with the Phase III EVOKE-03 or KEYNOTE-D46 study in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression levels greater than equal to 50% in collaboration with our partners at Merck. Additionally, later this year, we expect to initiate several other Trodelvy combinations, including evaluating Trodelvy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\nMoving to magrolimab on Slide 18. We're pleased that both divisions of the FDA have now lifted the partial clinical hold on magrolimab. All magrolimab programs have resumed enrolling patients without FDA requiring any additional protocol changes. Our confidence in magrolimab's potential efficacy and safety profile is unchanged.\nAt ASCO, we shared MDS and AML data from our Phase Ib study when magrolimab continues to demonstrate high and durable response rates in high-risk MDS with encouraging complete response rate of 33% compared with the historical rates of azacitidine alone. We also observed promising efficacy in patients with TP53 mutant AML with an ORR of 49% and a CR of 33%. Notably, our Phase III study in frontline HR MDS ENHANCE has been rolling nicely, and we expect the interim analysis no later than early 2023.\nMoving to cell therapy on Slide 19. On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, it's gratifying to see that more patients are benefiting from our cell therapies given the growing body of clinical evidence. Building on the ZUMA-7 data, we presented real-world data at ASCO that demonstrated consistent outcomes for survival and safety regardless of race and ethnicity. And in sub-analysis of ZUMA-7, patients over 65, Yescarta demonstrated more than 8x greater median event-free survival and a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.\nThese data further establish the efficacy and safety profile of Yescarta for patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL and support ongoing exploration of Yescarta in more settings. We expect to enroll our first patient for ZUMA-24, a Phase II study to evaluate Yescarta in second-line LBCL, in an outpatient setting; as well as ZUMA-23, a Phase III study to evaluate Yescarta in first-line, high-risk LBCL patients, in the second half of this year. Additionally, we expect first patient in, in a new Phase III trial evaluating the use of Yescarta in second-line HR follicular lymphoma patients, ZUMA-22, later this year.\nNow to Slide 20. As Dan mentioned, we made steady progress in the first half of the year and continue to focus on clinical execution. The key clinical milestones in the second half include: an update on our regulatory discussions for Trodelvy for late-line HR-positive/HER2-negative patients in the U.S.; a number of potential regulatory decisions, including for lenacapavir, Yescarta and Tecartus; at least 6 more trial initiations spanning Trodelvy, cell therapy and domvanalimab; as well as several data updates with our partner, Arcus, including Phase II data from ARC-7.\nLater this year, we also expect to have interim Phase II data for etruma from the ARC-6 study as well as ARC-8's Phase II data for [quemli]. We're encouraged with the early Phase I data for GS-5245, our investigational novel oral nucleoside in development for the treatment of COVID-19. We're discussing these early data with regulatory agencies and are planning to move into the clinic.\nWe're also pleased to see our earlier-stage pipeline with our partners such as Tizona and Pionyr continue to advance nicely. For example, Tizona's HLA-G program is currently enrolling its dose expansion cohorts, and Tizona expects to share interim data mid-2023.\nWith our robust internal pipeline and external partners, we're confident in our portfolio across virology, oncology and inflammation will deliver many life-changing treatments to help those patients in need.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results and starting on Slide 22, I would like to remind everyone that following the SEC guidance earlier this year, similar to our peers, acquired in-process R&D expenses or IP R&D, including upfront payments for business development transactions, are now included in our non-GAAP financial measures and reported under acquired IP R&D. As a reminder, the $300 million payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration announced in May is included in our Q2 results but was not reflected in our prior 2022 full year guidance.\nAdditionally, we have shifted prior period milestone and opt-in payments from R&D to acquired IP R&D. We believe this presentation better reflects the total costs incurred to acquire IP R&D projects. The most notable example is the $625 million opt-in payment we made to Arcus that we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. There are a few other smaller payments that have been moved, and this slide highlights the changes that you'll now see reflected in our 2021 P&L. I'll further note that this change impacts our 2022 R&D guidance because our R&D guidance is given relative to our 2021 results. I'll touch on that again later in this call.\nMoving to our second quarter results, starting on Slide 23. This was a very strong quarter with a notable contribution from both our HIV and our oncology businesses. As expected, Veklury sales were substantially lower sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting the lower COVID hospitalization rates in the quarter. Total product sales, excluding Veklury, were up 7% year-over-year. Foreign currency impacted second quarter sales, excluding Veklury, by approximately $65 million net of hedges. If we exclude this impact as well as the impact of the HIV LOEs, total underlying sales growth year-over-year was 11% in the quarter. For the first half, total product sales growth excluding Veklury was 5%. Also excluding FX and the impact of the HIV LOEs, underlying growth for the first half was 8%.\nBack to our reported results on Slide 24. Johanna took you through our revenue results and the drivers there. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 85.6% for the second quarter, down 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the Biktarvy-related royalty following the settlement in the first quarter of this year. Non-GAAP R&D excluding acquired IP R&D expenses, such as milestones and upfront payments, was $1.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year, primarily due to increased investment in development and timing of clinical trial activities, primarily for our oncology business. Acquired IP R&D for the quarter was $330 million, including $300 million related to the Dragonfly collaboration.\nNon-GAAP SG&A was $1.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased promotional and marketing activities, including for Trodelvy as well as higher corporate expenses, including IT investments and grants. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43%, reflecting higher operating expenses and the upfront Dragonfly payment. Excluding the Dragonfly payment, non-GAAP operating margin was 47.5% for the quarter.\nMoving to tax. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.3%. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.58 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $1.81 for the same period last year, reflecting the Dragonfly payments which represented $0.18 on a post-tax per share basis as well as the Biktarvy-related royalty. Overall, we had a strong first half of the year, as shown on Slide 25, with growth across HIV, cell therapy and Trodelvy, offset in part by HCV. Of note, currency headwinds impacted the first half total product sales by approximately $180 million net of hedges compared with the first half of 2021.\nMoving to Slide 26. We are increasing our full year sales guidance to reflect our year-end -- or our year-to-date results and our expectations for the second half, including our expectations for FX. In addition to the impact in the first half, we expect continued FX headwinds in the second half, impacting total product sales by approximately $200 million in the rest of the year compared to our initial February guidance.\nFor revenues, we now expect total product sales of $24.5 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. This reflects the strong performance year-to-date, notably very strong growth in cell therapy and HIV, and it also incorporates our expectations for the broader macro environment.\nIn HIV, we expect modest sequential growth in the third quarter, keeping in mind the strength we experienced in the second quarter. And in cell therapy, we expect flat to modestly higher revenue in the third quarter compared to Q2. Following the launch bolus of orders we experienced in the second quarter, we expect demand to stabilize.\nMoving to Veklury. And with the first half revenue of almost $2 billion, we're increasing our expectations to approximately $2.5 billion for the year. Following inventory drawdown in the second quarter, we expect sales to increase sequentially in the United States and to continue to track hospitalization rates. Note that our Veklury guidance assumes no significant increase in hospitalization rates from Q2 levels. Excluding Veklury, we expect our total product sales to be $22 billion to $22.5 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% year-over-year and compared to our prior range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion.\nAs for the rest of the non-GAAP P&L, there is no change to our product gross margin guidance range of 85% to 86%. R&D, as described earlier, will no longer include BD-related payments such as milestones and opt-in fees. These will be reported as acquired IP R&D along with upfront payments. With this change, we have moved $762 million of full year 2021 expense from R&D to acquired IP R&D. As a result of this change, we now expect full year R&D expense to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the new 2021 baseline of $4.5 billion. Our expectations for full year R&D expense remained largely unchanged from the start of the year, and this guidance revision reflects only the recasting of acquired IP R&D items, including Arcus, previously reported in R&D in 2021.\nMoving to acquired IP R&D. We are not issuing guidance for the full year and similar to what we did with the Dragonfly deal this quarter, we'll update our EPS guidance quarterly as needed to reflect any relevant activity during the quarter. What we have included here is the year-to-date acquired IP R&D amounts.\nFor SG&A, with our continued investment across our commercial organization and expectations for higher costs as a result of inflation, we now expect SG&A expenses to grow by a low single-digit percentage compared to 2021. Altogether, we expect operating income to be $11 billion to $11.6 billion for the full year compared to $10.7 billion to $11.5 billion previously. Similarly, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range between $6.35 to $6.75, up from $6.20 to $6.70 previously.\nOn a GAAP basis, we expect our diluted earnings per share to range between $2.90 and $3.30 compared to $3 and $3.50 previously, primarily reflecting net unrealized losses from strategic equity investments. As a reminder, this revised EPS guidance reflects the $300 million upfront payment associated with the Dragonfly collaboration we announced in May, which was not included in our previous guidance as well as our FX expectations and operating expenses for the second half. The guidance share today does not include additional upfront payments related to normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals that we might announce in the third or fourth quarters. As discussed previously, we will continue to update our guidance as needed to reflect the impact of any new business development transactions closed in the prior quarter.\nFinally, on Slide 27, you can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the quarter, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders, including $920 million in dividend payments. And just after the close of the quarter, we repaid $1 billion of debt, fulfilling our commitment to repay $1.5 billion of debt this year. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, we have returned to the same debt level we were at prior to the Immunomedics acquisition.\nWith that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now like to hand the call over to your host for today's program, Jacquie Ross, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of IR, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter of 2022. The press release, slides and supplementary data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com.\nThe speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer; Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite.\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations, plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital, and 2022 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, in our supplementary data sheet as well as on the Gilead website.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. We appreciate you taking the time with Gilead today, and I also want to thank those of you who joined our Virology and Oncology Deep Dives over the last few months. These 2 events provided a more in-depth view of our portfolio, our strategy and the teams behind them. We shared a much broader view of our growing clinical pipeline than we had in the past, highlighting its potential to deliver a number of new therapies to address unmet needs for patients across a diverse range of conditions.\nFor those of you who joined, I hope you got a deeper sense of why we're confident of sustaining our leadership in virology and growing our oncology revenue so that it becomes more than 1/3 of our total revenue in 2030.\nI'll turn now to our performance this quarter, and I'm pleased to share that the year is off to a strong start in line with guidance, as shown on Slide 4. Total product revenue was up 3% from last year to USD 6.5 billion, with cell therapy, VEKLURY, TRODELVY and HIV driving growth. HIV grew 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by BIKTARVY, which grew 18%, and reported more than 4% market share growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. This is notable given the impact of our TRUVADA LOE. Sequentially, HIV was down 18%, primarily as a result of first quarter seasonality. Our growing oncology portfolio performed well, with TRODELVY revenue doubling compared to the first quarter of 2021 and cell therapy delivering another strong quarter of growth.\nWe recently expanded our portfolio of marketed cancer therapies following the FDA approval of Yescarta for second-line relapsed and refractory LBCL. I'm also pleased to highlight the FDA approval of our new cell therapy facility in Maryland, which is part of the expected 50% increase in our manufacturing capacity by the end of 2022. The new facility will support our cell therapy growth expectations over the next several years.\nMoving to the pipeline. We shared the Phase III top line readout from TROPiCS-02 in March showing that the study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival versus physician's choice in chemotherapy. Additionally, the first interim analysis of the key secondary endpoint of overall survival demonstrated a trend in improvement. As you know, we are exploring potential pathways for approval with regulatory authorities to bring TRODELVY to these later-stage patients. The details of the study results will be shared at ASCO in June.\nAt the Oncology Deep Dive earlier this month, we highlighted the broad potential for TRODELVY across multiple tumor types and lines of therapy, with plans to initiate 13 more TRODELVY trials through 2023, including 4 more in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 5. As you know, the timing for TROPiCS-02 and the NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change. In the case of CAPELLA, this is due to the biocompatibility issue that we're working to resolve, and we're fully confident in lenacapavir itself. Other than that, we are on track with the remaining targeted milestones we shared with you in January.\nWe've added some of the newly disclosed trials from our Oncology Deep Dive as well on this slide. Additionally, we're pleased to note that the partial clinical hold for the pivotal magrolimab trials, including ENHANCE-3 for first-line unfit AML shown on the slide have been lifted. I'm also pleased to share that despite the hold, there's no change to the timing of the first interim readout for ENHANCE for first-line high-risk MDS, which we expect in the first half of 2023. Merdad will share more pipeline details later in the call.\nBefore I pass it over to Johanna, I just want to take a moment to thank the Gilead and Kite teams who are putting the full way to their expertise, passion and commitment behind all of this work that you're seeing. It's thanks to our 14,000 employees across the world that were delivering for patients with diverse conditions and diseases today and advancing a pipeline of innovative new therapies for the future. We have some bold ambitions for the coming years, and we're confident of achieving them given the level of innovation and capabilities that we have in place today.\nNow I'll invite Johanna to share an update on our first quarter commercial performance. Over to you, Johanna.\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. So turning to Slide 7. We had a solid start to the year with total product sales, excluding VEKLURY, of USD 5 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year driven by cell therapy, TRODELVY and HIV, and offset in part by HCV pricing dynamics. Quarter-over-quarter, total product sales, excluding VEKLURY, were down 14% as a result of the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter of the year, primarily in our HIV business.\nOn Slide 8, you can see that HIV sales were down 18% quarter-over-quarter to $3.7 billion, consistent with our guidance, given the seasonality we customarily experienced in the first quarter of every year. First, the channels build their inventories over the fourth quarter and then draw them down during Q1. On a dollar basis, the majority of the sequential decline was associated with inventory drawdown. Second, we realized lower net prices in part due to increased copay support, Part D discounts and other efforts to maintain access and affordability of our HIV medicines as patients' insurance plans reset. This is a customary Q1 dynamic that we expect to normalize throughout the rest of this year.\nYear-over-year, HIV sales were up 2% driven by market growth for both treatment and PrEP, often in part by the impact of the lost exclusivity for TRUVADA in 2020. The year-over-year impact of this LOE is expected to be minimal starting in this quarter, second quarter of this year. And excluding the LOE impact, HIV sales increased 5%.\nOverall, we're encouraged by the signs of recovery seen in the HIV treatment market despite screening and diagnosis rates still below pre-pandemic levels and the continued impact on market growth due to the Omicron surge in Q1. As a result, both the U.S. and European HIV treatment markets were down slightly on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, the European market was roughly flat, and the U.S. market grew a little over 3%.\nThe PrEP market grew 33% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Notably, DESCOVY continues to hold approximately 45% market share, and we'll continue to engage with payers to ensure those who benefit from PrEP have access to their preferred regimen. We believe Gilead remains well positioned in PrEP. And as highlighted during our Virology Deep Dive in February, we expect the market to double by 2030, catalyzed by the launch of long-acting regimens such as lenacapavir. DESCOVY sales in the first quarter were $374 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by continued PrEP market growth and partially offset by generic competition and switches to newer treatment medicines such as BIKTARVY.\nTurning to Slide 9. BIKTARVY sales of $2.2 billion in the first quarter were up 18% year-over-year driven by U.S. market growth, and notably, continued share gains in both the U.S. and in Europe. BIKTARVY remains the leading regimen for new starts and switches in the U.S. and new starts in Europe. In fact, BIKTARVY share is up 4.5% year-over-year to 43% share in the U.S., almost 8x larger than the next leading promoted medicine and representing the highest share of any complete regimen for the treatment of HIV.\nMoving to Slide 10 in HCV. We maintained steady market share, and the 22% decline year-over-year was primarily driven by unfavorable pricing dynamics. Sequentially, HCV was up 2%, while the overall market and new patient starts continue to be impacted by the pandemic.\nHBV and HDV on Slide 11 were up 7% year-over-year due to higher demand for Vemlidy, namely in Asia. Sequentially, HBV and HDV declined 11% driven by the same HBV seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics impacting HIV.\nHepcludex sales were $11 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting sales in Germany and France where full reimbursement has been established. Our discussions with regulatory bodies and other countries across Europe are ongoing. And of course, we look forward to potential approval in the U.S. in the second half of this year.\nVEKLURY revenues in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, as shown on Slide 12. VEKLURY utilization tracks hospitalization rates, and therefore, due to the timing of Omicron surges, was lower in the U.S. after January but higher in Europe and Asia later in the quarter. We're optimistic that there will not be another surge this year in the U.S. And overall, we will maintain our readiness to support hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. There's no change to our commitment to COVID-19 patients globally. And in that regard, we were very pleased to receive the World Health Organization's revised COVID-19 guidelines.\nThese guidelines now conditionally recommend VEKLURY for the treatment of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 at highest risk of hospitalization. And earlier this week, VEKLURY received FDA approval for the treatment of certain pediatric patients for at least 28 days old, highlighting our ongoing commitment to extend the reach of VEKLURY where we can.\nNow turning to oncology. TRODELVY sales were up 103% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, as shown on Slide 13. We're encouraged by adoption not just in the U.S., but notably, in Germany and France, and continue to work with health authorities and reimbursement bodies to extend TRODELVY's reach to patients globally. We've completed the expansion of our field force to support the U.S. and Europe and believe we are now at right scale to support physicians and make TRODELVY available across all approved indications to patients who could benefit from it.\nWe're extremely excited by the feedback from physicians about TRODELVY's impact on patients, both those who are prescribing TRODELVY today and those who expect to have access to it soon. With strong physician uptake and our expanded field footprint starting in April, we believe TRODELVY will benefit more than the 1 in 4 second-line metastatic TNBC patients we're reaching in the U.S. today. We look forward to sharing more updates as we progress throughout the year.\nTurning to Slide 14. And on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, cell therapy sales for the first quarter of 2022 were $274 million, up 43% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales of $211 million were up 32% year-over-year and 16% sequentially driven by continued global demand in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma as well as in follicular lymphoma. This highlights the growing recognition of the durable long-term survival benefit showcased at last December's American Society of Hematology Meeting.\nFor Tecartus, sales of $63 million were up 103% year-over-year due to strong demand in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. We're pleased with the strong early uptake for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. following approval last October, which contributed to the 11% sequential growth in Tecartus. The strong momentum we've seen across our cell therapy portfolio continued with the approval of Yescarta in second-line relapsed or refractory LBCL earlier this month as well as FDA's approval for our new Maryland manufacturing facility announced just last week. Through capacity improvements across our existing in-house CAR-T manufacturing site in addition to the new Maryland site, we expect our manufacturing capacity to increase by up to 50% and support our aspiration to serve a cumulative 25,000-plus patients by the end of 2025.\nSecond-line orders started coming in the day after the FDA approval and have been steady ever since. It is truly heartening to see the immediate help we can provide for patients. Given the Yescarta second-line inclusion in the NCCN guidelines and robust clinical data, we expect Yescarta to shift the paradigm in the standard of care for LBCL patients.\nChristi is here with the team and is available to take any questions on cell therapy during our Q&A. And so with that, I will hand over the call to Merdad for an update on our clinical pipeline.\n\nMerdad V. Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Johanna, and hi, everyone. 2022 is full of clinical activity here at Gilead, and I hope the Virology and Oncology Deep Dives were helpful in highlighting the breadth and depth of our portfolio.\nBy the end of 2022, we expect to have more than 90 clinical trials underway across oncology, virology and inflammation. With such a broad portfolio, our focus is firmly on innovation and execution to ensure that we fully leverage its potential.\nMoving to HIV on Slide 16. We shared exciting 1-year data from the CAPELLA trials at CROI in February, reporting 83% virologic suppression and heavily treatment-experienced people living with multidrug-resistant HIV. Given the significant unmet need of this patient population, the lenacapavir NDA was designated Priority Review by the FDA, and we're planning to resubmit the NDA as soon as we resolve the clinical hold and complete response letter.\nAs you know, the basis of these FDA actions was the compatibility of lenacapavir with vials in use at that time, not lenacapavir itself. We're in ongoing dialogue with the agency to consider an alternative vial and look forward to updating you of our progress in due course. Separately, we're on track for the HTE MAA approval in Europe in the second half of the year.\nAt our Virology Deep Dive in February, we shared details of the 8 internal candidates that could partner with lenacapavir for treatment and highlighted the additional early development or discovery assets shown on Slide 17. In addition to our PrEP programs, these assets give us a high degree of confidence that Gilead will sustain its leadership in HIV through the 2020s and beyond.\nIn the immediate term, we continue to generate very strong data for BIKTARVY. At CROI, we showed virologic suppression at or above 98% in the M=E analysis and 0 cases of treatment failure due to resistance to any components of the single-tablet regimen in 2 5-year Phase III trials. Of note, this 5-year duration is unprecedented for an HIV regimen.\nMoving to Slide 18. VEKLURY is playing an important role in the fight against COVID-19 and is the only antiviral approved for use in both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Just in the past few days, the FDA approved an sNDA for VEKLURY for the treatment of pediatric patients who are at least 28 days old and either hospitalized with COVID-19 or with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and considered high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.\nIn addition to VEKLURY, we have an ongoing Phase I trial of GS-5245, our investigational oral COVID-19 nucleoside that once metabolized works in the same way as remdesivir. Results from this study could lead to a registrational trial. So even while we hope the worst of this pandemic is behind us, we will continue to work to ensure that COVID-19 therapies are available to as many patients as possible.\nMoving to oncology, and specifically TRODELVY, on Slide 19, we'll share more detailed data from the TROPiCS-02 study at ASCO in June. As a reminder, we announced that the study met its primary endpoint with statistically significant PFS versus physician's choice of chemotherapy in late-line patients. And that results are consistent with the TRODELVY arm in the Immunomedics-132-01 Phase I/II trial. OS showed a trend in improvement at the first interim analysis, and we're now targeting a final OS analysis in 2024, depending on the timing of events.\nIn the meantime, we're engaging with regulatory authorities to explore potential pathways given the high unmet need. As a reminder, TROPiCS-02 targeted a more advanced patient population than DESTINY-Breast04. The encouraging clinical data we've seen in this more challenging patient group has strengthened our excitement in exploring earlier-stage patients.\nAs we shared 2 weeks ago, we're planning a pivotal study for frontline HR-positive/HER2-negative patients, and we'll share more information in due course. In addition to TROPiCS-02, we're targeting First Patient In, or FPI, for a number of new TRODELVY trials this year. In the first half of 2022, this includes front-line studies for non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative metastatic TNBC. In the second half of the year, we're targeting FPI for the EVOKE-03 Phase III trial for first-line non-small cell lung cancer. TROPiCS-04 for metastatic urothelial carcinoma is ongoing, and we anticipate a readout in the 2023, 2024 time frame.\nAs you can see on this slide, shared for the first time in our Oncology Deep Dive earlier this month, we are in the earliest stages of evaluating how TRODELVY, either alone or in combination, could bring new options to people with cancer. In total, we're studying more than 25 combinations, including 7 Phase III combination studies.\nOn behalf of my Kite colleagues and on Slide 20, I'm pleased to highlight the FDA approval of Yescarta for the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma earlier this month. The approval is based on the ZUMA-7 trial data that showed that 2.5x more patients receiving Yescarta were alive at 2 years without disease progression or need for additional cancer treatment versus the standard of care. This was the first cell therapy approved by FDA for initial treatment of refractory or relapsed LBCL and within 12 months of initial treatment. Yescarta was also added to the NCCN's B-cell lymphoma treatment guidelines for these patients.\nMoving to magrolimab on Slide 21. We're very pleased that the FDA lifted the partial clinical holds for our MDS and AML trials, and we resumed enrollment in our 3 pivotal studies. I'll note that the remaining partial clinical holds on DLBCL and multiple myeloma are being reviewed by a different division of the FDA, and we're actively working to resolve them as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the impact of these remaining partial holds is limited since the DLBCL trial was already fully enrolled at the time of the partial clinical hold and the multiple myeloma trial had just initiated.\nOverall, we're excited by magrolimab's potential to be the first new treatment for first-line high-risk MDS patients in 15 years and have completed patient enrollment for the first interim analysis that we expect to share in early 2023. In the meantime, we look forward to sharing data from our Phase Ib trial for high-risk MDS and first-line TP53 AML with more patients and longer follow-up at ASCO in June.\nFinally, on Slide 22 and noting that the timing for the potential submission of TROPiCS-02 and the NDA decision for CAPELLA are subject to change, there are no updates to the targeted milestones shared with you in January. With our partner, Arcus, we're targeting a number of data readouts in the second half of the year and have added some new trials, including STAR-121, evaluating zimberelimab and domvanalimab in combination with chemotherapy for front-line non-small cell lung cancer and ARC-21 to evaluate the same combination of upper GI malignancies.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Andy.\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into the Q1 P&L review and the guidance update, I wanted to touch on the $2.7 billion partial in-process R&D impairment related to assets acquired from Immunomedics in 2020. This had a $1.63 per share impact on our Q1 GAAP results and on our full year GAAP EPS guidance. There is no impact to our non-GAAP EPS in Q1 or to our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year.\nWith the TROPiCS-02 data readout in March, we have reassessed the value of the assets acquired. While no final decisions have been made pending discussions with regulatory authorities, as a result of the data, we have taken a $2.7 billion impairment to reflect the likelihood of a delayed launch of TRODELVY for third-line plus HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in the United States as well as Europe and the possibility of a reduced market share in late-line patients given the emerging competitive landscape.\nPrior to today's update, Gilead was carrying $14.7 billion for the IP R&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired with Immunomedics. This now values these assets at $12 billion. Recall that the carrying value of TRODELVY reflected 4 potential indications in progress at the time of the acquisition, triple-negative breast cancer and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. At that time, we knew that TRODELVY's potential extended beyond these indications, but for accounting purposes did not assign value for the incremental opportunities that we are exploring in prostate, endometrial and other solid tumors as well as potential combinations such as with magrolimab, domvanalimab and PD-1s like pembrolizumab.\nAs you saw at our Oncology Deep Dive earlier this month, there are 13 TRODELVY programs targeted for initiation through 2023, including a number of incremental opportunities. As a result, we remain confident TRODELVY will deliver an attractive return to our shareholders over time.\nMoving to Slide 24. The first quarter was a strong start to the year despite the expected seasonality observed in our HIV business and was stronger-than-expected VEKLURY sales. Total product sales were $6.5 billion, up 3% year-over-year, with growth in cell therapy, VEKLURY, TRODELVY and HIV, offset in part by lower HCV revenue. Of note, FX negatively impacted first quarter revenue by almost $100 million, net of hedges, representing approximately 160 basis points of growth. Total product sales, excluding VEKLURY, were up 2% from the first quarter of 2021 to $5 billion.\nIn HIV, on a sequential basis, we were impacted, as expected, by the normal seasonality associated with Q1 inventory burn following a build in Q4 in addition to the typical first quarter pricing headwinds that improved throughout the rest of the year. With Q1 now behind us, we expect sequential growth in HIV throughout the rest of the year.\nNon-GAAP product gross margin was 87.4% for Q1, up 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower inventory reserve adjustment. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were largely consistent with our expectations as we support the expansion of our oncology business. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. And non-GAAP SG&A was $1.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year, both primarily due to higher costs associated with TRODELVY.\nMoving to tax. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.4%. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.12 in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $2.04 for the same period last year, reflecting the higher revenue and higher gross margin, offset in part by higher operating expenses.\nOn a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate and earnings per share were impacted by the $2.7 billion impairment. We are excited about the strong start to the year. And as you can see on Slide 25, the only revision to our outlook is to our GAAP EPS, primarily to reflect the $1.63 share impact of the impairment discussed earlier. We now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $3 to $3.50 per share from $4.70 to $5.20.\nOn VEKLURY, we note the strong revenue start to the year, but also, fortunately, the significant drop-off in U.S. hospitalizations during the first quarter and into the second quarter so far. With that in mind, we will monitor demand through the second quarter and evaluate our full year guidance in the middle of the year.\nOne housekeeping item before we wrap up. Following recent guidance from the SEC, beginning in the first quarter and similar to many of our peers, Gilead will no longer exclude acquired in-process R&D expenses from non-GAAP financial measures. Prior period results have been updated to reflect this new methodology and are shared in our supplementary data posted on the Investor Relations website.\nAs a reminder, our full year guidance does not include the impact of any future upfront payments related to the normal course of business partnerships or licensing deals. Going forward, we plan to update our guidance on a quarterly basis to reflect the impact of any new corporate development transactions closed in the prior quarter.\nMoving to Slide 26. You can see there is no change to our capital allocation priorities. In the first quarter, we repaid $500 million in debt. Additionally, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase of shares.\nFinally, on M&A, there is no change to our philosophy here either. We are very comfortable with the breadth and the quality of the pipeline that we have built, acquired or partnered, and the growth that it will enable in the coming years. With that in mind, you can expect us to continue to opportunistically access high-quality assets through partnerships or make smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.\nWith that, I'll invite the operator to open the Q&A.",

Welcome to the Gilead Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJacquie Ross\n\nVP of IR, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gigi, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. The press release, slides and supplemental data are available on the Investors section of our website at gilead.com. The speakers on today's call will be our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel O'Day; our Chief Commercial Officer, Johanna Mercier; our Chief Medical Officer, Merdad Parsey; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Dickinson. After that, we'll open up the call to Q&A where the team will be joined by Christi Shaw, the Chief Executive Officer of Kite. .\nBefore we get started, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gilead's business, financial condition and results of operations; plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, corporate strategy, business and operations, financial projections and the use of capital; and 2022 financial guidance. All of these involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nA description of these risks can be found in the earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release available on the Gilead website.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel P. O'Day\n\nChairman & CEO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everybody. As we head into 2022, Gilead is coming off a year of positive clinical momentum and strong financial performance, mitigating the impact of the pandemic on some parts of our business. Higher sales of Veklury more than offset the impact of COVID-19 on HIV and HCV.\nVeklury The glory continues to play a critical role in helping to treat people with COVID-19, with continued activity against the Omicron variant. The FDA recently expanded its use beyond the hospital for patients at high risk of disease progression. In addition, we just initiated a Phase I trial of GS5245, a novel oral COVID-19 nucleoside that metabolize works in the same way as remdesivir.\nOur full year revenue for 2021 was 11% higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance in February of 2021. It was also an important year for our transformation to becoming a business that is based on diverse sustainable growth. In 2021, we received 7 approvals or accelerated approvals in the U.S. and Europe, and submitted an additional 6 filings. Our approvals included 3 for Trodelvy with the FDA and MAA approval in second-line triple-negative breast cancer as well as an accelerated approval from FDA for metastatic bladder cancer; two for cell therapy with Yescarta receiving accelerated approval in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and Tecartus receiving full approval in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and 2 expanded labels in virology, one for a pediatric label for Biktarvy in the U.S. and an expanded label for Veklury in the EU for adults not requiring supplemental oxygen.\nOur 2022 plans include a significant increase in clinical development studies across our novel oncology portfolio. We are planning at least 20 additional trials, including 7 Phase III for trials for Trodelvy, and these include the ASCENT-03 trial, which is evaluating Trodelvy in the frontline AAA and breast cancer in the PD-L1 negative population; the ASCENT-04 trial in collaboration with Merck to evaluate Trodelvy and KEYTRUDA in the frontline triple-negative breast cancer population in the PD-L1 positive population; and the EVOKE-03 trial, which will be led by Merck to evaluate Trodelvy and KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer.\nYou will also see ongoing momentum in our virology portfolio as we continue to expand our leadership in antiviral therapies. We are advancing our longer-acting HIV options with lenacapavir as the foundation and look forward to potential regulatory decisions in 2022. If approved, lenacapavir would be the only HIV treatment option administered twice yearly. In addition, we'll continue to drive progress across our broader virology portfolio, including hepatitis, COVID-19 and other emerging viruses.\nThis is a really important time in Gilead's transformation journey. After the consistent work to execute on our strategy and expand our portfolio over the last 2 years, you will increasingly start to see this play out in tangible results. We're confident that Gilead has all the elements in place for a strong year and a strong decade.\nJohanna, Merdad and Andy will now take you through the details of our progress and our plans. And let me hand first over to Johanna to talk about our commercial performance in the fourth quarter and the full year, and I'll be back to you in the Q&A. Johanna?\n\nJohanna Mercier\n\nChief Commercial Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone.\nAs you can see on Slide 7, we had a strong end to the year with Q4 total product sales excluding Veklury of $5.8 billion, up 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by favorable pricing and inventory dynamics. This also represented 8% growth year-over-year, driven by continued recovery in the HIV treatment market and favorable pricing dynamics. The Veklury sales were higher than expected in Q4, reflecting the start of the Omicron surge, but lower than both the prior quarter and prior year and contributing to total product sales of $7.2 billion for the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8. Total fourth quarter Veklury sales were $1.4 billion, bringing total sales for 2021 to $5.6 billion. Gilead is proud of the role that Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Veklury has demonstrated activity against the Omicron variant and has helped many patients with COVID-19 in the most recent surge. Although symptoms have generally been less severe, the volume of overall cases has meaningly increased since the emergence of Omicron and we have seen the total number of hospitalizations increase as well.\nWhile we would all prefer to put this pandemic behind us, we expect Veklury to continue to play a critical role in '22 and beyond. As you'd expect, hospitalizations remain a key indicator for inpatient Veklury sales, and we're seeing higher hospitalizations in geographies with lower vaccination adoption, including certain parts of the U.S. as well as Eastern Europe.\nAdditionally, I'm very pleased to highlight that the FDA recently approved the sNDA filing for the use of Veklury in the outpatient setting for patients at high risk of disease progression. This approval was based on data generated in the Phase III PINETREE study, further solidifying the credibility, importance and role of Veklury. Now Veklury will be able to help even more patients earlier and reduce risk of hospitalization for COVID-19.\nNext, as shown on Slide 9, total HIV sales were $4.5 billion in the quarter, up 8% sequentially driven by favorable inventory and pricing dynamics as well as changes to our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021. For the full year, total HIV sales were $16.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to the Truvada and Atripla LOE in addition to pandemic-related impacts and pricing dynamics. The expected impact from the LOEs, which amounted to $1.3 billion, was offset by continued Biktarvy growth. Excluding the sizable LOE impact, HIV total product sales for the full year grew 4% compared to 2020 despite the ongoing pandemic headwinds. We now expect the Truvada and Atripla loss of exclusivity impact to be minimal going forward as the headwind dissipates starting in Q2 of this year.\nIn HIV treatment, we continue to see signs of market recovery, although the U.S. market declined 1% sequentially in Q4, following 2 quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, the overall market in Q4 was up 1.5% in both the U.S. as well as EU5 despite screening and diagnosis rates still below pre-pandemic levels. As you know, favorable dynamics play out in the fourth quarter of every year in HIV and 2021 was no different with some year-end inventory stocking and favorable seasonal pricing as well as changes in our gross to net estimates in Q4 2021.\nAs you think about 2022, I'll remind you of the normal HIV inventory buildup in Q4 and the new year reset for patient co-pays and donut hole payments. Given these factors, along with the favorable pricing dynamics I just mentioned, we expect the sequential decline in Q1 '22 to be greater than Q1 '21. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall in HIV and expect continued growth in subsequent quarters.\nBack to Q4. Biktarvy had another record quarter with sales of $2.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. On Slide 10, you can see that Biktarvy U.S. treatment market share has increased over 5 share points in 2021, reaching 42%, which is the highest share that any complete regimen has ever achieved in this market. For the full year, Biktarvy sales were $8.6 billion, growing 19% from 2020, and Biktarvy remains the leading prescribed treatment for naive and switch patients in the U.S. as well as #1 in naive in the EU5.\nDESCOVY revenue for the fourth quarter was $473 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter, primarily as a result of favorable seasonal pricing and inventory dynamics as well as continued demand. We expect DESCOVY revenue to continue to be driven by PrEP as DESCOVY has maintained about 45% of overall PrEP market prescriptions in the U.S. We'll continue to ensure access to support physician choice and expect growing demand and market expansion to offset the impact of increased commercial contracting.\nOverall, while near-term growth continues to be impacted by local pandemic-related social restrictions, we're encouraged by the growing PrEP market. In Q4, the overall PrEP market grew 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, we believe lenacapavir, our investigational longer-acting prep offering, could potentially catalyze this market well beyond the 25% penetration rate in PrEP that we see today.\nMoving to Slide 11. It's clear that HCV continues to be part of our portfolio most impacted by the pandemic. Although there was some slight quarter-over-quarter recovery in market starts in the EU5, U.S. market starts declined, resulting in flat total starts overall. While Gilead market share increased modestly on a sequential basis in both the U.S. and the EU, this was more than offset by unfavorable pricing dynamics resulting in Q4 total sales of $393 million, down 8% sequentially and 7% year-over-year.\nAs you can see on Slide 12, our HBV and HDV franchise reported record quarterly revenues of $265 million, up 7% sequentially due to seasonal inventory and favorable pricing. The 9% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by Vemlidy demand. Total fiscal year sales for this franchise were $969 million, up 13% year-over-year.\nHepcludex reported $12 million of sales in Q4 in Europe, with $37 million in '21 sales since our acquisition in late first quarter. Hepcludex is currently available in Germany and France in addition to a number of early access program in countries such as Austria, Italy and Greece.\nIn 2022 and as part of our comprehensive commercialization plan, we expect to finalize reimbursement for launch in a number of major European markets. In the U.S., we filed a BLA in November and FDA granted priority review for accelerated approval with a PDUFA date set for the third quarter as well as an advisory committee meeting that will be scheduled in the coming months.\nMoving to oncology. First, with Trodelvy on Slide 13. Global sales were $118 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 84% year-over-year compared to full Q4 2020 sales. This reflects growing adoption of the second-line metastatic TNBC indication, which was noted as a preferred regimen and the NCCN Breast Guidelines updated in September. We're also starting to see stronger unaided brand awareness, which is resulting in continued market share growth.\nIn second-line TNBC, Trodelvy now captures approximately 1 in 4 new starts in the U.S. We've expanded our oncology footprint globally, including tripling our U.S. headcount to further accelerate penetration of Trodelvy and prepare for a potential HR positive and HER2-negative launches. Additionally, EU approval for Trodelvy was granted in late November 2021, and we've already seen strong momentum in France and Germany since their launch. We plan to launch a number of new countries following key reimbursement decisions this year.\nNow on Slide 14, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, Cell Therapy Q4 sales of $239 million reflected Forty Seven% year-over-year growth and 8% increase sequentially. For the quarter, Yescarta sales were of $182 million were up 41% year-over-year, driven by continued demand in relapse or refractory large B cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Yescarta sales of $57 million in the quarter reflected 68% year-over-year growth based on growing global demand for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma and early contribution for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. As a reminder, FDA granted Yescarta's approval in adult ALL in October. In just the first few months of launch, there has already been strong demand that we expect to continue in the coming quarters, given the high unmet need.\nFull year Cell Therapy sales of $871 million reflected 43% year-over-year growth driven by continued LBCL and MCL demand globally as well as the new launches. The strong growth we've seen with these recent launches reinforces our belief that Cell Therapy adoption will continue its positive momentum as more physicians understand the benefits of appropriate patients and, therefore, increase referral rates to treatment centers.\nMerdad will elaborate later, so I'll just quickly mention the impressive data Kite presented at ASH in December, 43% overall survival rate after 5 years in third-line LBCL patients. The Yescarta data at ASH not only highlighted the long-term real-world safety and efficacy profile in third-line LBCL but also in earlier lines of therapy. For ZUMA-7 data in second-line LBCL FDA has set a PDUFA date of April 1 when we hope Yescarta will be granted approval. In the meantime, the Kite team is ramping up manufacturing capacity to meet the anticipated demand. Kite expects the new Maryland facility to begin commercial operations by Q2.\nCombined with the Amsterdam and El Secunda facilities, we expect to increase operational capacity by up to 50% by the end of this year. Christi's here with the team and available to take questions on Cell Therapy during our Q&A.\nIn closing, our oncology sales were $1.25 billion in 2021, and we expect a robust growth in the coming years. And so with that, I'll hand it over to Merdad for pipeline update.\n\nMerdad V. Parsey\n\nChief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThanks, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone. Building out both Johanna and Dan have said, the Gilead team rounded out a very strong 2021 with further progress across our portfolio. In 2021 alone, we began enrolling patients in 13 oncology, 13 virology and 4 inflammation trials. And we have recently shared the initial details of the ambitious development programs we're targeting for 2022. As we look forward, we're confident that we have the foundation to continue to build a robust diverse portfolio across our 3 focused therapeutic areas. .\nFirst, on Slide 16, Veklury continues to play a valuable role in the fight against COVID-19. Veklury was the first approved treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We recently expanded indication labels in the U.S. and EU. In December, the European Commission approved a variation to the conditional marketing authorization for Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults, not on supplemental oxygen. And last month, based on the data from the Phase III PINETREE study, the FDA expanded the approval of Veklury to include nonhospitalized patients at high risk for COVID-19 disease progression.\nThese expanded indications speak to the activity of Veklury against the coronavirus variance we've seen so far, including Omicron. We believe there will continue to be a need for Veklury to be delivered intravenously, especially for higher-risk patients. The potential for continued COVID-19 variants and infections highlight the need for more convenient oral formulations to expand the options for outpatients.\nAs such, we have just initiated a Phase I trial of GS-5245, a novel oral COVID-19 nucleoside that once metabolized works in the same way as remdesivir. Pending data, the evolving pandemic landscape and discussions with regulatory agencies, we're hoping to initiate a registrational trial before the end of the year.\nMoving to HIV on Slide 17. We shared an overview of some of our long-acting development activities a few weeks ago to highlight the diversity of our portfolio and how it targets the entire HIV life cycle. We continue to believe that our investigational agent, lenacapavir is a unique and foundational asset, given its potential for extended dosing in addition to the compelling efficacy and safety profile highlighted in the CAPELLA and CALIBRATE studies.\nNext, on Slide 18, you can see our current clinical efforts with long-acting HIV therapeutics. As previously announced, the Phase II study evaluating the oral combination of lenacapavir with Merck's islatravir is on partial clinical hold, and Merck remains in discussions with the FDA on next steps for islatravir. In the meantime, we at Gilead, continued to develop a number of other potential partner agents for lenacapavir in HIV treatment and look forward to sharing some more detail on these programs at our virology deep dive later this month. We remain confident and excited about lenacapavir future potential to deliver options for people living with HIV or those who could benefit from PrEP.\nI want to be very clear that the recent clinical hold for the lenacapavir trials, which the FDA initiated in December, is not associated with lenacapavir molecule itself. Rather, the hold reflects concern about the compatibility of certain vials with lenacapavir solution. We continue to work with the FDA to remediate the concern and to agree on the path to resume these trials. We're hopeful this can be achieved quickly. As such, we continue to expect an FDA decision for lenacapavir in heavily treatment-experienced individuals in the first half of 2022. If successful, lenacapavir will become the first available 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection for the treatment of HIV.\nNext, moving to Trodelvy on Slide 18. I'm pleased to confirm that we now expect to share both top line progression-free survival data as well as the first planned interim analysis of our overall survival from TROPiCS-02 in March. There's been a convergence of events for PFS and OS such that we'll be able to conduct and report a single analysis of these outcomes rather than have 2 analyses separated by a short interval. Gilead remains blinded to the data, and we're excited to be able to share this more complete view later this quarter.\nWe are targeting an sBLA filing in the second half of 2022, depending, of course, on the readout. If the data are positive, we believe that Trodelvy could represent a very important treatment option for HR-positive HER2-negative patients who are hormone refractory and have very limited options.\nReflecting our confidence in Trodelvy overall, we're expanding the number of clinical programs in 2022 to evaluate effectiveness in breast, lung and bladder cancers, with plans to initiate study start-up activities for at least 7 Phase III trials. 3 of these are expected to enroll their first patients in 2022, including 2 in frontline metastatic TNBC and another in frontline non-small cell lung cancer study that will be led by Merck. Going forward, we will separately disclose trial start-up activities versus FPI milestones.\nAdditionally, in the first half of this year, we plan to add a combination of Trodelvy with other Gilead portfolio assets as a study or an additional cohort in an existing study. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming oncology deep dive in April. This is another example of the versatility and tremendous potential that Trodelvy along with the growing oncology portfolio can generate.\nNext slide on to magrolimab. Early last week, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold pausing enrollment and screening in trials and cohorts in the U.S. The value in magrolimab in combination with azacitidine following a review of a preliminary data set, suggesting an apparent imbalance in investigator-reported SUSARs, or unexpected -- sorry, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions between treatment groups and our ongoing Phase III trial in high-risk MDS.\nThe subsequent partial clinical hold has been placed on the Phase II multiple myeloma study in the fully enrolled Phase II DLBCL study. Importantly, patients currently enrolled in our magrolimab studies can continue treatment our compassionate use programs remain open. We're working with the FDA to take a comprehensive look at the safety data, and we'll share the outcome as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we remain committed to the magrolimab development program and believe that it has the potential to address an important unmet medical need in these seriously patients.\nAs you know, the patients in our ENHANCE Phase III trial have a very high unmet need with a median overall survival of only 1 to 3 years on the current standard of care. Separate from and prior to the partial clinical hold, our Phase Ib single-arm study in high-risk MDS no longer has a viable path to submission based on regulatory feedback. As such, we'll remain focused on our Phase III ENHANCE study and look forward to sharing the Ib data at an upcoming scientific meeting.\nNext, moving to Cell Therapy on Slide 21. On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'll share a brief update on the impressive data Kite presented at ASH last December. First, as you may recall, in 2020, we shared that Yescarta had a 4-year overall survival rate of 44% in third on LBCL patients. At ASH in December, we presented 5-year data from ZUMA-1 in third-line LBCL patients showing Yescarta demonstrated a remarkable and durable 43% overall survival rate, stable since our 4-year update. Additionally, 92% of the patients who remained alive at 5 years have not needed any additional cancer treatment since their onetime infusion of Yescarta. It's truly inspiring to see this type of durability for CAR T cell therapies.\nAs announced yesterday, the FDA approved a label update for Yescarta to include use of prophylactic corticosteroids across all approved indications. Adding prophylactic steroid use can improve the management of certain side effects without compromising the activity of Yescarta. For example, the FDA label now shows no grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome events occurred using the cohort 6 protocol as compared to 13% in the original label. This label update complements data published in 2021 showing 68% of patients had no CRS or neurological events within 72 hours of Yescarta infusion.\nAs we look to earlier lines of treatment, the landmark ZUMA-7 trial evaluating Yescarta in second-line relapsed/refractory LBCL demonstrated a greater than four-fold increase in median event-free survival, or EFS, compared to standard of care through 2 years of follow-up. As you can see on the slide, the EFS curve for Yescarta is compelling. The sBLA was filed last quarter, and we expect an FDA decision by April of this year.\nIn terms of the first-line LBCL data, Yescarta demonstrated 89% overall response rate in high-risk patients and 78% complete response with a median follow-up of 15.9 months. Given these encouraging data, the Kite team is in discussions with regulatory authorities on a potential path forward in frontline LBCL.\nAnd finally, on Slide 22, we highlight the key 2022 catalysts across the portfolio, many of which I've just mentioned. I'd also like to take a moment to highlight the 3 Arcus milestones in the second half of this year. Last quarter, Gilead opted into the 3 Arcus programs, which added 4 assets to our portfolio: domninilumab, silent anti-TIGIT antibody; AB308, an FC active anti-TIGIT antibody; etrumadenant, an adenosine receptor antagonist; and (inaudible), a small molecule CD73 inhibitor. Together with Arcus, we expect to share ARC7 Phase II PFS data in the second half of 2022, which will include data for the zimbrarelumab monotherapy, ZIM and Don doublet as well as the Zim Dom and Atripla triplet arm. We look forward to sharing data when available and are very excited to collaborate more closely with Arcus to accelerate future development plans.\nOn Slide 23, you can see the Gilead's portfolio now encompasses 55 clinical stage programs, nearly doubling since 2019. Given the exciting potential of our portfolio across virology, oncology and early-stage inflammation assets, this is just the beginning. Our teams are committed to advancing the most promising programs that will help transform patient outcomes, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming quarters and years.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Andy.\n\nAndrew D. Dickinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Gilead Sciences, Inc.\n\nThank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. It was a strong close to 2021, driven primarily by strong HIV and Veklury revenue in the fourth quarter. .\nFor the full year and excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV grew 4% year-over-year driven by the continued outperformance of Biktarvy, which achieved record U.S. market share of 42% and sales of $8.6 billion, up 19% from 2020. Oncology was another highlight from both a pipeline and a revenue perspective with full year cell therapy sales of $871 million, growing 43% from 2020 and Trodelvy sales of $380 million in its first full year. By 2030, we anticipate our oncology franchise will represent at least 1/3 of our total revenue.\nBefore I get into the normal P&L review and 2022 guidance, I want to address the EPS results for this quarter upfront. Slide 25 highlights 2 sizable expenses that occurred after we gave our last guidance update in October. First, and subsequent to the exercise of Gilead's opt-in to 4 Arcus assets in December, our fourth quarter results reflect a net charge of $625 million recorded in R&D.\nThis charge reflects our $725 million option payment recognized in Q4, less $100 million that was previously accrued. This impacted our EPS by about $0.38 in Q4 and for the full year.\nSecond, and as part of a legal settlement with ViiV and related parties, we have agreed to make a onetime $1.25 billion payment in addition to an ongoing 3% royalty for future sales of Biktarvy and the bictegravir component of any bictegravir-containing products in the United States. This royalty extends until October 5 of 2027. The $1.25 billion payment is recorded in our fourth quarter results and reflected in our cost of goods sold.\nThis charge constituted an approximately 17% impact to gross margin in the fourth quarter and it impacted our EPS by $0.80 for Q4 2021 and the full year. Going forward, we expect the impact of this new royalty to be approximately 1% on our gross margin starting in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding these items and their combined $1.18 impact, our full year non-GAAP EPS would have exceeded the guidance range that we set back in October helped by stronger-than-expected Veklury sales.\nMoving back to our quarterly review on Slide 26. Fourth quarter revenue in our base business included HIV product sales growth of 7% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Veklury sales were higher than expected due to the start of the Omicron surge, non-GAAP product gross margin was 70.5%, impacted by the legal settlement that I referenced earlier, and non-GAAP R&D was impacted by the Arcus opt-in resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 per share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.2%, reflecting tax expense related to uncertain tax positions and an increase in valuation allowance as well as the impact of discrete tax benefits related to legal sentiments of tax authorities in 2020 that did not recur this year.\nFor the full year, on Slide 27, total product sales of $27 billion grew 11% driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were roughly flat at $21.4 billion as growth in Biktarvy and oncology offset the $1.3 billion impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs in the United States. I touched on the main P&L impacts in the fourth quarter discussion, but I'll highlight that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 was 20.4% despite the higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter.\nMoving now to Slide 28. Our 2022 guidance assumes that the recent Omicron surge represents the only major COVID-19 wave for 2022 and that our HIV business will continue to recover from the pandemic. With that in mind, we expect product sales in the range of $23.8 billion to $24.3 billion. Excluding Veklury, we expect product sales in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4% for our base business year-over-year.\nRelative to Q1, I'll remind you to expect HIV revenue to decline sequentially. This is a normal dynamic for HIV due to inventory and seasonal pricing impacts and you'll recall that last year, HIV revenue declined 14% sequentially in Q1 '21 from Q4 of 2020. For Q1 '22, we expect a larger sequential decline given the favorable Q4 '21 changes to gross to net estimates that Johanna mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, we expect a strong year overall for our HIV business and continued growth in the subsequent quarters.\nLooking beyond Q1, we expect the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs will be largely behind us starting in Q2, and we look forward to accelerating growth in our HIV business during the remainder of the year. For the full year 2022, we expect Veklury sales of approximately $2 billion. This assumes, as I previously indicated that Omicron will represent the only major surge for the year with Veklury revenue heavily weighted in the first quarter. That said, the pandemic continues to be dynamic, and we will update you on our Veklury expectations on a quarterly basis, consistent with our recent practice.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. We expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 85% to 86%, consistent with our historic guidance and allowing for the 3% royalty associated with the legal settlement. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we expect R&D to decline -- or to decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2021 levels. This decline is driven by the net $625 million charge related to the Arcus opt-in in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding this, we expect full year R&D expense to increase by mid to high single-digit percentage compared to 2021 levels.\nWe expect SG&A expense to be approximately flat on a dollar basis compared to 2021. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% this year. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $6.20 and $6.70 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $4.70 and $5.20.\nOn capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continue to invest in our business, while at the same time, we returned over $4 billion in 2021 to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we repaid $4.7 billion of debt in 2021. For 2022, we plan to repay $1.5 billion of debt, of which we repaid $500 million this morning.\nWith that, I will invite the operator to begin the Q&A. Thank you.",

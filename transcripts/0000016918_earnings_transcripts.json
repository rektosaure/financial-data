Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning all, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Q4 and Full Year Fiscal '25 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.\nWe trust that you had the opportunity to review the newest release, CEO and CFO commentary and accompanying slides made available yesterday evening in the Investors section of our company's website, www.cbrands.com.\nAs we have received a couple of questions regarding certain figures contained in our slides, please note that we expect our beer net sales growth rate for fiscal '26 to be between 0% to 3% and for fiscal '27 and '28 to be 2% to 4%. And our operating income growth rate for fiscal '26 is expected to be between 0 to 2%. And for fiscal '27 to '28, we expect operating margins to be approximately 39% to 40%.\nOn that note, as a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in the news release and website. And we encourage you to also refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors that may impact forward-looking statements made on this call.\nBefore turning the call over to Bill and Garth, please keep in mind that as usual, answers provided today will be referencing comparable results unless otherwise specified and that any references to expectations for fiscal '26 to fiscal '28 reflect the anticipated impact of the tariffs announced by the U.S. government on April 2 and the Canadian government on March 4 of this year, inclusive of the delay in the effectiveness of certain tariffs announced by the U.S. government yesterday, which will particularly impact the Wine and Spirits business. Lastly, in line with prior quarters, I would ask that you limit yourselves to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time.\nThanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and welcome, everyone, to our Q4 and full year fiscal '25 call. As usual, I will outline a few overarching highlights but we will then move immediately to Q&A as our broader commentary was provided to you yesterday. So let's get going.\nIn a tough socioeconomic environment, we are taking decisive actions designed to continue to support our industry-leading beer business, reset our cost base and redefine our portfolio. More specifically, first, in fiscal '25, despite a softer consumer demand backdrop, largely driven by what we believe to be nonstructural socioeconomic factors, we continue to deliver enterprise net sales growth realized substantial comparable operating margin improvement and achieved double-digit comparable EPS growth.\nSecond, looking ahead, while we expect these nonstructural socioeconomic factors affecting consumer demand to gradually stabilize and subside, we remain focused on driving distribution gains on launching disciplined innovation and on deploying incremental marketing investments to support the growth of our beer business, all while continuing to deliver best-in-class operating margins.\nThird, in addition, we expect significant improvements in the performance of our Wine and Spirits business beyond fiscal '26, following the anticipated closing of the 2025 wine divestiture transaction that is primarily centered around the sale of the remaining main streamline brands in that portfolio as well as the implementation of associated restructuring actions expected to yield over $200 million in net annualized cost savings across the enterprise by fiscal '28.\nFourth, against that backdrop, we are targeting to deliver approximately $9 billion in operating cash flow from fiscal '26 to '28 and approximately $6 billion in free cash flow as we continue to invest primarily in the modular development of our third brewery in Veracruz and modular additions at our existing facilities in Mexico.\nAnd fifth, in line with this strong cash flow generation and having achieved our comparable net leverage ratio target in fiscal '25, we remain committed to a disciplined and balanced capital deployment framework including our [indiscernible] dividend payout ratio and executing share repurchases against our new 3-year $4 billion authorization.\nAnd with that, Garth and I will be happy to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Joe.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, all. Happy New Year, and welcome to Constellation Brands Q3 fiscal '25 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call.\nFollowing the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, and as Kevin just noted, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and welcome all to our Q3 fiscal '25 earnings call. As usual, I will start with a few key points regarding the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. First, growth in consumer demand for our beer portfolio sequentially expanded in the third quarter, and this in turn drove a marginal uplift in depletions growth relative to Q2. This acceleration was supported by the incremental marketing investments we deployed across our core brands in Q3 as we responded to the softer macroeconomic backdrop that began affecting consumer spending during the summer.\nAs a reminder, subdued overall spend and prolonged value-seeking behavior among consumers, have been key near-term limiting factors on demand growth, not only for our portfolio, but also for the dollar sales growth rate of total beverage alcohol. That said, beverage alcohol remains relatively unchanged in its share of total consumer expenditures. So we believe the slower rate of growth also reflects the adoption of broader value-seeking behavior across consumer goods. Against that backdrop and given the near-term uncertainty on whether consumers will revert to more normalized spending behaviors in Q4, we have made the decision to adjust the outlook for our fiscal '25 beer business net sales growth to be 4% to 7% and operating income growth to be 9% to 12%, still yielding an operating margin of approximately 39%. Notwithstanding this prudent adjustment to our beer business guidance, our revised fiscal '25 comparable EPS range still yields double-digit growth from the midpoint to the high end, which includes other adjustments to our outlook that Garth will cover in more detail shortly.\nSecond, despite softer consumer demand due to macroeconomic headwinds, our beer business continued to outperform the total beverage industry in dollar sales growth in Circana tracked channels over the 12 weeks ended December 1. And at a total company level, we once again achieved dollar sales growth outpacing the total CPG sector, as we approach nearly 12 years as a CPG growth leader.\nThird, we continue to effectively execute against our key initiatives in our beer business. From a distribution perspective, we have now secured more than half of the incremental 500,000 points of distribution that we identified as the fiscal '24 to fiscal '28 target for our core brands during our Investor Day with a significant portion of those gains achieved in the current fiscal year. On the innovation side, the depletion book contribution of our new liquids and pack formats released over the last couple of years is within the 20% to 40% range provided in Investor Day. That said, across our high-end light beer offerings, which include Modelo Oral from an innovation perspective and our more tenured Corona Light and premier brands, we are facing headwinds from competitive pricing, particularly in large pack formats. And across our Chelada brands, we are facing consumer demand growth rate headwinds from the convenience channel, where our Cheladas have outsized representation given the channel's core consumer base and the predominantly 24-ounce can format that skews more towards C-store retailers. To that end, we are actively working on levers to address the competitive dynamics in the high-end light beer segment and continue to pursue distribution opportunities for Chelada given our ongoing investments in broader marketing for the brands, including English language linear TV advertising for the first time and recent extensions into the 12-ounce can 12 pack formats.\nWe also continued to drive significant demand in our portfolio from new legal drinking age consumers and are pleased to have had a higher proportion of our dollar sales this year coming from 21 to 24 year olds as they have made more trips to the store and spend more on each trip across our brands. In fact, the share of spend for this demographic within our dollar sales is nearly twice that of the beer category, and that share has grown at more than twice the rate of the category and the high-end segment relative to last year. Last but not least, we also continued to consistently deliver against our capital allocation priorities. We maintained a 2.9x net leverage ratio on a comparable basis in the third quarter, still slightly below our 3x target. We further advanced our brewery capacity investments and returned nearly $220 million to shareholders through share repurchases and over $180 million in dividends in Q3. This brings our total year-to-date cash returns through share repurchases to approximately $670 million or to more than $1.2 billion, including both repurchases and dividends.\nWith that, let's turn more fully to our beer business performance. During the third quarter of fiscal '25, our beer business grew depletions by 3.2%, which again was an acceleration from last quarter despite continued consumer economic weakness. Shipments were up 1.6%, which as noted in our prior earnings call, trailed depletion growth due to the impact of planned maintenance activities at our breweries during the quarter. From a financial perspective, the business delivered net sales and operating income growth of approximately 3% and 2%, respectively, which included disciplined incremental pricing taking in the fall, which is in line with the 1% to 2% pricing expectations we provided for fiscal '25, another $40 million in cost savings achieved in Q3 as the persistent focus on driving savings and efficiency from our end-to-end supply chain team continues to deliver significant benefits to the business and incremental marketing spend for the third quarter that we announced in early September.\nNow moving on to the performance of our largest brands. Modelo Especial grew depletions by over 3% and upheld its position as the top share gainer in U.S. tracked channels. We continue to see a long growth runway ahead for Modelo Especial, a significant opportunity remains across key metrics like awareness, distribution and household penetration relative to competitive brands. While Corona Extra depletions declined approximately 1%, it continued to increase its dollar share as a top 10 gainer in the category. We remain positive about the outlook for Corona Extra's growth as it continues to be the most beloved beer brand in the U.S. and has responded well to the incremental marketing spend deployed in Q3, particularly around the World Series.\nPacifico delivered another quarter of very strong depletion growth of nearly 20% and remain the #4 dollar share gainer across the total beer category. We continue to build on the momentum of this brand in its core Southern California market, where it is already the #3 beer brand but still growing double digits. At the same time, we are strategically expanding Pacifico into key metro markets across the country using the same thoughtful approach we applied to Modelo Especial, seeking to balance rising awareness and demand with the appropriate increases in distribution to support sustainable long-term growth.\nOur Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of approximately 4% in depletions, and Limón y Sal remained a top 15 share gainer in the category. As noted earlier, our Chelada brands are facing a challenging consumer backdrop in the convenience channel, but we expect this to only be a near-term headwind and for the brands to return to the growth profile more in line with expectations provided at Investor Day.\nAll in, looking ahead, we aim to build on the sequential acceleration we have seen in volume growth across our core brands by continuing to make progress across the key volume growth drivers for the business, increased distribution, consumer-led innovation and attracting new legal drinking age consumers across our brands, as well as by deploying continued incremental marketing investments in Q4.\nMoving on to Wine and Spirits. As announced last month, our decision to divest SVEDKA builds on the actions we have taken over the past several years to align our Wine and Spirits portfolio with evolving consumer preferences and growing market sectors, focusing on higher-end brands. To that end, we are pleased to announce this morning the closing of that transaction, and we look forward to continuing to drive the growth of our higher-end craft spirits portfolio, which in the third quarter delivered a depletion increase of approximately 9%.\nConversely, the impact of ongoing consumer demand headwinds in the wine category, particularly in the lower-priced segments and of retailer inventory destocking remain the main drivers of a decline in Wine and Spirits shipments of 16% year-over-year, which in turn was the primary driver of the respective 14% and 25% declines in net sales and operating income for that business. Our Fine Wine portfolio, however, achieved depletion growth of 6%. And our largest premium wine brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford, delivered depletion increases of over 7%. This is aligned with our focus on delivering growth and improving margins by driving our higher-end brands and operating efficiencies while also seeking to deliver value from our mainstream brands.\nAgainst that backdrop, the business remains focused on continuing to advance in several areas. First, the tactical pricing and marketing support actions we are taking in selected markets to accelerate our top 10 largest brands; second, with better alignment with our distributor partners to help improve performance in our largest markets and channels; and third, cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives to drive leverage to the bottom line.\nIn light of continued consumer demand headwinds previously noted, we have updated our fiscal '25 outlook for wine and spirits business to net sales and operating income declines of 5% to 8% and and 17% to 19%, respectively.\nIn closing, we continue to manage a softer consumer backdrop due to macroeconomic headwinds and expect to deliver a very solid fiscal year underpinned by our continued progress against the key growth drivers of our beer business and our proactive actions to improve the performance of our wine and spirits business.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Garth, will give you more details on our financial results and outlook. Garth?\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion will focus primarily on comparable enterprise results accompanied by business segment details. Let's get started with our enterprise results. For the third quarter of fiscal '25, enterprise net sales were relatively unchanged year-over-year as moderated growth from our beer business was offset by the decline in our wine and spirits business. Enterprise operating income on a reported basis was in line with the prior year, and on a comparable basis, declined by 2%, reflecting growth from our beer business and favorability in corporate expense being more than offset by the decline in our wine and spirits business.\nComparable EPS was $3.25 for the quarter, and was relatively flat year-over-year as the decline in comparable operating income was offset by favorability in unconsolidated investments from the transition in our Canopy ownership to exchangeable shares and the impact of a more favorable comparable effective tax rate.\nBefore I get into the segment details, I would like to provide an update on our enterprise guidance for fiscal '25. We now expect Enterprise net sales growth of 2% to 5%, comparable operating income growth of 6% to 9% and comparable EPS to be between $13.40 and $13.80. These new Enterprise guidance targets reflect changes to the net sales and operating income growth targets for both business segments that Bill referenced earlier as well as a few additional updates that I will cover in more detail shortly.\nNow diving into the business segment details for the quarter. Starting with our beer business. Net sales grew by 3%, a $64 million increase, driven by beer shipment volume growth of 1.6%, a price uplift of 2% or $39 million from targeted actions taken during the fall and a 30 basis point headwind from unfavorable mix as consumers continue to shift to value-oriented larger pack size, particularly in cans. Beer depletions grew 3.2%, an acceleration from Q2 but reflected the ongoing consumer dynamics that Bill discussed. Regarding selling days, they were flat in the third quarter. And as a reminder, for the full year, there will be 1 less selling day, which already transpired in Q2.\nOur on-premise depletions grew nearly 5% and accounted for over 11% of our total volumes supported by Modelo Especial and Pacifico as the top 2 dollar share gainers in draft and Corona Extra maintaining its top spot in packaged on-premise. Off-premise depletions grew nearly 3% and accounted for approximately 89% of our total volumes. Within the off-premise channels, independent retailers not captured in Circana data achieved a lower growth rate, mainly driven by convenience and liquor store channels in most of our top 10 markets as well as independent grocers in our top state of California. Across these key states, unemployment rates for both total and Hispanic consumers remained elevated relative to the national average, which we continue to believe is a fundamental near-term driver for the relatively lower depletion growth rates we have seen in these markets over our last couple of fiscal quarters. However, as Bill noted, it is uncertain whether consumers in these states and channels will revert to more normalized purchase behaviors in the near term, we do not anticipate these trends to be a structural headwind over the longer term.\nOn that note, shifting to our full year expectations for top line drivers. While the third quarter beer shipments were outpaced by depletions due to normal seasonality and planned maintenance at our breweries, we continue to expect full year absolute shipment and depletion volumes to be closely aligned. And also from a full year perspective, as Bill noted, we now expect net sales for our beer business to be 4% to 7%, inclusive of 1% to 2% pricing.\nMoving to beer operating income and margins. Operating income grew by 2%, and we had a 60 basis point per year -- per year-over-year decline in operating margin to 37.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by increased marketing investments. Improvement in gross profit was largely a result of the previously mentioned net sales drivers and a $40 million benefit from ongoing cost savings and efficiency initiatives, partially offset by an absolute COGS increase of nearly 1%, excluding these savings. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was just over 10% for the quarter, driven by the incremental marketing actions that Bill discussed. Our full year expectation for marketing expense as a percent of net sales remains approximately 8.5%.\nOther SG&A expense was 5% as a percentage of net sales in line with our unchanged full year expectation. From a fiscal '25 full year perspective, in terms of operating income, we now expect our beer business to grow between 9% to 12%, while our operating margin expectation remains unchanged at approximately 39%.\nShifting to our wine and spirits business. Net sales declined just over 14% in the third quarter, largely driven by shipment volume decline of over 16%. The volume decline was largely a result of the ongoing category headwinds in the wine category, particularly in the U.S. wholesale market from weaker consumer demand, as well as continued inventory destocking by retailers. Despite these persistent challenges, we continue to expect improved organic shipment volume growth performance in our wine and spirits business in the fourth quarter as we anticipate more fully realizing the benefits of the pricing, marketing and distributor initiatives we launched at the beginning of this fiscal year, while also benefiting from the historical seasonal trends of the business.\nAdditionally, retailer inventory destocking has broadly started to stabilize, which we expect will result in additional tailwinds to support demand growth moving forward. As Bill noted, for fiscal '25, we now expect wine and shipments organic net sales to decline 5% to 8%, reflecting persistent volume headwinds in the wine category, and excluding $23 million of net sales following the recently closed divestiture of SVEDKA.\nOperating income for the wine and spirits business declined by $32 million, resulting in an operating margin of 22.1%. This decline was primarily driven by a decline in overall shipment volumes. Marketing expense for the wine and spirits segment as a percentage of net sales was just over 11% and remains elevated above our medium-term target as increased investments in our largest brands continue. The vast majority of which are for our higher-end brands. Other SG&A as a percentage of net sales was over 14%, consistent with our medium-term targets.\nIn line with the adjustments to our net sales expectations, we are now expecting fiscal '25 operating income for our wine and spirits business to decline 17% to 19%, excluding $10 million of gross profit less marketing of th SVEDKA brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture.\nShifting to the balance of the P&L. Corporate expense for the third quarter was $63 million, a 3% decrease driven by lower compensation and benefits, partially offset by higher consulting services and increased depreciation expense as a result of our corporate headquarters relocation. Following this decrease, we have updated our fiscal '25 corporate expense outlook to be $250 million. Interest expense remained flat year-over-year and for the quarter was $104 million. For the full year, given continued favorability from lower average borrowings and adjustments related to capitalized interest, we now expect our fiscal '25 interest expense to be $410 million. Comparable effective tax rate was 16.3% compared to 18% for the corresponding quarter last year, and we continue to expect our full year comparable tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.\nWrapping up with free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We generated year-to-date free cash flow of $1.6 billion for fiscal '25, a 13% year-over-year increase. This strong cash flow generation has enabled us to reach and maintain a net leverage ratio below our stated target, return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases through November of 2024 and continue to advance our brewery investments in a disciplined and agile manner.\nAs we look to the remainder of fiscal '25, we now expect to deliver annual operating cash flow of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, both above our initial targets, and to continue to deploy that cash with a balanced and thoughtful approach to capital allocation.\nWith regards to our brewery expansions and given our agile modular approach to these projects, we have shifted the completion and planned start-up of our latest addition at our existing breweries in Mexico from the end of fiscal '25 to fiscal '26. The timing of our new brewery in Veracruz remains on track with the completion of the initial phase of that facility anticipated by late fiscal '26 or early fiscal '27. While the timing adjustment of the existing breweries expansion has shifted some of our beer CapEx, we previously anticipated for fiscal '25 into fiscal '26, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $3 billion in CapEx between fiscal '25 and fiscal '28.\nIn closing, we made strong progress against our strategic initiatives this quarter and maintain a solid growth trajectory for the enterprise. We continue to invest behind the momentum of our brands, drive operational efficiencies and maintain cost discipline and provide strong cash generation while still executing against our capital allocation priorities as we have done for the last several years. We will continue to closely monitor the subdued spend and value-seeking trends we have seen develop across our consumer base and the economic drivers influencing that behavior as well as other possible macro shifts, particularly any changes arising from potential tariff policies. As always, we will seek to balance our consumer obsession and our value creation commitment to our stakeholders as we focus on executing against our strategy and stated priorities.\nThank you all for your continued support as we approach the close of fiscal '25. With that, Bill and I will now be happy to take your questions. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Snehal Shah, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Shah, you may now begin.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning all, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Year-End Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.\nAs a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in today's news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.\nPlease note, when we discuss comparable earnings per share figures for fiscal 2024 and prior fiscal years, we are referring to earnings per share on a comparable basis, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call.\nFollowing the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us to end our call on time today. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nehal, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal '24 year-end earnings call. As usual, I'd like to start with a few headlines from this past fiscal year.\nFirst, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of strong performance in fiscal '24. We drove comparable earnings per share growth of nearly 9% and remain focused on achieving our stated medium-term target of low double-digit comparable EPS growth moving forward. This growth was supported by a net sales increase of 5% at an enterprise level and solid operating leverage that resulted in an increase of 7% in comparable operating income, representing an enterprise comparable operating margin of nearly 33%.\nThis performance once again yielded recognition for Constellation Brands as the #1 growth leader among large CPG companies by Circana in calendar year '23 as we have been 5 of the last 7 years. We are the only CPG company of scale to make their top 10 ranking for 11 consecutive years.\nOur continued strong performance and momentum heading into fiscal '25 reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver against the following targets outlined at our Investor Day this past November maintaining 6% to 8% enterprise net sales growth, delivering 33% to 35% enterprise comparable operating income margin and generating low double-digit comparable earnings per share growth, all of which we intend to achieve in fiscal '25.\nSecond, from a segment perspective, our fiscal '24 results were largely driven by our beer business, which delivered net sales and operating income growth above 9% and 8%, respectively, both exceeding our expectations from the beginning of the year. This strong performance drove our largest dollar share gain ever for a full fiscal year, adding an impressive 2 points of dollar share within the U.S. beer category and we achieved a significant milestone this year as Modelo Especial became the #1 beer in U.S. dollar sales.\nFurthermore, across all beverage alcohol our beer business was the #1 dollar share gainer, capturing 1.1 points of share and driving nearly 70% of the total dollar growth in the sector. This was truly a remarkable achievement by our entire beer team working in concert with our distributor and retail partners as they delivered volume growth for the 14th consecutive year which is certainly another incredible differentiator among CPG companies.\nIn our Wine and Spirits business, we faced a series of near-term category headwinds throughout fiscal '24, but remain confident that our strategy is sound. We recently promoted San Glaser to serve as our new President of Wine and Spirits. He is a well-rounded and accomplished industry veteran with nearly 30 years of experience in the wine and spirits category and a successful track record of driving commercial and operational efficiency and effectiveness.\nSam also played an integral role in the implementation of the business transformation over the last few years, leading our global end-to-end supply chain optimization initiatives and building a world-class farming, winemaking and distilling network, aligned to consumer preferences while developing a focused international route to market to deliver incremental growth for the business in the medium term.\nNow with the strategic transformation of our Wine and Spirits portfolio is largely complete, Sam is well positioned to lead our team in driving enhanced focus on execution, and the delivery of growth and improved profitability. To that end, our Wine and Spirits team has identified several immediate actions to help drive improvement in our year-over-year top line performance, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.\nThird, we continue to achieve superior cash flow generation and deployed that cash in a disciplined and balanced manner, underpinned by our consistent capital allocation priorities. For fiscal '24, we generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow, and we're able to reduce our net leverage ratio by nearly 0.5 point while returning over $900 million back to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nWe also continue to prudently invest to support the ongoing growth with total capital expenditures of nearly $1.3 billion in fiscal '24, most of which was focused on capacity additions to our beer brewing operations. And fourth, we continued to deliver against our environmental, social and governance objectives, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.\nWith that as a backdrop, let's turn to a more detailed discussion of our fiscal '24 performance, starting with our Beer business, which despite some challenging weather in our fourth quarter, grew depletions by 9%, resulting in our 56th consecutive quarter of depletions growth. For the full year, we continue to extend our lead as the #1 high-end beer supplier in the U.S. delivering top share gains across the total beer category, underpinned by a nearly 14% increase in dollar sales and nearly 11% volume growth across tracked channels.\nAnd in line with our expectations, we captured low double-digit percent incremental shelf space this spring while adding another 21,000 resets through our shopper-first shelf program in fiscal '24. These factors all played a significant role in driving the growth of our beer business paired with the strength of our portfolio's iconic brands starting with Modelo Especial, which grew depletions by nearly 10% and maintained its leading position as the top share gainer and as noted earlier, the #1 overall beer brand in U.S. tracked channels.\nCorona Extra increased depletions nearly 1% and maintained its position as the #3 high-end beer brand in the U.S. and Pacifico delivered depletion growth over 17% and as it reached the 20 million case sold milestone and remained a top 10 share gainer across the total beer category and the #4 share gainer in the high end. While we continue to build on the success of our iconic brands, we are also building good traction with our focused innovations aligned with consumer-led trends of premiumization, flavor and betterment.\nOur Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of 30% in depletions also surpassing 20 million cases sold and remained the #1 Chelada in the category supported by the launch of our new flavor and new pack size offerings. We are excited to continue to build on that momentum in fiscal '25 with 2 new flavors Pacific Conte and Negra Con Chile. Modelo Oro's national launch established a strong foundation for the brand as it rose to become a top 5 share gainer across the total beer category and the #3 share gainer in the high end with just 2 SKUs.\nGiven that strong reception and ongoing consumer demand for betterment products, we are launching 2 more Modelo Oro SKUs in fiscal '25, an 18-pack and a 24-pack. Staying within the Modelo brand family, our new Aguas Frescas variety pack secured the #1 new FMB spot in its test market of Nevada. So on fiscal '25, we will be expanding its rollout to another 20 markets for this authentic liquid aligned with consumer-led flavor trends and featuring our project, our Nitro technology.\nIn our Corona brand family, we introduced Corona nonalcoholic, which is the leading dollar share gainer in the fast-growing nonalcoholic beer segment. As for fiscal '25, we are testing Corona Sunrun in select Eastern markets. This new refreshing beer is brewed with real citrus peels and a splash of real citrus juice.\nThe strong execution of our Beer business in fiscal '24 was also reflected in our ability to maintain best-in-class margins like combating, trailing inflation headwinds with cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We also continued to invest in our beer business in fiscal '24, deploying approximately $950 million in capital expenditures, supporting our ability to meet the continued robust demand we see for our brands through the expansion of our beer brewing capacity at Nava and Obregon and the ongoing work at our new Aracruz site.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '25 and in line with the plan we laid out at our Investor Day in November, we expect our beer business to remain within our net sales growth algorithm of 7% to 9% and for operating margins to gradually improve, supported by our operating income growth of 10% to 12%.\nMoving on to Wine and Spirits. Due largely to the challenging market dynamics referenced earlier, our Wine and Spirits business saw declines of approximately 8% for both organic net sales and operating income but still landed within our revised guidance range. While we do not expect ongoing challenges in the Wine and Spirits category to immediately subside, particularly in the mainstream and premium price segments.\nWe have identified several areas to improve the performance of our Wine and Spirits business in fiscal '25, including, but not limited to, refocusing our efforts within our premium and above brands, to more consistently drive growth in our most scaled and central offerings, notably in Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner, High West and while accelerating additional tactical investments to revitalize the equity and support demand for our largest mainstream brand, Woodbridge and ensuring that we continue to support the transformation of other significant brands in our portfolio such as by Robert Mondavi; Ruffino and Lumina.\nNote that these 11 brands represent 3/4 of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our Wine and Spirits business in fiscal '24, which is why we plan to provide more focus and investment for them. Another key area we are focused on is aligning with our U.S. wholesale distributor partners on clear priorities to help enhance our performance in our largest markets and channels.\nAs noted in our prior call, these priorities include enhanced focus on improving mix, inventory and sales execution. We will also be making additional investments in media spend and price promotions as well as adjustments in our own sales capabilities to better support the execution and go-to-market efforts of our distributor partners. And similar to our Beer business, we will continue to focus more broadly on efficiency opportunities to drive operational and sales excellence across our Wine and Spirits segment.\nThis will include the operational and supply chain initiatives highlighted at our Investor Day as well as enhancements to the business's organizational structure to enable a more effective and competitive operating model. Looking forward to fiscal '25, we expect our Wine and Spirits business net sales to be relatively stable and operating income to be down 9% to 11%.\nWhile we believe the focus on sales execution, I just outlined will help stabilize the top line growth for Wine and Spirits. Our operating income guidance reflects incremental investments in additional media spend price promotions and sales capabilities as well as continued inflationary pressures on some cost of goods sold and lapping of distributor contractual payments and reduced incentive compensation that occurred in fiscal '24.\nAs we noted, we remain committed to continuing to advance this business over the coming years toward the medium-term targets shared at our Investor Day. Moving on to capital allocation. we continue to deliver against our stated priorities and targets in fiscal '24. As noted earlier, we further strengthened our balance sheet with a reduction in our net leverage ratio, supported by our strong earnings performance and our disciplined debt management.\nWe returned cash to shareholders and deployed most of our capital investments to brewery expansions to support the growth of our beer business, and we continue to conduct tuck-in gap-filling acquisitions that are aligned with consumer-led trends and complemented our portfolio. We also made notable progress in regards to our environmental, social and governance ambitions in fiscal '24.\nFrom a governance perspective, our Board undertook refreshment actions that resulted in the appointment of 2 new independent directors, each with strong financial backgrounds. We also recently announced the election of a new independent Board Chair who brings a wealth of senior leadership experience from the CPG sector.\nIn addition, in line with our commitment to be good stewards of the environment, since we had surpassed our initial water restoration target in fiscal '23, we established a new goal of restoring more than 5 billion gallons of water to key water sheds near our operations between the time frame covering fiscal '23 and '25. This goal is designed to ensure local residents and businesses have ample supply and access to water, which is the key to building sustainable and thriving communities.\nFinally, we announced 2 new environmental commitments in fiscal '24 to reduce waste within our key operating facilities and to enhance circular packaging. So in summary, we once again achieved another strong year of performance and significant progress across our strategic initiatives in fiscal '24, and we fully expect to build on this momentum in fiscal '25. We are confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value and deliver on our commitments, including achieving low double-digit comparable EPS growth by generating high single-digit net sales growth and delivering best-in-class margins for our beer business, managing category challenges and improving the growth trajectory of our Wine and Spirits business with enhanced execution and maintaining our capital allocation discipline and commitment to operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world.\nAs I wrap up, I want to once again thank all of our colleagues across Constellation as well as our trade partners for their hard work and dedication in helping us deliver another year of industry-leading performance, and I believe we are well positioned to keep that momentum going in fiscal '25.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Garth, who will give more details on our financial results and outlook.\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion will focus mainly on our comparable P&L results, starting at an enterprise level by business segment detail for fiscal '24. I will then discuss our fiscal '25 outlook and expectations in the same matter.\nStarting with net sales. As an enterprise, we delivered growth of over 5% slightly exceeding our fiscal '24 guidance range of 4% to 5%. This was driven by the strong performance of our beer business, which grew net sales over 9%, exceeding our guidance of 8% to 9%. As Bill mentioned, our Beer business had another strong year of depletion growth, a 7.5% increase as the strength of our portfolio carried throughout the entire year. Off-premise depletions grew by over 8%, which represent nearly 89% of our total depletion volume. The on-premise accounts for the balance of our depletions and grew by over 1%.\nWe expect to build on our momentum in off-premise channels, supported by the low double-digit incremental shelf space that we captured this spring, which we foreshadowed at our Investor Day last November. And we continue to see opportunity to drive growth in the on-premise with new draft handles particularly from Modelo Especial and Pacifico in the coming fiscal year.\nI will elaborate on fiscal '25 shortly. Shipment volumes for our beer business in fiscal '24 grew 7.4%, and we achieved favorable pricing of 2%. These volume and pricing increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our craft beer business and an unfavorable shift in product mix. In aggregate, the volume, price and mix changes amounted to a nearly $700 million increase in beer net sales for fiscal '24.\nIn regards to selling days, we had 1 extra sell day in the year, which occurred in Q4. This had a minimal impact on our volumes as shipments and depletions on an absolute basis were over 99% aligned for the year. For our Wine and Spirits business, net sales declined 9% and 8% on a reported and organic basis, respectively. The change in organic net sales for our Wine and Spirits business was within our lowered guidance range of a 7% to 9% decline. This decline was largely driven by unfavorable U.S. wholesale performance, particularly across our mainstream and premium brands.\nAs Bill noted, we are working with our U.S. wholesale distributor partners to enhance performance in our largest markets and channels in fiscal '25. Additionally, in our international markets, net sales for fiscal '24 were down 7% by destocking, particularly in Canada, our largest export market. More recently, in Q4, net sales from our international markets grew 14% largely driven by the Canadian market where inventory levels have begun to normalize.\nThe net sales decline in our U.S. wholesale and international markets were partially offset by 10% net sales growth in our direct-to-consumer channel. Moving on to our operating income and margin. At an enterprise-wide level, we delivered a 7% increase in comparable operating income at the upper end of our 6% to 7% guidance resulting in a 50 basis point increase in comparable operating margin to 32.6%. This was driven by the strong performance of our beer business, which grew operating income by just over 8% and delivered an operating margin of 37.9%.\nEnterprise-wide operating margins also benefited from an 11% reduction or $30 million decrease in corporate expense driven mainly by reduced third-party consulting fees related to our DBA project spend. This solid performance was partially offset by our Wine and Spirits results, as operating income, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, declined by 8%.\nThis decline was within our lower guidance range of a 6% to 8% decline, resulting in a flat year-over-year operating margin of 22.2%. Elaborating on the margin puts and takes in more detail, starting the beer business. The increase in operating income and slight 40 basis point decrease in operating margin were reflective of an absolute increase of approximately 12% in overall COGS. This increase in COGS includes the impact of increased volume and the nearly $205 million from cost savings initiatives realized in fiscal '24.\nBy COGS component and on an absolute basis, inclusive of both volume growth and cost savings year-over-year changes were as follows: raw materials and packaging represented the midpoint of 55% to 60% of total COGS and had an absolute increase of 16%. Logistics making up just over 20% of total COGS increased 3% as a large portion of the benefits from our cost savings agenda came from this area. Labor and overhead landed at just under 15% of total COGS and increased 19% attributable to the construction activities at our Veracruz brewery. And the remaining portion of total COGS depreciation increased approximately $37 million, representing the incremental capacity that was brought online in fiscal '24.\nMoving on to marketing. Our dollar spend increased by approximately 2% year-over-year. As a percent of fiscal '24 net sales, marketing was approximately 8.5%, coming in slightly below our medium-term 9% algorithm partly driven by the divestiture of our craft beer brands and efficiencies from the transition to our new media agency. Lastly, SG&A, which represented approximately 5% of net sales increased approximately 8%, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and increased compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by benefits from the craft beer divestiture and lower legal fees.\nMoving on. Our Wine and Spirits business operating income margin, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following last year's divestiture remained flat year-over-year as the volume decline and unfavorable channel mix were offset by favorability in our COGS, driven by nearly $40 million coming from our cost savings initiatives, favorable pricing, reduced other SG&A expenses and a reduction in marketing expense.\nInterest expense for fiscal '24 was about $435 million, a 9% increase from prior year driven by higher average borrowings and weighted average interest rates. We ended fiscal '24 with our comparable net leverage ratio, excluding Canopy equity and earnings of 3.2x, leaving us well positioned to achieve our target of approximately 3x in fiscal '25.\nOur comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was 18.5% versus 19.2% last year. Comparable EPS for fiscal '24, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $12.38 and came in above our guidance range of $12 to $12.20.\nMoving to fiscal '24 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow slightly over $1.5 billion, exceeding our $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion guidance range. Free cash flow decreased 12% year-over-year, driven by a 23% increase in CapEx investments attributable to our expansions at our existing facilities and the ongoing construction of our new Ruri and Veracruz.\nIn fiscal '24, we increased our total nominal capacity from our Mexico brewery operations from 42 million hectoliters to approximately 48 million hectoliters as a result of the modular expansions brought online over the summer that were fully ramped by year-end along with unlocked incremental capacity through our optimization initiatives. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we once again delivered cash returns to our shareholders with over $900 million of expenditures in dividends and share repurchases.\nIn addition, we executed portfolio gap filling transactions, encompassing both a tuck-in acquisition of a female and black founded luxury wine brand with a successful track record and a venture investment in the high-growth nonalcoholic space in fiscal '24.\nWith that, let me now step through our outlook for fiscal '25, starting with net sales. We are targeting our enterprise-wide net sales to grow 6% to 7% and inclusive of a 7% to 9% growth target for our beer business and a 0.5% decline to 0.5% growth in net sales for our Wine and Spirits business. The beer top line outlook is expected to be primarily achieved by continued strong volume growth of our portfolio. Again, we expect this to come from distribution of our largest brands bolstered by spring shelf reset gains, the health and continued support of our consumers and innovation in the form of brand extensions, new-to-world products and new pack sizes.\nRegarding beer volumes. We anticipate fiscal '25 shipments and depletions to track closely on an absolute basis, consistent with prior years. Similarly, we expect the cadence of our shipments and depletions in terms of share of annual volumes from a quarter and a half year perspective to be fairly in line with fiscal '24. For Wine and Spirits net sales, we expect to largely offset ongoing category headwinds and as we drive the sales and marketing execution initiatives described by Bill earlier.\nAdditionally, we expect mix-related benefits due to the better performance in our higher-end brands. That said, we continue to anticipate overall volume growth to remain challenged, particularly due to demand headwinds in the mainstream and premium price segments, which account for a major part of our volumes. Furthermore, from a net sales perspective, we are expecting unfavorable lapping of bulk sales through fiscal '24.\nFrom a cadence perspective, we also expect quarterly and half yearly shipments and depletion shares of the full year total to be fairly aligned with fiscal '24. For fiscal '25 operating income, we expect comparable enterprise-wide growth between 8% and 10%, reflecting 10% to 12% operating income growth for our beer business in 9% to 11% operating income decline for our wine and spirits business and a slight increase in corporate expense to approximately $260 million.\nFor our beer business, we anticipate operating income tailwinds from volume growth and favorable pricing. We expect these tailwinds will be partially offset by continued input cost inflation with an absolute increase in COGS, inclusive of volume growth, cost savings initiatives and our multiyear hedging actions in the high single digits. We expect the following percent of total COGS and absolute increases across each component for packaging and raw materials to account for 55% to 60% and increase mid- to high single digits.\nLogistics to make up approximately 20% and increased mid-single digits. Labor and overhead to be approximately 15%, an increase in the high teens primarily driven by merit salary increases given the strong operational performance from the business and incremental headcount, primarily at our Veracruz brewery as we continue with construction. And the remainder of COGS depreciation with a mid-single-digit increase, which approximately equates to a $20 million step-up which is slightly lower than recent years given prior depreciation of the packaging line of the ABA facility that was operational throughout all of fiscal '24.\nOutside of COGS, we expect marketing expense as a percent of net sales to be approximately 8.5%, which is lower than our unchanged medium-term algorithm of 9%. The change of marketing expense as a percent of net sales for fiscal '25 is driven by a shift in our marketing investment allocation with an overall focus on maximizing value.\nThe investment shift is geared towards prioritizing our largest brands to support their continued momentum, followed by our high-growth potential NextWave brands and then thoughtful and deliberate investments to support our innovation pipeline and savings driven by efficiencies from our new media agency partnership announced in Q3 of fiscal '24. Rounding out for operating margin drivers, we anticipate SG&A as a percent of net sales to be approximately 5%, in line with the medium-term algorithm we provided during our Investor Day.\nAll in, this implies beer operating margins of approximately 39% as our beer business continues to generate best-in-class operating margins and year-over-year improvement as we close in on our medium-term targets. For our Wine and Spirits business, operating income -- we anticipate an overall COGS increase of mid- to high single digits, driven by less favorable fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volumes and higher seller overhead and blend costs partially offset by favorability in logistics and packaging costs as part of our cost savings initiatives.\nFor marketing and other SG&A expense as a percent of net sales, we anticipate 9% and 10%, respectively, each slightly above our medium-term outlook, driven by the adjustments to our marketing, pricing and sales investments to drive top line growth and partially offset by organizational structure changes, both points previously referenced by Bill. In addition, we expect to face headwinds from unfavorable lapping of contractual distributor payments and lower compensation and benefits in FY '24. That said, this implies Wine and Spirits operating margins to contract to approximately 20% in fiscal '25 as we continue to navigate category headwinds and reset investment in certain marketing and sales activities.\nWe believe our enhanced focus on execution and planned cost savings can provide margin improvement over the medium term toward the targets outlined at our Investor Day in November. Corporate expense is anticipated to increase slightly as we continue to invest in the business while reducing third-party fees more broadly. We expect interest expense to be approximately $445 million to $455 million, driven by higher weighted average interest rates, and we expect our comparable effective tax rate to remain unchanged coming in at approximately 18.5%.\nWe expect noncontrolling interest to be about $35 million and anticipated weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal '25 to be around 183 million, inclusive of share repurchase activity. Based on these assumptions, we expect our reported EPS to be between $13.40 and $13.70 and our comparable EPS to be between $13.50 and $13.80, representing a 10% midpoint increase year-over-year.\nFrom a cash flow perspective, we expect our free cash flow in fiscal '25 to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, reflective of $2.8 billion to $3 billion of operating cash flow net of CapEx spend of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the expansions of our existing breweries and the ongoing construction in Veracruz. We anticipate approximately $3 billion of remaining CapEx spend from fiscal '25 to fiscal '28 with fiscal '25 expected to be the peak spend year as we progress with the construction of our greenfield site in Veracruz.\nAnd consistent with our Investor Day messaging, we expect a step-up in free cash flow that should yield cumulatively between $7 billion to $9 billion from fiscal '26 to fiscal '28.\nTo conclude, we ended fiscal '24 with strong results driven by continued outstanding growth in our beer business as its core brands reached new milestones in cases sold in market share. Our Wine and Spirits business faced difficult market conditions in FY '24, but we've identified key actions to improve execution and performance.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal '25, we are confident that we can deliver against our plan with strong enterprise results aligned with our medium-term targets, execute our capital allocation priorities, and seek to create value for our shareholders. We thank you for your ongoing support throughout fiscal '24 and look forward to updating you on our progress and success in fiscal '25.\nWith that, Bill and I are happy to answer your questions."

Welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Pleas note that this call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Joseph Suarez, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Dara. Good morning, all, and happy new year. Welcome to Constellation Brands Q3 Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call.\nBefore turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and congratulations on your recent promotion, and good morning all. Happy new year to everyone, and welcome to our Q3 fiscal '24 call. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday season, and we're able to enjoy some of our great products with your family and friends. We have several topics to address on today's call. So let's start with the key takeaways for this quarter.\nFirst, I am pleased to report that our beer business again delivered very strong performance that accelerated throughout Q3. We achieved depletion growth of over 8% for our beer portfolio with a particularly outstanding end to the month of November. We led Thanksgiving beer sales in U.S. tracked channels and continue to see accelerating momentum in the last week of the month, reflecting both ongoing strong consumer demand and restocking after the earlier Thanksgiving holiday this year. And once again, for another entire quarter, we achieved leading share gains in tracked channels with more than 2-point expansion in the U.S. beer category and a nearly 3-point gain in the higher end. This marks the 55th consecutive quarter of depletion growth for our beer business and the tenth leading share gains. Secondly, in line with our consistent disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. We executed $215 million of share repurchases in Q3 while maintaining our net leverage ratio excluding Canopy equity and earnings, unchanged from last quarter at 3.2x.\nAs well as continuing to deliver cash returns through our dividend and advancing our organic growth investments at our Obregon brewery and new brewery site in Veracruz to support additional production capacity for our beer business. And thirdly, as noted at our recent Investor Day, over the past few months, our wine and spirits business, much like others across the industry has seen a broader marketplace deceleration. In light of these and other near-term headwinds, we are further revising our fiscal '24 organic net sales guidance for wine and spirits to be down 7% to 9% and the operating income guidance for that business, excluding gross profit less marketing of brands divested last year to be down 6% to 8%, which I will elaborate on shortly.\nOf course, we are not pleased with these revisions, and both our leadership team and our wine and spirits teams remain fully committed to improving the performance of this business and to achieving its medium-term targets. In addition, as announced earlier today, Robert Hansen has elected to step down from his role as President of our wine and spirits business in a few weeks at the end of the current fiscal year. We have initiated a process to identify a successor for this role, and I will step in to lead the wine and spirits business in the interim while, of course, retaining my chief executive oversight across both the enterprise and our beer business.\nDespite these revisions and leadership changes, as noted at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that over the medium term, our wine and spirits business should accelerate its net sales growth to 1% to 3% and improve operating margins to 25% to 26% and supported by the significant transformation undertaken over the last few years to better align our portfolio with broader consumer-led premiumization trends, expand our omnichannel capabilities, and extend into targeted international markets.\nMore importantly, in fiscal '24, we still expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance, excluding Canopy to remain within our previously stated range of $12.20. And over the medium term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth, as outlined at our Investor Day. Now let's step through these key points for Q3 in more detail. As noted, our beer team once again delivered remarkable results. Modelo Especial led the charge, achieving a roughly 12% increase in depletions and remained the leading share gaining brand and track channel dollar sales. Strengthening its position as the #1 beer brand in the U.S. market, having ultimately achieved that top spot now on a 52-week basis.\nThe broader Modelo brand family also delivered phenomenal results. Chelada's achieved an increase in depletions of approximately 22% year-over-year in Q3 and on a rolling 12-month basis, the combined set of Chelada flavors and pack sizes reached the 20 million case milestone, which is over 350% more than that set of brands was doing just 5 years ago in fiscal '19. Additionally, Modelo Chelada Especial our original flavor, which was recently launched in a 12 pack 12-ounce format was a top 15 share gainer in [indiscernible in Q3, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for our new Chelada flavor and pack size additions.\nAlso in the Modelo family, oral continued its strong first year of going national with a third quarter as a top 5 share gainer in the high end. We look forward to the growth opportunities ahead for oral as awareness grows and we introduce new pet sizes next fiscal year. Beyond Modelo, our Corona Extra and Pacifico core beer brands continued to perform strongly in Q3. Corona Extra maintained depletion growth at about 1%, while Pacifico delivered an outstanding 19% increase. And on a rolling 12-month basis, Pacifico also reached the $20 million case milestone double its volume from 5 years ago. In addition, both brands remain top 10 share gainers across the entire U.S. beer market and track dollar sales.\nOur beer brands clearly continue to resonate strongly with the consumer, and I'm incredibly proud of and thankful to our entire beer team for their consistently strong execution. With that backdrop, we remain confident in our fiscal '24 net sales growth guidance of 8% to 9% and from an operating income guidance perspective, we now expect our beer business to deliver 7% to 8% growth for fiscal '24 as we realize additional benefits this year from the marketing effectiveness actions discussed during our Investor Day.\nOver the medium term, we still see significant opportunities to continue to achieve net sales growth of 7% to 9% in our beer business supported by the fundamental distribution, innovation and demographic drivers as well as consumer-led trends also discussed at our recent Investor Day as well as to continue to achieve best-in-class operating margins of 39% to 40%, supported by savings and efficiency initiatives across our cost of goods sold, marketing and broader SG&A. And last but not least, we continue to support the growth of our beer business through modular investments in brewing capacity and productivity initiatives to unlock further production upside.\nMoving on to the wine and spirits business. As noted earlier, our wine and spirits business is operating amid a broader marketplace deceleration. As we have shared in recent quarters, we are actively working to address mainstream headwinds affecting our 2 largest volume brands, Woodridge and [indiscernible] However, we anticipate these efforts to extend beyond fiscal '24. More broadly, while we are maintaining a disciplined approach to taking price across our portfolio, the competitive environment is now adding pressure with more aggressive discounting and price points beyond mainstream.\nAgain, we believe the broader decelerization in these higher-end categories to be temporary and have continued to execute strategic pricing actions instead of implementing reductions like certain competitors. In addition, we have made the decision to adjust some aspects of our U.S. wholesale distributor agreements, focused on improving mix, inventory and state and channel level sales execution. We are actively engaged with our largest distributor partner to ensure that our portfolio continues to make progress against our vision of leading the higher end as well as on the revitalization of our mainstream brands.\nFrom an international perspective, while we experienced a decline in the quarter driven by previously noted weakness in our more mature markets, inventory levels in Canada, our largest export market, seem to now be normalizing following the destocking from recent changes to inventory regulations, so we anticipate more balanced supply and demand dynamics for this market going forward. Importantly, despite the impact of these near-term headwinds on organic net sales, our prudent pricing and cost efficiency efforts enabled margin improvement for wine and spirits in Q3.\nBeyond these near-term challenges, our focus remains on driving growth across our higher-end brands. As shared during Investor Day, over the last few years, our wine and spirits business has established a stronger foundation to advance toward these targets. Since fiscal '19, we have doubled the number of fine wine and craft spirits brands in our portfolio, and we have invested and expanded our footprint in higher-growth DTC channels and targeted international markets. With our structural transformation securely in place, I want to thank Robert Hanson for his contributions over many years including initially as a nonexecutive member of the Board. We wish Robert Wealth and all the best in his future endeavors and look forward to announcing the appointment of our next Wine and Spirits business President in the near future.\nLastly, I'd like to emphasize again our unwavering commitment to our consistent, balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As noted at our Investor Day event, we continue to target a strong balance sheet that supports our investment-grade rating, and we are working toward a net leverage ratio of 3x which we expect to achieve within fiscal '25. We expect to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 30%, supporting continued growth of our dividend per share in line with our earnings expectations.\nWe plan to invest approximately $5 billion in growth and maintenance CapEx from fiscal '24 to fiscal '28 primarily focused on growing capacity expansions for our beer business. We continue to opportunistically buy back shares with $215 million repurchased in Q3 and which leaves us with an additional $2.6 billion still within our existing share repurchase authorization. And finally, we continue to look at tuck-in gap-filling M&A opportunities with a highly rigorous transaction criteria. So to close, let's go back to the key takeaways for the quarter. First, we have a beer portfolio and team that consistently delivers industry-leading performance and we see significant opportunities, as outlined at our Investor Day to continue to drive similarly strong growth over the medium term.\nSecond, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders through consistent execution of our balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities. And third, our wine and spirits business is focused on realizing net sales growth and improved operating margins by leveraging its reshaped higher-end leaning portfolio as well as our enhanced DTC channel and international market footprints and capability. And lastly and importantly, we continue to expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance in fiscal '24, excluding Canopy to remain within our previously stated range of $12 to $12.20 and over the medium term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth, as we outlined at our Investor Day. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in greater detail. Garth?\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion on our financial performance will mainly focus on comparable basis results and stepping through our P&L. However, as of this quarter, we will discuss enterprise results, followed by business segment detail to better address our performance against the outlook shared at our Investor Day at these different levels. Beginning with net sales. We achieved enterprise-wide top line growth of 1% for the quarter. This was the result of solid beer net sales growth of 4%, partially offset by the Line & Spirits net sales decline of 8%. Wine & Spirits net sales decline was 7% on an organic basis.\nAs Bill noted, beer business depletions for the quarter were above 8% and as the year-over-year growth momentum from summer continued through the fall, supported by ongoing strong consumer demand of our portfolio. Again, we saw a particular acceleration in depletion volumes at the end of November as we extended our leadership across key holidays with outstanding performance during U.S. Thanksgiving. Our on-premise channel realized modest growth in depletions of about 1% for Q3 and accounted for approximately 11% of our total volumes as we've been able to replenish inventories following the keg disruption over the summer and began to advance growth and draft performance in the on-premise.\nShipment volumes for beer business grew 3.4%, and we achieved favorable pricing slightly above 1% as we began to lap the elevated pricing increases from last fall. These volume and pricing uplifts were partially offset by a shift in packaging mix. Altogether, these year-over-year shipment pricing and mix changes drove the 4% or approximately $77 million increase in beer net sales for the quarter. For our wine and spirits business, Organic net sales declined 7%, driven by lower shipment volumes due to the previously referenced category headwinds and the change in our process aimed at aligning shipments and depletions.\nAs a reminder, per prior calls this year, we now make quarterly shipment adjustments to align with depletions versus our former practice of only doing 1 annual adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter. We believe this process change has partially driven less favorable comparisons for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2024. Now shifting to operating margins. For Q3, enterprise-wide operating income increased 7%, and operating margin increased 170 basis points to 32.3%. This was primarily a result of an increase in operating income of 7% for our beer business, which also drove a 100 basis point increase in beer business operating margin to 38.5%.\nThe Enterprise-wide operating margins also benefited from a 13% reduction in corporate expense. These beer business and corporate expense tailwinds were partially offset by a 5% decrease in our wine and spirits business operating income, which still yielded a 60 basis point increase in operating margin to 25.4% for the wine and spirits business. Excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, operating income and operating margin for the wine and spirits business decreased by 4% and increased by 80 basis points, respectively.\nStepping through these drivers in more detail, starting with beer. The increase in operating income and margin were a result of benefits and cost of products sold as we continue to build cost efficiency and productivity savings. For the quarter, total cost savings were approximately $55 million. An $11 million or a 6% decrease in marketing costs as a result of shifts in timing of spend. Note that marketing as a percent of net sales was 8.7% for the quarter. A $4 million decrease in SG&A expense, primarily driven by lower legal fees, partially offset by higher compensation and benefit expenses and $6 million of favorability from the divestiture of our craft beer business. These benefits were partially offset by a $12 million unfavorable foreign currency impact as we still realized a higher Mexican peso rate year-over-year, inclusive of our multiyear hedging positions. Additionally, in line with our full year expectations and guidance we are still facing higher costs in our packaging and raw materials, which resulted in a $17 million headwind for the quarter.\nWe have also faced an $11 million increase in depreciation as a result of our capacity expansions. The reduction in our corporate expense, which for the quarter was $10 million, was primarily driven by the reduction in third-party services, particularly in our digital business acceleration investments partially offset by increased compensation and benefits. Our wine and spirits operating income margin, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following last year's divestiture had a year-over-year improvement as the volume declines and unfavorable mix were more than offset by reduced logistics and warehousing costs, favorable SG&A costs due to reduced third-party consulting expenses and lower compensation and benefits.\nMore favorable material costs driven by our cost savings initiatives and reduced marketing expense as we continue to shift our marketing focus towards more efficient, high return efforts. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $104 million, driven by higher average borrowings and higher weighted average interest rates. As a reminder, approximately 5% of our debt obligations are subject to adjustable rates. As Bill noted, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.2x excluding Canopy equity and earnings and remain on track to reach our target goal of 3x within fiscal 2025.\nOur comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 18% versus 18.8% last year. Our comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.24, reflecting the consistent growth of our business and representing an 8% increase. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion through the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2024 and a 10% decrease driven by a 33% increase in CapEx investments attributable to the expansions at our existing Obregon facility and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz.\nAs we look towards the end of fiscal '24, our guidance for enterprise comparable EPS, excluding Canopy equity and earnings remains unchanged at $12 to $12.20. In underpinned by the following expectations. First, an unchanged 8% to 9% net sales growth outlook but a higher 7% to 8% operating income growth expectation for our beer business. As stated in our prior calls this year and at our recent Investor Day event for our beer net sales, we continue to expect pricing to be between 1% to 2% and mid- to high single-digit volume growth in fiscal '24. We -- and we still anticipate shipment volumes for the second half to account for approximately 45% of the full year total. Bill already addressed the drivers of the uplift in our beer operating income growth guidance but it's also important to note that we still expect beer operating margin to be approximately 38% for the full year.\nSecond, for our wine and spirits business, we now expect a decline of 7% to 9% in organic net sales and a decline of 6% to 8% in operating income, excluding the impact of the divested wine brands that are no longer part of our results. They also already addressed the drivers for these revisions. Third, from a corporate expense perspective, we now expect that to be approximately $260 million to $270 million for the full year which includes a slightly lower end to the range versus our prior expectation. And similarly, our interest expense expectations are now slightly lower at approximately $450 million.\nAnd last but not least, we continue to expect our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy to be approximately 19% and despite the additional $215 million of share repurchases executed in the third quarter, we also continue to anticipate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $184 million. Beyond the P&L, for free cash flow, we expect to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for fiscal '24, reflective of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of CapEx. In closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading results in our beer business and remain confident in our ability to achieve our stated EPS targets for this fiscal year despite incremental category headwinds affecting our wine and spirits business.\nAs we look further ahead, we remain excited about continuing opportunities to build shareholder value over the medium term which we hope to achieve by capturing the substantial growth on consistent, disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities and delivering enhanced performance in wine and spirits, supported by the significant transformation that business has undergone and the actions that we are taking to improve this business. We encourage existing and prospective shareholders who have not yet had an opportunity to review our recent Investor Day presentations to access those through our Investor Relations website, ir.cbrands.com. To gain further insights into our medium-term perspective on these topics. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

Welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Darill. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands Q2 Fiscal '24 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.\nPlease refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides, which highlight the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call.\nBefore turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 fiscal 204 call. In terms of key headlines for the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that our team once again delivered solid overall performance. First of all, our beer business led the charge as the #1 share gainer with accelerating shares across the key summer holiday. We continue to invest in growth for this business as our team looks to seize opportunities to gain incremental awareness, shelf space and household penetration for our brands in the back half and beyond.\nSecondly, our wine and spirits business continues to progress along its journey to realize the full benefits of its transformation. [indiscernible] tied investments in our largest wine and spirits higher-end brands are yielding outperformance in their respective categories while partially offsetting and helping to reduce headwinds from our mainstream brands as they continue to shift the mix profile of our portfolio.\nAnd third, our continued discipline around capital allocation priorities contributing to a strong overall performance in the quarter sets the stage for fiscal '24 being another solid year of profitable growth and shareholder returns.\nThat said, let me provide a little more color around our key performance drivers in the quarter. As noted, our beer team once again delivered remarkable results. Not only did we remain the top share gainer over the entire critical summer season, we also extended our leading position from [indiscernible] de Mayo to become the #1 share gainer in track channels during the 4th of July holiday. And although it falls slightly after our second quarter end, I'm also pleased to report that we further accelerated our share gains during Labor Day.\nModelo Especial remained the key driver of our strong performance achieving double-digit volume growth in tracked channels and an 8.6% increase in depletions, ultimately strengthening its position as the top brand across the entire U.S. beer market dollar sales fiscal year-to-date. The broader Modelo brand family also delivered phenomenal results with Cheladas achieving 50% volume growth in tracked channels and an increase in depletions of over 40%, while Oro continues to build on a solid launch, increasing its share gains in the overall beer category and performing in line with our plans for the fiscal year.\nBeyond Modelo, our Corona Extra and Pacifico, core beer brands also continued to perform strongly. Corona Extra delivered solid low single-digit growth in depletions and tracked channel volumes, and was the #6 share gainer in the category, while Pacifico achieved 15% depletion growth, tracked channel volume growth of approximately 27% and was the #11 top share gainer in tracked channels.\nOur beer brands continue to resonate strongly with the consumer, driving demand for our brands in the second quarter, which supported double-digit net sales and operating income growth in our beer business. This gives us confidence to shift our fiscal '24 net sales and operating income guidance for the beer business to the higher end of our initial ranges. That is 8% to 9% and 6% to 7% growth, respectively. That said, it is important to remember that for our beer business, we indicated that only 45% of total volume for the fiscal year will be shipped in the second half, which aligns with the regular seasonality of beer demand in the U.S. and the timing of our brewery maintenance activities.\nBeyond fiscal '24, we continue to see significant opportunities to maintain the growth momentum of our beer business, particularly due to the resilience of key secular trends in the consumer landscape like ongoing consumer-led premiumization across beverage alcohol and the continued outsized growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S. as well as the relentless focus of our beer business on closing the distribution and awareness gaps that still exist across our brands, and on developing and scaling new and exciting products aligned with consumer-led trends. We look forward to sharing more details on this compelling outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on November 2.\nMoving on to Wine & Spirits. Our wine and spirits business continues to make headway on its vision to become a bold and innovative, higher-end market leader. In the second quarter, our largest premium wine brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford, outperformed their corresponding category segments in U.S. tracked channels. They both increased their respective share in the overall line category. Our largest fine wine and craft spirits brands, the Prisoner Wine Company and our Mi Campo tequila brand also outperformed their corresponding luxury wine and higher-end spirits category segments. Notably, all of the individual brands just referenced also delivered solid depletion growth rates in the second quarter.\nOur wine and spirits business also continues to advance the renovation of its mainstream brands to address the headwinds to corresponding category segments have faced over several recent quarters. While there is certainly more work to be done here, in U.S. tracked channels, the year-over-year dollar sales decline for Woodbridge improved relative to the first quarter and SVEDKA's overall share remained relatively stable when compared to the first quarter. All of that said, our wine and spirits business continued to face lower demand primarily for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends in prior occasions, which in turn affected overall performance in the second quarter. Nevertheless, we are reiterating guidance for the full year and continue to expect fiscal '24 organic net sales to remain relatively stable and operating income growth of 2% to 4%.\nAs we shared when we provided our outlook for fiscal '24, we see the year as a tale of 2 halves for the wine and spirits business, with 55% of planned volumes being delivered in the second half and operating performance projected to accelerate over the rest of the year due to other key factors. We expect to benefit from the more proactive quarterly shipment and depletion rebalancing actions we have undertaken this year versus our single downward shipment adjustment in Q4 of last year. We also anticipate an uplift in our direct-to-consumer channels and improved mix from incremental ASPIRA shipments in line with seasonality and as well as benefits from recent price increases. Ultimately, we also expect to see operating margins meaningfully accelerate due to the improved sales trends just described and the resulting positive operating leverage.\nBefore I conclude, it would be remiss not to highlight our consistent execution against our capital allocation priorities. We continue to make progress towards our reduced net leverage ratio of approximately 3x with a 400 point reduction since the increase resulting from the financing of our Class B common stock reclassification last November. Importantly, our proactive management of the incremental debt from the reclassification now puts us on track to deliver lower interest expense than initially anticipated for fiscal '24, and in turn, we now anticipate higher reported and comparable earnings per share, excluding Canopy in the ranges of 9.60 to 9.80 and $12 to $12.20, respectively, for the full year.\nIn terms of cash returns to our shareholders, our dividend payout ratio for the second quarter remained aligned with our 30% target. And while we did not conduct any additional share repurchases in Q2, we have executed $35 million year-to-date, in line with our goal to at least offset dilution. Lastly, our brewery expansions are progressing as planned, including Veracruz, and we continue to develop and bring these online with the flexibility enabled by our modular approach.\nBefore I conclude, I also want to again take an opportunity during our second quarter call to highlight the upcoming release of our annual ESG impact report in a few weeks. This report seeks to provide a comprehensive review of our strategy, initiatives, targets and performance to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our business, consumers, communities, employees and broader stakeholders. In particular, as noted in our last 2 calls, we have already surpassed our target of restoring 1.1 billion gallons of withdrawals from local watersheds, and are looking forward to showcasing the initiatives in our beer business that drove most of this achievement and to share more details on our new target in our upcoming ESG impact report. I invite all of you to spend some time reviewing this report when it is released, which will be available through our company website.\nIn closing, I'd like to leave you with 4 main takeaways for this quarter. First, our beer business continues to outperform the industry and the acceleration of its performance since the beginning of the year has given us confidence to shift our outlook for fiscal '24 to the higher end of our initial net sales and operating income growth expectations. And just as critical, we remain equally confident about the long-term runway for our higher-end brand portfolio.\nNumber two, the benefits of our Wine & Spirits strategy continue to take hold, and we expect the net sales growth and operating income growth of that business to ramp up through the remainder of fiscal '24, and as we look to the coming years, we anticipate our wine and spirits business to further gain momentum and achieve stronger results.\nNumber three, we are persistently delivering on our capital allocation priorities, maintaining discipline and balance to yield value and returns, and we remain committed to building on the consistent track record we've established with these priorities over the past few years.\nAnd finally, number four, we are excited to be sharing more of these important topics with you at our upcoming Investor Day in 4 weeks' time. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for Q2 in more detail. Garth?\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives and our relentless focus on continuing to deliver growth while enhancing our performance. As Bill noted, we achieved yet another strong quarter with double-digit net sales and operating income growth in our beer business while our wine and spirits business delivered solid performance across its largest premium, fine wine and craft spirits brands, which partially offset the category headwinds affecting our mainstream brands. We also continued to generate strong cash flow results and execute against our consistent and balanced capital allocation priorities.\nNow let's review our Q2 fiscal '24 results in more detail where I will mainly focus on comparable basis financial results. To begin, our beer business increased net sales by 12%, representing an uplift of $253 million. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 8.7% as demand for our beer brands accelerated through the first half of the fiscal year. This growth also benefited from favorable pricing which contributed $59 million of the overall net sales increase. As a reminder, we continue to expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales increase this fiscal year from the combination of the wraparound impact from the significant pricing actions taken in Q3 of fiscal '23 and targeted pricing actions we are taking in fiscal '24.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal '24, beer shipment volume and depletions were generally in line with one another, and I'm pleased to report that our inventories are at healthy levels to support the ongoing growth of our brands. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 7.9%, reflecting a successful summer selling season, driven by ongoing consumer demand across our industry-leading beer portfolio as evidenced by our share gain acceleration. Execution of our distribution and marketing strategies, including extending our category leadership across the key summer season and continued positive results from our Shopper-First Shelf initiative. And lastly, the accelerated growth in share gains across our core and emerging markets.\nBefore moving to on-premise performance, I'd like to take a moment to explain a notable recent development in off-premise channel observation. As many of you are aware, Circana track channel volume growth has historically been above depletion growth by a low single-digit variance. However, more recently, that variance has expanded to the mid-single-digit range as independent retailers not captured by Circana data have lagged in reversing the additional pricing they took beyond our October fiscal '23 pricing actions. We believe this has led certain consumers to ship from these independent retailers to chain retailers offering more competitive consumer pricing. While the shift in these variances has no impact on the overall demand of our brands, we continue to monitor channel performance and plan to provide further updates or insights needed to reconcile, track channel data with our overall performance as warrant. As a reminder, Circana captures approximately 50% of our total beer buyers.\nShifting back to the on-premise channel. Depletions were essentially flat year-over-year and accounted for approximately 10.3% of our total beer volume. Please note that while we did have some minor disruptions in our supply of kegs during the second quarter, this Q1 to Q2 step down largely reflects a normal seasonal pattern that we have seen in previous years. Importantly, while there is some disruption in the near term, we are currently producing and shipping kegs and fully expect to offset the impact of the disruptions as swiftly as possible.\nLooking forward to the second half of the year, as Bill noted, approximately 45% of our volumes will ship in the second half of the year as a result of it being our lower volume period. In addition, our Q3 shipment volumes are also normally more subdued due to routine maintenance activities. Lastly, from a pricing perspective, we will start to overlap the uplift we saw from significant incremental pricing actions taken in October of fiscal '23. Nonetheless, as we have previously stated, we fully expect our full year shipments and depletions to be largely in line, both on an absolute and a year-over-year growth basis by fiscal year-end.\nIn regards to selling days, they were flat year-over-year for the quarter. Please note, for the remainder of fiscal '24, Q3 sales days will be flat year-over-year, and there will be 1 more selling day in Q4.\nNow let me review beer margins. For Q2, operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 39.9%. This decrease was driven mostly by the ongoing inflationary pressures in our COGS as we faced an overall cost increase of approximately 17%. The largest drivers of these cost increases came from packaging and raw materials, incremental costs related to a voluntary product recall of select kegs for quality assurance, and higher depreciation that amounted to $12 million or a 24% increase.\nTo mitigate the inflationary and depreciation pressures, we continue to work across the business on cost efficiency and operational productivity programs that yielded meaningful and sustainable benefits. Building on the $30 million of net savings delivered by these initiatives in the first quarter, we realized an approximately $20 million in incremental net savings in the second quarter.\nIn addition to our cost-saving initiatives, we incurred margin benefits from the following: a $4 million or 2% decrease in marketing expense, primarily driven by the divestiture of our craft beer business; marketing as a percent of sales came in at 7.1% for the quarter; and a $3 million or 3% decrease in SG&A expense, which was primarily the result of favorable foreign currency impacts.\nRegarding Q2, our marketing spend as a percent of sales was outside of our previously stated algorithm of 9% to 10%. As usual, part of this relatively low percentage in Q2 is a reflection of the strong volume and therefore, net sales performance of the business due to category seasonality. However, the impact of the reduction in marketing due to the previously noted exit from craft beer has further lowered that percentage. For the full year, we now expect to be closer to the lower end of our stated range of 9% to 10% of net sales due to the craft beer divestitures and our continued focus on ensuring our large marketing investments are prioritized to the highest return areas in our portfolio.\nAs a result of the acceleration in the growth of beer business since the beginning of the year, we are shifting our expectations for fiscal '24 to the higher end of our initial ranges, resulting in an 8% to 9% expected increase in net sales growth and a 6% to 7% expected increase in operating income growth.\nNow moving on to our wine and spirits business. In line with the reshaping of our wine and spirits business to a higher-end portfolio of offerings, we continue to benefit from the solid performance of our largest premium wine, fine wine and craft spirits brands. Meiomi, Kim Crawford, the Prisoner Wine Company and Mi Campo, which as Bill noted, outperformed the corresponding categories in tracked channels and delivered solid depletion growth. While we are pleased with the results with these leading higher-end brands, our overall wine and spirits organic sales were down 11%, driven primarily by the category headwinds we continue to face from the performance of our biometrically larger mainstream brands, Woodbridge and SVEDKA.\nOur plans to renovate Woodbridge and SVEDKA are underway, and our wine and spirits leadership team is looking forward to sharing updates on this progress at our upcoming Investor Day. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by 15% and depletions decreased by approximately 8%. As a reminder, approximately 55% of the wine and spirits sales are anticipated to occur in the second half of the year, where we also expect to see consumer-led premiumization mixed shift towards the higher end to continue, supporting what we believe will be a notable acceleration in the growth trajectory of the business for the remainder of the year. Wine & Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, was down 12%, and operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 18.2%, also reflecting the same exclusion. The margin decline was primarily driven by the volume declines of our mainstream brands and partially offset by lower material costs, primarily from sustainable packaging projects, supply chain savings and lower marketing spend as we continue to focus on higher return areas of our portfolio.\nAs we look forward, we continue to expect the wine and spirits business to significantly improve its net sales growth trajectory for the remainder of the fiscal year through a combination of increased contributions from our higher-end portfolio as well as incremental pricing actions. We expect this acceleration in net sales growth combined with our continued cost reductions and marketing efficiency initiatives to also support our operating income growth targets. As a result, we remain confident in the outlook for wine and spirits for the year and our guidance for that business for fiscal '24 remains unchanged.\nNow let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expense was approximately $67 million, an overall reduction of 19% when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by reduced spend in the second wave of our digital business acceleration program, lower headcount-related costs and lower compensation and benefits post our reclassification transaction. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $111 million, a 17% increase from the prior year, driven by higher weighted average interest rates on the portion of our debt with adjustable rates, which is approximately 5% of our debt obligations, and higher average borrowings due to the financing of the share reclassification. However, we now expect interest expense for the full year to be approximately $460 million, roughly $40 million lower than our prior guidance due to refinancing actions for some of our higher interest debt and faster-than-expected deleveraging throughout the year. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.2x excluding Canopy equity and earnings, and expect to continue to make progress towards our 3x ratio target over the coming quarters.\nOur comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter, was 17.8% versus 20.3% last year. For fiscal '24, we continue to expect the comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be approximately 19%.\nMoving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the second quarter, year-to-date of fiscal '24, we generated free cash flow of $1 billion, a 15% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 34% increase in CapEx investments, attributable to the capacity expansions at our Nava and Obregon facilities and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. As of Q2, we have fully commissioned our latest additional brewing capacity project at our Obregon facility and now have approximately 47 million hectoliters of capacity across our 2 breweries.\nLooking ahead, we remain on track to bring our ABA facility online at Nava towards the end of this fiscal year. And the development of our additional expansion at Obregon and our third brewery site at Veracruz are advancing as planned. We continue to expect fiscal '24 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflective of operating cash flow between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.\nOur comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.80 as a result of the continued profitable and disciplined growth we have seen this year. We are raising fiscal '24 reported EPS guidance to between $9.60 and $9.80 and comparable EPS guidance, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be between $12 and $12.20. And finally, our announced dividend of $0.89 a share will result in approximately $163 million returned to shareholders for the quarter.\nIn closing, I'd like to say that our entire team continues to execute and deliver against our strategic priorities. We demonstrated solid execution in the first half of fiscal '24, and as we enter the back half of the year, we plan to remain disciplined as we seek to drive long-term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value.\nOur management team is excited to meet with many of you this coming November as we lay out our medium- and long-term ambitions and vision for Constellation Brands at our Investor Day.\nWith that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Joe.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning all, and welcome again to Constellation Brands' Q1 Fiscal '24 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.\nAs a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call.\nFollowing the call, we'll once again be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person as noted, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in fiscal '24, with a solid first quarter. Our Beer Business delivered net sales growth of 11%, mainly driven by continued strong volume growth in line with our medium-term algorithm. As anticipated, depletion performance accelerated throughout the quarter, resulting in a 5.5% increase for the period and acceleration that has continued into June, supported by our beer team's unrelenting push to increase distribution for our high-growth, high-velocity brands, continued incremental investments in marketing focused on the highest return opportunities and ongoing strong demand for our high-end Mexican beer brands aligned with consumer-led premiumization trends. Particularly in large markets with significant runway for Modelo Especial, like Texas, Florida, Illinois and North Carolina with the brand posted double-digit dollar sales growth in Circana track channels.\nAnd yes, also in California, where our share gains actually accelerated and as expected, demand for our portfolio did ramp up after the unseasonably cold weather in early March.\nAll in, our Beer Business delivered strong growth for the quarter while consistently advancing all 4 areas of our strategic initiatives. First, the business continued to propel its powerful core brands that people love. Modelo Especial remained the #1 dollar share gainer in the entire beer category, delivered double-digit dollar sales growth in tracked channels. And as most of you likely already are aware, became the #1 beer in America in dollar sales during the first quarter.\nBoth Corona Extra and Pacifico also achieved share gains and delivered dollar sales growth of approximately 4% and 26%, respectively.\nSecond, our beer innovations, which are still centered around the flavor and betterment consumer-led trends are off to a great start. Our Modelo Chelada brands remained a top 10 dollar share gainer with further support from our variety pack launched last year, the #4 new product in Circana channels and from the launch of new Sandia Picante flavor, the #5 new brand.\nModelo Oro was also a top 10 share gainer and incrementally has actually been slightly above what we saw in initial test markets. And Corona NA was the #1 share gainer in the nonalcoholic beer category in tracked channels.\nThird, the expansions of our beer brewing capacity continued to advance as planned. Our latest modular addition to Obregon successfully ramped up in Q1 and we are on track with the new ABA facility at Nava for Q4 of this fiscal year. At Veracruz, site development and construction work are underway, and we expect that to build up through this year and next.\nAnd fourth, the ESG efforts of our Beer Business further drove progress on our company-wide goals, particularly those on water stewardship. As noted in our last call, we recently surpassed our target of restoring 1.1 billion gallons of withdrawals from local water sheds. The initiatives in our Beer Business drove most of this achievement, and we plan to announce a new water target later this fiscal year.\nBuilding on our existing water and emissions targets, we also recently announced 2 new commitments focused on reducing waste and enhancing our use of circular packaging. In support of that commitment within our Beer Business, we plan to attain a true zero waste to landfill certification for our breweries in Mexico and replace high cone plastic rings with recyclable paperboard for all applicable 4 and 6 pack SKUs.\nSimilarly, within our Wine and Spirits Business, we also plan to attain the same certification for our key U.S. operations. As well as reducing our packaging to product weight ratio by 10% and ensure that 80% of the business packaging is returnable, recyclable or renewable.\nWith that, let's turn more fully to our Wine and Spirits Business. As noted previously, over the last few years, the Wine and Spirits Business has strategically shifted its portfolio to a bold, innovative and higher-end product mix that continues to be driven by consumer-led premiumization. In Q1, the higher-end wine portion of the business gained share in the U.S. wine category and outpaced the dollar sales growth of the corresponding segment and tracked channels.\nMeiomi and Kim Crawford, the portfolio's largest premium wine brands and the Prisoner Wine Company, the largest fine wine brand group were main drivers of this strong performance. The innovation efforts across these brands also continued to deliver excellent results with Meiomi Bright, the brand's lower alcohol, lower calorie offering aligned with consumer-led betterment trend capturing the #1 new brand spot in the category.\nIn the main streamline portion of the business, the reinvention of Woodbridge is underway to address the growth headwinds and facing that segment of the category while keeping the brand's core consumers engaged. And while there is certainly more work to be done here, the brand's year-over-year dollar sales decline in U.S. tracked channels improved throughout the quarter.\nThe overall spirits portfolio maintained its share in U.S. tracked channels with notably strong dollar sales performance across its higher-end tequila and RTD products. In particular, MI Campo tequila and High West ready-to-drink cocktails, both delivered significant double-digit dollar sales growth.\nBeyond the evolution of the portfolio over the last few years, the Wine and Spirits Business has also been investing in capabilities to accelerate its performance in key growth channels. This omnichannel focus has provided additional pillars of consumer-led growth such as international and direct-to-consumer. The latter of which grew the channel's net sales 13% in Q1. And in fact, the e-commerce and customer loyalty portions of our DT business -- DTC business, pardon me, were up over 40% in Q1.\nFrom a volume perspective, the Wine and Spirits Business continued to face lower demand primarily for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends noted earlier, which in turn affected top line performance. In the higher end line portion of our portfolio, our larger premium and luxury brands faced softer segment demand in April, but we did see solid acceleration in May, and that has continued into June.\nMeanwhile, in our spirits portfolio, our higher-end craft brands posted very strong depletion growth of 40%. The Wine and Spirits Business also delivered significant operating margin expansion in Q1, adjusted for the contribution after marketing of the divested brands. This further demonstrates the benefits of the strategic refocusing of the portfolio to higher end, higher growth, higher-margin brands and channels.\nTo sum up the shift of the Wine and Spirits Business toward driving growth and margin improvement through its pivot to the higher-end brands and broader channels and markets, remains well on track. All in, we are confident in our outlook for the Wine and Spirits Business in fiscal '24 as performance is expected to continue to accelerate throughout the course of the year, in line with seasonality and the business' annual plan, particularly as the share of net sales from our Aspira fine wine and craft spirits portfolio increases over the coming quarter.\nIn closing, I once more want to highlight that our solid performance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was anchored by the consistent execution of the annual plans and strategic initiatives across both businesses. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review in more detail our financial results for the quarter.\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, fiscal '24 is off to a solid start. We steadily executed against our annual plans, remaining both focused and adaptable as the economic and consumer backdrop continue to evolve and we remain on track to deliver against our stated financial performance goals for this fiscal year.\nAs Bill noted, our Beer Business achieved double-digit net sales growth and the higher-end segment of our Wine and Spirits Business outperformed the higher end of the wine category. We also continue to execute and deliver against our capital allocation priorities, and we are reiterating our guidance for the year.\nNow let's review our Q1 fiscal '24 results in more detail where I will mainly focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with the Beer Business. Net sales increased by $200 million representing an uplift of 11%. This was driven primarily by our volume growth of 7.5% as strong demand continued across our industry-leading portfolio. We also benefited from favorable pricing, which contributed $60 million of the overall net sales increase.\nStaying on the topic of price for just a moment, the incremental pricing we realized this quarter primarily reflects the wraparound impact from the elevated pricing taken in fiscal 2023 that was above our typical 1% to 2% algorithm. As a reminder, we expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales increase this fiscal year, which represents the combined uplift from the wraparound impact and the average of any other additional pricing actions to be taken in fiscal '24 on a market by market, channel by channel and SKU-by-SKU basis.\nBeer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 5.5%, which reflects a slower start but strong finish in the 3-month period between March and May as growth significantly accelerated through the quarter, driven by the disciplined execution of our distribution and marketing plans, including during the key Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays, ongoing consumer-led premiumization trends including solid buy rates for high-end beer. And as Bill noted, significant growth in several of our top 5 markets and beyond as well as improving conditions in California. These results give us confidence as we head into the peak summer selling season.\nOur largest brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra delivered mid-single-digit and low single-digit depletion growth, respectively. While our emerging brands, the Modelo Chelada brands and Pacifico each delivered double-digit depletion growth. On-premise depletions grew 3.2% and accounted for approximately 12.4% of total volume, reflecting more normalized year-over-year performance following the distortions caused by the pandemic closures and post-pandemic reopenings.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal '24, shipment volume ran slightly ahead of the depletion volume on an absolute basis. Shipments were in line with our plan throughout the quarter, and depletions ultimately ramped up over the course of the 3 months, as previously noted. This difference in timing was the primary driver of the variance between shipment and depletion volumes.\nAdditionally, as it has been the case historically, strong shipment volume in the first quarter also reflects inventory preparations with distributors and retailers for the peak busy summer season. That said, distributor inventories remain at normal seasonal levels, so we do not expect this variance to generate any further distortion in Q2 and expect both shipment and depletion volume to be aligned for the full fiscal year.\nImportantly, we also -- we are also well equipped with capacity flexibility to meet any incremental demand as we move through the year.\nIn regards to selling days, they were flat year-over-year for the quarter. Please note that for fiscal '24, there will be 1 more selling day in Q4.\nMoving on to beer margins. Operating margin decreased by 220 basis points to 38%. This decrease was primarily driven by continued inflationary headwinds in our COGS as we faced an overall cost increase of approximately 4% for the quarter. As anticipated in our guidance for the year, we continue to face higher packaging and raw materials, freight and overhead costs. In Q1, we experienced low double-digit percent increases in packaging and raw materials as inflationary pressures continued throughout the period, albeit at a declining rate over the 3 months.\nWe also continue to face higher overhead costs related to our brewery expansion as well as increased logistics costs, largely related to higher shipment volumes. As we have previously stated, it is important to note that for fiscal '24 and consistent with recent years, roughly 70% of our COGS are subject to annual pricing adjustments. These are based on trailing indicators, such as producer price indices and, therefore, typically reflect inflation from the preceding year. The remaining 30% of COGS are subject to fluctuations throughout the year and we can manage the volatility for about half of that 30% through our multiyear hedging program. Will our full year COGS expectations currently remain unchanged, we are monitoring closely any potential favorability in direct commodity and pass-through raw material prices for the approximately 15% non-hedged portion still subject to intra-year adjustments and will provide any relevant updates in future quarters.\nAdditional operating margin headwinds for the beer business were comprised of a $29 million or 17% increase in marketing expense, primarily driven by ongoing media spend to build awareness of our core products as well as recent investments to support the new Modelo Oro product launch and as a result, please note that marketing as a percent of net sales came in at 9.5% for the quarter.\nA $15 million or 18% increase in SG&A expense which was primarily the result of increased legal costs and an $11 million or 16% increase in depreciation, almost entirely associated with our brewery capacity investments.\nTo help offset the increase in cost to our Beer Business, we are executing on various levers to partially offset the full year high single-digit inflationary headwinds in our overall packaging, raw materials and logistics costs through productivity initiatives. These initiatives have yielded savings of over $30 million for the first quarter of fiscal '24, and are focused on unlocking efficiencies and cost savings across procurement, operations and supply chain.\nFor fiscal '24, our guidance for the Beer Business remains unchanged as we continue to target 7% to 9% of net sales growth and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, implying an operating margin of approximately 38%.\nNow moving on to the Wine and Spirits Business. As Bill noted, over the last few years, our Wine and Spirits Business has been effectively shifting its portfolio to be more focused on higher-end brands that are better aligned with consumer-led premiumization trends while broadening sales channels to also expand into higher growth avenues. To that effect, please recall that we divested a collection of primarily mainstream wine brands from our portfolio during our third quarter in fiscal '23.\nAccordingly, during today's discussion, I will be referring to the top line of the Wine and Spirits Business on an organic basis, which excludes the contribution from the divested brands. Consistent with the strategic transformation, the Wine and Spirits Business has undertaken the higher-end brands of the wine portfolio, continue to resonate with the consumer and outperformed the corresponding segment of the category in the U.S. tracked channels in Q1.\nMore recently, we've seen even greater strength in our 3 largest premium and fine wine brand families with Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner Wine Company showing dollar sales growth and acceleration in tracked channels. Similarly, we were also pleased to see the overall spirits portfolio deliver strong dollar sales growth in tracked channels led by MI CAMPO, and High West ready-to-drink cocktails. However, Wine and Spirits organic net sales were down 6%, largely as a result of the continued impact of ongoing consumer-led premiumization affecting the entire category and the lapping of a particularly strong prior year first quarter for our higher-end brands due to distributor inventory balancing actions.\nFrom a channel perspective, we continue to see success through our direct-to-consumer efforts, which delivered 13% net sales growth in our overall DTC channel. While still small compared to the rest of our Wine and Spirits Business, this channel accounted for 4% of total net sales, an increase of 100% versus just a few years ago.\nShipments on an organic basis decreased by 9% and depletions decreased by approximately 6%. As noted earlier, this volume decline was primarily driven by our mainstream brands, Woodbridge and SVEDKA as their respective segments of the categories face ongoing growth headwinds driven by consumer-led premiumization. Again, the Wine and Spirits Business continues to diligently work on the reinvention of Woodbridge and SVEDKA to address these headwinds. In particular, SVEDKA declines have stabilized, and we continue to look at incremental opportunities to revitalize the brand and accelerate improvements.\nAnd more broadly, in our spirits portfolio, our craft brands posted nearly 40% depletion growth driven by MI CAMPO, posting depletion growth of over 80%. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture were relatively flat, and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 19%, also reflecting the same exclusion. The margin improvement was primarily driven by the favorable impact of the pricing actions taken last year that primarily focused on our higher-end brands, lower materials and packaging costs, including great blend optimization, lapping of higher freight and warehousing costs and lower marketing expense as we have streamlined our approach to marketing, focusing on the highest return areas of our portfolio.\nLooking ahead, we expect the performance of the Wine and Spirits Business to accelerate throughout the remainder of the fiscal year through the combination of increased growth contribution from the portfolio's higher end brands, which are already seeing depletions improve in line with our sales efforts and seasonal trends, ongoing growth in DTC channels as well as a return to growth in international markets. Lower marketing spend as we shift towards higher growth areas, focusing on the Aspira portfolio, and continued work toward a revitalization of SVEDKA and Woodbridge in the mainstream category.\nAccordingly, we remain confident in the outlook for Wine and Spirits for the year and our guidance for that business for fiscal '24 remains unchanged.\nNow let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Starting with corporate expense, which for the quarter was approximately $50 million from SG&A and overall corporate expense reduction of 19% when compared to the prior year and $33 million from unconsolidated investments related to Canopy and our Ventures portfolio investments. The overall corporate expense reduction is primarily driven by reduced spend in the second wave of our digital business acceleration program.\nI want to take a moment to talk briefly about the next wave of our digital business acceleration program. For fiscal '24, our DBA program will have 3 main goals: first, scaling our prior year's focus areas of marketing, procurement and supply chain across the business; second, introducing a new focus area, logistics, which will center around improving end-to-end visibility, and planning as well as enhancing our network capabilities across the business; and third, reducing third-party consulting fees as we begin to shift the support of our DBA program to in-house, increasing efficiencies and reducing overall cost.\nInterest expense for the quarter was approximately $118 million. This is a 34% increase from the prior year driven by higher average borrowings and rising interest rates on approximately 10% of our debt with adjustable rates. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x excluding Canopy equity and earnings and expect to continue to make progress towards our approximately 3x ratio target throughout the year.\nOur comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 20.7% versus 20.6% last year. For fiscal '24, we continue to expect the comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be approximately 19%.\nMoving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first quarter of fiscal '24, we generated free cash flow of $388 million, a 31% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 41% increase in CapEx investments driven primarily by the capacity expansions at our Nava and Obregon facilities and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. Our capacity expansions are underway as planned. Of the planned additions for this year, we fully ramped up 5 million hectoliters at our Obregon facility in Q1 and are planning on another 5 million hectoliters to support our ABA production to be online at our Nava facility towards the end of fiscal '24.\nIn total, by the end of fiscal '24, we expect to have about 52 million hectoliters of capacity online, which, as you recall, includes nearly 3 million hectoliters of additional capacity from operational efficiency initiatives executed last fiscal year. Looking ahead, as we continue to consider incremental operational opportunities for our production facilities, we will seek to ensure that we align our additional modular capacity expansions to the timing that best balances both any further enhancements to our existing production footprint and our expectations for continued strong demand for our brands.\nTurning to cash flow. We continue to expect fiscal '24 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflective of operating cash flow between $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.04 with an announced dividend of $0.89, bringing our dividend payout ratio to approximately 30% for the quarter. Our fiscal '24 EPS comparable guidance of $11.70 to $12 remains unchanged.\nIn closing, we believe that this solid start to fiscal '24 sets us up for a great year ahead. We delivered net sales and volume growth in our Beer Business while implementing cost savings and efficiencies to help counteract the continued inflationary headwinds we face. Our Wine and Spirits Business is honing in on becoming a multichannel global competitor primarily focused on the higher-end segment. The growth in our core businesses and execution against our strategies makes us enthusiastic about what the rest of the year will bring and the shareholder value we will be able to create. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Darryl. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Year-End Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.

Thanks in advance. And now here is Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our team delivered another solid year of performance in fiscal '23, driving a 7% increase in net sales and a 3% increase in comparable operating income, despite elevated inflationary headwinds faced throughout the year. We delivered record net sales and comparable operating income of $9.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. We were recognized as the #1 growth leader among large CPG companies by IRI and Boston Consulting Group in calendar year '22. And we are the only CPG company of scale in recent times to make their top 10 ranking for 10 consecutive years.\nOur performance was pivot by strong execution of our strategy, which centers on continuing to build powerful brands that people love, to introduce consumer-led innovations that address emerging trends and consistently shape our portfolio for profitable growth, to deploy capital with discipline while balancing priorities and operate in a way that is both good for business and good for the world.\nHere's how each of our segments delivered against each of these objectives in fiscal '23. Our beer business delivered another year of double-digit net sales growth, and its 13th consecutive year of shipment volume growth, while maintaining best-in-class margins. We extended our lead as the #1 high-end beer supplier in the U.S. and as the leading share gainer in IRI channels with a 12% increase in dollar sales. We increased depletions by nearly 27 million cases and delivered net sales and operating income growth, well above the initial top end of our guidance range.\nWe continue to build momentum for our anchor brands. Modelo Especial maintained its position as the top share gainer and the #1 high-end beer brand in the category, increasing depletions by 9%. Corona Extra was the third largest share gainer and the #3 high-end beer brand in the category, increasing depletions by nearly 4%, and Pacifico gained significant momentum as a top 10 share gainer in tracked channels, delivering depletion growth of over 30%. Several consumer-led innovations within our Modelo Chelada franchise served as growth catalysts in fiscal '23. Naranja Picosa flavor, a new variety pack added over 1.6 million new cases of depletions to our Chelada brands.\nOur new Limón y Sal 12-ounce, 12-pack helped to more than doubled to depletions of that flavor to over 5.6 million cases. And in tracked channels, the Limón y Sal 12-pack was a top 15 new package SKU and the variety pack of top 10 new brands. We continue to invest in our beer business, deploying over $800 million in capital investments in fiscal '23, which supported the ongoing expansions of our growing capacity at Obregon, the continued development of our new ABA alcohol production line in Nava, and the early stage work at our new site in Veracruz.\nAs part of our commitment to water stewardship, we recently worked with local efficients and water authorities to complete a project that updated water infrastructure in the city of Zaragoza near Nava facility, which improved water accessibility for most of the families in this town that is approximately 13,000 people. This is just one of the number of efforts we have underway in Mexico as part of our water stewardship commitment. As we look to fiscal '24, we will continue to prioritize investments against our core brands in Modelo Especial, Corona Extra and Pacifico.\nWe believe that the fundamental growth drivers for these brands, including awareness, distribution and demographic upside opportunities, remain as strong as ever. We're excited about several consumer-led innovations that are currently hitting the market, including Modelo Oro, which exceeded both external and internal benchmarks in 3 test markets where we trialed it last fiscal year and Corona non-alcoholic, which addresses the rapidly growing betterment trends. We'll also continue to build momentum for our Chelada franchise with the introduction of a second 12-ounce 12-pack for our best-selling traditional Chelada flavor and with the new spicy watermelon flavor, Sandia Picante, and we'll continue to deploying capital to enhance our growing capacity to meet the anticipated continuing robust demand for our products, both near and long term. Shifting gears. Our Wine & Spirits business has transformed from a U.S. wholesale business, mainly serving the mainstream segment to a global omnichannel competitor with a higher-end focused portfolio. And this strategy is working as the strength of our higher-end brands supported our outperformance against the broader market. While lower demand for our mainstream brands drove a 2.1% volume decline for our Wine & Spirits portfolio and IRI channels, we outperformed the 2.6% volume decline for the combined U.S. Wine & Spirits categories in fiscal '23.\nWe continue to focus on the growth of our consumer preferred higher-end brands within our portfolio. Our Aspira portfolio, which includes our Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands, delivered double-digit shipment growth. In addition, it significantly outpaced the Fine Wine and Craft Spirits segment, led by The Prisoner Wine Company, which delivered depletion growth approaching 10% and our Craft Spirits portfolio, which achieved depletions growth approaching 29% in U.S. wholesale.\nIn addition, these brands delivered exciting consumer-led innovations such as The Prisoner's Blindfold Blanc de Noir, Casa Noble Ultra Premium Marques Tequila and our Mi Campo ready-to-drink cocktails, which are still in early stages of their life cycles, but are contributing to our expanded presence in higher end of the market. Meanwhile, our Ignite portfolio continued to drive the momentum of our premium brands such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, which delivered depletion growth of 5% and 7%, respectively, both gaining share in their respective segments.\nWe continue to complement the growth of our core premium products with innovations that broaden the offerings of these consumer preferred brands. As an example, Meiomi's new Red Blend remains the #2 wine SKU since its launch and Kim Crawford's Prosecco was the #2 new wine brand. Within our Ignite portfolio, the performance of our higher-end premium brands was offset by our remaining mainstream Wine & Spirits brands, namely Woodbridge and SVEDKA which experienced declines versus the market in the U.S. We continue to focus on stabilizing and revitalizing these brands. To further support our strategy to reshape our Wine & Spirits portfolio to the higher end, we divested several residual mainstream brands and acquired a smaller, higher-end wine brand and a ready-to-drink cocktail brand.\nOf note, our relatively recent acquisition to My Favorite Neighbor portfolio is delivering substantial growth and performing above our initial expectations. So overall, in fiscal '23, while net sales for our Wine & Spirits business declined just under 4%. A large part of that was due to the recent divestiture of primarily mainstream brands that I just referenced. And despite the strong performance of our higher-end brands, on an organic basis, net sales declined by 2%, mainly driven by lower demand for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends, which I also noted earlier.\nWe continue to build momentum for our higher-end brands and continue to accelerate our performance in key channels, such as direct-to-consumer and international markets, which grew net sales by 29% and organic net sales by 4%, respectively. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to continue to grow the DTC and international markets by investing in our Premium Wine, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands that tilt their growth toward DTC and international routes to market. Importantly, our Wine & Spirits business delivered operating margin expansion in fiscal '23, further demonstrating the benefits of its strategy and making additional progress towards its medium-term targets.\nOverall, we are exiting the year in Wine & Spirits on solid footing, and I remain confident in the pathway of that business. The solid performance driven by our beer and Wine & Spirits teams enabled us to return nearly $2.3 billion to shareholders and share repurchases and dividends in fiscal '23, and we further demonstrated our capacity to conduct opportunistic share buybacks with an additional nearly $300 million of repurchases in the fourth quarter. This means our dividend payments and buybacks since fiscal '20 totaled more than $5.4 billion, well above our $5 billion goal.\nMoving forward, we plan to continue to deliver against our capital allocation priorities with our disciplined approach. Our fiscal '24 earnings and cash flow outlook should enable us to move closer to our net leverage ratio target to support dividend payments in line with our payout ratio target to continue to deploy capital to be a growing capacity additions and hospitality investments in Wine & Spirits business and to opportunistically pursue additional share repurchases and small gap [indiscernible] acquisitions.\nLastly, we remain committed to making meaningful progress against our enterprise ESG goals, which include reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% in fiscal -- by fiscal '25 from a fiscal '20 baseline and restoring more than 1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from local watersheds, while also improving accessibility and quality of water for communities where we operate between fiscal '23 and '25. Water stewardship in particular, has been a top priority for our team, and I'm pleased to announce that we have already surpassed our fiscal '25 goal related to water restoration.\nWe'll look to announce later this year new targets for our water stewardship efforts as well as other important areas that are part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the long-term viability of our local communities and this environment. We have also significantly enhanced our ESG reporting references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and considering recommendations from the Task Force on climate-related financial disclosures.\nAs we look ahead, we intend to continue to take steps to more fully integrate ESG into our core business planning process, establishing thoughtful, specific, measurable and time-bound targets supported by robust strategies and operating plans that we can map progress against. We believe this approach best serves the interest of our business, shareholders, other stakeholders and our surrounding communities as it seeks to integrate ESG into our business operations and helps ensure that we can clearly deliver on our stated commitments.\nSo in summary, we delivered another solid year of performance, resulting in record net sales and comparable operating income, despite elevated inflationary headwinds based throughout the year. Our performance was driven by strong execution of our strategy, and we continue to make good progress against all dimensions, building brands that people love, complementing growth of our core products with consumer-led innovation, deploying capital with discipline while balancing priorities against our organization, and continuing to operate in a way that is both good for business and good for the world.\nWith another strong year of execution against our strategy behind us, we're quite confident in our ability to continue building momentum in fiscal '24. And with that, I will turn the call over to Garth.\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 was another solid year for our company as we continue to relentlessly deliver on our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Despite the inflationary pressures that both our industry and consumers have been facing, we demonstrated yet again the strength of our adaptable businesses, high-end brands and resilient teams. We expect the same focus and dedication to further support our momentum in fiscal '24.\nSo let's review in more detail our full year fiscal '23 performance and fiscal '24 outlook. As always, I will focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with the fiscal '23 performance of our beer business. Net sales increased $713 million or 11%, exceeding the upper end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by solid shipment growth of approximately 7% as strong demand continued across our portfolio, supporting a $464 million uplift in net sales from incremental volumes.\nNet sales also benefited from favorable pricing in excess of our unusual 1% to 2% average annual pricing algorithm. As we previously noted, the incremental pricing actions taken in fiscal '23 were in response to cost pressures across the value chain due to inflationary headwinds. We introduced larger pricing increases and made pricing adjustments in certain markets ahead of our regular case. Depletion growth for the year was over 7%, which, as Bill noted, was driven by continued strong growth in our largest brands, Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico and Modelo Chelada brands. On-premise depletions grew 15% year-over-year, and on-premise volume accounted for approximately 12% of total depletions in fiscal '23, nearing the mid-teen volume share from prior to the start of pandemic.\nAs previously guided, our shipments and depletions were closely aligned on an absolute basis. Moving on to the bottom line for our beer business. Operating income increased 6%, also exceeding the upper end of our guidance range. This increase was largely driven by a $492 million benefit from net sales growth and yielded an operating margin of 38.3%, which was in line with our implied guidance range. As expected and noted over fiscal '23, operating margins were negatively affected by inflationary headwinds.\nFor the import portion of our beer business, which represents nearly the entirety of COGS, we faced an increase of approximately 16% in our raw materials and packaging costs, which was largely driven by inflationary pressures that resulted in an 8% increase on a per case basis. This reflected some benefits from the lapping of the seltzer obsolescence charge in fiscal '22 as excluding any obsolescence impact, the increases in our raw materials and packaging costs would have been 20% on an absolute basis and 12% on a per case basis.\nNote that these 2 cost categories, including the obsolescence impact represented just over 55% of the import portions COGS in fiscal '23. We also saw a 12% year-over-year increase in freight costs, mainly driven by incremental shipment expenses that were offset by efficiency initiatives. Freight costs were 5% up on a per case basis and account for just under 25% of import COGS. and we faced a 14% rise in labor and overhead costs that was mainly driven by our brewery capacity investments. Labor and overhead were up 7% on a per case basis and accounted for just under 15% of import COGS. In addition, operating margins for the beer business were also affected by a $41 million or nearly 22% increase in depreciation, almost entirely associated with our brewery capacity investments. A $55 million or nearly 9% increase in marketing spend related to incremental investments in sport sponsorships and a $48 million or nearly 14% decrease in our -- in other SG&A, driven by incremental sales support to align with the momentum of our beer brands. Note, however, that while our marketing investments increased when compared to the prior year, they were still within our 9% to 10% range as a percentage of net sales. All of that said, and it's important to note that we still delivered best-in-class margins for our beer business in fiscal '23. Now shifting to our Wine & Spirits business. First, please recall that we divested a collection of primarily mainstream wine brands from our wine portfolio in fiscal '23.\nSo during today's remarks, I will also be discussing top line on an organic basis, which excludes the contributions from the divested brands. As Bill noted, despite the strong performance of our higher-end Wine & Spirits brands on an organic basis, net sales decline of 2%, ultimately landing in our guidance range. The decline in net sales, excluding the impact of the divestiture, was primarily driven by our mainstream brands as they faced challenging market conditions and lapping of prior fiscal year inventory build.\nAgain, this decline was partially offset by strong growth in our higher-end brands, which outperformed in the U.S. in the higher-end category for both Wine & Spirits and total U.S. wine market. Our higher-end brands also had strong growth in our emerging and rapidly expanding direct-to-consumer channels and international markets. Over time, we expect our portfolio to continue to migrate toward the higher end and for these higher-end brands, channels and markets to support our top line growth acceleration.\nShipments on an organic basis decreased by under 8% and depletions decreased by 3%. As just noted, this volume decline, which reduced organic net sales by $148 million, was driven primarily by our mainstream brands, as mix and price, largely driven by our higher-end brands provided a $111 million uplift to organic net sales.\nWine & Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business, following their divestiture in fiscal '23, increased 2%, and operating margin increased 80 basis points to nearly 23%, also reflecting the same exclusion. This margin increase was driven by a $12 million uplift from net sales flow-through as favorable product mix was supported by lower grade costs as well as a strong New Zealand harvest. Benefits from other cost savings actions primarily resulting in lower-grade costs that helped to partially offset higher logistics material costs. And more efficient marketing expense from enhanced investment strategies, which increased focus the highest return opportunities, which supported a $20 million tailwind to operating income.\nThese benefits were partially offset by $17 million in higher SG&A from increased headcount, as we continue to strategically invest in our growing DTC channels. We remain well positioned to continue to expand margins in our Wine & Spirits business over time with mix improvements and productivity initiatives in the future. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. In fiscal '23, our corporate expense included approximately $270 million from SG&A and $20 million from unconsolidated investments related to our ventures portfolio. All-in, landing at the low end of our guidance at $290 million.\nWithin the SG&A portion of corporate expense, the implementation of our DBA program, which stands for digital business acceleration, accounted for $47 million.\nAs a reminder, we introduced our multiyear DbA initiative in fiscal '23 and expect similar investments to carry into fiscal '24. Interest expense for the year increased 12% to approximately $400 million, coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. This increase was driven primarily by the financing of the stock reclassification, which took place in Q3 of fiscal '23 as well as the impact of rising interest rates on approximately 15% of our debt with adjustable rates.\nOur full year comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 19.2% versus 17.5% last year as we lapped favorability in fiscal '22, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation activity. Free cash flow for fiscal '23, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx, was above the upper end of our guidance range at $1.7 billion. CapEx totaled $1 billion, including over $800 million of investment in our beer business.\nCapEx came in below our guidance, primarily due to timing shifts in the spend for certain materials and equipment of our Mexico brewery investments at our Nava and Obregon facilities. As of the end of fiscal '23, our Mexico brewery operations had a total nominal capacity of approximately 42 million hectoliters. This includes 32.5 million hectoliters at our Nava facility and 9.5 million hectoliters at our Obregon facility.\nThis represents a 1 million hectoliter uplift at our Nava facility relative to the capacity we communicated a few months ago. This uplift is once again the result of our continued productivity initiatives that have unlocked additional production flexibility from the existing footprint of our breweries. As a reminder, earlier this year, we shared that these initiatives had unlocked additional capacity of 1.5 million hectoliters at Nava and 0.5 million hectoliters at Obregon.\nIn light of the 2.5 million hectoliters of productivity capacity unlocked at Nava in fiscal '23, we have slightly adjusted the ramp-up plans for our new ABA production line at that facility, which I will discuss shortly. With that, let's move now to our outlook for fiscal '24. We expect a comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, excluding Canopy equity earnings. For fiscal '24, our beer business is targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%. As Bill discussed earlier, we expect to continue strong volume growth momentum to be largely driven by our iconic brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra and next wave brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada brands.\nWe anticipate our full year fiscal '24 shipments and depletions to track each other closely, both on an absolute basis and in terms of the year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, despite some fluctuations in the last few years in our quarterly shipment cadence and year-over-year growth rates due to severe weather and pandemic-related impacts, we expect the cadence of our shipments in fiscal '24 to follow a more traditional seasonal pattern. We anticipate approximately 55% of our fiscal '24 wine to ship in the first half as we meet peak summer demand for our products.\nIn addition, from a quarterly perspective, particularly when looking at year-over-year growth rates, we also expect shipment and depletion comparisons to still show some variability as they always have, as we manage inventory levels around seasonality throughout the year and our regular brewery maintenance activities in Q3. All of that said, we do not expect to have any incremental lapping variability in our shipment growth rate for Q4 as we did in fiscal '23.\nFrom a pricing perspective, at this stage, we are planning for average annual pricing within our 1% to 2% algorithm. We are mindful that consumers will likely continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions for the foreseeable future, and that our pricing increases in the last 2 fiscal years were above this algorithm. As we advance throughout the year, we will continue to monitor inflationary dynamics and potential recessionary risks to ensure our pricing is appropriately balanced to support the momentum of our brands.\nWe will provide any further update in that regard as part of our future quarterly calls. In terms of operating income growth. Our beer business is targeting 5% to 7%, which implies a fiscal '24 operating margin of approximately 38%.\nAs we have discussed, we continue to expect our beer operating margin to be negatively impacted by inflationary COGS headwinds. The majority of these relate to year-over-year adjustments in our packaging and raw material costs, which, on average, represent a high single-digit increase in absolute terms for these inputs in the import portion of our beer business.\nWhile prices for some of these inputs are off their peaks, most are subject to contractual terms that reflect annual adjustments based on trailing pricing data and some still remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic prices. In fiscal '24, we expect packaging and raw material for imports to account for approximately 55% to 60% of our costs. In addition, we expect freight to be approximately 20% to 25% of costs and reflect a high single-digit year-over-year absolute increase as we continue to face annual volume contractual increases. And labor and overhead to be approximately 15% of costs and reflect a high teens increase in absolute terms, largely driven by increased headcount and training tied to our brewery capacity investments.\nFor our beer business, we expect incremental depreciation of approximately $35 million to $40 million, as we continue to bring into production incremental growing capacity from our investments, particularly at Obregon, in fiscal '24. As noted earlier, the incremental capacity unlocked from our existing Nava facility footprint from productivity initiatives has given us additional flexibility on the ramp-up of our new ABA line. We now intend to spend a bit more time optimizing that new additional ABA production to better support the strong growth of our Modelo Chelada brands.\nAccordingly, we anticipate the ABA line will be ramping up in Q4 of FY '24. Conversely, we have been able to accelerate the ramp-up of our next 5 million hectoliter investment at Obregon to Q1 of fiscal '24. This is being enabled by the move of brewery and package equipment that we had previously intended for use in Mexico. Now going back to operating margins. We plan to execute a number of productivity initiatives to help offset inflationary pressures. The expectations shared for our beer business COGS in fiscal '24 have operational efficiencies and cost-saving actions embedded into them.\nThese initiatives include benefits from our ongoing hedging program and contractual negotiation efforts as well as from our fiscal '23 DBA program. To that end, it is relevant to note that only around 25% of our beer business COGS are subject to contractual pricing adjustments within fiscal '24, and then we expect our hedging program to reduce our exposure to those adjustments for about 10% to 15% of COGS.\nIn addition, we expect to deliver marketing and other SG&A efficiencies, including an even greater focus on optimizing these types of investments toward our iconic and next wave brands. So despite remaining slightly below our medium-term operating margin target we expect our fiscal '24 efforts to still yield best-in-class results for our beer business, and we expect all quarters within fiscal '24 to deliver operating margins above this latest quarter's result.\nMoving to the outlook for our Wine & Spirits business. Our fiscal -- for fiscal '24, we are targeting organic net sales to be relatively flat within 0.5 percentage point from fiscal '23 net sales, excluding $38.5 million of net sales from the brands divested in fiscal '23. We expect to continue the strong growth of our Premium Wine, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands and in our DTC channels and international markets. These segments of our business will help to offset the headwinds we expect to face with our mainstream U.S. wholesale brands, which are facing challenging market conditions due to ongoing consumer-led premiumization.\nConversely to our beer business, we expect our Wine & Spirits business to ship approximately 55% of our fiscal '24 volumes in the second half, again, in line with seasonal demand for our Wine & Spirits products. More notably, despite continued inflationary pressures, we are targeting operating income growth between 2% to 4%, exclusive of $19.5 million of gross profit, less marketing, related to brands divested in fiscal '23. This implies an operating margin improvement of at least 40 basis points.\nThe primary margin improvement drivers for fiscal '24 include additional mix improvement, particularly with our further optimized portfolio, driven by ongoing growth in our higher-end brands from continued consumer-led premiumization trends, enduring growth momentum in our higher-margin direct-to-consumer channels and targeted international metro areas, primarily through our Aspira portfolio brands, additional innovation with new consumer-led products that help extend our higher-end offerings and stabilize our mainstream brands, reduced marketing spend relative to net sales with optimized investments increasingly focused on high-growth, high-return areas and additional SG&A reductions in cost management initiatives.\nSimilar to our beer business, we expect approximately 25% of our Wine & Spirits business COGS to be subject to adjustments within fiscal '24. Now moving to expectations for the rest of the P&L in fiscal '24. Corporate expense, including just the SG&A portion, is expected to be approximately $270 million. We expect to see favorability from the termination of certain compensation and benefits that will not be payable in fiscal '24 following the retirement of Rob and Richard Sands from their executive roles for the reclassification agreement approved by shareholders in fiscal '23, offset by the impact of inflationary pressures and merit-driven salary increases.\nInterest expense is expected to be approximately $500 million for the year. This is a 25% increase from fiscal '23 and is primarily due to the incremental interest expense associated with the financing of the reclassification. The comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings is expected to be around 19%. Rounding up the P&L, we anticipate approximately $40 million in noncontrolling interest benefits and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately 184 million.\nTurning to cash flow. We expect fiscal '24 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. CapEx includes approximately $1 billion to support our Mexico brewery investment and most of the remainder will support our Wine & Spirits hospitality updates.\nTo wrap up, I would like to reiterate that our refreshed capital allocation priorities that we have introduced and discussed throughout fiscal '23 and earlier by Bill remain unchanged. We remain committed to a disciplined financial foundation by maintaining an investment-grade rating as we move towards our net leverage ratio target, delivering returns to shareholders via both dividends in line with our payout ratio goal and through incremental share repurchases to at least cover dilution while remaining opportunistic for any additional repurchases, continuing to support the growth of our businesses through deployed capital in our beer brewing emissions and in our Wine & Spirits hospitality investments.\nAnd lastly, through smaller acquisitions that will fill gaps or enhance our existing portfolio.\nWe believe that this strong disciplined capital allocation strategy, combined with exceptional execution, will empower us to be a premier shareholder return generator for the foreseeable future.\nWith that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joseph Suarez. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVP of IR, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, all, and happy new year. Welcome to Constellation Brands Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with our CEO, Bill Newlands; and our CFO, Garth Hankinson. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters or like last, let me limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill..\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter call. I hope you all had a great holiday season and that our products were able to play a role in some of your special moments with your family and friends. Since our last call in October, Constellation Brands reached a notable milestone in its history as a public company.\nAs most of you know, in November, our shareholders approved the elimination of our Class B common stock. With that came the transition of our company to a single class of publicly listed stock, our Class A common stock, which provides our shareholders with equal 1 share, 1 vote rights. I want to thank everyone who supported this important enhancement to our company's corporate governance profile and capital structure. We believe that our leadership team now has an even stronger foundation to continue to build shareholder value through the strategic initiatives we adopted and have steadily advanced over the past nearly 4 years since I assumed the role of CEO.\nSince fiscal 2020, we agreed to focus on and put in place plans to: number one, continue to build powerful brands that people love; number two, develop consumer-led innovations aligned with emerging trends and consistently shape our portfolio for growth; number three, deploy capital in line with disciplined and balanced priorities; and number four, operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world. I'm pleased to say that we continue to build on a strong track record we have established against all of these strategic initiatives.\nStarting with number one, building our powerful portfolio of brands. Our beer business, despite a more recent series of headwinds, which we'll address in a few minutes, delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of leading share gains across the entire U.S. beer category in IRI channels that was primarily driven by our 2 largest brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra.\nIn the third quarter, Modelo Especial maintained its position as the top share gainer and is the #1 high-end beer brand, and Corona Extra was the third largest share gainer and the #3 high-end beer brand. In fact, our beer business delivered 3.5 points of share gains and 54% in dollar sales growth when comparing the 52-week period that ended with our latest fiscal third quarter against the 52-week period that ended with our fiscal 2019. And comparing the same periods, the business contributed the highest dollar sales growth in the category, amounting to over $2.5 billion.\nIn our Wine & Spirits business, our largest higher-end brands Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner and High West, all delivered dollar sales growth and share gains in the third quarter. And comparing the 52-week period that ended our latest fiscal third quarter, against the 52-week period that ended our fiscal 2019, these brands achieved 72% dollar sales growth.\nMoving on to number two, consumer-led innovation and shaping our portfolio for growth. Many of you may be surprised to know that in our beer portfolio, our SKUs introduced over the past 3 years have driven 20% of the growth delivered by the business since the start of fiscal 2020. An important part of this growth has come from our Modelo, Chelada brands, which have evolved from a niche business to a sizable platform. In fiscal 2023 year-to-date, it has delivered 13.6 million cases of depletions, which already exceeds the brand's total deflations for all of last fiscal year. And in the third quarter, Modelo Chelada limoncello moved up 9 spots to become the sixth largest share gaining brand in IRI tracked channels. Beyond the Chelada brands, we continue to build on the opportunities within the Modelo family with a clear focus on maintaining brand investments. We are excited about the national launch of Modelo Oro in March which has surpassed internal and external benchmarks in test markets.\nIn our Wine & Spirits business, innovation has also yielded strong results, increasing its contribution to net sales from 1% in fiscal 2020 to approximately 8% in fiscal '23 year-to-date. This expansion has been primarily driven by extending our largest higher-end brand, once again, Meiomi Kim, The Prisoner and High West. Notably, extensions in The Prisoner brand family, Blindfold, Saldo and Unshackled have contributed significant growth, especially Unshackled, which has grown to be half the size of The Prisoner brand in just 4 years.\nIn addition, since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we have added 5 brands through acquisitions, like Bronco Wines, My Favorite Neighbor, Empathy Wines, Halpern and Kings and Austin Cocktails, all of which are in the higher-end segments of the wines and spirits categories that are contributing to growth. And we divested 36 brands, the vast majority of which were in the mainstream segment, which has mainly been in decline due to consumer-led premiumization trends. Given this free shaping of our portfolio, including the recent additional divestiture 62% of net sales in fiscal '23 year-to-date were from our higher-end brands. This is a dramatic shift from the 34% higher-end brands represented at the end of fiscal '19.\nNow turning to number three, capital allocation. In fiscal 2020, we introduced a thoughtfully structured approach designed to consistently deploy capital with discipline and balance. We made maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, our top capital allocation priority and reduced our net leverage ratio, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, from 4.5x at the end of fiscal '19 to 3x by the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year. This was partly driven by a $3.2 billion reduction in our debt levels and partly by strong earnings growth in our beer business.\nAnd then in the third quarter, these efforts gave us the flexibility to both accommodate the $1.5 billion financing for the elimination of our Class B shares and to maintain our investment-grade rating. As our net leverage ratio remained in line with our prior 3.5x target. However, we recently updated that set target to 3x, given our ability to previously achieve that target and the continued strong cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses.\nOur second priority became delivering cash returns to our shareholders, and we set a goal to return $5 billion in dividends and buybacks between fiscal 2020 and '23. We virtually completed that goal ahead of schedule in the third quarter and we are now on track to exceed the $5 billion target with the fourth quarter dividend payment announced today. As to our third priority, we sought to advance growing capacity expansions to support the strong growth in our beer business. Since the start of fiscal 2020, we added approximately 9 million hectoliters of capacity through growth investments and another 2 million through brewery optimization and productivity initiatives.\nWe are also on track to further diversify our production footprint with the development of our new brewery in Veracruz, where we have recently broken ground. And last in our capital allocation priorities was M&A, and since the start of fiscal '20, we have judiciously deployed excess cash through acquisitions with a strict focus on small gap filling higher-end brands. And the key strategic acquisitions we have executed over the last nearly 4 years are delivering top line growth. All in, we believe we have unquestionably upheld our capital allocation priorities and have even exceeded some of the associated targets we set out to achieve.\nMoving on to strategic initiative number four, operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world by advancing ESG goals. Our ambitions are to protect the environment and natural resources by serving as a model for water stewardship in our industry while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to champion the professional development and advancement of women within our company, industry and communities, to enhance the economic development and prosperity in disadvantaged communities and to promote responsible beverage alcohol consumption. While we still have much work to do, I am proud to say we are making good progress towards our goals.\nTo that end, in the third quarter, we released our 2022 ESG Impact Report, which included several enhancements on the information shared on these important topics and our work towards our targets, including, for the first time, references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and taking into consideration recommendations from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures.\nSo as with our capital allocation priorities, we have been consistently working to deliver against our strategic initiatives. Net, we have done we have said what we do, and we have done what we said. And despite current inflationary pressures and the risk of recessionary headwinds we remain confident in our ability to continue to advance and create value through these initiatives.\nAnd on that note, let's move on to a more fulsome discussion of our performance in the third quarter. Depletion growth for our beer business decelerated to 5.7%, which, as I mentioned earlier, was largely due to a recent series of headwinds that developed towards the latter part of the quarter. First, as we shared on our last call, we decided to introduce all pricing changes above our usual algorithm due to cost pressures across the chain, and historically, the impact of these types of notable pricing actions take a few months to settle in.\nSecond, distribution growth is returning to more normalized levels after lapping a softer summer period last year when we were managing supply constraints. That said, distribution growth remains at exceptionally healthy levels as well as aligned with our full year expectations. And third, some of these headwinds were particularly accentuated in a few key regions for our brands, such as California, where we lapped double-digit depletion growth rates and better weather in November of last year as well as more favorable economic conditions.\nAll of that said, our beer business continues to perform strongly relative to the wider market and to resonate with consumers who continue to shift to higher-end brands. In IRI channels, we gained 1.5 points across the entire category and 2.3 points in the higher-end segment in the third quarter, which is higher, let me repeat that, which is higher than the share gains in the same quarter last fiscal year.\nAnd when looking at depletions fiscal '23 year-to-date, our beer business achieved growth of 7.8%, which continues to be in line with our annual expectations. Importantly, based on the prior activity we have seen in retail, as they adjust to the continued inflationary environment, we expect trends to return to more historical rates over the next few months.\nNow shifting to the performance of our beer brands. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of 4.4% in the third quarter lapping a tough 13.2% depletion growth comparison in the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. That said, the brand has achieved depletion growth of 9.9% over fiscal '23 year-to-date.\nIn the recent quarter, it continued to strengthen its position in the 5 states where it is already the #1 beer brand in dollar sales, delivering another approximately 0.2 points in share gains. Importantly, in the other 39 states tracked by IRI data, Modelo Especial delivered more than 4x the share gains at over 0.8 points. More broadly, Modelo Especial's depletion growth in its secondary markets outpaced the growth in its top 5 states by over 10 points. As such, we continue to see significant incremental opportunities to maintain the momentum of Modelo Especial, particularly through distribution gains in the states where it is under represented.\nCorona Extra delivered depletion growth of 1.3% in the third quarter and 4% in fiscal '23 year-to-date. As noted earlier, the brand has maintained its momentum as the #3 share gainer in track channels. We continue to invest in the growth of Corona Extra through a thoughtful and authentic evolution of the brand's market such as the augmented reality addition to our O Tannenpalm campaign, which is one of the more enduring holiday themed commercials running for over 30 years now. And we continue to see growth potential for Corona Extra with younger legal drinking age and multicultural consumers.\nPacifico's depletion growth accelerated in the third quarter to 40.7%. And over fiscal '23, year-to-date, its depletion growth was 32.9%. The brand remains a top 10 share gainer in track channels in the third quarter, mainly supported by its growing footprint in states like California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. We continue to see fantastic growth runway for Pacifico as one of our new wave brands with significant distribution potential relative to Modelo and even more so relative to Corona Extra. Particularly as the brand also continues to build momentum by shifting east in the U.S., building on the 26% depletion growth delivered in our Eastern business unit in the third quarter.\nLastly, our Modelo Chelada brands achieved depletion growth of 44% in the third quarter and 48% over fiscal '23 year-to-date. Our Model Chelada brand remained the #1 set in the Chelada space, and the brands gained nearly half a share point across all U.S. beer and track channels. For perspective, that is as much as Corona Extra's gain. In fact, these gains were largely driven by innovations launched this fiscal year, including Naranja Picosa flavor, the Limon y Sal 12 ounce 12 pack, which is a top 10 new patent SKU and our new variety pack, which is among the top 15 new brands.\nWe continue to expect significant growth from the Modelo Chelada brands as we invest in marketing to the general market consumer to broaden the demographic appeal for this product. All in, the strong demand for our brands in the third quarter supported a net sales increase of approximately 8% for our beer business. And despite the impact of inflationary headwinds on operating income, we were able to maintain operating margin at 37.5%. This gives us the confidence to once again raise guidance for our beer business this fiscal year lifting the low end of our growth outlook. We now expect to achieve 9% to 10% net sales growth and 4% to 5% operating income growth for fiscal '23.\nMoving on to Wine & Spirits. Our Wine & Spirits business continues to advance its vision to be the high-end market leader. As noted earlier, our largest higher-end brands delivered strong performance relative to their categories in the third quarter. In our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, over the third quarter in track channels, The Prisoner brands grew dollar sales by 4.3%, while the fine wine segment contracted by 5.7%. And High West grew dollar sales by 22%, while high-end spirits segment grew by only 3.4% In our premium and mainstream Wine & Spirits portfolio, which we refer to as Ignite, both Meiomi and Kim Crawford gained share in the U.S. wine category.\nDepletions for our Wine & Spirits business declined by 5.5% in the third quarter, mainly driven by continued headwinds based across our mainstream brands. However, our Aspira portfolio delivered strong performance with 8.5% depletion growth in the quarter. And in fiscal '23 year-to-date, our Aspira portfolio has now achieved an overall 6.3% increase in depletions supported by strong double-digit depletion growth for The Prisoner and High West.\nAmong Ignite brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford have also delivered solid depletion growth in fiscal '23 year-to-date, supporting an overall 2.3% increase in depletions for our premium line portfolio. Our Wine & Spirits business also continued to expand its global omnichannel footprint, advancing its growth in direct-to-consumer, 3-tier e-commerce channels as well as international markets. Wine & Spirits DTC net sales grew 23% in the third quarter, and we continue to perform particularly well in 3-tier e-commerce which delivered dollar sales growth 9 points above the competition.\nThese results were underpinned by our strategic DTC investments in both hospitality through facility upgrades and talent development and our own e-commerce website platforms as well as our continued leadership in 3-tier e-commerce through marketing innovations like launching video ads on Instacart. And a strategic focus on major omnichannel national accounts, third-party marketplaces and digitally native retailers like Amazon, where we were the #1 overall supplier and #1 gross supplier in higher-end wine in the third quarter.\nInternational markets accounted for 9% of the total net sales in the Wine & Spirits business in the third quarter as our strategically focused approach continued to target select metropolitan markets, including London, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney, Mexico City, Zurich and Toronto with some of our most renowned premium and fine wine brands like The Prisoner, the Schrader as well as more recently acquired brands like Lingua Franca and My Favorite Neighbor.\nAnd with our craft spirits portfolio, which includes brands like Casa Noble and the CAMPO high-end tequilas, that delivered international shipments 5x greater than the third quarter of the prior year. We are also pleased that our efforts to establish a leading global higher-end Wine & Spirits portfolio are gaining recognition with several of our brands receiving remarkable accolades including Schrader Cellars winning its 37th 100-point score and its Double Diamond brand being recognized by The Wine Spectator as its #1 wine of 2022.\nOur To Kalon Vineyard was being recognized again as the top vineyard in North America for the fourth consecutive year among top vineyards in the world. And I'm pleased to report that our To Kalon Vineyard has now also is certified as organic, expanding the appeal of its lines to a broader set of consumers and adding to its differentiation. And in our spirits portfolio, our recently launched Nelson Brothers Bourbon Reserve was ranked among Whiskey Advocate's top 10 most exciting whiskeys of 2022. So all in, our Wine & Spirits business continues to make meaningful progress on its transformation.\nAnd while net sales and operating margins, net of recent divestiture, were slightly lower relative to the third quarter of last fiscal year due to volume shifts from shipment timing only being partially offset by mix and pricing benefits we did see a significant sequential uplift in operating margins of 55 basis points relative to the second quarter of this fiscal year. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance for our Wine & Spirits business of stable to 2% lower net sales and 3% to 5% operating income growth, which we are providing against the fiscal '22 baseline adjusted for the recent divestiture.\nLooking further ahead, we are also confident that over the medium term, both our beer business and our Wine & Spirits business remain well placed to deliver strong growth and best-in-class operating margins. That said, given continued inflationary pressures and the potential impact of recessionary environment, we remain mindful of balancing the momentum of our brands against near-term cost challenges.\nTo that end, based on our current expectations of the pressures that the consumer will continue to face in the near term, we are giving even more careful consideration to our pricing actions for fiscal '24. In particular, we currently expect pricing actions for our beer business to be more muted in fiscal '24 as our pricing actions in the current fiscal year were ultimately above our medium-term algorithm. While input costs remain at historically elevated prices we strongly believe that additional consideration in our approach to pricing in fiscal '24 is warranted to sustain healthy growth for our brands.\nIn addition, while some input costs are below the peaks from earlier this fiscal year, we now anticipate inflation to remain above historical trends in the high-end single-digit range for fiscal '24. As always, we will continue with our disciplined approach to manage these evolving conditions through cost-saving initiatives. But these persistent inflationary headwinds will be compounding on the double-digit cost uplift we have faced in fiscal '23. As such, we now expect operating margins for our beer business in fiscal '24 to be more in line with our anticipated margin structure for this fiscal year, and therefore, below our stated 39% to 40% medium-term range. We are still refining our outlook for '24 and will provide more detailed guidance at our next earnings call, but we wanted to share some context today now that our annual planning process is underway.\nWith all that said, let me be clear. Our beer business continues to have best-in-class operating margins and our Wine & Spirits business continues to make progress toward achieving that same differentiation. We are also confident that over the medium term, our beer business remains well positioned to deliver leading operating margins, supported by the sustained momentum of our core Modelo Especial and Corona Extra brands, the significant opportunity being captured by our Pacifico, Modelo Chelada brands.\nThe incremental upside from our broader existing portfolio and the continued development of our innovation lineup particularly from exciting imminent additions like dell' Ornellaia and we continue to expect our Wine & Spirits business to make progress on its operating margins supported by continuing to pursue the exciting runway for growth of our higher-end brands and ensuring these brands represent an even greater portion of our mix over time, enhancing the performance of our mainstream portfolio through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through relevant and innovative products and growing our omni-channel and international leadership particularly as an incremental opportunity for higher-end growth.\nNow before I conclude, I wish to quickly touch on Canopy. We remain supporter of Canopy sellers to create an exchangeable share structure designed to support the consolidation of all its U.S. cannabis assets into a single avenue. And to that end, our intention continues to be to transition our existing common share ownership interest in Canopy Growth into new exchangeable shares once its shareholders approve this transaction. We believe that the conversion of our ownership interest will maintain our ability to realize the potential upside of our investment in Canopy.\nAt the same time this transaction and the surrender of our warrants are expected to eliminate the impact to our equity and earnings, mitigate risk to our organization and further reinforce our intent to not deploy additional investment in Canopy in line with our capital allocation priorities. In closing, I'd like to reiterate 3 main takeaways today. First, nearly 4 years ago we committed to a series of strategic initiatives aimed at delivering profitable growth and shareholder value. And I'm pleased to say that we are delivering against those initiatives and in many cases even exceeding the goals we set out to achieve.\nSecond, our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute against these strategic initiatives and that our company remains in a strong position to deliver best-in-class results. Despite the headwinds in the quarter due to macroeconomic pressures and tough comps versus prior year, the strong performance of our beer business has put it on track to deliver better-than-expected results in fiscal '23. And the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business is also yielding results.\nAnd third, we remain confident we will continue to build on our track record of solid growth and value creation through our strategic initiatives. And with that, I turn the call over to Garth.\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we delivered another set of solid results in the third quarter and continue to make progress against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Our beer business achieved high single-digit net sales growth and continue to deliver best-in-class operating margins. Our Wine & Spirits business made additional progress against its strategy with an even more premiumized portfolio further aligned with consumer trends following our recently completed divestiture. Additionally, we generated strong cash flow results and with yesterday's declared dividend to be paid in February, we are on track to exceed our stated $5 billion goal of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases between fiscal '20 and fiscal '23.\nI will now review our Q3 performance and full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with our beer business. Net sales increased 8%, primarily driven by higher average price increases and solid demand across our portfolio. Q3 shipment volumes were up 3% reflecting a difficult buying lap given the focus of replenishing product inventories in the same period last year. From a depletions perspective, we achieved growth in the quarter of approximately 6%, driven by the demand of our Modelo family of products, including the Modelo Especial and Modelo Chelada brand as well as double-digit growth from Pacifico.\nAs Bill noted, depletions decelerated sequentially from Q2 to Q3. This was primarily due to: number one, incremental fall pricing that, as expected, will put us above our targeted annual average increase. Notably the impact of our fall increases has been heightened by additional pricing actions across the value chain. That said, we expect the impact of incremental pricing will settle over the coming months as we have seen in prior similar circumstances.\nNumber two, relatively lower distribution growth in Q3 versus Q2, where we lapped a softer prior year period when we were managing supply constraints. And while we are seeing distribution growth return to normalized levels, it remains aligned with our full year expectations. Importantly, it is worth noting that Q3 distribution growth remained well above the levels we achieved in Q4 last year and Q1 of this year.\nAnd number three, as Bill also referenced in the third quarter, particularly in the month of November, we lapped multiple tailwinds from last year such as double-digit depletion growth rates in key regions like California, which benefited from periods of warmer weather and a stronger macroeconomic environment. All of that said, we expect depletion trends to continue to normalize as we move into fiscal 2024, and we remain confident in our fiscal year expectations. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year, but please note that in Q4, there will be 1 less selling day. Operating income for the beer business decreased 2% and operating margins declined by 380 basis points to 38%.\nAs expected, operating income and operating margins were negatively affected by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, particularly as more favorable hedges rolled off. Increased logistics expenses related to higher fuel and freight costs, incremental operating costs and increased depreciation as a result of our brewery capacity expansions, and increased marketing spend, particularly from our media investments in sports sponsorships with NFL and TAA Football, Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 160 basis points to 9.6% in Q3. For fiscal '23, we continue to expect that marketing as a percent of net sales will be in the 9% to 10%. More broadly, given the strong top line growth of our beer business year-to-date, we now anticipate it will grow net sales between 9% to 10% and operating income between 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year.\nThis still implies an operating margin of approximately 38% for fiscal 2023. As expected benefits from our 2% to 3% average pricing increase for the full year and our cost-saving efforts will be more than offset by the same headwinds that have affected our margins year-to-date. I'd like to take a moment to reiterate some of the points Bill made earlier regarding fiscal '24. As mentioned, we are anticipating our beer business margins to be more in line with our anticipated margin for this fiscal year, and therefore, below our stated medium-term target range of 39% to 40%. This is driven by the fact that input costs remain at historically elevated levels due to ongoing inflationary pressures.\nAs we have shared in some of our prior calls, we hedged about 10% of our beer business costs to help reduce volatility in the P&L. However, our commodity hedging program is managed on a multiyear rolling basis. So we currently do not anticipate our blended hedge rates to capture the favorability of recent declines in certain commodity prices until the second half of next fiscal year. In addition while prices have declined from their peaks earlier this year for commodities like aluminum and natural gas, which are part of our can and glass cost, they still remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nBeyond our hedging program, most of our beer business input costs have a greater exposure to inflationary pressures, including raw materials, such as wood pallets, steel crowns and cartons. The majority of these input costs are subject to contractual agreements that tend to reflect negotiated prices that are based on existing inflationary conditions. So as we move forward with our annual planning and supplier cost determination process, we will develop a clearer view of these contractual prices and on the resulting margin expectations. Against that backdrop, with these processes now underway, we have greater visibility into the high single-digit cost segments that will continue to build off the double digit unfavorable cost outlook that our beer business faced in fiscal '23.\nIn addition, we continue to see ongoing macroeconomic pressures on the consumer, which are leading us to plan to take more subdued pricing actions across our beer portfolio in fiscal '24. That said, we expect a number of tailwinds that will partially offset some of these elements, including the continued momentum of our core brands, capitalizing on opportunities with emerging brands such as Pacifico and Modelo Chelada's, winning with new and future innovation such as Modelo or Modelo Oro and through our consistent and disciplined cost savings actions, nevertheless, as Bill mentioned, we will continue to refine our outlook for next year, and we will provide detailed guidance during our Q4 earnings call.\nThat said, it is important to reiterate that our expected fiscal '23 and fiscal '24 operating margins remained best in class. And in fact, when considering our fiscal '20 through our currently anticipated fiscal '24 margins, we expect the average operating margin for that 5-year period to remain within our medium-term algorithm of 39% to 40%.\nNow shifting to Wine & Spirits. As a reminder, during our recently concluded third quarter, we divested a series of brands from our Wine portfolio. As such, third quarter of fiscal '22, included approximately $17 million of net sales and $11 million of gross profit less marketing, that are no longer part of the Wine & Spirits segment results. When presenting today's results, I will be discussing our top line results on an organic basis, excluding the contribution from those divested brands in the preceding periods.\nStarting with organic net sales. The Wine & Spirits business decreased 1%, primarily driven by a 13% increase in shipments, partially offset by a favorable product mix, which both related to consumer-led premiumization and mix improvements of our portfolio. From a depletions perspective, while the Wine & Spirits business saw a decline of approximately 6% on an organic basis in Q3 as Bill noted earlier, our higher-end brand delivered strong performance with our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, delivering depletion growth of 9%, driven by growth in our Prisoner Wine and High West brands.\nMeanwhile, our Ignite portfolio, which includes our mainstream and premium Wine & Spirits brands primarily faced headwinds from our mainstream brands, which was down 8%. That said, in tracked channels, our largest higher-end brands continue to outperform their corresponding segments, and our peak premium brands portfolio actually gained share in the category with particularly strong performance from Meiomi and Kim Crawford in both volume and dollar sales growth.\nMoving on to Wine & Spirits operating income and operating margins. Wine & Spirits operating income declined by 7%, partly as a result of the divestiture and operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 24.8%. The decrease in operating margins was driven by higher transportation costs, including ocean freight shipping, unfavorable costs from higher drivers largely due to inflation and increased general and administrative expenses due to higher compensation and benefits primarily related to higher headcount from our continued strategic focus on expanding into direct-to-consumer channels and higher-end brands in our Aspira portfolio.\nFor full year fiscal '23, we remain confident in our previously stated outlook for our Wine & Spirits Experience business. We expect fiscal '23 organic net sales decline of 0% to 2% and operating income to increase 3% to 5% implying a full year operating margin of about 24%. Looking ahead to fiscal '24, we expect our Wine & Spirits business to continue to make progress on its operating margin. We believe our Wine & Spirits business is positioned to further improve its operating margins through growth of our higher-end brands, bolster performance from our mainstream portfolio through high-return brand initiatives such as innovation, and expansion of our omnichannel and international footprint.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are currently working through our annual planning process and we'll provide a more detailed fiscal '24 outlook during our Q4 earnings call. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in at approximately $75 million, up 70% versus Q3 last year. This increase in corporate expense was primarily impacted by costs associated with increased compensation and benefits, primarily related to a third quarter fiscal '22 reversal of stock-based compensation and third-party services related to our ongoing investments in our digital business acceleration initiative.\nWe now expect our total corporate spend to be between $290 million and $300 million for the full year, mainly driven by the incremental costs in Q3. Interest expense for the quarter was up 12%. Also, as we noted in our release, following the completion of the reclassification of our Class B common stock, we now expect interest expense for fiscal '23 to be between $390 million and $400 million. This includes the interest expense associated with the funding of the $1.5 billion cash consideration which is expected to be $80 million to $90 million on an annual basis based on current market rates. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, came in at 18.8% versus 14% in Q3 last year.\nThe effective tax rate increased mostly due to the change in stock-based compensation benefits. As a result of these updates to our outlook, the increased interest expense due to the reclassification bonds, adjustments relating to our most recent divestiture in our Wine & Spirits business and increased corporate expenses that were only partially offset by the increased expectations for our beer business. We now expect comparable EPS guidance to be in the $11 to $11.20 range, which represents a $0.20 decrease to the bottom end and a $0.40 decrease at the top end of our prior guidance range.\nMoving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the 9 months of fiscal '23 reflecting strong operating cash flow partially offset by a 14% increase in CapEx investments as we continue to support the growth of our beer business through our brewery capacity expansion plans. And on that note, to echo Bill, we are excited by the progress we have made with our new sites in Veracruz in which we recently broke ground. Our fiscal '23 free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion and CapEx is now expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow for fiscal '23 remains unchanged and is expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion.\nRelated to our uses of these cash flows, as we recently noted in December, our capital allocation priorities moving forward following the reclassification remain fundamentally aligned with the priorities we introduced in fiscal '20. To achieve a disciplined and balanced and thoughtful approach to support growth and value creation. Our recently updated capital allocation priorities are as follows: first, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and to targeting dividend growth in line with earnings as key elements of a disciplined financial foundation.\nWe ended the third quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x when factoring in the financing for the cash payment associated with our recent transition to a single-class stock structure and excluding Canopy equity earnings. That said, we have set a target net leverage ratio on that same basis of approximately 3x, which we are confident we can return to.\nAnother important element of our commitment to a disciplined financial foundation is targeting an approximately 30% dividend and payout ratio. Second, we will continue to balance investments to support the growth of our business and deliver additional returns to shareholders through share repurchases. As we look ahead, we continue to expect adding another 25 million to 30 million hectoliters of brewing capacity between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This will be supported by $5 billion to $5.5 billion of investment over that same period. We are developing this capacity through a series of expansion ways which is consistent with the modular approach we have adopted to maintain capital expenditure discipline and flexibility.\nWe remain committed to executing share repurchases targeted to at least cover dilution. While we also have approximately $1.2 billion of our repurchase capacity still under our current board authorization and plan to remain opportunistic, particularly since we achieved incremental cash flow flexibility. And third, we may deploy excess cash to smaller acquisitions. Again, we intend to remain disciplined in our pursuit of any M&A opportunities and we'll continue to pursue transactions that we believe fulfill one or more of the following characteristics: are consumer led, they deliver growth momentum, providing compelling returns, fill portfolio gaps, and offer synergistic benefits.\nLastly, on Canopy. As it announced in October, Canopy plans to consolidate all of its U.S. cannabis assets into a single entity, Canopy USA. This U.S. holding company and new exchangeable share structure is designed to enable Canopy USA to trigger full ownership of Canopy's U.S. cannabis investments and capitalize on the U.S. cannabis market opportunities. Assuming the completion of this transaction and approval by Canopy shareholders of a charter amendment we intend to transition our existing common share ownership interest in Canopy into new exchangeable shares, which is intended to protect Constellation shareholder value while retaining an interest in Canopy through nonvoting and nonparticipating shares.\nThis share ownership transition and the surrender of our Canopy warrants is aligned with our focus on core beer and Wine & Spirits businesses and capital allocation priorities. As a reminder, until this transaction is completed and we convert our holdings into exchangeable shares, Canopy will still be reported within our P&L consistent with past quarters.\nIn closing, we continue to demonstrate strong execution in growing our core business and investments to enhance our portfolio of industry-leading brands. As we approach the end of the fiscal year, we remain committed to delivering against our stated goals to drive sustainable and profitable growth and build shareholder value. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joseph Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJoseph Suarez\n\nVP of IR, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning all, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.\nAs a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. (Operator Instructions) Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, all. Welcome to our second quarter call. I hope everyone had a good summer and enjoyed some of it with our great products.\nBefore we get started today, I want to take this opportunity to say that our thoughts are with all those affected by Hurricane Ian. Thankfully, all Constellation employees living in Hurricane Ian's path are safe and accounted for. We are also fortunate to have avoided any adverse impact to our operations in the area to this point. And we continue to stay in contact with our local distributors, retailers and other partners to best support their needs in this difficult time.\nAdditionally, thousands of people in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have been impacted by this natural disaster. So we are also supporting the American Red Cross with a significant contribution to help provide food, shelter and much-needed assistance. We will also match employee contributions to the American Red Cross 2-for-1 as part of this effort. And we hope it provides at least some comfort to local residents as they work to recover and rebuild.\nI also want to remind everyone that we filed our proxy statement in connection with the Class B common stock reclassification a couple of weeks ago. We have called a Special Meeting of Shareholders to vote on the reclassification next month on November 9.\nAt this point, we are unable to comment further or provide additional information on this topic during today's call beyond what is available in the proxy statement and our other filings with the SEC. All of these filings are available through our Investor Relations website, and I urge anyone interested in the special meeting or the reclassification to review these documents.\nNow as usual, I would like to start by emphasizing a few key takeaways from our latest results. First, consumer demand for our products remains strong. Consumer-led premiumization trends continue across beverage alcohol, giving further confidence in the resilience of premiumization as a fundamental driver of demand for our brands.\nBuy rate, which captures both the number of trips a consumer makes and the amount they spend per trip, increased in the second quarter for both high-end beer and total wine categories in tracked channels. And buy rate for Hispanic high-end beer consumers, which is particularly relevant to our core beer portfolio, is also proving resilient.\nMore specific to our brands, our Beer business posted depletion growth of nearly 9%. That is more than 9 million additional cases for the quarter. And in our Wine & Spirits business, our wine portfolio gained share and outperformed the entire wine category in tracked channels, while our craft spirits brands outperformed the higher-end segment of the spirits category.\nSecond, our Beer business also continues to outperform the entire category. In the second quarter, our Beer business remained the leading share gainer in U.S. tracked channels across the entire beer category and now accounts for 28% of the high-end segment.\nImportantly, we believe our Beer business remains well placed to continue to support the steady growth of our brands with inventories across the supply chain at historical norms and production continuing for our operating plants to meet volume expectations for the fiscal year and incremental capacity unlocked from our existing brewery operations in Mexico through optimization and productivity initiatives and the expansion of our breweries at Nava and Obregon as well as the construction process of our new brewery in Veracruz are all advancing as planned, all of which has given us the confidence to increase the fiscal '23 net sales and operating income growth guidance for our Beer business and continued conviction in our medium-term top line growth and margin algorithm.\nThird, the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business continues to yield results. Over the past few years, this business has been evolving from a U.S. wholesaler business focused mainly on the mainstream segment to a global omni-channel competitor primarily focused on the higher end.\nAnd in our latest quarter, our largest premium wine brands, Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Meiomi and Ruffino and our largest fine wine brand, The Prisoner Wine Company, all delivered solid depletion growth. In our craft spirits portfolio, High West, Casa Noble and Mi Campo all achieved strong double-digit depletion growth. In addition, our international and DTC channels each delivered double-digit net sales growth year-over-year, and we continue to gain share in 3-tier e-commerce.\nFourth, our capital allocation priorities remain firm. Starting with our investment-grade rating. We expect to remain investment grade, including after funding the expected $1.5 billion cash payment for the Class B common stock reclassification, given the strong operating performance and cash generation of our business.\nMoving on to cash returns to shareholders. As of the end of the second quarter, we were over 97% toward meeting our $5 billion goal. And we have now exceeded the share buybacks component of our goal by $300 million. And upon payment of today's declared dividend, which we expect to take place next month, we will have fully achieved our goal ahead of our fiscal year-end deadline.\nShifting to our third priority of reinvesting to support the growth of our Beer business. As noted earlier, our capacity expansions and construction processes continue according to plan.\nAnd lastly, our M&A focus remains on small acquisitions to fill portfolio gaps, particularly in our Wine & Spirits business. This included, most recently, the investment in a minority stake in Archer Roose as part of our Focus on Female Founders initiative, which is an accessible premium wine brand focused on offering consciously crafted wines to a new generation of legal drinking age wine drinkers. We are proud to say that 5 years into our Focus on Female Founders initiative, we have fulfilled 76% of our commitment to invest $100 million in female-founded and female-led start-ups in the beverage alcohol sector as part of our efforts to enhance social equity within the industry.\nNow let's move on to a more fulsome discussion of our performance in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our beer brands continue to resonate strongly with the consumer, gaining 1.8 points across the entire category and 2.5 points in the high-end segment and tracked channels.\nModelo Especial delivered depletion growth of over 10% and was the #1 share gainer in the entire U.S. beer category. It continues to strengthen its position as the #2 beer brand in dollar sales and is the #1 or 2 beer in 11 states, more than double the number of states from just 3 years ago. We continue to see further opportunities to maintain the growth momentum of Modelo Especial, particularly given the resilience of premiumization trends and our relentless focus on striving to close the brand's distribution and awareness gaps.\nCorona Extra maintained its momentum with 6% depletion growth and is the #3 share gainer in tracked channels. It remains the #1 most loved beer brand with both general market and Hispanic consumers. And our La Vida Más Fina campaign has maintained the #1 spot in ad awareness across the beer category. We continue to expect modest growth from Corona Extra, supported by distribution gains within certain pockets of the U.S. where it is underrepresented and the brand's appeal and growth potential with younger legal drinking age and multicultural consumers.\nPacifico achieved depletion growth of over 37% and was a top 10 share-gaining brand in tracked channels. We continue to see a fantastic growth runway for Pacifico as an emerging brand, particularly as the brand has significant distribution potential when compared to Modelo and even more so when compared to Corona Extra.\nLastly, our Modelo Chelada brands posted depletion growth of more than 60% for the second quarter. And Modelo Chelada Limón y Sal was a top 15 share-gaining brand in tracked channels. Modelo Chelada remains the #1 brand family in the chelada space and owns nearly 60% market share of the chelada segment nationwide.\nHowever, awareness for Modelo Chelada is still relatively low compared to other flavor categories. And we continue to expect significant growth as we invest in marketing to broaden the demographic appeal and in additional flavors and package configurations to unlock new consumption occasions for this product.\nAll in, the strong demand for our brands in the second quarter supported a net sales increase of 15% for our Beer business. And this, in turn, drove a 25% uplift in operating income, which also benefited from the lapping of higher obsolescence charges last year.\nThis gives us confidence to increase guidance for our Beer business as we now expect to achieve 8% to 10% net sales growth and 3% to 5% operating income growth for fiscal '23, which Garth will review in more detail shortly. That said, it is important to remember that in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '23, we will be lapping elevated shipments from the second half of the last fiscal year that resulted from the rebuild of distributor and retailer inventories after supply shortages and severe weather-driven shipping disruptions that occurred in the first half of fiscal '22.\nSo while on an absolute basis, we continue to expect our shipments for the remainder of this fiscal year to be relatively in line with depletions, we believe the more comparable indicator for growth for our beer brands in the second half will be the depletion rate. Looking forward, we are also confident that over the medium term, our Beer business remains well positioned to deliver 7% to 9% net sales growth and 39% to 40% operating margin, supported by the sustained momentum of our core brands, the steady progress of our brewing capacity additions and the continued development of our innovation lineup, including the momentum of our chelada brands, the recent launch of Fresca Mixed, the expansion of Modelo Oro from select test markets to the entire national market next year and the introduction of Corona nonalcoholic.\nThe new nonalcoholic drinking age consumer is an attractive target as they also consume high-end beer as well as spirits and hard seltzers. So we are excited about the extension of Corona into this segment, and we look forward to sharing more details as we approach the product launch.\nMoving on to Wine & Spirits. Our Wine & Spirits business is making headway with its vision to become a bold and innovative high-end market leader. As noted earlier, the largest premium and fine wine brands and craft spirits brands of our portfolio delivered solid depletion growth rates in the second quarter. And relative to the market, the higher-end portion of our wine portfolio, which includes our premium and fine wine brands, outperformed the corresponding category segments in U.S. tracked channels.\nOur craft spirits portfolio delivered dollar sales growth significantly ahead of higher-end segment of the spirits category. Our Wine & Spirits business also continues to advance its mainstream strategy through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through the delivery of relevant and innovative products.\nAs we also announced this morning, we continue to further premiumize our business with the divestiture of a portion of our main streamline portfolio combined with a couple of select premium brands to the wine [brand]. When it closes, we believe this transaction will further enable us to focus our portfolio and efforts to deliver the industry-leading growth in margins that we continue to work towards.\nFrom an innovation perspective, we have several great examples of recently introduced products that are driving growth within our wine portfolio. Woodbridge Box was the #2 premium box share gainer in the second quarter. Meiomi Red Blend 750 was the #2 wine SKU. Kim Crawford Sparkling Prosecco was the #4 new wine brand. And the recent launches of The Prisoner Pinot Noir and Blindfold Blanc de Noir are respectively seeing early successes in priority accounts and the on-premise.\nBeyond product innovation, we continue to extend our growth in direct-to-consumer and 3-tier e-commerce channels as well as international markets. Wine & Spirits DTC net sales grew 15% in the second quarter as our investments in these channels continue to yield strong performance.\nWe also continued to outperform in 3-tier e-commerce, delivering dollar sales growth 16 points ahead of the competition in the second quarter. Importantly, we're also outperforming in 3-tier e-commerce with our Beer business, which achieved a 7-point lead in dollar sales growth versus competition in the second quarter.\nBack to our Wine & Spirits business. International net sales grew 10% versus prior year, showing the continued momentum of our brands in the select international markets that we are targeting. Going forward, we will continue to focus on growing our omni-channel and international footprint as we believe these channels will continue to grow as a portion of our mix over time and be an important opportunity for higher-end growth.\nNow let's move on to Canopy growth. While the impairment of our Canopy investment is clearly disappointing, it is not indicative of a significant long-term market opportunity that still exists for the legal cannabis market, particularly in the U.S. where the market was estimated at $25 billion at the end of 2021 and is expected to nearly double in size by 2026 as more states continue to legalize cannabis.\nIn fact, the companies that Canopy invested in to establish its U.S. ecosystem continued to perform strongly and to scale. We also remain supportive of Canopy's efforts to restructure its Canadian operations and its plan to further drive BioSteel's growth and believe these actions will also strengthen their business and ultimately provide an opportunity to enhance the value of our holding.\nBefore I conclude, I also want to take this opportunity to highlight that we expect to release our 2022 ESG Impact Report later this month. The report seeks to provide a comprehensive review of our ESG strategy and key initiatives designed to make a positive difference in our communities, safeguard our environment and advocate for the responsible consumption of beverage alcohol.\nWe will also, for the first time, be reporting with references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and taking into consideration the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. We believe these planned enhancements to our reporting will be valuable steps intended to better align with stakeholder expectations on the information we provide on these important topics, reflect our company values and better showcase our ongoing efforts to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our communities, our consumers and our employees. I invite all of our stakeholders to spend some time reviewing the report when it is released, which will be available through our company website.\nIn closing, I'd like to reiterate our main takeaways from this quarter. Number one, consumer demand for our higher-end beer and higher-end wine and spirits products continues to be strong. And we remain confident in the long-term prospects of our portfolio and our runway for growth.\nNumber two, our core imported brands continue to outperform the industry. Modelo Especial further strengthened its position as the #2 beer in the U.S. market and continues to gain ground as the #1 share gainer. And Corona Extra also maintained its momentum, delivering solid growth rates and taking the #3 share gainer spot in the beer category. The strong performance of our brands in the first half of the fiscal year now puts us on track to deliver better-than-expected growth for our Beer business in fiscal '23.\nNumber three, we continue to see the benefits of our wine and spirits strategy taking hold. Our largest higher-end wine and spirits brands are delivering growth. And we are also performing strongly internationally with our higher-end brands and in e-commerce and DTC channels.\nAnd number four, we continue to deliver on capital allocation priorities by maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, delivering cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, advancing the brewery capacity expansion and construction processes in our Beer business to support its continued strong growth and executing on disciplined tuck-in M&A to fill gaps in our portfolio.\nAnd with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter.\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our business continued to perform well in the second quarter, delivering another strong set of operating results. We are making good progress against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. And we are now expected to exceed our previously stated fiscal 2023 net sales goals for the Beer and Wine & Spirits businesses and our operating income goal for the Beer business.\nOur strong Q2 results were led by a 12% increase in net sales driven by growth in both our Beer and Wine & Spirits businesses. Additionally, we achieved a 10% uplift in operating income, underpinned by significant double-digit increase in the operating income of our Beer business.\nOur strong cash flow results supported dividends and incremental share repurchases in Q2 that put us on track to exceed our $5 billion goal in cash returns to our shareholders by the end of this fiscal year. With that, let's review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results.\nStarting with beer. Net sales increased 15% primarily driven by shipment volume growth of over 12% from strong demand for our core beer portfolio and higher average annual price increases. Q2 shipment volumes were generally aligned with depletion volumes, and inventories across the supply chain remained at historical norms.\nFrom a growth perspective, depletions for the quarter were up nearly 9% which was propelled by the continued strength of Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada brands. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will continue to be flat in Q3.\nMoving on to beer margins. We continued to experience headwinds driven by the inflationary economic environment, particularly in packaging material costs and shifts in mix. However, beer operating margin increased over 330 basis points to 40.5% primarily driven by more favorable impact from pricing, lower obsolescence charges and lower marketing spend as well as the favorable impact of fixed cost absorption from strong shipment volume growth.\nAs you may recall, we reported higher obsolescence charges in Q2 of fiscal 2022 due to the slowdown in the overall hard seltzer category during the summer of last year.\nMarketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points due to the timing of our media spend. We continue to expect that marketing as a percent of net sales will be in the 9% to 10% range for the full year as we anticipate marketing spend to ramp up in the second half of the year with the launch of new campaigns, particularly from our media investments around college and NFL football.\nGiven the strong performance of our Beer business, we are now targeting full year fiscal '23 net sales growth of 8% to 10% and operating income growth of 3% to 5% for that business. Our updated fiscal '23 outlook includes a 2% to 3% price increase, which is higher than the previously anticipated 1% to 2% expectation and medium-term algorithm range as elevated costs continue to create pressure across the supply chain. However, we continue to expect an implied operating margin of approximately 38% for fiscal '23.\nWe anticipate second half operating income margins to be negatively affected as we expect the benefits from our pricing adjustments and cost-saving actions will be more than offset by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, particularly as more favorable hedges will continue to roll off, additional headcount in training as well as increased depreciation from our brewery capacity expansions and higher marketing spend as previously referenced.\nNow shifting to Wine & Spirits. Q2 fiscal '23 net sales increased over 1% driven primarily by an increase in bulk sales and favorable pricing. And as Bill noted, Q2 depletion growth was solid for our largest premium wine brands, Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Meiomi and Ruffino, our largest fine wine brand, The Prisoner Wine Company, and our largest craft spirits brand, High West, Casa Noble and Mi Campo.\nOperating margin decreased 40 basis points to 19.3% primarily driven by the continued impact of inflationary headwinds and higher general and administrative expenses. The increase in COGS was mainly a result of higher supply chain costs, particularly container surcharges and warehousing, and higher material costs, including grapes and glass, partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption as a result of the lapping of the New Zealand frost and the wildfires in the U.S.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense was driven by compensation and benefits primarily to improve marketing effectiveness. Marketing was favorable due to the timing of spend.\nFor full year fiscal '23, we now expect Wine & Spirits net sales to come in flat to down 2% and operating income to increase 3% to 5%. This implies operating margins of about 24% for fiscal '23.\nDespite significant inflationary pressures and the inclusion of Cooper & Thief in the divestiture previously referenced by Bill, we continue to expect a considerable improvement in operating margins albeit at a lower point than previously anticipated.\nAs noted in our Q1 earnings call, we expect to achieve the uplift in operating margins in the second half through the following key drivers: consumer-led premiumization and mix improvement, mainly in our fine wine brands; incremental pricing actions executed in Q2 that will be fully reflected in the second half; a bountiful New Zealand harvest, which will drive volume and enhance margins for Kim Crawford; lowering marketing as a percent of net sales; and finally, continued benefits from our cost savings initiatives.\nNow let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. As we also discussed in our Q1 earnings call, increased investment in our digital business acceleration initiative was the primary driver of our higher corporate expense.\nThe majority of the spend in our Digital Business Acceleration program, or DBA for short, was incurred in Q2. And we expect to start to see some small benefits from these investments later this fiscal year followed by larger benefits in FY '24.\nAs a reminder, the goal of our DBA initiative is to support our aim to become a digital leader and capture value. It is a combination of data, technology and operating models, including evolving ways of working, organizational structures and acquiring talent.\nDBA builds on the implementation of our SAP platform that was completed last year. And we anticipate it will enable us to deliver cost savings and greater efficiency in a number of areas by taking our digital strategy to the next level.\nThe first phase of our DBA program is focused on 3 key areas: supply chain, marketing and procurement, each with their own objectives. The aim of these initial efforts is to maximize efficiency across end-to-end supply chain, to build a world-class procurement function with greater spend visibility and to unlock demand for our products by analyzing and connecting multiple consumer data sources.\nWe continue to expect $35 million to $40 million of spend in our DBA program for fiscal '23 as part of our total $265 million to $270 million of corporate spend anticipated for the full year. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter was relatively unchanged. However, we now expect interest expense for fiscal '23 to be between $360 million and $370 million as a result of the July equitization of the Canopy debt securities and rising interest rates.\nThis excludes the impact of any interest expense associated with the funding of the $1.5 billion cash consideration payable in the event a Class B common stock reclassification closes. From a balance sheet perspective, should the reclassification be approved, on a Q2 FY '23 pro forma basis, our net leverage would increase to approximately 3.5x when considering funding for the premium payment and excluding Canopy equity earnings.\nWe ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3x, excluding Canopy equity earnings. As Bill noted, we have nearly completed our goal of returning $5 billion to cash to shareholders. We will continue towards our goal through planned dividend payouts and opportunistic share buybacks throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. This remains a top capital allocation priority, and we now expect to exceed our cash returns to shareholders goal by the end of this fiscal year.\nThat said, we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 186.5 million for fiscal '23, including shares repurchased in Q2. As a result of the adjustments to our Beer business growth outlook for fiscal '23 and the partial offset from higher interest expense, we now expect EPS comparable guidance to be in the $11.20 to $11.60 range, which represents a $0.10 increase at the top end of our prior guidance range.\nMoving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal '23, which is a 4% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong operating cash flow, partially offset by a 23% increase in CapEx investments as we continue to make good progress on our brewery capacity expansion plans to support the robust growth of our Beer business.\nIn addition, our brewery optimization and productivity initiatives have enabled us to utilize incremental capacity from our existing footprint. We now estimate our current total capacity to be approximately 41 million hectoliters, giving us additional production flexibility and enhancing the returns of our prior capital investments.\nWe continue to expect fiscal '23 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and unchanged CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.\nLastly, on Canopy growth. We recorded a $1.1 billion impairment on our investment, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. This noncash item was driven by the following factors: the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy's stock price recovery in the near term, Canopy's previously announced goodwill impairment for their cannabis operations and the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis legalization.\nIn addition, we also recorded a $651 million equity loss from our share of ownership in Canopy, which includes $461 million of Canopy's goodwill impairment. While disappointing, we continue to believe that Canopy's focus on premiumizing its cannabis branded portfolio to improve their performance in Canada is appropriate. And we also remain supportive of Canopy's efforts in the U.S. to strengthen their emerging CPG brand distribution and build of a competitive THC ecosystem.\nIn closing, we continue to deliver strong business performance and are proud of the continued progress we are making against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Our Beer business continues to outshine the market. And our Wine & Spirits business is showing the benefits of its strategy to become a global omni-channel competitor in line with consumer preferences primarily focused on the higher end.\nWith that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for opening remarks. Please go ahead, Patty.\n\nPatty Yahn-Urlaub\n\nSVP of IR, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Q1 Fiscal '23 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.\nBefore turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started today, I wanted to take a minute to recognize Patty, who, after 15 years with Constellation, has elected to retire next month. We appreciate Patty's commitment in helping shepherd our Investor Relations function since joining the company in 2007. And on behalf of all of our team here at Constellation, we thank Patty for her many contributions to our success over the years, including managing our relationships with a number of folks on this call. We wish her the very best in retirement.\nEffective July 1, leadership of our IR function will transition to Joe Suarez, who joined Constellation last November as Vice President of Investor Relations. Joe previously served as Managing Director at Teneo, a global CEO advisory firm. Prior to his time there, Joe also served in a range of commercial, governance, finance and investor relations roles for a couple of major players in the global resources sector. We look forward to the continued success of our Investor Relations function under Joe's leadership.\nWith that, let's move on to a discussion of our first quarter results. We're off to a strong start in our new fiscal year, thanks to the solid fundamentals of our business, the disciplined execution of our strategy and the relentless commitment of our Constellation Brands team as well as that of our distributors and retail partners.\nOur performance in Q1 fiscal '23 continued to build momentum in 3 key areas tied to our long-term goals. First, our beer business once again delivered industry-leading share gains with Modelo Especial and Corona Extra taking the #1 and #4 spots among share-gaining brands across track channels. The business achieved an important milestone, having reached more than 5 full points in shares gained over the last 5 years.\nComing back to Q1. Our beer business delivered net sales growth of 21% and added nearly 15 million cases in incremental shipment volume. As anticipated, these significant increases were partly driven by the lapping of supply challenges as a result of severe weather impacts in Q1 fiscal '22. For clarity, ships and depletes in our current quarter were roughly equal on an absolute basis. Importantly, our shipments mainly were underpinned by continued strong demand for our authentic Mexican beers, our consistent and balanced approach to pricing and the effective ramp-up of new brewing capacity from our organic growth investments.\nSecond, our Wine & Spirits business outperformed the U.S. Wine & Spirits category in tracked channels, where we gained share supported by strong performance of our higher-end brands. Our Wine & Spirits business grew net sales by 2% and saw overall U.S. depletions increased by over 1% with the premium wine and fine wine and craft spirits portions of our portfolio achieving 8% and 16% depletion growth, respectively, with brands like Meiomi, the Prisoner, High West and Casa Noble delivering double-digit depletion growth rates; and third, our sustained and strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to continue to deliver against our established capital allocation priorities.\nOur balance sheet remains strong. We continue to invest behind the momentum of our beer business with a focus on growth and flexibility, and we exceeded our planned $500 million accelerated share repurchase activity with an additional $800 million in buybacks. In fact, we have now fulfilled the share buyback portion of the $5 billion goal in cash returns to shareholders that we promised.\nNow let's discuss in more detail our beer business performance. We maintained our #1 position as the #1 supplier in high-end beer in the U.S. and achieved depletion growth of almost 9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and our growth profile target.\nAs for Memorial Day, which celebrations took place within the quarter, we were the #1 share gainer for that holiday, capturing 1.5 share points of total beer and 2.3 points of high-end beer in the U.S. tracked channels. In the on-premise, our beer business achieved a 30% depletion growth rate across the portfolio and delivered double-digit growth for the Corona and Modelo brand families as well as Pacifico.\nAs mentioned, Modelo Especial remains the #1 share gainer in tracked channels, adding over 1.2 points in incremental share, nearly double the incremental share of the second largest gainer. Overall, Modelo Especial delivered the total depletion growth above 15% for the quarter.\nOur Modelo Chelada brand family grew in line with our medium-term double-digit CAGR expectations, achieving over 39% depletion growth in the quarter. The national release of our new Limon y Sal 12-ounce, 12-pack helped this popular flavor of our Chelada brand delivered the 15th largest share gain across the entire U.S. beer category in tracked channels. And although it is still very early days for our other Modelo innovations, we are encouraged by the initial data we're seeing in test markets, particularly for (inaudible)\nWe continue to be encouraged by the sustained healthy growth of Corona Extra. This brand delivered over 4% depletion growth for the quarter, and as mentioned earlier, was the #4 share gainer in the U.S. beer market in tracked channels. We continue to expect modest growth for Corona Extra in fiscal '23.\nAnd Pacifico delivered depletion growth of more than 20% for the quarter. We continue to expect Pacifico to grow in line with our medium-term 10% to 15% total annual volume growth forecast in fiscal '23. All in, our beer business delivered strong net sales growth for the quarter and this, in turn, supported a double-digit increase in operating income.\nLooking ahead, we're confident that our beer business remains well positioned to deliver against our net sales and operating income growth targets for fiscal '23 despite the ongoing inflationary pressures affecting consumers. We'll continue to take appropriate pricing and cost management actions to ensure we maintain both the growth algorithm of our brands and our industry-leading margins.\nWe'll also continue to support our consumer-led innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year. which will include the launch of our Fresca Mixed vodka spirits and Tequila Paloma flavors in early September. And we continue to make progress with our brewing capacity additions including our new brewery to be built in the state of Veracruz.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to have formally announced the location of our new brewery with the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, as well as with both the governor of this data of Veracruz and the mayor of the city of Veracruz along with federal, state and municipal authorities. The new brewery will be located in the port of Veracruz, one of the most prominent sea ports in the region and will have ample access to water and necessary resources and a highly capable workforce as President Lopez Obrador himself has stated. We look forward to continuing the remarkable journey of our strong performance of our beer business with a focus on both growth and flexibility as we deploy the investments needed to meet steadily rising demand for our products.\nNow let's move on to Wine & Spirits. Our strategy to increasingly focus on higher-end brands, aligned with ongoing consumer-led premiumization trends, continues to enhance the commercial performance of our Wine & Spirits business. The premium wine, fine wine and craft spirits portions of our portfolio all significantly outperformed their corresponding categories and track channels. Meiomi, the Prisoner and Kim Crawford remain the driving forces behind our premium and fine wine growth with continued share gains in tracked channels and strong increases in depletions. And in craft spirits, our High West and Casa Noble brands delivered dollar sales growth ahead of the competition. We maintained share in mainstream wine with Woodbridge primarily driving that performance.\nOur innovation efforts also continued to produce excellent results with Meiomi Red Blend becoming the second largest new product growth contributor in the wine category in just over a quarter since its launch. And we are seeing incremental growth from the expansion of our Wine & Spirits brands into international markets with particularly significant gains of more than 60% in international shipment volumes for our fine wine and craft spirits products.\nAs with our beer business, we continue to closely monitor the state of consumer and remain disciplined in our approach to ensure we balance both pricing and growth across our Wine & Spirits portfolio as economic conditions further evolve. That said, while consumers are reporting increasing concerns about the economy, these concerns have not yet translated into significant behavior change for beverage alcohol shoppers, particularly for our major brands. In total, beverage alcohol servings per capita in the U.S. have remained and are expected to remain stable with growth of 1% to 2% based on population growth expectations.\nAgainst that backdrop, we are encouraged by the continued strength of our high-end beer and Wine & Spirits brands in the first quarter of this fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to drive additional growth for both businesses over the medium term. To that end, we are accelerating our investments in digital capabilities to further support future growth. These investments will be focused on securing the talent and enhancing the technologies needed to further optimize our marketing efforts and reinforce our leading position in 3-tier e-commerce and DT sales as well as unlock value from enhancements to our procurement, supply chain management, plant operations and back office activities.\nOnline beverage alcohol sales remain over 4 point times the pre-COVID rates and we are seeing great traction with our DTC and 3-tier e-commerce efforts, having outperformed the competition by 3.5 points in these channels over the first quarter. We are now planning additional investments as part of these efforts this fiscal year and expect the total impact of this digital business acceleration program to ultimately result in incremental earnings to be realized over the coming years driven by more effective marketing as well as more efficient supply chain, procurement, data and analytics and operations platforms. Garth will provide additional details in just a few minutes.\nBeyond the growth, we continue to expect from our businesses, which will be further supported by our digital business acceleration program. We also continue to believe that our ownership position in Canopy represents a compelling opportunity in developing -- in a developing industry with significant long-term growth potential.\nWithin that context, we think Canopy's focused on premiumizing its cannabis-branded portfolio to improve performance in Canada is appropriate. And we are also supportive of its efforts in the U.S. to strengthen the distribution of its emerging CPG brands and build a competitive THC ecosystem as Canopy continues to gain traction.\nCanopy's agreements with Acreage, TerrAscend, Wana and Jetty position it to quickly scale operations across the U.S. upon federal legalization. We continue to support Canopy through our strategic relationship sharing our experience and capabilities to support the continued advancement of their U.S. strategy, specifically in the areas of commercial sales, marketing and operations. And as announced yesterday, part of our holding in Canopy's convertible debt will be transitioned into equity, which will reduce Canopy's debt while maintaining our share of equity ownership without putting additional capital at risk.\nOn a separate note, earlier today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a proposal to eliminate our Class B common stock. After an extensive review and analysis by the special committee and with the special committee's recommendation, our Board agreed that it is in the best interest of the company and all Constellation shareholders to eliminate the Class B common stock. Under the proposal, owners of our Class B common stock, which are primarily the Sands family, would convert those shares into Class A common stock and receive $64.64 per share in cash, which equates to a total amount of $1.5 billion. The transaction requires shareholder approval, including approval of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock not held by the Sands family or their affiliates, executive officers of the company or Directors that also hold Class B common stock.\nOne shareholder approval is received, we expect that the proposal would deliver a number of corporate governance and other benefits, including the elimination of the higher vote Class B common stock, including the associated voting control of the Sands family and a reduction in the concentration of voting power; a simplification of the company's equity capital structure to better align the voting rights and interests of all shareholders; a broader appeal of our shares to a larger base of investors who prefer single voting class common stock structures; operating cost savings associated with executive salary and certain benefits as well as administrative savings from maintaining the Class B common stock.\nWe expect the executive salary and benefits cost savings will be about $15 million to $20 million per year using the $17.5 million midpoint of that cost savings range. and our current trading multiple of approximately 21x PE. That equates to roughly $300 million of value on a tax-effective basis. Other corporate governance benefits include a rotation of the lead independent Director position on the Board at the next available normal cycle opportunity. And finally, a shift to majority voting in uncontested elections from the current plurality standard for our Board of Directors and the adoption of a Board anti-pledging policy.\nWe will be seeking the approval of shareholders at a special meeting, and a proxy statement, including all details of the proposal will be available ahead of that special meeting. In the meantime, the announcement we made this morning related to the proposal can be found on our company website, cbrands.com. And at this point, we will be unable to comment further or provide additional information on the proposal during today's call beyond what is available in that announcement.\nIn closing, I once again want to recap the 3 highlights I shared earlier on our performance in the first quarter of fiscal '23. First, our beer business continued to achieve industry-leading share gains, driven by our high-performing Modelo Especial, Modelo Chelada, Corona Extra and Pacifico brands delivering overall strong financial results with double-digit growth for both net sales and operating income.\nSecond, our Wine & Spirits business outperformed the U.S. Wine & Spirits category and tracked channels, particularly through the strong performance of our higher-end brands and also grew net sales in the quarter. And third, we continued to deliver against our established capital allocation priorities, including through the $1.3 billion return to shareholders and share repurchases through June and dividends for the first quarter of this year. We are now at over 90% of our $5 billion promised goal.\nWe were very encouraged by the continued strength of our business in the first quarter of this fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to drive sustained growth over the medium term. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Garth, who will give you more detail of our financial results in the quarter. Garth?\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 is off to a great start. We're executing against our business strategy, and we're on track to achieve our targeted financial performance goals for the year. Our beer business achieved double-digit net sales and operating income growth, and our Wine & Spirits business is progressing as marketplace momentum accelerates for the portfolio.\nIn addition, our strong cash flow results enabled us to accelerate and complete our share buyback as we repurchased 5.3 million shares for $1.3 billion through the first 4 months of our fiscal year.\nAs a reminder, one of our key capital allocation priorities has been to return $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases by the end of fiscal '23. To date, we've completed the share repurchase portion of this commitment well in advance of our year-end target. As such, we are now forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 186.5 million for fiscal 2023, which includes share repurchases through June only. As is typical, since we do not know the timing and cadence of future share repurchase activity, any additional share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions.\nNow let's review Q1 fiscal '23 performance in more detail where I generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 21% primarily driven by shipment volume growth of over 17% from ongoing robust demand for our core portfolio and favorable price. As a reminder, we're seeing a favorable shipment volume overlap versus last year's Q1, which was impacted by supply shortages and missed shipping days as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico.\nDepletion growth for the quarter came in at nearly 9% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. Q1 shipments were generally aligned with cases depleted as distributor inventories remained at normal levels. The on-premise channel grew more than 30% in Q1 and now accounts for approximately 13% of our depletion volume versus 11% in Q1 fiscal 2022 when the on-premise channel continued to be somewhat affected by the pandemic.\nMoving on to beer margins. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 40.2% primarily driven by the expected impact of inflationary headwinds, leading to increased COGS for transportation and material costs, including pallets, cartons, steel, corn and aluminum.\nAdditional factors include higher depreciation and brewery costs associated with planned capacity additions at our Obregon production facility in Mexico. These headwinds were partially offset by the favor overlap from 2 items: one, fixed cost absorption related to increased production levels compared to last year's Q1 driven by the weather events I just mentioned; and two, decreased obsolescence primarily related to hard seltzers.\nOn an absolute dollar basis, marketing investments increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable top line leverage, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9% versus prior year. We continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for the year.\nFor full year fiscal '23, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. This implies an operating margin of approximately 38% for the year.\nThroughout the remainder of the year, gross margin will be negatively impacted as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following COGS headwinds. First, elevated inflationary pressures will continue throughout fiscal 2023 across numerous cost components but largely driven by aluminum, cartons, wood pallets and steel. In addition, we'll see increased logistic costs for fuel and freight rates for truck and route.\nSecond, we're expecting incremental brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico as well as increased head count and training expenses to support our continued capacity expansion initiatives at both Nava and Obregon.\nThird, as a result of these brewery expansion plans, the step-up in depreciation expense will continue as additional capacity is planned to come online throughout the fiscal year.\nMoving to Wine & Spirits. Q1 fiscal '20 net sales increased 2% driven by a combination of increased shipments and favorable price and mix. Q1 depletion growth was driven by double-digit contributions from Meiomi, the Prisoner brand family, High West and Casa Noble.\nOperating margin decreased 330 basis points to 19.6% as mix and price benefits, combined with a favorable inventory adjustment, were more than offset by higher COGS driven by inflationary headwinds, including higher material costs for grapes and glass, as well as increased transportation and warehousing costs.\nSG&A and marketing increased as a percent of net sales versus the prior year primarily driven by increased head count and marketing initiatives to support key growth areas of our business. For full year fiscal 2023, the Wine & Spirits business continues to expect net sales to decline 1% to 3% with an increase of 4% to 6% in operating income, implying operating margins of about 24% for fiscal '23.\nDespite unit Q1 margin results, we expect to achieve our Wine & Spirits margin goals for the year through a combination of the following initiatives that are primarily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect ongoing premiumization and mix improvement driven primarily by our fine wine business and the timing of the vintage transition for these products. We have planned incremental pricing actions beginning in the second quarter. A strong New Zealand vintage coming online is projected to drive volume and enhanced margins. And finally, we expect to see benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives.\nNow let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. This is a good point to provide additional detail regarding the digital business acceleration initiative that Bill outlined a few minutes ago. Constellation is already an emerging digital business today with impressive progress in key areas such as DTC, 3-tier e-commerce and digital marketing. The digital business acceleration effort will help to create a more cohesive digital strategy and is an entirely new way of doing business that is designed to enable us to become best-in-class initially in the areas that include procurement, end-to-end supply chain planning and marketing optimization.\nThe implementation of our new SAP platform last year enabled a framework for us to proceed with this initiative, which is expected to add $35 million to $40 million in corporate expense this year. As a result, our initial corporate expense guidance increased from $230 million to a range of $265 million to $270 million. We expect to start to see some benefits from these investments later this year.\nOur fiscal 2023 EPS comparable guidance of $11.20 to $11.50 remains unchanged despite the lower share count. Corporate expenses as a percent of net sales remains at about 3%, which is at the level that had been trending during the SAP implementation. In fact, the Q1 increase in corporate expense of approximately $7 million was primarily driven by investment spending for our digital business acceleration initiative. You can expect to see the majority of the remaining fiscal 2023 spend for this project to occur in Q2.\nComparable basis interest expense for Q1 increased slightly due to higher average borrowings, and we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.2x, excluding Canopy equity earnings. During Q1, we entered into an agreement that amended and restated our senior credit facility. This resulted in an increase in our existing revolving credit facility from $2 billion to $2.25 billion and extended its maturity to 2027.\nIn addition, we issued senior notes and subsequently repaid the 2018 3.2% senior notes and the 2013 4.25% senior notes that were coming due next year. We believe that this was the appropriate action to take in a rising interest rate environment.\nMoving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $562 million, which represents a 7% decrease versus prior year driven by a 73% increase in CapEx investments to support planned capacity expansions and related activities in Mexico.\nWe continue to expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, including investments targeted for Mexico beer operations expansions.\nIn closing, our excellent performance and strong business fundamentals demonstrate that we are committed to generating net sales and operating income growth while returning value to shareholders. Our path to impressive Q1 results were paved by great execution in growing our core business and supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and operations. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPatty Yahn-Urlaub\n\nSVP of IR, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Year-end Fiscal '22 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.\nBefore turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's (inaudible) .\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal '22 year-end call. Before I get started this morning, I'd like to comment on the announcement made earlier this week relating to the proposal from the Sands family to declassify Constellation's dual share class structure. According to the family's filing, the proposal brings significant benefits that will accrue to the company and its shareholders, including increasing market finance from investors who prefer single-class structures. The proposal is under consideration and will be negotiated explicitly by the Special Committee of our Board of Directors, and any agreement reached with the Sands family will require the approval of that special committee as well as our full Board of Directors. .\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the proposal, it would require the approval of holders of a majority of our Class A common stock that do not also hold shares of our Class B common stock I'd like to remind everyone that the Sands family proposal was not made in connection with a corporate transaction. Constellation does not intend to comment further on the proposal. Unless and until a definitive agreement is reached, the proposal is abandoned or otherwise deemed advisable in connection with any further public disclosure by the Sands family.\nWith that, let's proceed with the discussion of our excellent results and our guidance for fiscal '23. As I reflect on our performance for fiscal '22, I'm extremely proud of how our team pulled together to deliver a year of double-digit organic net sales growth and strong cash flow generation. Our team accomplished this while battling through year 2 of the pandemic, including various supply chain challenges, adverse weather events, rising inflation, rapidly shifting consumer preferences and a host of other issues in the surrounding environment. Through it all, we stayed true to who we are and remain laser focused on our consumers and building brands that people love.\nWe launched our consumer-led innovation while continuing to invest in future capabilities needed to win long term. We continue to deliver on our commitments to return value to shareholders and to serve the interest of all stakeholders by making a positive impact on our communities and the environment.\nIn fact, earlier this morning as part of our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship, we announced our new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by fiscal '25 and to restore 1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from critical watersheds and improved water accessibility in disadvantaged communities where we operate in each case by fiscal '25.\nWith that as a backdrop, I'd like to frame up what we believe are key takeaways from our performance in fiscal '22 as we head into our new fiscal year. First, our strong overall performance continues to be headlined by our beer business, which delivered its 12th consecutive year of volume growth. Our beer portfolio led by our Modelo and Corona brand families posted net sales growth of 11% and added 30 million cases of high-end growth, extending its leadership position as the #1 high-end beer supplier and the #1 share gainer across the U.S. beer market.\nSecond, our Wine & Spirits business delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9% and solid gross margin improvement for the fiscal year. Our enhanced focus on consumer-led premiumization in Wine & Spirits continue to yield benefits as our end brands outpaced the overall U.S. line and spirits category primarily driven by Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner.\nThird, we continue to execute against our stated capital allocation strategy, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in fiscal '22. We continue to demonstrate this commitment with this morning's announcement of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which, when completed, will bring us to about 75% of our $5 billion goal. Our continued strong performance in fiscal '22 and the investments we continue to make in our core business provide a nice springboard for another successful year ahead.\nNow let's dive a little deeper into our business performance in '22 and our outlook for the year ahead. One outlook of our success -- one hallmark of our success has been our beer business over the years has been the strength and continuity of leadership. Earlier this year, we announced that Jim Sabia assumed the role of President of our beer business. As many of you know, Jim has played a key role in the success of our beer business for many years, and we look forward to further building on the momentum under his leadership.\nJim succeeds Paul [Hetterich], who will continue to work with our beer operations team in Mexico to support our ongoing brewery projects in Nava and Obregon as well as the construction of our new brewery in the state of Veracruz. Paul has been a driving force behind the success of our economy, including our beer business for more than 35 years. I look forward to continuing to work with Paul, Jim and the rest of our beer team to accelerate traction of our high-performing beer portfolio in fiscal '23.\nThere are several industry trends that provide a solid platform for our portfolio growth in the year ahead. Total beverage alcohol servings per capita are expected to remain stable with growth of about 1% to 2% annually based on population growth expectations. Premiumization in the beer category is projected to continue with the high-end segment taking share from the mainstream segment. Mexican imports, primarily driven by the Constellation portfolio, are expected to continue to drive traditional beer growth and will continue to be a key driver of gains in the overall beer segment.\nSignificant growth is projected in the flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits, wavered malt beverages with all categories exhibiting strong future growth prospects. The on-premise segment has rebounded and is expected to continue to recover to drive incremental category growth.\nAnd finally, 3-tier e-commerce and digitally influenced sales have proven sticky for beer with revenue and share growing significantly. In fact, this channel is forecasted to deliver overindexed growth relative to other channels. Each of these trends, combined with Hispanic demographic tailwinds that work in our favor, either aligns with the core strengths of our beer business, are areas where we're investing to build capabilities needed to more fully compete and win.\nWe have one of the most focused and highly efficient portfolios in the industry with a long runway for growth ahead. Our inventory position has been rebuilt, and we have plans to invest aggressively behind our brands in fiscal '23. We also got some exciting new consumer-led innovation on the way. Modelo Especial is the #2 beer brand in dollar sales in the country and has significant distribution runway over the medium term to facilitate mid- to high single-digit total annual volume growth in the off-premise. Modelo Especial currently underindexes with non-Hispanic consumers, but have strong momentum in (inaudible) household penetration, 7% to 20%. I wish it was 70, but it was 20 with these consumers in the past 2 years, yet there's still significant opportunity to close the awareness gap in order to drive further household penetration. For reference, Modelo Especial currently has only 80% of the household penetration of Corona Extra.\nWe believe increasing total market penetration for Modelo Especial to corona extra levels will enable access to more than 2 million incremental consumers. Modelo Especial is the #5 draft brand in the entire category, yet it only has 11% national distribution. This distribution opportunity, along with the velocity the brand delivers, makes Modelo Especial brand our biggest on-premise priority.\nIn the [F&B] space, our Modelo Chelada brand family has become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the #1 chelada in the U.S. beer market. For Modelo Chelada, we're forecasting double-digit CAGRs and in the medium term, driven by extended channel distribution with new pack sizes, formats and flavors. Current awareness levels from Modelo Chelada are low relative to other flavor categories and large competitors. We expect to improve awareness and accelerate growth of Modelo Chelada through maximizing social and digital media investments to broaden our demographic reach to general market consumers as well as Spanish language TV to stay connected to core Hispanic consumers. Within our Chelada lineup, we're aiming for additional growth for a product line that grew over 30% last year, has tripled in size over the past 5 years and where we own almost 50% of the market nationwide.\nIn fiscal '23, we're introducing a 12-ounce, 12-pack of (inaudible) and a new Chelada flavor, naranja picosa, an orange and chili flavor. We're also extending the Modelo brand into new spaces to bring authentic Mexican flair to both lighter beer styles and favored cocktail-inspired beer. Modelo (inaudible) is a premium, sessionable light cerveza with low-calorie cars rolling out in 3 test markets, Charlotte, Fresno and Houston. This is a full-flavored beer that fits an active lifestyle.\nAnother product aimed at the low-calorie crowd is Modelo Cantarito Style Cerveza, a beer with fruit juice that mimics a popular Mexican beverage. It's rolling out in Atlanta, San Diego and Arizona and celebrates the strong Mexican culture and heritage we see throughout the U.S.\nShifting gears. We're excited by the resurgence of Corona Extra, which continues to be one of the most loved brands in the U.S. beer market. While modest growth is projected for Corona Extra in fiscal '23, this brand has overindexed brand equity, indicating higher growth potential, both for the master brand and broader brand family, including younger and multicultural consumers, where we see significant opportunity to increase buy rates.\nCorona Extra also has a fairly high household penetration, yet it still lags behind some large competitors. Distribution opportunities also exist for Corona Premier as there are still significant effective distribution gaps versus Corona Extra. And while buy rates continue to grow for Corona Premier, it still trails behind competing brands, indicating a significant opportunity to increase velocity.\nPremier is currently underdeveloped in the can format relative to its competitors, as experience indicates that cans are the preferred format for light beer drinkers. And we see a significant unlock with the launch of new packages and format sizes. Finally, consumers have embraced Corona Premier in the on-premise, and our craft focus this year is designed to accelerate that trend.\nFor the Pacifico brand, we're forecasting 10% to 15% total annual volume growth in the medium term from distribution alone. We're prioritizing growth in key DMAs for Pacifico to expand off-premise points of distribution in key cities, particularly in the West and Midwest regions of the country, which will be supported by digital media to reach target legal drinking age Gen Z consumers. We'll also activate consumer and customer-specific national accounts retail programs as well as steel marketing and sponsorship to support targeted investment markets.\nPacifico had the hottest draft volume trend in the category during the last 52 weeks, followed closely by Modelo. That trend, along with planned unique activations, positions Pacifico to continue to gain awareness with consumers.\nWe've been increasingly focused on upping our game in the spirits-based RTD space with unique and compelling new brands. Last quarter, we announced a new agreement with the Coca-Cola Company for the U.S. market to create a new, state-of-line of spirit-based ready-to-drink cocktails using the well-loved and fast-growing [fresca] brand. Fresca mix will debut this fall in (inaudible) strips and tequila [Paloma] (inaudible) .\nIn support of our collective fiscal 3 portfolio initiatives, we will continue to leverage our efficient sponsorship of UFC, the college football playoffs as well as numerous NFL, NBA and MLB teams. You'll see a significant increase and media investments to drive sustained awareness and consumer demand.\nOverall, we plan to recruit new drinkers through advertising, investments in digital media and localized programming. In addition, our portfolio initiatives will be enabled by increasing adoption of our Shopper-First Shelf approach, which continues to drive results and gain traction. We completed 14,000 shopper-first shelf sets last year, our highest total to date.\nAs you can see, our beer portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on (inaudible) category and consumer trends by leveraging our core brands' competitive advantages for existing and new platforms to deliver our medium-term net sales growth target of 7% to 9%.\nNow let's move on to our Wine & Spirits business. Despite the confluence of factors impacting this business in fiscal '22, including a major distributor transition, migration to SAP, inflationary headwinds and COVID related to logistics and supply chain challenges, this business delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9% and solid gross margin improvement for the year.\nMarketplace performance for our hiring brands continued to outpace the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category primarily driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner Wine Company. And our increased focus on our higher-end price segments yielded benefits as our fine line and craft (inaudible) portfolio achieved double-digit net sales growth. driven by the Prisoner Wine Company and High West.\nOur innovation efforts also produced excellent results with growth contributions coming from Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate selling on (inaudible) which together both held the top 2 slots among new high-end products introduced over the last 2 years as well as the Prisoner (inaudible) extensions High West ready-to-serve packed (inaudible) and Woodbridge's buttery chardonnay in 3-liter box.\nHeading into fiscal '23, our strategic focus includes commitment to continued premiumization, margin expansion, accelerated growth in DTC channels and continued growth in our international business. Our innovation strategy will be focused on prevailing consumer trends of premiumization, digital, betterment, convenience, sustainability and enhanced flavor profiles. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year, which includes the launch of SVEDKA gin, Meiomi Red Blend, Kim Crawford, (inaudible) [unshackled] chardonnay and pinot noir and (inaudible) combo ready-to-serve cocktails.\nToday, we announced 2 small additions to our Wine & Spirits portfolio to complement our premiumization efforts in line with Constellation's ambition to be the #1 player in fine wine and among the top 5 in ultra-luxury and icon lines. We have acquired the highly acclaimed Oregon line brand (inaudible). This demonstrates our commitment to building a strong omnichannel business that includes category leadership in DTC and 3-tier eCommerce while building our fine wine portfolio with a diverse collection of best wines from top line regions around the world.\nWe also acquired the remaining portion of Austin Cocktails, which began in 2018 as Constellation Ventures focus on female founders. Austin Cocktails is a leader in the fast-growing premium RTD segment of the U.S. beverage alcohol market. It currently is distributed in 28 states and posted depletion growth of 135% in calendar '21 as RTD trends continue to rise to popularity among consumers. Overall, we expect fiscal '23 to be a dynamic year in our Wine & Spirits business. A tighter focus on higher-end brand strengthens the business and strategically positions it for future success.\nBefore I wrap, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on our investment in Canopy Growth. We continue to believe that the cannabis market represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. and we're encouraged by the work Canopy is doing to further sharpen its strategy, rightsize its operating expense structure and capital investments and achieved profitability in Canada while strengthening its competitive positioning in the U.S.\nIn their most recent quarterly results, Canopy maintained the #1 share position in premium flower products in Canada and drove record performance for its BioSteel and stores and (inaudible) product lines. We are encouraged by recent Canadian government changes to beverage equivalency regulations, allowing consumers to purchase cannabis beverages in greater quantities. And in the U.S., Canopy's THC strategy is anchored by strategic relationships with 2 profitable MSOs, (inaudible) and TerrAscend, both of which are positioned in high-growth northeastern markets. Canopy continues to progress their SPAC strategy by establishing a scalable footprint, best-in-class products and national distribution networks required to unlock the U.S. market upon federal legalization.\nIn closing, I once again want to thank our team as well as our value distributors and retailers for your efforts in delivering another strong year of performance, and we're just as excited about our prospects for growth in the year ahead. Our beer business, led by our core iconic brands and consumer-led innovation, is poised to continue extending its leadership position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Our continued focus on premiumization in the Wine & Spirits business is producing results, and we have plans to further focus our Wine & Spirits portfolio towards the higher end in fiscal '23. We remain committed to our previously stated capital allocation strategy, and we remain on track to deliver our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '23.\nAnd finally, I'd like to leave you with this. We operate in a very dynamic and seemingly ever changing environment. But over the years, one thing has remained constant. (inaudible) recently came out with its annual rankings of CPG growth leaders, and Constellation with recognized for being one of the top performers yet again. In fact, Constellation has been recognized as an IRI growth leader more than any other CPG company in our peer set over the last 10 years. That's something we're extremely proud of, and we look forward to continuing to keep this momentum going into our new fiscal year. And with that thought, I would like to turn it over to Garth, who will review our financial results in '22 and our financial focus for '23. Garth?\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2022 marked another year of solid financial performance and shareholder value creation despite a myriad of headwinds forming our fortitude and resiliency. Our strong operating results and powerful cash flow generation allowed us to return almost $2 billion in capital to shareholders for the year. .\nAdditionally, as Bill mentioned, this morning, we announced that we are entering into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, agreement to repurchase $500 million of shares during Q1 of fiscal 2023. Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes the $500 million share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. Once we complete the ASR in Q1, we will be approximately 75% of the way toward achieving our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2023. More on fiscal 2023 in a minute, but first went to review full year fiscal 2022 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results.\nStarting with beer. Net sales increased 11%, landing in the upper end of our previous guided range driven by shipment growth of approximately 9% and favorable price, which, as expected, landed slightly above our typical 1% to 2% range. These tailwinds were partially offset by unfavorable sales mix primarily driven by a shift in package types and the return of on-premise draft SKUs. Depletion growth for the year came in at nearly 9% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the strong return to growth in the on-premise channel.\nOn-premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the fiscal year and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre COVID and was only 6% of our depletion volume in fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. When adjusting for 2 extra selling days in the year, the beer business generated approximately 8% depletion growth. As previously guided, (inaudible) shift to contingents depleted during the fourth quarter, which resulted in distributor inventories returning to normal levels at fiscal year-end.\nMoving on to beer margins. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 110 basis points versus prior year to 40%. Benefits from favorable pricing, marketing as a percent of net sales and mix were more than offset by unfavorable costs. The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that included the following: first, the previously announced obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million due to excess inventory of our hard seltzer SKUs resulting from a slowdown in the overall category; second, increased brewery costs driven by incremental head count, labor inflation in Mexico and increased spend related to capacity expansion; third, increased material costs due to rising commodity prices and inflationary headwinds that, on average, landed in the mid- to high single-digit increase range, predominantly driven by wood pallets, cartons steel, corn and aluminum. Please note that this range includes the impact of hedging where possible. And lastly, step-up in depreciation expense, largely due to the incremental 5 main hectoliters at Obregon completed in early fiscal 2022. These comp headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production levels in fiscal 2022 versus last year.\nOn an absolute dollar basis, marketing investments increased versus prior year However, due to favorable top line leverage, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9.2% versus prior year.\nMoving to Wine & Spirits. Net sales declined 19% as shipments declined approximately 34%. Excluding the impact of the wine experience divestitures, organic net sales increased 9% mainly driven by shipment growth of nearly 3%, favorable mix, increased pricing and small tainted bulk wine sales related to the 2020 wildfires. Organic shipment growth was largely driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner partially offset by a decline for some of our key mainstream brands.\nDepletions declined approximately 6%, mainly driven by SVEDKA, Robert Mondavi private selection and Woodbridge. These declines were partially offset by the robust growth of our higher-end brands, led by the Prisoner Wine Company of 16%; made only in High West, up 13%; and Kim Crawford, up 9%. Shipment growth was ahead of depletion growth for the year, mostly reflecting impacts from our distributor transition. During the coming year, we expect to rightsize inventory levels in the business.\nOperating margin decreased 180 basis points to 22.7% as mix benefited from the divestiture and favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend as a percent of net sales and increased costs. Higher costs were driven by increased freight and warehousing costs partially offset by net favorable fixed cost absorption, lower break raw materials and cost savings initiatives. Marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales increased versus the prior year largely due to a loss of top line leverage resulting from the divestitures.\nNow let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal 2022 corporate expense came in slightly higher than our previous guidance, finishing at approximately $238 million up 4% versus last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher consulting T&E spend and increased depreciation. These headwinds were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits and a favorable foreign currency impact. Interest expense for the year decreased 8% to approximately $356 million primarily due to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.\nOur full year (inaudible) effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 17.5% versus 18.2% last year primarily driven by a higher level of stock-based compensation benefits. Effective tax rates on our 4 businesses came in lower than expected during Q4, driving tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance.\nMoving to fiscal 2022 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash. CapEx totaled approximately $1 billion and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $850 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion.\nPivoting to our full year fiscal 2023 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal 2023, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50, which excludes Canopy equity and earnings. For fiscal 2023, the beer business is targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, reflecting 1 to 2 points of pricing benefit within our Mexican product portfolio, which is in line with our typical pricing strategy and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. This implies operating margin to approximately 38%.\nAs previously discussed, the implied decline in operating margin is predominantly driven by gross margin compression as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following COGS headwinds. First, we are expecting elevated inflationary pressures to continue throughout fiscal 2023 and estimating inflation on the commodity spend component of raw and packaging materials to land, on average, in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, including the impact of hedging and (inaudible). These significant inflationary pressures are expected across numerous cost components but largely driven by aluminum, cartons, wood pallets and steel.\nSecond, similar to fiscal 2022, we are expecting incremental brewer costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico is estimated to range between 5% and 6% as well as incremental head count and training expenses to support our continued capacity expansion initiatives.\nThird, as a result of these brewery expansion plans, we are estimating a step-up in depreciation expense as additional capacity is planned to come online throughout the fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $295 million or an increase of approximately $45 million. And finally, we expect margin headwinds related to incremental logistics costs in fuel and freight rates for both rail and truck, which is expected to drive an increase in the low to high single-digit range. As previously stated, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda to help partially offset these headwinds, along with expected favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production models. As it relates to beer marketing spend for fiscal 2023, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range.\nShifting to Wine & Spirits. For fiscal 2023, the Wine & Spirits business is targeting net sales to decline 1% to 3%. While this range is outside our medium-term growth goal for the business, it is an anomaly driven by the significant overlap we have from our distributor transition as well as revenues associated with sales of smoke-tainted bulk wine. Both are anticipated to be onetime in nature, and thus, we do not expect them to be repeated in fiscal year 2023. Excluding these impacts, we expect an underlying Wine & Spirits business to return to its targeted goal of 2% to 4% net sales growth next fiscal year.\nOn the bottom line, we expect operating income to increase in the 4% to 6% range. This implies operating margin to approximate 24.5%, which represents almost 200 basis points of margin expansion. This margin expansion reflects benefits from price, mix and cost saving initiatives to help more than offset significant cost inflation headwinds mostly related to freight and packaging.\nCost saving initiatives include optimizing the Appalachian mix across our portfolio and decreasing the weight of our glass bottles, which also has positive environmental impacts. This is a good spot to update everyone on our Wine & Spirits operating margin expectations in the medium term. Since we provided original targets back in 2019, the operational environment has changed considerably. Inflationary pressures have got significantly worse, driving increased freight and warehousing costs in fiscal 2022 and are expected to continue well into fiscal 2023. Additionally, while we continue to remove stranded costs from the business, we strategically decided to reinvest more of these savings back into the areas of businesses that are driving growth.\nSpecifically, in DTC, e-commerce, our fine wine and craft spirits portfolio and consumer-led products that are fueled by category tailwinds. As such, we've updated our operating margin goal to reflect these impacts and now expect medium-term operating margins to migrate to a range of 28% to 29% and EBIT margins at approximately 30%, reflecting a leading margin structure for our industry.\nBefore we move on to guidance for the rest of the P&L, I'd like to highlight the new additions to our wine spirit portfolio that Bill mentioned earlier. As part of the evolution to the high end, we acquired [lingua franca] as well as the remaining interest in Austin Cocktails from our ventures portfolio, 2 businesses positioning categories with significant growth tailwinds behind it. From a finance perspective, these transactions collectively, along with [My Favorite Neighbor], which was fully acquired in fiscal 2022 and were almost entirely self-funded through the sale of one of our successful venture investments, which generated a significant return on investment.\nOther fiscal 2023 guidance assumptions include the following: corporate expenses to approximate $230 million, interest expense to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million and a comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings of approximately 20%. The increase in our tax rate is mainly driven by a lower level of anticipated stock-based compensation benefits versus fiscal 2022.\nRounding up the P&L, noncontrolling interest is expected to approximate $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately 198 million. This share count assumes we executed a $500 million of share repurchases in Q1. We plan to repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. However, we do not know the timing of cadence, and as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year.\nAdditionally, this EPS guidance range does not reflect a prolonged impact from the volatility associated with the ongoing headwinds we've been experiencing on fuel prices and other commodities as the sustained impact of the recent geopolitical events remains unclear. Thankfully, we have (inaudible) employees who live or work in Russia where you're training, and we have minimal commercial disclosure to this part of the world. That said, our thoughts and prayers are with those being impacted by this growing humanitarian crisis, and we wish for a quick resolution to this conflict and return the peace in the region.\nTurning to cash flow. We expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion targeted for Mexico beer operations expansion.\nTo wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. In fiscal 2022 alone, our strong operating results and powerful cash flow generation capabilities enabled us to return almost $2 billion in capital to shareholders as part of our overall goal of returning $5 billion by the end of our fiscal 2023.\nOur capital allocation priorities augment our organic growth strategy to enable strategic reinvestment where we see category tailwinds. We believe this strategy, combined with excellent execution and returns to shareholders, positions us to be a top-tier shareholder return generator for many years to come. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPatty Yahn-Urlaub\n\nSVP of IR, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Valerie. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal '22 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.\nAs a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on the call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAnd now here's Bill.\n\nWilliam A. Newlands\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks you, Patty, and Happy New Year to everyone on the call. I sincerely hope you were able to enjoy a safe and happy holiday season with family and friends.\nCalendar year 2021 was another challenging year given the continued effects of the pandemic, a host of global supply chain issues impacting nearly every industry, inflationary pressures and severe weather events. That said, I'm incredibly proud of the determination shown by our team at Constellation throughout the year. They worked relentlessly, navigating a myriad of evolving dynamics to deliver a very solid performance year-to-date and in Q3, putting us on pace for another strong year of financial performance and shareholder value creation in fiscal '22.\nThat said, I'd like to highlight a few key takeaways from the quarter. First, our beer business delivered a very strong performance in Q3, while lapping tough comps in fiscal '21. We continue to see robust consumer demand, yielding high single-digit depletion growth. We extended our leadership position as the top share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer market behind the strength of our Modelo and Corona brand families, while improving our inventory position. Our strong performance to date gives us confidence to increase top and bottom line guidance for our beer business in fiscal '22.\nSecond, we continue to see significant runway for growth for our core imported beer portfolio in the years ahead, and we're investing in the next increment of capacity additions required to sustain our momentum as this represents one of the most compelling value-creating opportunities for our company and our shareholders.\nThird, our Wine & Spirits business has made solid progress in transforming both its brand portfolio and financial profile. Q3 marked another step along our journey as we continue to shift to a higher-end Wine & Spirits business focused on delivering increased revenue growth and margin expansion.\nWhile our Wine & Spirits business continues to navigate through a series of headwinds impacting its year-to-date performance, our increased focus and investments behind our fine wine and craft spirits portfolio, margin accretion innovation and e-commerce initiatives continue to gain traction and are enabling an increase in our net sales guidance for the business in fiscal '22.\nAnd finally, our strong overall total company performance in Q3 gives us confidence to increase our comparable basis EPS guidance for the fiscal year. Garth will provide additional details relative to our financial performance and fiscal year guidance in just a few minutes.\nToday, we are also excited about our announcement of a new agreement with The Coca-Cola Company in the United States to bring FRESCA brand into beverage alcohol through manufacturing and distributing a new line of FRESCA mixed cocktails.\nFRESCA is currently the fastest-growing diet soft drink in Coca-Cola's portfolio, and over half of FRESCA consumers already use it as a mixer with spirits. Building on this great foundation and in alignment with emerging consumer preferences around convenience, flavor and a preference for high-quality products, we plan to launch FRESCA Mixed later this year, starting with cocktails using real spirits and inspired by recipes created by FRESCA fans from around the globe.\nWith that, let's talk in more detail about our performance in the most recent quarter. Our beer business posted depletion growth of more than 80% in the third quarter, outpacing the high end of the U.S. beer category. Modelo Especial continues to be our most significant growth driver, with depletions increasing over 13%. That is more than 5 million cases relative to the same quarter last year. It remains the brightest star in our portfolio as the top share gainer across the entire U.S. beer category in IRI channels, while maintaining its position as the #1 high-end beer brand.\nOur Modelo Chelada brand family has become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the #1 chelada in the U.S. beer market and maintained its explosive growth, posting 35% depletion growth in the third quarter. We continue to build on this extremely successful innovation platform with a new entrant, Modelo Chelada Pina Picante, which was launched in August and is already a top share gainer among important brands.\nCorona Extra sustained its reinvigorated growth trajectory and position as the second-fastest import share gainer and the #3 high-end brand in IRI channels with 11% depletion growth versus prior year. Similarly, Corona Premier continued its strong performance with 8% depletion growth, which accelerated through distribution gains as supply conditions improved.\nFrom an innovation perspective within the Corona brand family, Refresca and Refresca Mas are back in production and contributing nicely to growth in our ABA portfolio. Meanwhile, Corona Hard Seltzer remains a top seltzer brand in IRI, following the dramatic slowdown in the seltzer category. We're making good progress to enhance our flavor profiles, and we're on track to roll out the restaging of our variety packs, tropical mixed pack and berry mixed pack in the first quarter of fiscal '23. And we are diligently working to address the brown glass shortage that is acting a big headwind this year, especially for our Pacifico brand, which continues to see strong demand and has a long runway for growth ahead.\nOverall, our outstanding performance gives us confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 10% to 11% net sales growth and 6% to 7% operating income growth in fiscal '22.\nTo fuel the continued growth of our imported beer portfolio, we plan to deploy an increased level of investment over the next 4 fiscal years to support construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz as well as to expand and optimize capacity at our existing Nava and Obregon operations. Garth will give you additional details on that momentarily.\nNow moving on to our Wine & Spirits business. We remain committed to our vision to become a bold and innovative, high-end wine and spirits business with distinctive brands and products, delivering exceptional consumer experiences. In an effort to make this vision a reality, we recently reorganized into 2 distinct commercial teams within the business, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands and the other focus on our mainstream and premium brands.\nWhile each team has their own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to our goal of accelerating performance by increasing revenue growth and expanding margins. Our fine wine and craft spirits business is delivering solid growth this year, driven by brands like The Prisoner Unshackled, Roberto Mondavi Winery and High West as well as strong gains in our direct-to-consumer, e-commerce, hospitality and international businesses.\nOur mainstream and premium business is focused on maintaining share in the mainstream wine segment, while delivering and continuing to deliver growth through premium segment brands such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, in line with our consumer-driven premiumization strategy.\nWhile we've experienced recent headwinds on mainstream brands like Woodbridge, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and SVEDKA, IRI trends for these brands have improved since overlapping the peak of the pandemic, supported by an increased focus on more relevant branding, strategic pricing and innovation.\nThroughout our buying experience portfolio, we've launched several innovations that are creating momentum and driving growth, including Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, both of which were among the top 5 share gainers in their respective price points and IRI channels this quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we also launched multiple initiatives. First, the editor's collection, an exciting collaboration between our SIMI Winery and the Hello Sunshine Book Club, the book club community founded by media mogul and innovator Reese Witherspoon. Second, SVEDKA ready-to-drink, soda mixed pack; and third, our new Woodbridge 3-liter box.\nWe've also experienced successful market expansion for our Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi private selection spirit barrel aged wines. Within our DTC portfolio, we launched exclusive SKUs from the Robert Mondavi Winery and The Prisoner Saldo Red Blends as well as High West Midwinter Night Dram and the ready-to-serve Manhattan and old-fashioned cocktails.\nWithin the 3-tier e-commerce landscape, Constellation continues to outpace total U.S. wine market growth by double digits. In fact, Meiomi sales in the 3-tier e-commerce channels increased 27% versus the prior year. Currently, about 10% of Meiomi's sales come from 3-tier e-commerce, which is the highest level among leading U.S. line brands in IRI e-commerce channels.\nWhile we advance our strategic agenda in Wine & Spirits, we continue to address a number of headwinds that have impacted our year-to-date performance. We continued to lap last year's COVID pantry-driven loading, where we experienced outsized growth. However, upcoming comparable growth rates are less challenging.\nThroughout the year, we've experienced out of stocks and other operational challenges related to our SAP implementation, a difficult domestic and international logistics environment and our route-to-market transition of 70% of our distribution to Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits. The encouraging news: These issues are all stabilizing. We are rebalancing our inventories and expect more standard service levels for the balance of the year. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising organic net sales guidance from 2% to 4% to 4% to 6% for fiscal '22.\nAnd before I close, just a couple of quick notes on Canopy growth. Clearly, recent results have been disappointing and there are meaningful near-term challenges facing Canopy and the overall cannabis market in Canada. The store openings have been slower than previously anticipated due to the pandemic.\nHowever, we continue to believe that the cannabis market represents a significant growth opportunity in the CPG space over the next decade given the predicted U.S. market size of roughly 100 billion post-legalization, which is double the size of the spirits market and approaching the size of the beer category. We're encouraged by Canopy's innovation agenda with more than 40 new SKUs launched globally during their recently reported second quarter.\nIn addition, Canopy purchased the right to acquire Wana Brands upon a U.S. triggering event, which includes U.S. federal legalization of cannabis. Wana Brands has the #1 share of the gummy market in Canada, with more than 40% market share and the largest multi-market presence in the U.S. gummy market. The gummies category is one of the fastest growing segments in both the U.S. and Canadian cannabis markets, accounting for over 70% of all edibles purchased. Wana's asset-light licensing model approach will allow them to scale quickly in the U.S. and provide Canopy a highly distributed brand upon U.S. legalization.\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate our main takeaways from this quarter. Our beer business continues to deliver impressive performance. Its growth remains ahead of the high end of the U.S. beer market in IRI channels, and we now expect to achieve 10% to 11% net sales growth and 6% to 7% operating income growth for fiscal '22. We remain confident in the robust longer-term growth prospects of our beer business, and we're securing our ability to capture the significant value creation opportunity by expanding and optimizing our production capacity over the next 4 years.\nOur Wine & Spirits business continues to move towards its long-term revenue growth and margin expansion vision, which is further enabled by the clearer strategic focus of its newly configured fine wine and craft spirits and mainstream and premium teams. And in spite of an ongoing challenging environment, our strong overall total company performance gives us the confidence to increase our comparable basis EPS guidance for the year.\nWe look forward to continuing to build a portfolio of products that consumers love and delivering another strong year of financial performance and shareholder value creation in fiscal '22.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Garth.\n\nGarth Hankinson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Constellation Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Q3 was another quarter of strong execution by our beer business. This continued strength, coupled with tax favorability, enabled us to deliver 8% comparable basis diluted EPS growth for the quarter, excluding Canopy. As a result, we have increased and narrowed our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $10.50 to $10.65 versus our previous guidance of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings, includes an increase in beer operating income guidance and reflects a decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2022.\nNow let's review our Q3 performance and full year outlook in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results.\nStarting with beer. Net sales increased 4% driven by shipment growth of 3% and favorable price, partially offset by unfavorable mix. As a reminder, we are lapping a significant inventory rebuild in Q3 of the prior year, which generated 28% shipment growth.\nDepletion growth for the quarter came in above 8% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and explosive growth of Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on-premise channel. Again, keep in mind the difficult volume overlap we encountered during the quarter as we faced a 12% depletion growth comparison driven by robust inventory replenishment at the retailer in the prior year. On-premise volumes account for approximately 12% of the total beer depletions during the quarter and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre-COVID and was only 8% of our depletion volume in Q3 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19.\nSelling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year, and please note that in Q4, there is one additional selling day. Cases shipped exceeded cases depleted as distributor inventory levels began to rebuild during the quarter. Inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year as shipment volume is expected to continue to exceed cases depleted for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nMoving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin decreased 130 basis points versus prior year to 41.3%. Benefits from favorable pricing and marketing timing were more than offset by unfavorable costs. The expected increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that included the following: First, increased material costs due to rising commodity prices and inflationary headwinds that on average are in the mid to high single-digit range, predominantly driven by wood pallets, aluminum, steel and carpets. Please note that this range includes the impact of hedging more positive.\nSecond, increased brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased head count, incremental spend related to capacity expansion and annual brewery maintenance that was performed during the quarter. As a reminder, the annual brewery maintenance took place during the fourth quarter last fiscal year.\nAnd third, a step-up in depreciation expense, largely due to the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon completed earlier this fiscal year.\nThese COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production levels.\nMarketing as a percent of net sales decreased 130 basis points to 8% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. In the prior year, a significant amount of marketing spend was shifted from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year due to COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Additionally, we continue to expect full year spend as a percent of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range, which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales.\nFor full year fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales growth to land in the 10% to 11% range and operating income growth to land in the 6% to 7% range, reflecting the continued strength of our core beer portfolio. As previously communicated, we expect price increases within our beer portfolio to land slightly above our typical 1% to 2% range. However, we anticipate this incremental pricing favorability to be partially offset by unfavorable net sales mix, primarily driven by a shift in package types and return of on-premise draft SKUs.\nWe continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by cost headwinds, predominantly driven by a significant step-up in depreciation and increased inflation across numerous cost components as the inflationary environment resulting from economic supply chain and other byproducts of the pandemic continues to be dynamic and variable.\nWe now anticipate these elevated inflationary pressures to persist well into fiscal year 2023 and expect inflation on the commodity spend component of direct materials to land on average in the high single-digit to low double-digit range next fiscal year. We will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to address these evolving conditions through our commodity hedging program, cost saving initiatives and balanced price adjustments. However, due to a persistent and tough inflationary environment and incremental depreciation driven by our capital expansion plans, operating margins could land below our stated 39% to 40% range in fiscal 2023. Let me reiterate that these are still best-in-class operating margins within our industry, which reflects the strength of our core beer portfolio and efficiencies of our operations. We will continue to refine our outlook for fiscal year 2023 and will provide more details and official guidance during our Q4 earnings call in April.\nMoving to Wine & Spirits. Q3 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 25% as shipments declined approximately 39%. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 3%, driven by shipment growth of approximately 3%, favorable price, incremental sales to Opus One and smoke-tainted bulk wine sales, all partially offset by unfavorable mix.\nDepletions declined approximately 7% during the quarter and continue to be challenged by port delays for our international brands and distributor route-to-market changes in transition markets. Additionally, depletions faced a difficult overlap, especially for our premium and luxury brands, which experienced robust growth during Q3 of the prior year. However, we expect depletion growth to accelerate during the fourth quarter driven by the continued strength of our higher-end brands, led by the Prisoner brand family, Meiomi and Kim Crawford, a robust innovation agenda and an easier buying overlap versus a year ago. From a shipment perspective, we expect shipment growth for the fourth quarter to decelerate versus Q3 as we continue to rightsize distributor inventory levels for our mainstream brands.\nMoving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin increased 140 basis points to 25.4% as decreased COGS, mix benefits from divestitures and favorable price were partially offset by increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales and unfavorable mix from the existing portfolio. As expected, lower COGS were driven by net favorable fixed cost absorption, lower grade raw materials and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The net favorable fixed cost absorption resulted from lapping the unfavorable impact of $20 million in the prior year, which was a result of decreased production levels due to the 2020 U.S. wildfires. This benefit for the quarter was partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption, resulting from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a late frost during their harvest season earlier this year.\nMarketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales increased versus the prior year due to a loss of top line leverage resulting from the divestitures. In the prior year, a significant amount of marketing spend was shifted from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year due to COVID-19-related cancellations and/or postponements. As a result, marketing as a percent of net sales for Q4 is expected to be lower than the prior year. For the full year, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 10% range.\nFor full year fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales and operating income to decline 21% to 22% and 23% to 25%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures, organic net sales is now expected to grow in the 4% to 6% range versus our previous guidance of 2% to 4%.\nIt is important to note that the increase in our top line guidance is mainly due to incremental shipments to support our route-to-market transition earlier this fiscal year and revenues associated with sales of smoke-tainted bulk wine. Both are onetime in nature, and thus, we do not expect them to be repeated in future years. As such, going forward, we remain confident in our medium-term top line growth algorithm for the Wine & Spirits business 2% to 4%.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we expect significant cost increases for the business, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures on product, freight and warehousing costs. However, in order to mitigate some of these cost headwinds, we intend to take incremental price that will be staggered throughout the first half of calendar year 2022. We will continue to work through the puts and takes of our fiscal -- of our full year fiscal 2023 outlook, and we'll provide more details and official guidance during our Q4 earnings call in April.\nNow let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $162 million, down 6% versus Q3 year-to-date last fiscal year. The decrease was predominantly driven by compensation and benefits, due to the reversal of an accrual for performance share units, which will not be earned due to not achieving the threshold level of earnings performance from our Canopy investment and a favorable foreign currency impact. These tailwinds were partially offset by increase in consulting services and T&E spend. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $230 million, reflecting the year-to-date compensation and benefits favorability.\nComparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 8% to $88 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We expect fiscal 2022 interest expenses to land towards the midpoint of our previous guidance range of $355 million to $365 million.\nOur Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 14% versus 17.7% in Q3 last year, primarily driven by the timing and magnitude of stock-based compensation benefits, partially offset by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, to approximate 19.5% versus our previous guidance of 20%. This 0.5 point decrease primarily reflects the impact of increased stock-based compensation tax benefits received during the quarter.\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation tax benefits were weighted towards Q3 versus our previous expectation of Q4, resulting in a sequential rate increase to our implied Q4 tax rate, which is now expected to approximate 23%.\nMoving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion for the first 9 months of fiscal 2022, reflecting a 3% increase in operating cash flow, offset by an increase in CapEx spend. CapEx spend totaled approximately $600 million, which included approximately $500 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million targeted for Mexico beer operations expansions, remains unchanged.\nFurthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously (inaudible).\nAs Bill mentioned, our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer industry driven by robust consumer demand, and it is essential that we invest appropriately to support the expected ongoing growth momentum for our exceptional beer brands. As such, we have updated and increased our brewery expansion investment plans in Mexico.\nTotal capital expenditures for the beer business are now expected to be $5 billion to $5.5 billion over the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 time frame with the majority of spend expected to occur in the first 3 years. In total, this investment will support an incremental 25 million to 30 million hectoliters of additional capacity and includes construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz as well as continued expansion and optimization of our existing sites in Nava and Obregon. Please note that this investment includes the previously disclosed beer CapEx guidance of $700 million to $900 million annually during the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025 time line to support a 15 million hectoliter build-out between our Nava and Obregon facilities. As a reminder, our existing brewery footprint currently supports 39 million hectoliters between Nava and Obregon.\nIn closing, I'd like to reiterate our medium-term growth expectations for our beer business. As Bill and I outlined, we expect continued momentum, and thus, continue to target top line growth in the 7% to 9% range over the next 3 to 5 years, which includes 1 to 2 points of price and implied volume growth in the mid to high single-digit range. This expectation provides us with the conviction to support incremental capital investments in Mexico.\nWith that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions."

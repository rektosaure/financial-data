Please note that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'd now like to formally begin today's call and introduce Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; as well as Marc Montagne, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2025 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. .\nOur statements are as of today, November 3, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn it over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good afternoon. We are pleased to share another quarter of positive financial and operational results, including industry-leading AFFO per share. We continue to see strong leasing demand in both the U.S. and international markets. And as a result, we are modestly increasing our full year outlook for both new leasing activity and escalations. The bulk of the activity continues to come from new colocations as carriers both densify and expand their network footprints. And the backlog remains healthy as well, and it is steady compared to last quarter.\nOur Services business also continues to perform extremely well, increasing revenue by 81% in Q3 compared to the prior year period, primarily from construction-related projects focused on network expansion. As a result of this activity, we are increasing the full year site development revenue outlook by $20 million.\nIn addition to our strong operating performance, we have also had a number of other significant accomplishments since our last earnings report. We have recently completed the final closing of all remaining Central American assets under our purchase agreement with Millicom. The closings were slightly delayed from our prior assumptions due primarily to timing of regulatory approvals, but we are nonetheless very pleased with how this transaction went, and I'd like to thank our teams that worked tirelessly to get it done. We are excited about the future opportunities for SBA across the region.\nAlso, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the previously announced sale of our Canadian Tower business earlier than anticipated. While the adjusted timing of both the Millicom acquisition and the Canada sale negatively impact our current site leasing revenue outlook, we are extremely pleased to continue to show progress related to our ongoing portfolio review that was originally announced back in February of last year.\nWe continue to focus on being a leading tower company in each market where we operate and aligning ourselves more directly with the leading wireless operators in those markets. Pro forma for the Millicom and Canada closings, SBA owns a total of over 46,000 tower sites worldwide, representing an increase of 40% since 2020.\nAnother recent significant accomplishment since our second quarter earnings report is today's announcement that Verizon and SBA have entered into a new long-term agreement that supports Verizon's continued network modernization plans. This new agreement builds on the long-standing partnership between our 2 companies and highlights the critical nature of our Tower portfolio and our ongoing efforts to help our carrier customers achieve their network goals. As part of this agreement, Verizon has committed to a certain level of growth through new deployments across SBA's best-in-class tower portfolio. The agreement enhances operational efficiencies for both companies and the length of the agreement provides both companies with stability and more certainty for the future.\nI'm very excited about this enhanced partnership, and I want to thank all who work to get this done. And if that wasn't enough, since our last earnings report, we took advantage of what we believe to be market dislocations, directing capital towards share repurchases. We spent $153 million at an average cost of $196.99 per share to repurchase and retire 776,000 shares. So far in 2025, in total, we spent $325 million to repurchase 1.6 million shares. As of today, we have $1.3 billion remaining on our authorization, and we continue to believe share repurchases play a significant role in creating shareholder value over time. We have been able to grow our portfolio and repurchase shares while still maintaining leverage below the low end of our previously stated range.\nAs stated in today's press release, however, we are officially changing our financial policy and reducing our target leverage range to 6 to 7 turns of net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Marc will discuss these changes in more detail in a moment.\nSo as you can see, there are a lot of positive things going on here at SBA. And the macro environment for mobile broadband growth is supportive of a bright future. Today, we are seeing a greater proliferation of 5G use cases, including fixed wireless access, which is nearing 15 million subscribers today with aspirations of over $20 million by 2028. Paired with increasing mobile data traffic, that's a heavy burden on today's networks. This will require ongoing network investment via overlays and densifications, including cell splitting, refarming of existing spectrum bands and newly acquired spectrum to meet those network needs.\nLooking further out, the recently passed federal spending and tax bill earmarks 800 megahertz of spectrum to help boost network capacity and support the next generation of wireless technologies, including 6G. The initial wave of upper C-band spectrum will be auctioned off by July 2027. And while there is still work to be done to identify which additional bands will ultimately be auctioned, upper mid-band frequencies such as 4.4 to 4.9 gigahertz and 7.25 to 7.4 gigahertz are currently being studied. These higher bands will not propagate as far and will require denser networks and new equipment at our cell towers. There is a lot to look forward to.\nNow before I turn the call over to Marc, I'd just like to take a moment to acknowledge Mark DeRussy. After 16 years with SBA and many more in the industry, Mark has decided to retire at the end of the year. This will be his last earnings call. Mark has done a great job representing the company to many of you over the years, and I appreciate his many contributions. [ Louis Friend ], who is an SBA veteran and well known to many of you, we'll be taking over Mark's IR responsibilities after year-end.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Marc Montagner.\n\nMarc R. Montagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Brendan. The slight delay in closing of Millicom compared to our prior assumption around timing impacted the third quarter by $4 million and $3 million cycling revenue and total cash flow, respectively. Adjusting for the timing of Millicom, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations.\nThird quarter domestic organic leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 5.3% on a gross basis and 1.6% on a net basis, including 3.7% of churn. $11 million of the third quarter churn was related to Sprint consolidation which we anticipate to be $51 million for the full year 2025. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged. Non-sprint related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 1.5% of our domestic site leasing revenue.\nTurning to DISH. We currently have approximately $55 million of annualized revenue. Based on lease agreements, we expect approximately $25 million of churn in each of 2027 and 2028 with some small amount before and after these years. During the third quarter, 80% of consolidated cash cycling revenue and 85% of adjusted EBITDA was denominated in U.S. dollars. International organic leasing revenue growth for the third quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 8.5% on a gross basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the third quarter, mainly due to ongoing carrier consolidation.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we acquired 447 sites for total cash concentration of approximately $143 million, mostly related to the acquisition of sites from Millicom. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the remaining approximately 2,000 sales related to the American transaction.\nSwitching to the balance sheet. We have ample liquidity from both available cash in our $2 billion revolver, which as of today has a balance of $385 million outstanding drove mostly to fund the purchase of towers from Millicom and for share buyback. At the end of the third quarter, our weighted average interest rate was 3.8% across our total outstanding debt and our weighted average maturity was approximately 3 years. Including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate on approximately 96% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\nAs you may have seen in our press release, I'm pleased to share with you our new updated financial policy and one in SBA going forward. Given the rising rate environment over the past few years and the lack of actionable M&A opportunities at attractive valuation, we have been operating below our steady target leverage of 7 to 7.5x net debt to annualized EBITDA.\nIn the past few years, we intentionally opted to allocate excess capital to pay down debt and delever our balance sheet to minimize interest expenses and grow AFFO per share. Having operated with leverage in the 6 for several years now, we have concluded that 6 to 7x is the right leverage range for SBA for several reasons. First, it will have no meaningful effect to our future capital allocation strategy. Given our predictable strong cash flow, remaining leverage capacity and revolving credit facility, we'll still have plenty of flexibility to continue our share buyback program and to pursue attractive M&A opportunities.\nWhile operating in a target average ratio for the past 3 years, we have successfully pursued both options, including $625 million of share repurchase and $1.2 billion of M&A, all while staying below 7 turns of leverage. In short, our capital allocation strategy will remain virtually unchanged with a long-term goal of deploying capital to create high-quality FFO per share.\nSecond, our revised financial policy will create a path for SBA to move towards issuing investment-grade debt. As you may have seen this evening, Fitch just issued their corporate rating on SBA at BBB+ at both the corporate level and issuer level. This is now a second investment-grade rating. Barring new investment-grade rating with S&P, SBA has a clear path towards raising debt capital in this new deeper credit market. As part of this transition and with our commitment to staying inside the newly revised target leverage rate, we will seek to reduce our percentage of secured debt to total debt as existing secured debt maturities come due or inside their par call window. We have already engaged with the rating agency and are highly confident that they are in full support of our new stated policy and next step.\nThe third and final reason for this new policy is related to our dividend. We expect our dividend to grow over time, and we believe that it is financially prudent to operate our company at a slightly lower leverage to protect our dividend from potential future fluctuation in interest rates. In summary, the investment-grade bond market is the deepest and most for credit market, which we expect will provide us with many benefits. This includes reducing our overall cost of debt over time lowering future refinancing risk and extending our weighted average maturity, all while maintaining our ability to pursue a robust share buyback program and be opportunistic on the M&A front.\nI am excited about this new phase for SBA, and I look forward to providing you with further update on the topic. Let me now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.8 billion of total debt and $12.3 billion of net debt. Our current leverage is 6.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical lows. Our third quarter cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a solid 4.3x. During the third and fourth quarter, we repurchased 958,000 shares of our common stock for $194 million at an average price per share of $2.85. We currently still have $1.3 billion of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1.5 billion stock repurchase plan. .\nIn addition, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $119.1 million or $1.11 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.11 per share payable on December 11, 2025, to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2025. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 13% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2024 and approximately 35% of the midpoint of our full year AFFO outlook.\nAs Brendan mentioned, after 16 years here at SBA and over 25 years participating in the tower industry, I have decided to retire from SBA. This decision had been in the works for a while and was part of our overall succession planning process. [ Louis Friend ], who many of you know already has been my partner for the past 12 years, and I'm confident that I'm leaving you in good hands. He knows the company inside and out and will certainly be a joy to work with.\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to my teammates at SBA as well as my friends and colleagues in the investment community for your support and friendship for all these years.\nAnd with that, I'm ready to open up the call for questions."

Good evening. Thank you for joining us for SBA's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.

Good afternoon. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results, exceeding our internal projections. Both the U.S. and international businesses performed very well, and we are pleased to increase our full year guidance across all key metrics, both in total and on a constant currency basis.\nIn the U.S., activity levels continue to improve, and this quarter represents the sixth sequential quarter where bookings increased. While not at the peak levels enjoyed back in '21 and '22, positive momentum continues to build, and we are encouraged by the sustained levels of activity as carriers continue investing in their wireless networks. In addition, the trend towards more colocations continues driving more new point of presence with our key customers across our portfolio. Our carrier customers are working hard densifying their existing footprints, expanding fixed wireless access as well as pushing out into rural parts of the United States, where our portfolio is well positioned to capture that sustained network investment.\nThe backlog also remains healthy which bodes well for the remainder of the year and into 2026. Consistent with our strong U.S. bookings, our services business outperformed our expectations and we are increasing our full year services revenue guidance by almost 20%. Most of the increase is related to construction services as carrier installations accelerate across the U.S. I am optimistic about domestic organic growth opportunities over the next year or 2 due to the specific initiatives of each of our major customers.\nBut I am also optimistic about the long term. The growth in fixed wireless access subscribers for all of our MNO customers, the expanding number of AI intensive applications, 5G advanced enabled new use cases and the opportunity for incremental spectrum auctions are all supportive of sustained long-term growth. With regard to the spectrum, the recently passed federal spending and tax bill included the reinstatement of the FCC's Spectrum Auction Authority, a positive development for us and our customers.\nIn addition, as part of the new bill, 800 megahertz of spectrum will be identified and eventually auctioned to help boost network capacity and support the next generation of wireless technologies. This new spectrum will require new equipment at our cell towers, particularly at the higher bands that are not currently used for traditional wireless service today. Additionally, with bonus depreciation being permanently reinstated improving available liquidity from our customers, we could see greater investment in their networks as they have more capital available to invest. Similar to the U.S., our international business continues to perform well as our customers invest in 5G upgrades and ongoing densification.\nWe signed a growing number of new leases in our international markets, and continue to expand our portfolio through high-quality strategic new tower builds and elevated CPI rates continue to support healthy tenant lease escalations. While certain international markets continue to experience elevated levels of churn, we believe this to be temporary and necessary for the long-term health and success of our customers. One area of challenge internationally is with 1 of our carrier customers in Brazil, Oi. As indicated in our updated full year guidance, we are increasing international churn by $5 million, primarily related to oil.\nAs previously disclosed, Oi Wireline, the remaining Oi business post the wireless business breakup, which is mostly point-to-point wireless backhaul, represents approximately $20 million of run rate revenue. On July 2, Oi filed an amendment to their judicial reorganization plan citing unforeseen financial difficulties. While many things remain unknown and will take time to work through the court system, we have booked a bad debt allowance for certain outstanding receivable balances and are now assuming that a portion of the recurring revenue churn this year and next year. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide any updates to our thinking as the situation develops.\nTurning to our portfolio review. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made recently. Both expanding our presence in key markets and exiting the market where we are currently subscale and could not see a path towards being a more meaningful player. On the former, we added approximately 4,300 sites through the partial early closing from the previously announced Millicom transaction, deploying $550 million towards enhancing our strategic positioning in Central America, making SBA the leading tower operator in that region. This early closing contributed to the increase in our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, this portfolio has a 15-year MLA, tenant contracts with the leading mobile network operator, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, and comes with a substantial build-to-suit arrangement.\nWe continue to expect the balance of the deal to fully close by September 1. With regard to the market exit, we are announcing the sale of our tower business in Canada. We entered Canada back in 2009, and we have had reasonable success. However, we have been unable to meaningfully grow our portfolio. And as a result, we made the decision to explore strategic alternatives. On July 21, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our towers and related operations to a leading global infrastructure fund.\nToday, Canada represents approximately CAD 27 million of annual leasing revenue in Canadian dollars and CAD 15 million of cash flow after taxes. As mentioned in our press release, we expect the deal to close sometime in the fourth quarter, but given the uncertainty in closing timing, we have made no adjustments to our full year outlook related to this transaction. Upon closing, we expect this deal to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. I would like to briefly thank our Canada-based team for all of their hard work and contributions to SBA over the last 16 years. The portfolio review remains ongoing, and I look forward to providing further updates.\nIn addition to portfolio acquisitions, you should expect SBA to continue to deploy capital towards a mix of share repurchases and/or debt erection, as seen in our latest quarter and revised outlook. We continue to be committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation, opportunistically using each of these different options to invest in value-creating assets or to return capital to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMarc R. Montagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Brendan. As a positive momentum from last quarter continued to increasing our full year outlook for all key metrics, including site leasing revenue, cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share as compared to our last quarter guidance. The primary drivers of these increases included outperformance of second quarter results, higher straight line revenue, the acquisition of Millicom Towers earlier than expected in 2 international markets, an improved outlook for services, favorable foreign currency movement and a reduction in the share count from recently completed share buybacks.\nSecond quarter domestic organic leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5% on a gross basis, 1% on a net basis, including 4% of churn. $11 million of the second quarter churn was related to Sprint consolidation, which we still anticipate to be approximately $50 million to $52 million for the full year 2025. Our previously provided estimate of total spring-related turn over the next several years remain unchanged. Beyond 2025, we anticipate approximately $50 million of churn in 2026 than $20 million thereafter. Non sprint domestic annual churn continue to be between 1% and 1.5% of our domestic site leasing revenue.\nDuring the second quarter, 80% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue and 85% of adjusted EBITDA was denominated in U.S. dollar. International organic leasing revenue growth for the second quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 0.8% net, including 7.5% of churn or 8.3% on a gross basis. Total international return remained elevated in the second quarter, mainly due to ongoing [ career ] reconsolidation as well as the oil wireless churn in Brazil. During the second quarter of we acquired 4,329 sites for total cash concentration of approximately $563 million, mostly related to the acquisition size from Millicom in Guatemala and Panama. The remaining 2,500 sites related to the May comp transaction remain under contract and the guidance continues to assume a September 1 closing date.\nThe ultimate closing date is dependent upon regulatory approval and other requirements and may differ from this date. We also built 94 sites in the quarter, mostly outside of the U.S. Switching to the balance sheet. We have ample liquidity from both available cash and a $2 billion revolver, which as of today, has a balance of $35 million outstanding. At the end of the second quarter, our weighted average interest rate was 3.7% across our total outstanding debt and our weighted average maturity was [ EUR 50.2 ] approximately. Including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 97% of our pinoutstanding debt is fixed. And finally, our next debt maturity is a $750 million ABS security due in January 2026.\nI will conclude by discussing the recent credit rating update by S&P. We were pleased to see that on July 30, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB investment-grade rating, driven mostly by S&P new criteria for digital infrastructure companies, the upgrade underscore the benefits of our stable and predictable cash flows and the positive impact on our U.S. revenue growth of anticipated increased wireless capital spending in the U.S. in 2026 and beyond. While we have made no change to our financial policy, this upgrade bring us 1 step closer to accessing the investment-grade debt market.\nAnd now I will turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $12.3 billion of net debt. Our current leverage of 6.3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted on a pro forma basis for the Millicom assets remains near historical lows. Second quarter cash net interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remained strong at 4.3x.\nDuring the second and third quarter, we purchased 799,000 shares of our common stock for $172 million, at an average price per share of $215.33. We currently have $1.45 billion of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1.5 billion stock repurchase plan. In addition, during the second quarter, we declared to pay a cash dividend of $119.4 million or $1.11 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.11 per share payable on September 18, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2025.\nThis dividend represents an increase of approximately 13% over the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2024 and approximately 35% of the midpoint of our full year AFFO outlook. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon. 2025 got off to a good start in the first quarter. Results were broadly in line with our estimates and activity levels continue to demonstrate a healthy level of growth. In the U.S., our mobile network operator customers continued growing their level of network investment around our macro tower sites. We had our best quarter going back several years in terms of new domestic leasing business signed up during the quarter. Most encouraging though is that our leasing backlog also grew from December 31, and meaning we are adding new applications at a greater pace than we are signing up new business. This bodes well for the balance of the year.\nWe also continue to see a higher percentage of our new U.S. leasing business coming from new lease colocations versus amendments to existing leases. And our U.S.-based services business had a great quarter as well, with activity levels and results ahead of our expectations. We also saw our new business backlog grow for services during the quarter. And as a result of the strong start to the year and our growing backlog, we have increased our full year outlook for services. In our international markets, we also saw a positive start to the year with solid leasing activity.\nIn addition, elevated CPI rates in some of our markets have presented the potential for better existing lease escalations during the year. Across our markets, our customers have many network goals, which will require continued investment. Macro sites remain the most effective and cost-efficient way to advance wireless coverage and deploy new spectrum and technologies. Our portfolio is well positioned to capture growth from these initiatives over the next several years.\nIn addition to our operational achievements during the quarter, we also made progress in the areas of portfolio management and capital allocation. During the quarter, we completed our exit from the Philippines. And on last quarter's earnings call, we announced our planned exit from Colombia. We were able to finalize the required steps to complete this exit and formally sold our Colombian operations prior to quarter end. These steps have allowed us to improve our focus and allocation of resources.\nWe continue to evaluate all of our operations to identify ways to improve our market positioning or gain further synergies. In addition, during the first quarter, we closed on a small portion of the Central American sites previously put under a purchase agreement with Millicom International. While there are numerous regulatory and diligent steps remaining we will continue to explore opportunities for additional early closings. Against the backdrop of the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and the resulting market volatility the stability and consistency of our company and our business stand out. We have not experienced, nor do we foresee any direct impacts from the current tariff policies.\nOur business continues to generate steady cash flow and the underlying needs of our customers remain robust. As a result, we have significant confidence in our company and our future. Subsequent to quarter end, we have demonstrated that confidence by repurchasing 583,000 shares of our stock at an average price per share of $210.87- We have also announced today that our Board has approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, supporting our ability to return significant value to our shareholders. The combination of this plan and our industry-leading dividend growth provide a direct line of shareholder returns, while our existing capital structure allows us the flexibility to still pursue meaningful asset investment opportunities. We are very well positioned.\nFor the balance of 2025, SBA will be focused on operational execution, driving efficiencies in our processes, particularly through the incorporation of new technologies and systems enhancing our relevance to and relationships with our largest customers and bringing a balance of entrepreneurial spirit and informed financial discipline to capital allocation and expansion. Some of these focus areas may seem straightforward or mundane, but our ability to excel in each of these areas will be what sets SBA apart from our peers. The wireless ecosystem will continually evolve providing new opportunities for those willing to take them. I believe we have the people, experience and DNA makeup to maximize these opportunities.\nBefore turning it over to Marc, I'd like to thank our team members who represent that experience in D&A. Our team members represent SBA well every day and continually put the goals and objectives of our customers first. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the balance of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Marc, who will provide additional details on our results.\n\nMarc R. Montagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Brendan. Given the solid start to the year, we are increasing our full year outlook for all key metrics, including site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, FFO and FFO per share as compared to our initial 2025 guidance. The primary drivers of these increases include in-line third quarter result the closing of a small portion of the acquisition of towers from Millicom earlier than expected, an improved outlook for services, slightly higher [ street lag ] revenue due to the extension of some leases and a reduction in the share count from recently completed buybacks.\nFirst quarter domestic organic leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.2% on a gross basis, 1% on a net basis. including 4.2% of churn. $20 million of our first quarter churn was related to the Sprint consolidation, which we anticipate to be approximately $50 million to $52 million for the full year 2025. previously provided SDL of aggregate sprint related churn over the next 7 years remain unchanged. Beyond 2025, we anticipate approximately $50 million in 2026 and $20 million thereafter. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 1.5% of our domestic site-leasing revenue.\nDuring the first quarter, 80% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. International organizing leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 1.6% net, including 5.6% of churn or 7.2% on a gross basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the first quarter due mostly to key area consolidation.\nWe believe that procure consolidation in some of our international markets, the remaining wireless operators will be stronger in a better position to invest for the long term. This will support a steady growth rate for our operations in those countries. During the first quarter of 2025, we acquired 344 sites for total cash consideration of $58 million mostly related to the acquisition of sites for Millicom in Nicaragua. The contribution to the 2025 outlook from closing earlier than previously assumed, is $4 million of site leasing revenue and [ $2 million ] of tower cash flow.\nThe remaining 6,700 sites related to the Millicom transaction remain under contract and guidance continues to assume the September 1 closing date. The closing date is dependent upon regulatory approval and other requirements and may differ from this date. We also built 67 new sites in the quarter, mostly outside of the U.S. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity from both cash on the balance sheet and a fully undrawn $2 billion revolver. The recent share buybacks were funded fully with excess cash and did not require any borrowing.\nOur current leverage of 6.4 turns net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical low. As of the end of the first quarter, our weighted average interest rate was 3.7% across our outstanding debt and our weighted average maturity was approximately 4 years. Including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 9% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. And finally, our next debt maturity is a $750 million ABS security due in January of 2026. Now let me turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.5 billion of total debt and $11.8 billion of net debt. As Marc mentioned, our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4x below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains strong at 4.9x. During the second quarter, we repurchased 583,000 shares of our common stock for $123 million at an average price per share of $210.87.\nOn April 27, 2025, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase plan replacing the prior plan that was authorized in October of 2021, which had a remaining authorization of $82 million. This new plan authorizes the company to purchase from time to time up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding Class A common stock. The new plan has no time deadline and will continue to otherwise modified or terminated by the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $122.3 million or $1.11 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 1.1 -- I'm sorry, $1.11 per share payable on June 17, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 22, 2025. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 13% over the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2024 and approximately 35% of the midpoint of our full year AFFO outlook. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Welcome to the SBA Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. We will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, VP of Finance, Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Here today are Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSome of the information we will discuss on this call is forward looking including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, July 29, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make.\nIn addition, some of our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to comment on the second quarter.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThank you, Mark, and good afternoon. The second quarter was another solid one with good execution operationally and financial results in line with our expectations. Accounting for recent weakening and foreign exchange rates, we have modestly lowered our full year outlook for most financial measures. However, on a constant currency basis, we have slightly increased our projected full year results.\nThe year has largely unfolded as we had expected, steady carrier activity across our markets, but no material inflection in new lease and amendment execution thus far into the year. In the U.S., we have continued to receive increased inquiries from our customers, which is a good sign. But to date, we have only seen a modest increase in new business executions.\nLooking out over the next several years, though, we are very excited about the prospects for further increased demand. Mobile network consumption continues to grow at a very healthy pace, adding strain to existing networks. The offering of fixed wireless access by all 3 of our major customers will only add to this network stream.\nI have mentioned it before, but I believe it bears repeating. The average fixed wireless access user consumes 15x to 25x the data that a typical mobile wireless user consumes. As a result, the equivalent mobile subscriber additions to our customers' networks is significantly higher than it has been in the past.\nThis phenomenon will require continued network investment by our customers to keep pace with the demand and all have publicly discussed plans to continue to grow fixed wireless access subscribers over the next several years. We also expect that the eventual incorporation of new generative AI capabilities into handsets will further increase network consumption.\nIn addition, the percentage of our existing leases with the big 3 carriers that have been upgraded with mid-band 5G spectrum still remains at just over 50%, leaving a significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Varying rates of 5G progress among our large customers creates competitive pressures that we believe will also be a driver of future network investment just as it has been in past cycles.\nIncidentally, mid-band 5G spectrum upgrades in our international markets are at even lower percentages of completion than in the U.S. Beyond all of these demand-oriented drivers, we expect increased network spending driven by 5G coverage commitments made in connection with past regulatory approvals.\nSome of these commitments not only require coverage of [ POPs, ] but also minimum downlink speeds. This means that denser build-outs and expansion into areas not previously prioritized, particularly rural areas, will become more important as deadlines approach. We believe we are well situated to assist our customers in meeting their objectives with both our assets and our services support solutions. We are in the business of long-term assets and long-term customer relationships. Things don't change materially overnight, but the signs of numerous demand drivers are all there, and we are confident in our long-term organic growth prospects.\nIn our services business, we had another good quarter as well. Revenue was up 50% from the first quarter, and our gross profit contribution was ahead of our internal expectations. We have lowered our full year outlook for services revenue by $10 million at the midpoint due to a lower anticipated level of construction work, although we still expect to increase that number in the second half of the year over first half levels.\nNotwithstanding this lowered revenue outlook, we have not reduced our expected gross profit contributions to our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook as we continue to secure higher-margin work. Our services teams continue to perform very well for our customers, helping them to significantly reduce their deployment cycle times.\nInternationally, results were also in line with actuations in the prior quarter. Although we did see a pickup in new leasing activity during the quarter, increasing the contribution to full year revenue from new leases and amendments. Each of our markets has opportunities for increased organic growth as new spectrum and new generations of wireless technology are rolled out.\nChallenging macroeconomic factors and imbalanced market share among mobile network operators in some of our markets has led to consolidations and increased network rationalizations presenting some near-term challenges but ultimately, bolstering the strength and sustainability of our customers' prospects.\nWe continue to work towards enhancing our own market positioning and our alignment with the leading carriers in each of our markets. We believe our efforts will ultimately enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows and increase our opportunities to capture incremental organic leasing revenue growth.\nDuring the second quarter, we also continued a balanced approach to capital allocation with a mix of portfolio expansion, stock repurchases, dividends and debt reduction. I anticipate that we will continue to balance our capital allocation for the remainder of the year.\nSince our last earnings call, we have largely focused on debt reduction and have reduced our outstanding revolver balance to just $30 million as of today. We have some upcoming debt maturities that we anticipate refinancing in the near future. But until that time, we will likely continue to prioritize debt reduction and liquidity.\nThe debt markets are wide open to us and have also improved over the last few months as we have seen some tightening of rates. Our quarter end net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4x. So while our current priority is debt reduction, we have preserved the flexibility to take advantage of material, value-enhancing investment opportunities if they arise. We continue to explore and stay educated about the numerous asset portfolios available throughout our markets but we'll retain an informed financial discipline in our approach to these opportunities.\nOur approach really [ has ] not changed, but our increased cost of capital has certainly underscored the emphasis we place on precise valuation and strategic rationale. I still believe we are the best in the business at valuing, integrating and operating tower assets. So I believe we can continue to create value through asset acquisitions.\nWe have a great long-term steady cash flow, low risk business. The underlying strength of wireless dependent products and services will continue to drive increased needs for enhanced infrastructure solutions, and we have positioned ourselves as a key partner for our customers in meeting the challenges of addressing those needs.\nBefore turning it over to Mark to share some more specifics on our second quarter results, I'd like to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our success. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide additional details.\n\nMarc R. Montagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Brendan. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. Second quarter domestic [ same tower ] revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis and 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of [ current. ] $8.2 million of the second quarter churn was related to spring consolidation churn.\nInternational same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 2.7% net including 5.3% of churn or 8% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 6.4% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, the reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI link escalator in Brazil.\nWe continue to see strong organic lease-up in our international market. Total international [ turns ] remained elevated in the second quarter due mostly to previously announced carrier consolidation. During the second quarter, 7% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar [indiscernible] revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter.\nLet me now cover our revised outlook for 2024. Excluding the impact of weak [indiscernible] foreign currency assumptions, we slightly increased our full year outlook for site leasing revenue, solid cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and FFO per share as compared to our prior outlook. The devaluation of the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar is estimated to have a negative impact to our site leasing revenue of approximately $90 million in 2024 versus our prior forecast in May.\nWith regard to site development revenue, we are forecasting lower construction volume for the full year and therefore, have lower our full year outlook by $10 million. However, we have not reduced our expectation for gross profit contribution for this business as we continue to execute well and secure higher-margin work.\nPlease also note that the outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those as of today that are already under contract and expected to close by year-end. We also do not assume any share repurchase beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year.\nOutlook for net cash insurance expenses and for FFO and FFO per share, I assume was September 1 refinancing of the $620 million [ ABS ] Tower Securities scaled to mature in October 2024. We assume a refinancing at a fixed rate of 6% per year. Actual rate and time may vary from these assumptions. As a result of these revised financial assumption and projected lower cash taxes, our full year FFO per share outlook has increased by $0.09, excluding the impact of FX fees. Let me now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Marc. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity. Our current leverage is 6.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA remains near historical lows. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains very strong at 5.2x.\nOur weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years with an average interest rate of 3% and across our total outstanding debt, including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver and as of today, we have a $30 million balance under our $2 billion revolver.\nIn addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $105.3 million or $0.98 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on September 18, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 22, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% of the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023. And operator, with that, we are ready to open up the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nAnd I now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Finance, Mr. Mark DeRussy. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Brendan Cavanagh, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSome of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2024 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 29, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make.\nIn addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics.

Montagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Mark. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currency assumptions, we increased our full year outlook for Tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share as compared to our initial 2024 outlook. The primary drivers of these increases are direct cost savings associated with Towers to be decommissioned and a reduction in our estimated full year share count from complete buyback. Due to the current strength of the U.S. dollars versus local currencies in some of our international markets, our overall outlook for leasing revenue, total revenues, tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA were slightly down versus our initial guidance.\nFirst quarter Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 5.9% on a gross basis, 2.3% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. $7.5 million of the first quarter churn was related to spring consolidation churn, which we anticipate to be approximately $30 million for the full year 2024. As expected, domestic operational leasing activity of bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter, was consistent with the levels of activity we saw in 2023.\nNonprint-related domestic annual churn continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate sprint role churn over the next several years remain unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025 and $45 million to $55 million in '26 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027.\nInternational same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.3% net, including 4.8% of churn or 8.1% on a gross basis. In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower -- organic growth was 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As compared to the previous quarter and full year 2023, our reported international growth rate continued to be impacted by a declining local CPI linked escalator in Brazil.\nTotal international churn remained elevated in the first quarter due mostly to carrier consolidation. During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue during the quarter.\nAs a reminder, our 2024 outlook does not include any churn of sector related to the oil wireless consolidation other than the amount associated with the previously announced agreement that we executed with Vivo. If during 2024, we were to enter into further agreements with other carriers related to the oil wireless consolidation that may have an impact on 2024. We will adjust our outlook in future earnings calls. Additionally, the need judicial reorganization plan for all while on was recently approved by a majority of creditors.\nAs a result of this plan, we have increased our full year churn outlook for oil wireline by $2 million to a total of approximately $4 million. This adjustment is including updated full year site leasing revenue outlook. As a result, all wireline now represent approximately $20 million total annual site leasing revenue in 2024.\nDuring this quarter of 2024, we acquired 11 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $9.2 million. We also built 76 new sites, mostly outside of the U.S. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or is under contract to purchase 271 sites in our existing markets, an aggregate price of $84.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter.\nOur outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. We also do not assume any share buyback beyond what was already completed so far this year. However, it is possible that we invest in additional assets or share repurchase or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expenses and for FFO and FFO per share continues to include the July 1 refinancing of $620 million ABS Tower securities scheduled to mature in October '24. We assume a refinancing at a fixed rate of 6% per year, actual rate and timing vary from these assumptions.\nOur balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity. If not for the recent share buyback, our $2 billion revolver would have been fully paid down. Our current leverage of 6.5x net debt to EBITDA remains near historical low and will be a steady target of 7 to 7.5x. Our balance sheet is very strong with a current weighted average interest rate of 3.1% across our total outstanding debt. Our weighted average maturity is approximately 4 years, including the impact of our current interest rate hedge, the interest rate of 96% of our current outstanding debt\nAnd now then turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.2 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.5x, below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2x. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $195 million outstanding under our $2 billion revolver.\nDuring the first and second quarter, we repurchased 935,000 shares of our common stock for $200 million at an average price per share of $213.85. We currently have $205 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2024, were $107.9 million. In addition, during the first quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $108.1 million or $0.98 per share. And as of today, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared a second quarter dividend of $0.98 per share, payable on June 19, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close on May 23, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good afternoon. The first quarter marked a good start to 2024. We executed well operationally and produced financial results in line with our expectations. As a result, we have made very few adjustments to our full year outlook on a constant currency basis.\nIn many of our markets, macroeconomic challenges have continued, and as a result, incremental network investments by our customers have remained measured and largely in line with activity levels that we saw last year. In the U.S., leasing activity from an execution standpoint was only slightly higher than the fourth quarter. However, during the first quarter, we saw increases in applications for both new leases and amendments as well as an increase in our services backlog.\nOur customers continue to have significant network needs. A large percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades and data-heavy use cases, including fixed wireless access, will compel continued investment by our customers over the next several years. I am personally of the belief that the current high cost of capital environment is perhaps the biggest overhang on this spending and is driving the more elongated spending cycle.\nNonetheless, the needs are great. Consumers are demanding and competitive pressures will continue. Our infrastructure will be a critical component of the delivery chain for our customers to meet these challenges, and I believe we are well positioned to support them in their efforts. In addition, the current cost of capital may persist longer than anticipated just a few months ago. I believe it will ultimately come down in time, which will encourage increased network investment. It is all really just a matter of timing.\nInternationally, results were also in line with expectations. Although each market has its own specific dynamics on average, we are in a period of slower growth internationally compared to our historical levels. Lower inflationary escalators are a contributor, but the primary reason is consolidation-related churn and its associated impacts on carrier focus.\nInternationally, we have found that during these consolidations, the surviving carriers direct most of their attention to rationalizing their existing networks, causing much of their incremental network expansion. However, new spectrum and new technology generation deployments remain important and we believe will result in an acceleration in organic growth rates over time.\nAs discussed on our last call, chart remains elevated due primarily to these consolidations, but we believe that the steps we have taken and are taking to reach mutually beneficial contractual amendments with these customers will enhance the long-term strength and stability of our cash flows.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities, we have not shifted our previously stated overall approach, but we do very much make adjustments along the way in response to broader market dynamics and opportunities. We prioritize our dividend and have again announced a quarterly dividend 15% higher than the prior year period. This dividend level remains less than 30% of our guided full year AFFO, leaving meaningful capital available for allocation.\nDuring the first quarter, we added a relatively small number of towers to our portfolio. And as a result of carrier consolidation, we decommissioned almost as many sites as we added. We remain selective about the quality of the sites that we add to our portfolio, but we really remain particular about the price at which we add them, which these days has been the main gating issue. That's okay as our focus continues to be on return on investment, not growth just for growth's sake.\nOpportunities will come along. In fact, they come along all the time. So we are comfortable being patient appropriately considering the new cost of capital environment we are operating in, and going after those opportunities that we believe we can best drive strong returns on.\nThe sites we are decommissioning are related to consolidation activity among our customers. We will be more proactive in the coming years in evaluating naked sites for cost-saving opportunities and potentially decommissioning.\nAs I mentioned earlier, cost of capital and specifically cost of debt remains high and is now broadly expected to remain elevated for longer. This dynamic beyond any other has had the most significant impact on public tower company valuations. During the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, we responded to some of this decline in valuation by spending $200 million to repurchase 935,000 shares of our stock. I believe that when there is ultimately a downward shift in rates, repurchases at this level will be even more accretive to future shareholder value.\nNonetheless, rates remain elevated today, and we recognize the impact of potential future higher interest costs on AFFO. So a portion of our capital allocation will continue to be appropriately dedicated to reducing debt.\nWe are not formally changing our leverage targets as we believe retaining flexibility for the right investment opportunities is valuable, but operating with lower leverage in the current environment is clearly prudent.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity position remain in great shape. If not for the share repurchases, our revolver would have been fully paid down as of today. Our average cost of debt remains very low at 3.1%. However, over the next 12 months, we have approximately $1.8 billion that will need to be refinanced. The cost of that debt will certainly be higher than what we are paying today, but our ability to manage the amount of debt needed and the time we are locked into higher rates will be important factors in the approach we take.\nCapital is widely available to us. It's really just a matter of cost. We are evaluating a variety of options and we'll provide further updates during the year as incremental steps are taken.\nFinally, I would like to revisit some of my comments from our prior earnings call with regard to the portfolio review we have undertaken. On the last call, I mentioned that we had begun an effort to analyze all of our operations and our potential operations through a lens of stabilizing results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. I do not see this goal as having a finite deadline as it is more definitional around the key decisions we make. However, there are some very specific steps being taken and looking at each of our key operations, each of our business lines in each of our international markets. We are setting baselines as to where we think these operations end up on a status quo basis 1 year from now, 5 years from now and even 10 years from now. Then based on potential opportunities we see in each case, we are developing alternative results profiles based on different paths we might take with the ultimate goal being improving the outcome relative to the base case. We are making good progress in gaining good insights through the effort, but this is not an overnight initiative.\nMany of the potential steps identified to enhance our positioning in given markets or operations will take time, sometimes possibly years to effectuate. After our prior call, a lot of attention was paid to the possibility of divestitures of businesses or markets. While that may be an outcome in some cases, it is far from the priority or preferred path.\nI would much rather find ways to improve our position in the market through the addition of quality assets, enhance customer relationships and agreements and other creative solutions. In fact, I was recently visiting our team in Brazil, and learned a number of creative solutions we are introducing to enhance the customer experience at our sites and thereby improve the longevity of our customer relationships at those sites. I am encouraged by the seriousness with which our teams are approaching this initiative.\nIn the end though, as I stated previously, financial results always matter, and we will make the best decisions we can to protect or create shareholder value as our top priority. We have a great business and great assets. It is our job as the management team to maximize the value we can realize from those assets, and that is where our focus squarely is.\nI'd like to wrap up by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our solid first quarter, and we look forward to continuing to share our progress throughout the year. With that, Jeffrey, we are ready for questions."

Our statements are as of today, February 26, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make.\nIn addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Marc to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2024 outlook.\n\nMarc R. Montagner\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Mark. We ended 2023 with another strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allow us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Consolidated same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 3.6% net year-over-year including impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.9% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Of that 3.4%, 1.6% was related to Sprint consolidation churn.\nAs expected, domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue place and the contract during the fourth quarter was consistent with the lower levels of activity we saw during the second and third quarter of 2023. Full year organic leasing contribution to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our previously provided outlook. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn was also in line with our prior expectations and continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. International same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.2% net including 5.9% of churn or 10.1% on a gross basis.\nIn Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 8% on a constant currency basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due mostly to [indiscernible] consolidation. During the fourth quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our tower portfolio, acquiring 23 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $21.3 million. We also paid 138 new sites. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have purchased under agreement to acquire 281 sites in all of our existing markets for an aggregate price of $87.8 million. We anticipate closing on this site under contract by the end of the third quarter.\nLooking ahead, this afternoon, earnings press release includes our initial outlook for the full year 2024. Our outlook reflects a continuation of the reduced level of carrier CapEx that began early last year. Despite this, our leasing business will continue to grow organically through contribution from new leases amendment and contracted escalators. Domestically, our outlook assumes $55 million of customer churn in 2024 of which approximately $30 million related to Sprint related decommissioning. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint churn over the next several years remain largely unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in 2026 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027.\nInternationally, our outlook includes approximately $22 million churn in 2024. During the fourth quarter of '23, we signed a multiyear agreement with Vivo in Brazil. Under this agreement, we expect to incur $4 million wireless consolidation churn in 2024 and an additional $2 million over the next several years. Total anticipated wireless consolidated remains at approximately $30 million. Additionally, our full year 2024 outlook reflects a year-over-year decline in service revenue and gross profit due to the lower overall [indiscernible] activity in the U.S.\nHowever, our outlook is in line with the historical performance, excluding our very strong result in 2022 and '23 due to the initial rollout of 5G network by some of our wireless customers during these years. This outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract and does not assume any share repurchase. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets and our share repurchase during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for FFO and FFO per share include the recent refinancing of our term loan B debt, the upside of our credit facility in the future refinancing a rerating rate in the future of our $620 million ABS tower securities maturing in October 2024.\nOur balance sheet remains very strong, and we have ample liquidity. In January of 2024, we refinanced our $2.3 billion credit facility, pushing out the maturity to 2031. We also increased our revolver capacity by $500 million, a $2 billion revolver is almost fully paid down. Our leverage remains at historical lows and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5 turns giving us plenty of dry power for opportunistic acquisition and/or share repurchase. Lastly, we purchased a forward starting interest rate swap in the fourth quarter. This will give us great certainty around great uncertainty on future interest costs.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will provide additional detail.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.3x, which is below the low end of our target range and near the lowest level we have seen in decades. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2x. During the fourth quarter 2023, the company entered into a $1 billion forward starting interest rate swap, which will swap 1-month SOFR for a fixed rate of 3.83%. The swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025, which coincides with the expiration of our existing $1.95 billion notional interest rate swap. This forward starting interest rate swap agreement will expire April 11, 2028.\nSubsequent to the fourth quarter and on January 25, 2024, the company issued a new $2.3 billion secured term loan B under its amended and restated senior credit agreement. This matures in January of 2031. The new term loan accrues interest at SOFR plus 200 basis points. The existing $1.95 billion interest rate swap will remain in effect until expiration on March 31, 2025. The term loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds were used to retire the company's 2018 term loan and to pay related fees and expenses. Also subsequent to the quarter, on February 23, 2020, the company further increased the total commitments under the revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2 billion.\nWe continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts under the revolver. And as of today, we have a $70 million outstanding balance under our $2 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3% and with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.1 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.4%. The interest rate on 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\nDuring the fourth quarter, as we previously discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we repurchased 235 -- I'm sorry, 234,000 shares of our common stock, $46 million at an average price of $198.27 per share. We currently have $405 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at December 31, 2023, were $108.1 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $91.8 million or $0.85 a share.\nAnd today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on March 28, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend we paid in the fourth quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good afternoon. I am pleased for the opportunity to reflect on our 2023 performance and to share our thoughts about 2024 and beyond. 2023 was a year marked by some significant macro headwinds, in particular, the consistently high interest rate environment that not only directly affected SBA's floating rate debt costs and the views around our cost of future refinancing but also impacted our customers and their network spending levels. In spite of these macro headwinds, SBA executed extremely well and produced solid financial results. When compared against the initial outlook for 2023, given in February of last year, our actual results for the year finished materially above the high end of the ranges given for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share.\nMost of the outperformance was organic as we spent very little incremental discretionary CapEx in comparison to our initial outlook. Our excess free cash flow was instead largely spent on paying down our floating rate revolver debt, and we finished the year at a multi-decade low leverage level of 6.3x. And today have a current revolver balance of only $70 million.\nInternally, it was a year of leadership transition for the company. Jeffrey Stoops retirement, the addition of Marc Montagner to the team and new leaders in our international legal and IT functions. Everyone has stepped up extremely well into their roles, and I am very happy with how the team is collaborating and performing. The disciplined succession planning and highly capable team members assembled throughout the organization have positioned us well for the future.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we recognize that we are coming off of a period of reduced network investment by our largest domestic customers. However, future network needs for each of these customers remain significant, and we anticipate being a critical partner for our customers in meeting their operational goals and objectives. A significant percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades, which we are confident will take place over the next couple of years.\nIn addition, the success and growth of fixed wireless access as a product offering for our customers will add greater demand for increased network capacity as the average user of this product uses 20x or more broadband data than the typical mobile customer. And the evolution of AI-infused 5G offerings will continue to fuel the demand for improved speeds and lower latency. All of these factors as well as good old-fashioned service-based competition are supportive of steady organic leasing activity on our U.S. assets for years to come.\nInternationally, we also see a dynamic of significant network needs, providing a backdrop for continued solid organic leasing activity throughout many of our markets. Financial pressures have impacted many of our international customers as well but the demand for advanced wireless products and services is significant, and in a number of cases, even greater than that seen in the U.S. We expect this will in turn drive continued demand for incremental space at our tower sites. Nonetheless, there have been customer consolidations in several of our markets. As a result, we have worked closely with our customers to help them achieve necessary efficiencies in their operations.\nBut while preserving the breadth of our business relationships, and solidifying our contractual commitments for the long term. While this temporarily leads to elevated churn, we believe the long-term strength and stability of our cash flow streams produced as a result of these efforts meaningfully improves our go-forward value proposition. This is a good segue into my views around our forward strategy. Internally, we are highlighting a desire to analyze everything we do or consider doing through the lens of stabilizing our results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations.\nWhile this is not materially different than the approach SBA has taken throughout its history, we recognize that not all of our assets or business lines fit well within this goal. As a result, we are doing the work to evaluate our full portfolio and develop action plans around how we improve our position in each business line and in each market. For instance, in our international operations, we have found it to be valuable to be a market leader in the markets we operate in. In places where we hold a more significant position, we have tended to do better than those places where we do not. This ultimately means that we need to find a path to increase scale in certain markets or possibly exit a market.\nAn example of this was our fourth quarter exit from Argentina. Not only was our market position subscale, but the economic instability in that country created operational challenges that were dilutive to the otherwise typically very attractive attributes of the tower business. We will pursue incremental investments to drive continued growth as we always have. But we will prioritize either an overall favorable shift in the quality and stability of our asset mix or an opportunistic investment that improves our standing and existing markets.\nFinancial results always matter. We will be disciplined toward producing the best possible financial results over the long term. We believe high-quality assets ultimately produce that result. We also believe that when opportunities for incremental asset investments are not available stock repurchases and debt reductions are worthwhile uses of capital. We intend to continually evaluate our optimal capital structure, and we'll look to balance the lowest cost of capital with retaining appropriate investment flexibility.\nOur attention to optimize capitalization of the company has placed us in what I believe is the best position in the industry. We are the fastest dividend grower, but yet have the greatest retained AFFO post dividend to invest in the business. We have maintained an average cost of debt very close to our larger peers, but have retained access to up to 2 turns more leverage. We have recently extended and expanded our revolver capacity by $500 million, creating increased liquidity. This structure provides us with significant optionality to move in whichever direction we believe will provide the best return for our shareholders. The strength and stability of our core tower business remains and it provides a tremendous foundation for all future endeavors.\nAs a result, I have great confidence in our ability to create future value for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers for their support and their confidence in SBA. I also want to thank our team members for their contributions to our success.\nAnd with that, Eric, we are ready to take questions."

Welcome to the SBA Third Quarter Results Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeffrey Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. .\nSome of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from expectations. Our statements are as of today, November 2, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make.\nIn addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another very solid quarter in Q3, with financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share, notwithstanding weaker forecasted foreign currency exchange rates than we had previously expected.\nTotal GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $637.5 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $630.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a headwind of approximately $1.4 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, and a benefit of $4.8 million when compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nSame tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the third quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.1% of churn.\nOn a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.8%.\nDomestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8.6% on a gross basis, and 4.7% on a net basis, including 3.9% of churn.\nDomestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was up materially from the second quarter, primarily as a result of the AT&T master lease agreement signed in July.\nExcluding the impact of the AT&T MLA, third quarter activity levels were similar to the second quarter. All major carriers remain active with their networks. However, agreement execution levels continue to be slower than a year ago.\nThe higher cost of capital naturally has caused a focus on cash management and expense control by our customers. This dynamic extends the timing over which 5G-related network investments are being made.\nThere is still a long way to go for 5G network investments based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators.\nWireless data use continues to grow materially, and that fact, combined with the limited spectrum availability, will require additional infrastructure over time to maintain and certainly to enhance service quality. This gives us great confidence in continued domestic organic leasing growth for many years to come.\nDuring the third quarter, domestic churn was slightly below our prior projections due to a slower pace of decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected. Our overall expectations for Sprint related churn remain the same, but there will likely continue to be small variations in timing of realizing this churn over the next several years.\nWe currently expect Sprint related churn for 2023 to be $28 million. 2024 Sprint related churn is currently estimated to be approximately $30 million. Non-Sprint related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections and continues to range between 1% and 2% of our domestic leasing revenue.\nInternationally, on a constant currency basis, third quarter same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.5% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.4% on a gross basis.\nInternational leasing activity remained strong in the third quarter and was again ahead of our internal expectations.\nWhile global macroeconomic conditions present challenges to our carrier customers, we have continued to see pockets of dedicated network investment across a number of our markets. The desire and need for enhanced wireless coverage and quality of service continues to be elevated internationally, and we expect will continue to drive leasing opportunities across our portfolio.\nWireless data growth in our international markets is even greater than the U.S. We also continue to see steady contributions from inflation-based escalators in many of our markets.\nIn Brazil, our largest international market, the same-tower organic growth rate was 2.6% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 6.3% of churn, which growth rate reflects a decline in the Brazilian inflationary index. The net growth rate was also again significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement.\nAs a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than that associated with the TAM agreement. However, we continue to discuss potential arrangements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that could have an impact on our current year international churn.\nDuring the third quarter, 77.8% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.\nTower cash flow for the third quarter was $511.7 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.3%, and an international tower cash flow margin of 70%, or 91.5% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $482.1 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 71.4% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 76.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, our services business had another solid quarter, with $45.1 million in revenue, and $13.6 million of segment operating profit.\nWhile off last year's all-time high activity levels, we continued to execute on our backlog of high-quality, high-margin work and deliver for our carrier customers.\nHowever, given the slower pace of carrier network related activity across the industry, we have lowered our full year outlook for our site development business by $15 million at the midpoint.\nNotwithstanding this adjustment, we continue to manage our costs and focus on high-margin work. And thus, we have not lowered our expected margin contributions to 2023 adjusted EBITDA and AFFO from our services business.\nWe still expect 2023 to be the second largest services revenue year in our history, trailing only 2022.\nAdjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the third quarter was $364.1 million. AFFO per share was $3.34, an increase of 7.7% over the third quarter of 2022.\nDuring the third quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 45 communication sites for total cash consideration of $40.8 million, and building 86 new sites.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 215 sites, all of which are in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $74 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\nIn addition to new towers, we also continued to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms.\nAt the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.\nBefore I turn things over to Mark, I'd like to take a quick moment to welcome Marc Montagner, who joined our team in mid-October, and will be taking over as our new CFO on January 1. Marc brings with him an extensive background in telecommunications and finance, and we are very excited to have him as part of the team.\nI also would be remiss if I did not take a moment to recognize that this call is Jeff's final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have big shoes to fill, and I am grateful for the professional guidance and the friendship he has extended to me over the last 25 years.\nAnd with that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThank you, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt, and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.4x, 0.2 turns lower than last quarter, and the lowest level of decades.\nOur third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense increased to 5.1x.\nDuring and subsequent to quarter end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $285 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver.\nThe current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.2 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%. Including our interest rate hedging position, the interest rate on 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\nDuring and subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $100 million at an average price per share of $197.89. We currently have $404.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan.\nThe company's shares outstanding at September 30, 2023 were $108.1 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million, or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.85 per share. It's payable on December 14, 2023, to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2023.\nThis dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period, and only represents 26% -- 26% of our projected full year AFFO.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We continue to execute well in the third quarter. We produced financial results ahead of external and internal expectations, and we continue to be a valued partner to our carrier customers in helping them to meet their network objectives.\nEach of our largest U.S. customers continue to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations.\nAlthough current activity levels are below the pace of the last couple of years, we have continued to steadily organically grow our revenues and tower cash flow. Even in a slower than typical demand environment, wireless carriers still have a constant need to invest in expanding and enhancing their networks.\nBy leveraging our high-quality assets and providing them quality services support, we have been able to continue growing our business relationship with each of our major customers. In addition, we are confident there will be additional material network investment over the next several years as wireless data usage continues to grow materially. The growth in wireless demand is not slowing down, and networks will continue to be strained, and our customers still have significant mid-band spectrum holdings that need to be deployed with little additional spectrum plan for release anytime soon.\nMacro tower sites are still the most efficient and effective way to deliver wireless connectivity, and our focus on high-quality portfolio will make us a key participant in network growth for many years to come.\nInternationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. We again experienced strong contributions broadly for many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa.\nBrazil, our largest market outside of the U.S., was again ahead of our internal expectations, and each of the big 3 carriers in that market remain busy, with coverage expansion, densification and integration of the legacy Oi wireless network.\nLease up across many of our Central American markets was also ahead of expectations, and evidence is the need of our customers to meet the constantly growing demand of wireless customers for wireless data in those markets.\nI'm pleased with our operational execution internationally, and I'm optimistic for the future based on significant network needs across many of our markets.\nDuring the third quarter, we again generated very healthy AFFO, providing strong dividend coverage and significant cash for discretionary allocation. During the quarter, we allocated capital to the dividend and new site additions through both acquisitions and new tower builds, selectively adding high-quality sites that we believe will be additive to our organic growth in future years.\nWe also spent $100 million on share repurchases at prices we believe represent a very good value and will produce a nice return over time.\nWe also continue paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver. We immediately benefit from this by reducing some of our highest rate cash interest obligations. The reduction in our outstanding debt, along with our continued solid growth in adjusted EBITDA produced a quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.4x, which I believe is the lowest level ever in our public company history.\nEven with continued portfolio growth, stock repurchases and growing dividends, we have reduced our leverage by almost 1 full turn in the last 18 months, demonstrating the deleveraging power of our business.\nAt this leverage level, we believe we have the near-term optionality to achieve an investment-grade rating. However, for the time being, we are maintaining flexibility in order to comfortably assess all capital allocation options.\nGoing forward, we expect to continue growing our dividend at a rate higher than the rate of growth of our AFFO over the next several years while maintaining a low AFFO payout ratio.\nAnd for the time being, excess future cash flows will likely be directed into the repayment of debt, as it is the most accretive short term and is also beneficial long term. But we will, of course, also stay opportunistic around portfolio opportunities and additional stock buybacks.\nOur balance sheet remains in great shape, with no debt maturities until October 2024, and we have the capacity to satisfy that repayment entirely with cash flow from operations or availability under our revolver.\nWe continue to have very good access to capital, and thus are comfortable to be opportunistic around the timing of future financings. Overall, we feel very good about our current capital position.\nAs Brendan mentioned earlier, this represents my final earnings call as CEO of SBA. I have participated in approximately 100 of these calls over the years. I have been honored to be the leader of this organization for the past 22 years, and appreciative of the time I have spent with many of you on this call.\nThank you for your support and goodwill throughout this very enjoyable ride. I will retire with the comfort and satisfaction of knowing SBA is a great company in great shape, and with the management team that I know will lead it to new heights.\nI want to conclude by thanking our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success.\nAnd with that, Eric, we are ready for questions."

Good evening. We had another steady quarter in Q2 with solid financial results that were slightly ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter or $626.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $618.7 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $1.9 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $4.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.3% net over the second quarter of 2022, and including the impact of 3.9% of churn.\nOn a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.2%. The Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.8% on a gross basis and 4.2% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter declined from the first quarter. While all major carriers remained active with their networks, agreement execution levels in the second quarter from several of our customers were below our prior expectations. Longer term, we continue to see significant runway for new 5G-related leasing activity based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators.\nIn addition, today, we announced that we have entered into a new long-term master lease agreement with AT&T. This comprehensive agreement will streamline AT&T's deployment of 5G solutions across our tower portfolio while providing us with committed future leasing growth from AT&T for years to come. Based on this MLA, we have increased our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from domestic organic new leases and amendments by $6 million from the full year projections we provided last quarter. During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 42% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 58%. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 89% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was slightly elevated during the quarter, primarily due to faster decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected, which is the opposite of our experience last year. Based on our current analysis, we expect Sprint related churn for 2023 will be at the high end of our previously stated range for this year of $25 million to $30 million, resulting in a change to our full year domestic churn outlook of $4 million.\nOur views around the ultimate multiyear cumulative impact of Sprint merger-related churn have not changed. Although we continue to update our outlook around timing as more information becomes available. We now project 2024 Sprint related churn to be in a range of $20 million to $30 million, 2025 to be between $35 million and $45 million. 2026 to be $45 million to $55 million and 2027 to be $10 million to $20 million. Just as last year ended up being well below our initial churn expectations and 2023 will likely be a little above our initial expectations, we anticipate that the exact timing will continue to be somewhat fluid, but in line with our provided projections. Non-Sprint-related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections.\nMoving now to international results. On a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.8% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was strong in the second quarter and ahead of our internal expectations. These positive results and our solid backlogs have allowed us to increase our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from international organic new leases and amendments by $1 million. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make steady contributions to our organic growth. However, decreases in actual and projected Brazilian CPI rates have caused us to moderate our outlook for international escalation contributions for the full year by approximately $1 million. Overall, Brazil, our largest international market, had another very good quarter. The same tower organic growth rate in Brazil was 5.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.6% of churn, which amount was significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. While international churn remains elevated, it continues to be in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook.\nAs a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the OI consolidation other than that associated with the TAM agreement. However, if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the oil consolidation that would be expected to have an impact on our current year we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. During the second quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.2% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 13.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $503.5 million, Tower cash flow in the quarter benefited by approximately $7.3 million in accounting-driven cost reclassifications. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.5% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.3% or 92.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $471.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business had another strong quarter with $52.4 million in revenue and $13.1 million of segment operating profit. While off year ago activity levels, our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter, and we have retained our full year outlook for our site development business due in part to the strength of our first half results. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $352.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.24, an increase of 6.2% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 9 communication sites for total cash consideration of $7.2 million and building 64 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 134 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $72.9 million.\nWe anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites, and during the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $10.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6x. And below the low end of our target range and the lowest level in decades. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a strong 4.9x. During a subsequent to quarter end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have $360 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.5 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance was 6.3%. The interest rate of 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\nDuring the quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock, choosing instead to reduce revolver balances. We currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2023, were $108.4 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on September 20, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend we paid in the year ago period. and only 26% of our projected full year AFFO. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid one for SBA. We produced good financial results across all areas of our business, and we continue to deliver high-quality service and operating results for our customers. Each of our largest U.S. customers remained active with their networks. Our customers continue to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new colocations. We did, however, see the same slowdown in activity that many others have discussed. While we had always anticipated domestic leasing growth to moderate as we move through 2023 and organic leasing activity levels were lower than we anticipated in Q2 from some of our customers. Some of this was due, we believe, to slower activity from AT&T in anticipation of our new MLA as would be expected. We believe that these variations in activity are part of the normal cycle of carrier network investment that we have seen over time, a large initial burst of coverage activity as the next generation of technology starts to be deployed, followed by many years of coverage completion and capacity building.\nWe are confident that there will be additional material network investment over the next several years. We believe this for a number of reasons. Most importantly, wireless demand continues to grow at a fast clip, consuming more and more of current network capacity. We have a large remaining number of sites that have not been upgraded yet to accommodate the mid-band spectrum holdings acquired by our customers over the last couple of years, some of which spectrum is not even available for deployment yet. DISH has their next phase of regulatory coverage requirements to meet in 2025, and we have our newly signed MLA with AT&T. We believe all of these items and others are supportive of multiyear continued development activity. While there will always be ebbs and flows in leasing activity levels based on a variety of factors, we believe that there will remain a need for continuous network investment just as we have seen throughout our history in this business. With regard to our announced master lease agreement with AT&T, we're very excited about this next chapter in our long-standing successful relationship.\nThis new agreement highlights the long-term importance of SBA sites to AT&T's future network deployment plans. The agreement will improve operating efficiencies between our organizations and enhance stability with regard to future leasing growth. We look forward to working closely with AT&T for years to come under this mutually beneficial framework. In the second quarter, our services business remained busy helping our carrier customers meet deployment objectives in an efficient and effective manner. While our services business is down on a year-over-year basis, 2023 will still represent the second biggest service this year in our company's history behind only 2022. We believe our legacy and reputation in the Services business keeps us well positioned to be a go-to provider for our customers to meet their network rollout goals.\nInternationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. During the quarter, 62% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 38% came through new leases with strong contributions broadly for many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market. I continue to be pleased with our operational performance, cost management and customer relationships in Brazil, which has made us a leader in the market. And we have recently seen positive movements in the currency exchange rate, providing some financial benefit and increased U.S. dollars for repatriation as well as contributing to our increased full year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil. During the quarter, we again generated solid AFFO providing significant cash for discretionary allocation. While our strong financial position allows us to retain flexibility for future further opportunistic investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases and we dedicated the majority of our available cash in the quarter to paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver.\nWe immediately benefit from this by reducing our floating rate cash interest obligations which today represent among the highest cost debt in our capital structure. With the continuing high cost and limited availability of private market tower acquisition opportunities, we believe this is currently our best use of discretionary spending. Our quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6%, which I believe to be the lowest in our history, at least as a public company. As always, we will continue to be opportunistic around investments, but for the near term, likely direct future cash flows into the repayment of debt as the most accretive short term and certainly a long-term beneficial use of capital. Our balance sheet is in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024. And since that maturity could easily be refinanced under our revolver, we are comfortable now to remain opportunistic around timing of future financings. We are a preferred issuer in the debt markets we routinely use and retain very good access to capital.\nWe finished the quarter with 95% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed for now to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we continue paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year. We feel very good about our current capital position. We feel fortunate to be in a sound, stable business with tremendous fundamentals and significant long-term opportunity ahead. Our customers continue to have significant network needs, and we will be there to support them in meeting those needs. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success. And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions."

Welcome to the SBA First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSome of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 1, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statement that we may make.\nIn addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThank you, Mark. Good evening.\nWe started the year with a solid first quarter. Our results were slightly ahead of our expectations and allowed us to increase our full year 2023 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $617.3 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $610.4 million.\nForeign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $2.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nSame tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the first quarter of 2022 including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%.\nDomestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 3.4% of term. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, remained steady and it was similar to the fourth quarter.\nWe again saw balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 51% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 49%. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.\nDomestically, churn was in line with our prior quarter projections, and our full year churn expectations remain the same as we provided last quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of Sprint merger-related churn.\nInternationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 2.5% net, including 7.8% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was good again with similar results to our solid fourth quarter. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make healthy contributions to our organic growth, although these inflationary rates have begun to decline from their 2022 highs.\nIn Brazil, our largest international market, we had another good quarter, although the impact of the previously discussed agreement weighed on our first quarter same-tower organic growth. This growth rate in Brazil was 4.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.9% of churn.\nInternational churn remains elevated, but in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. Excluding consolidation-related churn, we believe 2023 will be the high watermark for international churn.\nAs a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than associated with the TIM agreement, but if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time.\nDuring the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 15.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.\nTower cash flow for the first quarter was $491 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 91.8% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $459.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter.\nDuring the first quarter, our services business had another strong quarter with $58.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million of segment operating profit. Our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter, and our services backlogs also remained healthy at quarter end.\nAdjusted funds from operations, or AFFO in the first quarter was $341.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.13, an increase of 5.7% over the first quarter of 2022. AFFO growth was hindered by increased interest rates, which are anticipated to impact growth rates throughout the year.\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to invest in our portfolio, acquiring 14 communication sites for total cash consideration of $8.6 million. During the quarter, we also built 52 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 56 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $63.7 million.\nWe anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year.\nIn addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms.\nAt the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.\nWith that, I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.9 billion of total debt and $12.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, below the low end of our target range.\nOur first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains at a strong 4.7x.\nDuring and subsequent to quarter end, we borrowed and repaid certain amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $595 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver.\nThe current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.8 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%. The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\nDuring the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock, and we currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2023, were $108.3 million.\nIn addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $93.9 million or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.85 per share, payable on June 21, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2023.\nThis dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 27% of our projected full year AFFO.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, SBA Communications Corp.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone.\nThe first quarter represented a very good start to 2023. Our team continued to execute at a very high level, and we produced solid year-over-year growth in each of our key metrics. Each of our largest U.S. customers remain busy, and they contributed relatively equally to our organic leasing activity during the quarter.\nThe focus of their activity was a balanced mix of adding equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands and infill and coverage expansion through brand-new co-locations.\nWhile we believe domestic activity in 2023 will fall below the peak levels of activity in 2022, we expect our carrier customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment over the next several years for a number of reasons. Some of the AT&T and Verizon C-band licenses will not be cleared until later this year; the C-band and 3.45 gigahertz license is won by T-Mobile have been delayed due to the lapse of the FCC spectrum authority; dual-band radios that our customers are planning to use in their deployment supporting 3.45 gigahertz and C-band frequencies have just been approved by the FCC; and dual-band radio supporting C-band and CBRS are still pending approval; and DISH will be moving forward with additional co-locations to meet their 2025 coverage requirements. We believe all of these developments will drive multiyear continued development activity.\nAlso encouraging about the prospects for future network development activity is the letter sent last week from CTIA to the White House, imploring the President to free up 1,500 megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum currently held by the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies.\nThe request is for the spectrum to be made available on a full power license basis, which obviously would have positive implications for additional macro site activity. The request from CTIA demonstrates the industry believes that more network resources will be necessary to handle increasing demand for volume, quality and new applications and to stay competitive with the rest of the world.\nJust as the last 20 years has demonstrated the need for continuous network investment, we believe the future will be the same. We believe this will provide a continued positive environment for SBA.\nInternationally, we also had a solid quarter with continued steady organic leasing activity. During the first quarter, 42% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases, and 58% came through new leases with particularly strong contributions from Tanzania and South Africa.\nBrazil also had a strong quarter, ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market as well as good-sized contributions from CPI-based escalators.\nThe integration of the GTS assets has gone very smoothly, and these assets are performing well thus far. And we have seen a stabilization in the currency exchange rate that has contributed to our increased full year outlook.\nWe remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil over the coming years as we build on our strong customer relationships and expect meaningful 5G-related investments and continued expansion of wireless services throughout the country.\nMoving on now to our balance sheet. We remain in a very strong position. As we have stated before, we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we currently participate in with extremely good access to capital.\nWith respect to the current interest rate environment, fortunately, we do not have any debt maturities until October 2024. Thus, we do not need to issue incremental debt today unless we see a compelling use of capital that we expect to be additive to long-term shareholder value.\nWe finished the quarter with 93% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations.\nOur exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we anticipate further paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year, absent other more compelling capital allocation.\nWhile our first choice for capital allocation continues to be portfolio growth, today, the market is pretty slow globally and lacking attractive opportunities. That, of course, can change quickly, and we will be ready when it does.\nWe ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range and giving us flexibility if we see value-enhancing investment opportunities.\nAs a result of our strong financial position and our optimism about our future, today, we announced our second quarter dividend consistent with our first quarter dividend, which represents a nearly 20% year-over-year increase.\nThis dividend represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFO in our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments. Our financial condition remains very strong.\nLast quarter, I mentioned the fourth quarter ratings upgrade we received from Standard & Poor's to just below investment grade. Since our last earnings release, we received another ratings increase this time from Moody's. These upgrades are indicative of the comfort the rating agencies have in the strength and stability of our underlying business.\nThe future of our business remains bright. Our customers continue to have significant network needs, and we are committed to supporting them and efficiently and effectively meeting those needs. I want to thank our customers and I want to thank our team members for the significant effort put in by all to the contribution to our shared success. We look forward to sharing with you our progress as we move throughout the balance of 2023.\nAnd with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions."

Welcome to the SBA Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nCFO & Executive VP, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. Good evening. We finished up an outstanding 2022 with another very strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2022 outlook for most metrics.\nTotal GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $609.6 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $600.5 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $800,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a benefit of $2.2 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\nSame tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 5.1% net over the fourth quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 9.3%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5% on a net basis, including 3.5% of churn.\nDomestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was not as strong as the third quarter, but still solid. We saw meaningful and balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. Full year organic leasing contributions to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our outlook provided on our prior earnings call.\nDuring the fourth quarter, amendment activity and new leases each represented 50% of our domestic bookings. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we again experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. We still expect to incur this churn and have incorporated our reduced 2022 domestic churn amount into our outlook for 2023.\nInternationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 7.6% of churn or 13% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again with similar results to our strong third quarter. 2022 was one of the strongest years in the company's history for international gross leasing activity or bookings.\nIn addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contribution from inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to the third quarter and as anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due primarily carrier consolidations and Digicel's previously announced exit from Panama.\nDuring the fourth quarter, 78.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil. With Brazil representing 15.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $485.9 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.4% or 90.9%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $460.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.1% in the quarter, again, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues and pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.1%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our Services business had another very strong quarter with $76.5 million in revenue and $19.3 million of segment operating profit. We finished 2022 with our most successful services year in company history as measured by both revenue and profit by a very wide margin. Services backlogs remain very healthy at year-end, although off the record high hit earlier in 2022. Our fourth quarter services results were again primarily driven by T-Mobile and Verizon.\nAdjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the fourth quarter was $340.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.12, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2021. AFFO results finished ahead of our prior outlook, but were still negatively impacted relative to our outlook assumptions by our early refinancing of $640 million of secured tower revenue securities in November at a higher interest rate than the retired debt.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we meaningfully expanded our portfolio acquiring 2,642 communication sites for total cash consideration of $736.7 million, which included 2,632 sites acquired from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for approximately $725 million.\nDuring the quarter, we also built 162 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 31 sites all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $23.2 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the second quarter.\nIn addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $15.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the year, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years. The land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.\nLooking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2023. Our outlook reflects continued year-over-year growth across our leasing business, including an increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments largely due to the strong new leasing activity we experienced during 2022. We also forecast significant revenue growth contributions from nonorganic additions, primarily as a result of having the assets acquired from GTS in Brazil in our results for a full year in 2023.\nIn addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2023. Domestically, the increase is mainly in connection with the anticipated Sprint-related decommissioning, some of which we had previously expected in 2022. Due to the timing shifts of some of these decommissionings, including during the fourth quarter, we are now including an estimate of $25 million to $30 million of Sprint-related churn in our full year outlook. Our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain unchanged.\nInternationally, our outlook includes increased churn as well. Including carryover impacts from Digicel in Panama and carrier consolidations in Central America. In addition, our international churn includes approximately $10 million associated with an agreement we have entered into TIM Brazil, to address their consolidation of a portion of Oi Wireless. This agreement has accelerated certain turn impacts with us in exchange for longer-term business commitments from TIM, and we believe positions us well for a long, mutually beneficial relationship with TIM. Our 2023 outlook does not include any other churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation. But if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to this that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time.\nWith regard to our Services business, our full year 2023 outlook reflects the year-over-year decline in revenues and adjusted EBITDA contribution but starts ahead of where our 2022 outlook started. If not for the phenomenal 2022 Services results, our outlook for 2023 would represent the best year for services in our company's history.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, we continue to have very healthy services backlog. And as a result, we expect another very strong year for this business. The outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today and also does not assume any share repurchases. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO does not contemplate any further financing activity in 2023, but it does assume we deploy excess cash into repayments of our outstanding revolver balance. Under this assumption, we would end the year with leverage in the mid 6x area, but we project that we would still incur approximately $36 million of increased net cash interest expense compared to 2022. Finally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of 109.6 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices. We are excited about 2023. Our customers remain active, and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals.\nBefore turning the call over to Mark, I would like to take just a moment to discuss the succession plan announced this afternoon. I'm truly honored to have been entrusted with the leadership of this tremendous company. I've had the privilege of spending the last 25 years at SBA and spending all of those years working closely with Jeff as the company has grown significantly under his leadership. Jeff has been a great friend and mentor me, and I look forward to continuing to have his counsel as Chairman of the Board.\nI'm very excited about the future of SBA. We have an amazing business that is part of a great and still growing industry. Our financial strength and very talented leadership team position us well to be a critical support to our customers and to capitalize on many future opportunities. I greatly look forward to working with the rest of the SBA team to continue rewarding shareholders and building upon the company's great legacy.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on the balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $13 billion of total debt, and $12.8 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, which is below the low end of our target range, notwithstanding our significant Brazilian GTS acquisition during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a very strong 4.7x.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the company through an existing trust, issued $850 million of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, which have an anticipated repayment date of January 11, 2028, and a final maturity date of November 9, 2052. The fixed interest rate on these securities is 6.599%. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the entire $640 million principal amount of our 2018-1C Tower Securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of March 2023 as well as to pay certain amounts outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Subsequent to quarter end, we continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts outstanding under the revolver. And as of today, we have $585 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver.\nThe current weighted average interest of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.0%. The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital to repay amounts outstanding under revolver as a result of the GTS acquisition. We currently have $504 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan.\nThe company's shares outstanding at December 31, 2022, were 108 million compared to 109 million at December 31, 2021, a reduction of 0.9%. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on March 24, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nCEO, President & Director, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. And good evening, everyone. The fourth quarter was a strong end to one of the best operational years in our history. For the full year 2022, we beat the midpoint of our original full year guidance for revenue by almost 8% for AFFO per share by 5%. We grew our tower portfolio by over 15%, including entering into a new market in Tanzania, which has gone very well. We had a very strong year for lease-up, including one of the best ever internationally. Our Services business had its best year ever, beating the midpoint of our original outlook for services revenue by 46%. And we grew and expanded our relationships with our largest customers worldwide, setting us up for a bright future.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our domestic same tower leasing revenue growth was the highest of the year. All of our largest U.S. customers remain busy during the quarter with relatively balanced contributions from each of them as they continued adding equipment to sites in support of the deployment of new spectrum bands. As evidenced by our full year 2023 outlook, we expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again this year. And we expect all of our largest customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment during 2023, although perhaps at levels slightly below the peak periods of activity we experienced in 2022. Each of the largest U.S. carriers still have significant remaining network needs. So we are confident we will see solid activity on our domestic power portfolio for years to come.\nInternationally, we ended the year with another very strong organic leasing quarter. During the fourth quarter, 60% of new business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 40% gain through new leases. International leasing activity was ahead of our internal expectations and led by strong contributions from Brazil, South Africa and Tanzania, our largest markets.\nIn 2022, Brazil had, in particular, a very strong year. Lease-up in Brazil for the year was well ahead of internal expectations, and we also had a larger-than-anticipated contribution from CPI-based escalators. We realized material portfolio growth in Brazil, primarily as a result of the GTS acquisition for which the integration is going very smoothly.\nThe foreign exchange rate fluctuations have stabilized over the last year and were actually a slight tailwind to our 2022 results. As Brendan mentioned, we recently entered into an agreement with 1 of the 3 major carriers in Brazil to address Oi consolidation issues in our broader long-term relationship, and we may do something similar with our other major customers in that market. We believe there are great opportunities for future growth in Brazil, particularly with recent 5G spectrum options as the driver.\nOne item we are watching in Brazil is always recent filing for injunctive relief from some of their debt payments. We currently expect that Oi must and will continue to pay their operational vendors, including rents to tower providers. And to date, we have had no collection issues. Our financial exposure to Oi is much reduced given the recent sale of most of their wireless operations to the other 3 mobile carriers in Brazil, with Oi representing approximately 3.5% of our total international revenue. Our sites are critical to the operation of Oi's network, and we have very long-term leases. As a result, we will likely see a little impact from this latest filing. However, we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely.\nMoving on now to our balance sheet. We remain in a very strong position. During the fourth quarter, in order to address the nearing maturity date, we completed a new 5-year ABS offering. And while the interest rate was higher than we would have liked, we were very pleased with the significant level of demand for our offering. We continue to be a preferred issuer with extremely good access to capital. While we have good access to additional debt capital, we will be very thoughtful this year when considering issuing incremental debt in the current rate environment, which would only be done for a compelling use of capital, similar to our Tanzanian GTS acquisitions 2022. With completion of this refinancing, we now do not have any debt maturities until October of 2024.\nWe finished the year with 93% of our debt fixed, keeping us largely insulated for the time being from significant interest rate fluctuations. Even with the GTS acquisition, we ended the year with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range. The strength of our operations and balance sheet and the steady growth in our cash flow allowed us to once again announce an increase of nearly 20% in our quarterly dividend. This increased dividend still represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO and our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments.\nThe strength of our business and capital structure was recently recognized by the rating agency Standard & Poor's. Since our third quarter earnings release, S&P increased our corporate rating to BB+, only one notch below investment grade. While a good development, we do not, however, have a specific goal of being an investment-grade company. Should we continue to use AFFO to pay down our revolver and reduce leverage, that would be a tactical choice to generate a guaranteed return to the higher interest rate environment compared to other uses of capital and not a change in our long-term views on the use of leverage. We would be building capacity and biding our time for the next opportunity to issue incremental debt at more attractive rates. We believe the stability and financial strength we offer provides shareholders strong opportunities for additional value creation.\nI want to end on our succession news. The Board and I have been working on succession planning for several years. We appropriately considered the pros and cons of an external search versus the appointment of an internal candidate as our next CEO. Brendan has, for many years, been growing as the leading internal candidate to be our next CEO with increasing internal and external responsibilities. We are confident we have made the right call. Brendan is an extremely talented executive, equally adept with internal and our external matters, strategy and shareholder value creation. His knowledge of SBA and our industry are (inaudible). He's well known and respected in the investment community. SBA has an extremely bright future in his hands, and I get to remain very involved and invested in that as the future Chairman of the Board.\nSo a little bit about my decision. It's been very difficult, as you can imagine, given my love for involvement with SBA for more than 25 years. But the reasons are very simple. I turned 65 this year. And I've reached a point in life where I want to do some things while I still can, but I can't do while running SBA full time. Things like spending more time with family, a growing number of grandchildren, travel, spending more time at our home in South Carolina and charity work, very basic reasons that I believe we all consider at various times in our life. With these things buying for my time and attention, it became clear that now is the right time to turn over leadership to Brendan and the next generation of our exceptional leaders.\nAs you can see from our fourth quarter results and full year 2023 outlook, I am retiring at a time when SBA's financial help and prospects are extremely strong. I want to thank all of you on this call or otherwise that have played a role in SBA's success over the years. We have accomplished a lot, and it certainly has taken the work of many. I consider myself extremely fortunate have had the opportunity to lead such a talented group of individuals as we have at SBA, and to have been able to interact and build relationships with a much larger group of customers, constituents, friends, business partners and others who have all contributed to our success.\nAnd with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nGood evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSome of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, October 31, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make.\nIn addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our third quarter results.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nCFO & Executive VP, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThank you, Mark. Good evening. We continued our very strong 2022 with another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results were well ahead of our internal expectations and have allowed us to again increase our outlook for our full year results.\nTotal GAAP site leasing revenues for the third quarter were $587.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $575.6 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but they were a headwind on comparisons to the third quarter of 2021, negatively impacting revenues by $3.3 million on a year-over-year basis.\nSame tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the third quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.9% over the third quarter of 2021, including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 9.1%. Domestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the third quarter of last year was 8% on a gross basis and 4.8% on a net basis, including 3.2% of churn.\nDomestic operational leasing activity, or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the third quarter was very solid again, with meaningful contributions from each of our largest customers. The combination of our strong third quarter leasing activity level and faster-than-anticipated commencements of new amendments have allowed us to increase for the second consecutive quarter our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease-up.\nDuring the third quarter, amendment activity represented 58% of our domestic bookings, with 42% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented over 94% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. Domestically, we also experienced less churn than we had projected due to timing of merger-related decommissionings being later than we had previously estimated. Our reduced 2022 domestic churn amounts are expected to shift to 2023.\nInternationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.4% net, including 8.4% of churn or 13.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again as we had our best quarter of the year in terms of new revenue signed up. In addition to strong customer activity levels across many of our markets, we continue to see healthy contributions from inflation-based escalators.\nIn Brazil, our largest international market, we had another very strong quarter. Same tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.6% on a constant currency basis. As anticipated, international churn remained elevated in the quarter due primarily to carrier consolidations and Digicel's previously announced exit from Panama.\nDuring the third quarter, 81.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.2% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.\nTower cash flow for the third quarter was $464.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a third quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.8% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.3% or 91.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $446.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 67.3% in the quarter, impacted slightly by outsized services revenue. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 72.2%. Approximately 95% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the third quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, our services business again produced new record level results, with $88.3 million in revenue and $22.8 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs, finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record third quarter results. Based on this backlog, our strong third quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $26 million.\nAdjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, in the third quarter was $339.4 million. AFFO per share was $3.10, an increase of 15.1% on a constant currency basis over the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 131 communication sites for total cash consideration of $54.9 million. We also built 113 new sites in the quarter.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on October 11, we closed on the previously announced acquisition from Grupo TorreSur, adding 2,632 sites in Brazil for cash consideration of $725 million. In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 34 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $28.5 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the first -- excuse me, by the end of the first quarter of next year.\nIn addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.\nBased on results and activities during and subsequent to the third quarter, we have updated our outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics due to outperformance in the third quarter, lower churn expectations as a result of timing and the earlier closing of the GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by higher interest costs and higher estimated cash taxes from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release.\nWe are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance and excited for a strong finish to 2022.\nWith that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.8x, below the low end of our target range. Our third quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3x, equaling the last 2 quarter's all-time high.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the GTS acquisition closing. As a result, as of today, we have $995 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 2.9%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4 years. The interest rate on 90% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.\nDuring the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock as we allocated capital for the closing of the Brazilian acquisition. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchased authorization remaining under our $1.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at September 30, 2022, were 108 million compared to 109.5 million at September 30, 2021, a reduction of 1.4%. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.7 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.71 a share, payable on December 15, 2022, to our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 17, 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nCEO, President & Director, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As is appropriate on Halloween, we are pleased to present a treat of an earnings report. The third quarter exceeded almost all expectations and benefited from the significant level of wireless deployment activity by our carrier customers.\nNotwithstanding the broader challenging macroeconomic environment, our business was extremely busy, and we were able to again increase our full year outlook across all key metrics. We raised our full year outlook for total revenue by $49 million after raising it by $64 million last quarter. Domestic organic contributions to leasing revenue growth in the third quarter were the highest for the year, and our outlook implies an even higher contribution in the fourth quarter. Our services business produced the highest quarterly contribution of revenue and gross profit in our history, and we again grew our services backlog. Our rate of return on invested capital was 10.6% for the quarter, the highest in at least 10 years. It really was a remarkable quarter.\nIn the U.S., each of our carrier customers remain busy during the quarter as they have throughout the year, building out their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands. T-Mobile was our most active customer during the quarter, continuing their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon, AT&T and DISH were, again, very active in the quarter, with 5G-related new lease and amendment signings.\nSite leasing revenue growth from domestic new leases and amendments has been strong this year, growing throughout the course of the year. We expect the contribution to revenue growth from domestic leases and amendments to be good again next year as well based on the strength of the organic leasing activity during 2022.\nInternationally, we had our best organic leasing quarter of the year. During the third quarter, we saw more of a shift toward upgrades at existing sites, with 63% of new business signed up in the quarter coming from amendments to existing leases and 37% coming through new leases. International leasing activity was again led by strong contributions from Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest markets. Brazil has performed very well this year. Not only has lease-up been above our internal expectations for the year, but we have also had larger contributions from CPI-based escalators while maintaining a relatively stable foreign exchange rate.\nIn addition, we closed on the previously disclosed GTS acquisition of over 2,600 sites earlier in October. The integration of these sites has only recently begun, but is proceeding smoothly and ahead of plan. As a reminder, these sites have 2.1 tenants per tower, and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum auctions in Brazil as a driver. These sites do contain some legacy Oi leases, but a smaller percentage than the rest of our portfolio.\nWith regard to Oi, we have begun conversations with some of the carriers that are absorbing the Oi wireless business to discuss potential mutually beneficial and efficient arrangements around the integration of these networks. We still anticipate total churn of approximately $20 million to $30 million associated with the Oi merger on our legacy sites, plus an additional estimate of approximately $3 million associated with the GTS or Grupo TorreSur sites. These numbers do not include any potential impact to pass-through reimbursements as those items will be neutral to tower cash flow. We also continue to produce revenue from tenancies associated with Oi's wireline business, which is unaffected by these mergers. We have a strong relationship with our Brazilian customers and look forward to working with them through this process.\nWith respect to our balance sheet due to early refinancings completed over the last few years and some well placed interest rate swaps, we have positioned ourselves well to address more challenging debt markets. We ended the third quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.8x, below our target range at our lowest level in years. And even with our large fourth quarter Brazilian tower acquisition, we expect to be at or below 7.0x at year-end. We have only 1 $640 million debt instrument maturing between now and October of 2024, representing approximately 5% of our debt outstanding. That instrument matures in March of 2023. And while interest rates are certainly higher today, we still have great access to incremental and refinancing debt capital given the strength of our cash flows.\nWe expect to refinance our pending first quarter maturity during the next several months. During periods with an elevated cost of capital and increased interest rates, it is even more imperative to continue our disciplined and opportunistic approach to investing capital. We are fortunate to be in a strong industry benefiting from the continued growth in wireless, but also having the strength of significant free cash flow generation, largely fixed cost and scaled operations. It is during times like these that we really appreciate the strength of our underlying business.\nWe're very pleased with the third quarter performance. As indicated by our updated outlook, we are also well positioned to finish out 2022 on a high note. We will be providing our initial 2023 outlook on our next quarterly earnings call. But based on this year's organic leasing activity and the significant network projects ahead of our customers, we anticipate our leasing results to continue to be strong into next year. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, focused on maximizing returns for our shareholders.\nI want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success, and we look forward to a strong finish to the year.\nAnd with that, Caroline, we are now ready for questions."

The reconciliation of and information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our second quarter results.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nCFO & Executive VP, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA continued building on our strong first quarter with an even better second quarter with across-the-board results ahead of our expectations and backlog supportive of an equally good or possibly even better second half of the year.\nTotal GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $580.2 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $570.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were largely in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter but were a tailwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $3.4 million on a year-over-year basis.\nSame tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.4% over the second quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.7% of churn. On a gross basis, same tower growth was 8.1%.\nDomestic same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.1% on a gross basis and 4.1% on a net basis, including 3% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter was very strong again and incrementally higher than the first quarter of this year.\nIn addition, our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlogs remain very healthy as well. The combination of our strong second quarter leasing activity level and our backlogs have allowed us to increase our outlook for new 2022 domestic site leasing revenue from organic lease-up.\nDuring the second quarter, amendment activity represented 66% of our domestic bookings with 34% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.\nInternationally, on a constant currency basis, same tower cash leasing revenue growth was 5.6% net, including 7.1% of churn or 12.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again and also higher than we saw in the first quarter. We continue to see strong customer activity levels in many of our markets as well as increased contributions from inflation-based escalators.\nIn Brazil, our largest international market, we had another particularly strong quarter. Same tower organic growth in Brazil was 14.2% on a constant currency basis. International churn was elevated in the quarter as anticipated, due primarily to carrier consolidations and other customer financial challenges, mainly in Guatemala and Panama.\nDuring the second quarter, 80.6% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 13.1% of consolidated cash tight leasing revenues during the quarter and 9.9% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.\nTower cash flow for the second quarter was $459.6 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.9% and an international tower cash flow margin of 67.2% or 90.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were impacted on a year-over-year basis by our new, less mature Tanzania assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $437.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.2% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 73.3%. Approximately 96% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, our services business produced record results for the fifth quarter in a row, with $71.8 million in revenue and $17.3 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlogs, finishing the quarter once again at a higher level than the prior quarter, notwithstanding our record second quarter results.\nBased on this backlog, our strong second quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $40 million.\nAdjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, in the second quarter was $335.3 million. AFFO per share was $3.07, an increase of 16.3% over the second quarter of 2021.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 210 communication sites and 1 data center in Brazil, which we previously disclosed with our first quarter results for total cash consideration of $127.3 million.\nWe also built 100 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase approximately 200 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $85 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year.\nIn addition, during the quarter, we entered into a contract with Grupo TorreSur, or GTS, to purchase their remaining approximately 2,600 tower sites in Brazil for $725 million. We anticipate closing on this acquisition during the fourth quarter of this year and expect these assets to produce approximately $68 million of tower cash flow during the first full year following closing based on our current estimates of future exchange rates.\nThese are assets we know well in a market we obviously know well, and this acquisition will be immediately accretive to AFFO per share upon closing. Jeff will share a little more about this acquisition in a moment.\nIn addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $9.9 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.\nLooking ahead now to the rest of the year. This afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook across all of our key metrics based on a combination of outperformance in the second quarter, strengthening activity levels in both services and leasing, lower churn expectations and anticipated contributions from the pending GTS acquisition. These items were partially offset by weaker foreign exchange rates and higher interest costs from the outlook previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release.\nWe are excited about the current operating environment and pleased with how our team has been able to execute in order to produce better-than-expected results and support our customers at a high level with all their network initiatives.\nWith that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $12.3 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.0x, which is at the low end of our target range. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3x, equaling last quarter, the highest in the company's history. As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.9% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.3 years, and the interest rate on 93% of our outstanding debt is fixed. And as of today, we have $480 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver.\nDuring the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock as we chose instead to pursue the Brazil acquisition. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2022, were 107.9 million compared to 109.5 million at June 30, 2021, and which is a reduction of 1.5%.\nIn addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.6 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.71 a share, an increase of 22.4% over the third quarter of last year. The dividend will be payable on September 20, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 25, 2022.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nCEO, President & Director, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had another great performance in the second quarter. All areas of our operations were very busy and executed at a very high level, producing better-than-expected financial results and setting us up well for the second half of the year. Despite higher interest rates and weaker FX rates, we have meaningfully increased our full year outlook in all areas including a $64 million increase in anticipated total revenue. Our strong results and increased outlook are driven by the current network investment initiatives around the globe.\nWhile there is a range in the degree of activity from each of our customers around the globe, collectively, they are producing very high levels of demand, which we expect will keep us very busy for the remainder of this year and well into 2023. As of this moment, we are not seeing any material adverse impact on our activity levels from supply chain, labor or COVID-19 issues.\nIn the U.S., each of our carrier customers remain busy during the quarter, signing up new leases and amendments primarily associated with the build-out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum. T-Mobile was very active during the quarter and continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T each increased their 5G-related signings with us from the first quarter, with each focused on C-band deployments and AT&T beginning to incorporate 3.45 gigahertz spectrum into their deployments as well.\nAnd DISH also contributed to the quarter, continuing to sign up new lease agreements in support of their nationwide 5G network buildout. We are excited about the upcoming 2.5 gigahertz auction, which will result in even more spectrum being deployed.\nInternationally, we also had one of our best organic leasing quarters in a while coupled with increased CPI-based escalators in a number of our markets. International leasing activity was again led by strong new leased and amendment activity in Brazil, but we also saw significant executions in a number of our other markets, including South Africa and El Salvador.\nDuring the second quarter, we signed up 51% of new international revenue through new leases and 49% through amendments to existing leases, so almost evenly balanced. The combined U.S. and international new leasing revenue signed up during the second quarter were the best we have produced in about 7 years.\nOn top of these outstanding leasing results, our services business had its best quarter in company history, producing record services revenue and margin results for the fifth quarter in a row. Our services backlog finished the quarter at its highest level ever, increasing our confidence in U.S. carrier activity for the balance of the year and allowing us to increase our services outlook by 33% over the initial guidance we provided in February. I am extremely pleased with the job our team has done to deliver outstanding support to our customers during this critical time.\nIn addition to our strong operational performance during the second quarter, we maintained our disciplined and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. This quarter, we pursued a very attractive portfolio growth opportunity evidenced by our agreement to buy the remaining 2,600 towers owned by GTS in Brazil. GTS is one of the longest tenured independent tower companies in Brazil run by industry veterans we have known and respected for many years, individuals who know how to properly run a tower company. The majority of these sites are located in Sao Paulo state, and most are located in urban or suburban areas. The sites have 2.1 tenants per tower, and we believe there are opportunities for growth, particularly with recent 5G spectrum auctions in Brazil as the driver. This will be our second acquisition of towers from GTS. We like the current dynamic in Brazil quite a bit, and we are pleased to incorporate these high-quality assets into our portfolio at a very accretive price.\nOn this portfolio, Oi and legacy Nextel leases represent 17% of the business. So while these towers present some variability around future churn outcomes, we believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize the future of these assets. This acquisition will increase SBA's total portfolio in Brazil by over 25% to over 12,500 sites, and we expect the towers will be integrated with little to no incremental SG&A expense.\nWe believe this increased size and scale will be an asset in upcoming Oi consolidation discussions and will also position us well to capture more of the necessary incremental network investment that will be required of the remaining 3 legacy MNOs. Finally, we will be able to absorb this transaction while still maintaining leverage in our target 7x to 7.5x range. We expect this will be a very complementary, value-enhancing investment in a market that we know very well.\nWith regard to our balance sheet, we remain in good position. We have only 1 debt instrument representing 5% of our outstanding debt maturing in the next 2 years. 93% of our debt is fixed rate, and our weighted average interest rate remains very low at 2.9%.\nWith respect to that 1 instrument due March 2023, our plan is to refinance that in the next 6 months as we watch and stay opportunistic around the credit markets. While incremental interest rates are higher, our access to capital remains very strong, and we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we have historically used.\nWe are really very well positioned to weather the challenging broader macro environment. In addition to our strong balance sheet, growing AFFO and the steady and growing operational environment of our industry, the majority of our largest costs are fixed or increases are capped. As a result, we believe we are not only able to withstand the current inflationary environment, but we are able to continue growing our AFFO per share, creating additional value for our shareholders.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our first half of 2022. Our team performed well against a very strong demand environment. I expect more of the same throughout the rest of the year and into 2023. I want to thank our customers and team members for their support and contributions to our success.\nI also want to take a brief moment to recognize and thank both Kurt Bagwell, our President of International; and Tom Hunt, our General Counsel, for their decades of service to SBA. Both will be retiring at the end of this year but each has left an indelible mark on SBA and the industry. I appreciate their sacrifices and contributions and wish them all the best in retirement.\nAnd with that, Moses, we are now ready for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nGood evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer.\nSome of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including, but not limited to, any guidance for 2022 and beyond. In today's press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, April 25, and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make.\nIn addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics. The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.\nWith that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.\n\nBrendan Thomas Cavanagh\n\nCFO & Executive VP, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark. Good evening. SBA started the year off with a very strong quarter with many of the results ahead of our internal expectations, and we continue to anticipate a solid performance throughout 2022. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $559.4 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $551.4 million. Foreign exchange rates were slightly ahead of our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, positively impacting revenues by approximately $2.3 million. They were also a tailwind on comparisons to the first quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $2.3 million on a year-over-year basis.\nSame-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.3% over the first quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.1% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 7.4%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 6.4% on a gross basis and 3.7% on a net basis, including 2.7% of churn.\nDomestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, was very strong again and materially higher than the first quarter of last year. And we continue to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at quarter end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout the rest of 2022. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 55% of our domestic bookings, with 45% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.\nInternationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 7% net, including 4.8% of churn or 11.8% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was very good again, and we continue to see increasing customer activity levels in many of our markets. International growth continued to climb higher, in part due to increased inflation of -- I'm sorry, in part due to increased inflation-based escalators. In Brazil, our largest international market, we also had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 13.3% on a constant currency basis.\nDuring the first quarter, 82.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 12% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.8% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $445.3 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.6% and an international tower cash flow margin of 68% or 90.3% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. International tower margins were modestly impacted by our new, less mature Tanzania assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $423.8 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.2%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter.\nDuring the first quarter, our services business produced record results for the fourth quarter in a row with $60.3 million in revenue and $14.6 million of segment operating profit. We also continue to replenish and build even higher our services backlog, finishing the quarter at the highest level in our company's history. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for increased contributions from our services business throughout the balance of 2022.\nAFFO in the first quarter was $324.3 million. AFFO per share was $2.96, an increase of 14.7% over the first quarter of 2021. During the first quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 1,807 communication sites for total cash consideration of $215.4 million, which includes 1,445 sites for $176.1 million closed on January 4 and our previously disclosed acquisition from Airtel Tanzania. We also built 86 new sites in the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 358 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $127.9 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year.\nIn addition, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of a stand-alone data center in Sao Paulo, Brazil for cash consideration of approximately $49 million. The data center currently produces approximately USD 8.3 million in annual revenue and USD 3.5 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This acquisition was done in support of our continuing evaluation and efforts around the potential expansion of mobile edge computing to our tower sites.\nIn addition to new tower and other assets, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $8.7 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 71% of our towers. And the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.\nLooking ahead now. This afternoon's earnings press release includes our updated outlook for full year 2022. We have increased our outlook for most of our key metrics from the outlook we previously provided with our prior quarter earnings release. These increases are partially due to revised expectations for better foreign currency exchange rates than previously assumed. These FX changes have contributed an increase to our revenue outlook of approximately $21 million and our adjusted EBITDA outlook of approximately $13 million.\nIn addition, we have increased the midpoint of our outlook for site leasing revenue by $17 million on a constant currency basis. This increase is due to several factors, including lower domestic churn impact during 2022 as a result of longer decommissioning cycles as compared to SBA's initial estimates, higher international CPI-based escalators, higher reimbursable and miscellaneous onetime revenue items and contributions from acquisitions completed during and after the quarter, all of which was partially offset by increased churn in Panama.\nOn April 6, Digicel Panama, one of our primary customers in Panama, announced that they intend to apply for voluntary liquidation and withdraw from the telecommunications market in Panama. While there are likely many developments and steps to take place over the coming months, we have increased our projected 2022 churn impact by approximately $6 million to account for the loss of all leasing revenue from Digicel Panama for the balance of the year. Notwithstanding this one churn issue, as noted, there were a number of very positive developments in our business over the last few months that have resulted in a significant increase in our full year revenue outlook.\nIn addition to the leasing benefits I just mentioned, we also raised the midpoint of our services revenue outlook by $27 million or over 13% due to our very strong first quarter results and the continuing strength of our backlogs. The strength of both our leasing and services business has allowed us to raise the midpoint of our full year outlook for AFFO per share by $0.24.\nOur full year 2022 outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today, and the outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the rest of the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to continue to optimize our balance sheet.\nWith that, I will now turn things over to Mark will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x, well within our target, notwithstanding a substantial amount of capital allocated in the first quarter. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.3x, the highest in the company's history. As of the end of the quarter, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.6 years, and the interest rate on 92% of our outstanding debt is fixed. As of today, we have $590 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $431.6 million at an average price per share of $332. Included in these amounts, subsequent to our previous disclosure of share buybacks in our fourth quarter earnings release, is the repurchasing of 253,000 shares for $81.6 million at an average price per share of $322.10. All the shares repurchased were retired. We currently have $504.7 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2022, were 107.8 million compared to 109.3 million at March 31, 2021, a reduction of 1.4%.\nIn addition, during the first quarter, we declared to pay a cash dividend of $76.9 million or $0.71 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.71 per share, which is an increase of 22.4% over the second quarter of last year. It's payable on June 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 19, 2022.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nCEO, President & Director, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. As you have heard, we had a very strong start to the year with strong operating and financial results, again generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. Our better-than-expected results combined with continued elevated activity levels with our customers have set us up well for the balance of this year. We have increased our outlook for full year revenues by $65 million and AFFO per share by $0.24. These upward revisions are indicative of the positive environment we are currently in.\nThe U.S. market remains particularly strong. Each of our U.S. carrier customers remained busy during the quarter signing up new leases and amendments and generally investing in the build-out of their networks through the deployment of new spectrum bands.\nT-Mobile continued their nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 megahertz spectrum. Verizon and AT&T increased their 5G-related signings with us, with particular focus on C-band-oriented deployments. And DISH continued signing up new lease agreements actively in support of their nationwide 5G network build-out. These carrier activity levels also drove meaningful U.S. services results where we produced record services revenue and margin results for the fourth quarter in a row. Our backlogs also continue to replenish and support our confidence in continued strong performance.\nInternationally, we had another strong quarter, finishing ahead of our internal expectations for organic tower leasing and new build activity in most of our markets. During the first quarter, we signed up 49% of new international revenue through new leases and 51% through amendments to existing leases. Coupled with increased escalators due to higher consumer price indexes in many of our markets, this leasing activity drove some of our strongest organic international leasing revenue growth in years. We are also off to a good start integrating our new Tanzanian operations, and we continue to build new sites and tower backlogs in the Philippines.\nIn addition, we recently acquired a new data center in Sao Paulo that we believe will allow us to more fully explore the potential for tower edge mobile computing in Brazil. We believe this data center can act as a hub for tower edge data centers and C-RAN deployments based on discussions with some of our carrier customers in Brazil. Overall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we continue to believe that 2022 will be a very good year.\nIn addition to our strong operational performance during the first quarter, we also continued to execute well with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation. We meaningfully increased our dividend and invested in significant asset additions as well as significant stock repurchases. We were able to make these investments while maintaining our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at 7.3x, right in the middle of our target range of 7 to 7.5x, and our weighted average cost of debt remains largely fixed and at our all-time low of 2.6%. We believe our ability to manage leverage while continuing to invest in our business is critical during this current time of more broadly increasing interest rates. We are well positioned to continue to grow our business, but also to weather any kind of challenging macro environment.\nWe are very pleased with our start to 2022. I'm going to keep my comments brief as I believe our results and increased outlook tell the story very well. I believe the rest of the year will be similar to the first quarter, excellent blocking and tackling on our part against a very strong demand environment. We are in a great industry during a time of increasing organic growth, and we are more financially healthy than at any time in our history. We have great confidence in the balance of the year and look forward to helping our customers achieve their ambitious network goals.\nI want to finish by again thanking our team members for their commitment and contributions to our success. And with that, Colin, we are now ready for questions."

Good evening. SBA finished 2021 with our best quarter of the year. The quarter included financial and operating results ahead of our expectations and continued strong momentum into 2022. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the fourth quarter were $539.4 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $529.8 million. Foreign exchange rates were generally in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter. They were a headwind though on comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2020, negatively impacting revenues by $2.1 million on a year-over-year basis.\nSame-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4% over the fourth quarter of 2020, including the impact of 2.7% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower growth was 6.7%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.3% on a gross basis and 3.9% on a net basis, including 2.4% of churn.\nDomestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was at its highest level of the year. This was the highest quarterly level since 2014. Even with this high level of execution, we continue to replenish our domestic new lease and new amendment application backlog, which remained very healthy at year-end. These backlogs support our expectations for continued strong domestic operational leasing activity throughout 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter, amendment activity represented 48% of our domestic bookings, with 52% coming from new leases. The big 4 carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, reported domestic site leasing revenue was slightly impacted by the timing of revenue commencements versus our internal estimates, primarily with regard to new DISH leases. This is a timing issue only as the number of leases executed exceeded our expectations.\nDuring the quarter, we also had slightly less domestic churn than our internal estimates due to delays in timing versus our prior estimates. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.3% net, including 4.4% of churn or 8.7% on a gross basis.\nInternational leasing activity increased again and was at the highest level of the year. As anticipated, the impact of international churn increased in the quarter as we began to see greater impacts from carrier consolidations and other network and contract modifications in Central America. Although there were some churn timing delays that resulted in slightly lower reported international churn for 2021 than we previously forecasted.\nIn Brazil, our largest international market, we had another solid quarter of leasing activity. Gross same-tower organic growth in Brazil was 9.8% on a constant currency basis. During the fourth quarter, 84.9% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 11.3% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 8.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.\nTower cash flow for the fourth quarter was $434.1 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with a fourth quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.1% or 91.6%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $409.1 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 69.8% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74.5%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our Tower Leasing business in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our Services business produced record results for the third quarter in a row, with $55.9 million in revenue and $12.9 million of segment operating profit.\nNotwithstanding these record results, we were able to completely replenish our services backlog, finishing the year at an equal level to our company all-time high backlog from September 30. Based on this backlog and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we are projecting another very strong contribution from our Services business in 2022.\nAFFO in the fourth quarter was $310.8 million. AFFO per share was $2.81, an increase of 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2020 on a constant currency basis.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our portfolio, acquiring 59 communication sites for total cash consideration of $38.4 million. We also built 88 new sites in the quarter, including our first 7 sites built in our new market, the Philippines. Jeff will touch on our expansion into the Philippines in a moment.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on January 4, we closed on our previously announced deal to acquire towers from Airtel Tanzania. This transaction added 1,445 sites to our tower portfolio at a cash purchase price of $176.1 million, and the impact of this transaction is fully included in our 2022 full year outlook.\nAdditionally, subsequent to year-end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 371 sites in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $137.1 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the third quarter.\nIn addition to new tower assets, we also continued to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $13.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 72% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 37 years.\nLooking ahead now, this afternoon's earnings press release includes our initial outlook for full year 2022. Our outlook reflects a significant increase in organic leasing revenue contributions from new leases and amendments. This increased organic leasing contribution is largely due to the increased pace of new leasing activity we experienced during 2021, as well as some contributions from anticipated continued strong organic leasing activity during 2022.\nOur outlook for contributions from new leases and amendments is based in part on estimates of lease commencement timing with each of our customers and shifts in the timing of equipment installations may have minor impacts on these estimates as they did in the fourth quarter. We are also projecting increases in contributions from contractual escalations. Most of the increase is projected in our international markets, where inflationary increases are expected to drive increased rental escalations.\nIn addition, our leasing revenue outlook contemplates increased impacts from customer churn in 2022. The primary increase is in connection with the anticipated Sprint-related decommissioning. Our outlook incorporates a current estimate of approximately $30 million of churn in 2022 related to legacy Sprint leases, and our previously provided estimates of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remains unchanged.\nOur total churn projections for 2022 are based in part on internal estimates of a variety of factors that can impact the timing of actual revenue C states. To the extent that there are variances from these internal estimates, there may be impacts on our reported 2022 churn. However, any differences in reported 2022 churn from these variances is a timing issue and does not change our expectations for long-term aggregate churn.\nIn addition to Sprint churn, our outlook includes increased churn in our international markets, primarily due to carrier consolidation in Central America.\nOur full year 2022 outlook includes the projected impact of the Tanzania acquisition, but it does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract today. The outlook also does not assume any share repurchases other than those completed as of today. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets or share repurchases or both during the year.\nOur outlook for net cash interest expense and for AFFO do not contemplate any further financing activity in 2022. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and our cost of debt.\nFinally, our outlook for AFFO per share is based on an assumed weighted average number of diluted common shares of $110 million, which assumption is influenced in part by estimated future share prices.\nWe are very excited about 2022. Our customers are all very active, and we expect to produce very strong results as we help them to achieve their network build-out goals.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn things back over to Mark, who will provide an update on our liquidity position and balance sheet.\n\nMark DeRussy\n\nVP of Finance, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 7.3x. Our fourth quarter Net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was 5.0x, the highest in the company's history.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the company through an existing trust issued $895 million of 1.84% Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2021-2C, which have an anticipated repayment date of April 9, 2027 and a final maturity date of October 10, 2051. In addition, $895 million of 2.593% Secured Tower Revenue Securities Series 2021-3C, which have an anticipated repayment date of October 9, 2031 and a final maturity date of October 10, 2056. The aggregate $1.79 billion of these Tower Securities have a blended interest rate of 2.27% and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 7.8 years.\nAlso during the fourth quarter, the company repaid at par the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2013-2C Tower Securities, which had an anticipated repayment date of April 11, 2023. And we also redeemed the entire aggregate $1.1 billion principal amount of the 2016 4.875% senior notes, as well as paid all premiums and costs associated with such redemption.\nAs of the end of the year, the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding debt was 2.6% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.8 years. And the interest rate on 97% of our outstanding debt is fixed. As of today, we have $560 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 786,000 shares of our common stock for $263.6 million at an average price per share of $335.26. Subsequent to year-end, we repurchased an additional 1.47 million shares for $350 million at an average price per share of $334.40. Since the beginning of 2021, we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock at an average price of $318.59 per share. All of these shares repurchased were retired. We currently have $586.4 million of repurchased authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan.\nThe company's shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 were $109 million compared to $109.8 million at December 31, 2020, a reduction of 0.8%. Pro forma for the repurchases after year-end, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7%.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $63.1 million or $0.58 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.71 per share, an increase of 22.4% over last quarter, payable on March 25, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2022. Today's dividend announcement represents a payout ratio of 25% of fourth quarter AFFO per share.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey A. Stoops\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, SBA Communications Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. We had a very strong finish to the year. again, generating double-digit percentage growth in AFFO per share. We produced record results in several categories, and we are set up well for a very strong 2022.\n2021 lease-up activity levels were ahead of plan in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. market was particularly strong with the highest level of organic new leasing revenue per tower signed up in over 7 years during the fourth quarter. T-Mobile remained extremely busy investing in their continued nationwide deployment of 2.5 gigahertz and 600 mmegahertz spectrum, DISH continued signing up a large number of new lease agreements in support of their brand-new nationwide 5G network, Verizon continued its ramp-up for their C-band deployments and AT&T remained a steady contributor. These significant activity levels have also translated into meaningful U.S. services results where we produced record services revenue and margin results for the third quarter in a row.\nDomestic activity has remained strong through the first 2 months of 2022, and both our leasing and services backlogs have remained very healthy, notwithstanding the solid fourth quarter results we produced in both segments of the business.\nBased on this backlog, commentary from our largest U.S. customers disclosing robust capital expenditure plans for 2022, and the size and scope of our customers' 5G deployment plans, we expect to continue seeing elevated domestic leasing and services activities throughout 2022 into 2023 and perhaps beyond.\nInternationally, we had our strongest leasing quarter of the year. Demand remains high in many of our largest international markets, and we expect to continue to see it remain strong throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we signed up 68% of new international revenue through new leases and 32% through amendments to existing leases. We had strong leasing results in Central America, Brazil and South Africa.\nIn addition, the recent 5G spectrum auction in Brazil and the upcoming 5G spectrum auction in South Africa, give us confidence that we will continue to see increasing network investment, and thus, leasing demand throughout our largest international markets.\nWe are also excited about the potential from our 2 newest international markets. In early January, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of over 1,400 sites from Airtel Tanzania. We believe this market has great promise for us, not only in terms of organic lease-up on our acquired sites, but also in terms of new tower build opportunities. Significant wireless investment will be needed over the upcoming years, and we are well positioned to support our customers in Tanzania and participate in the growth of wireless throughout this market.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter, we built our first brand-new greenfield sites in the Philippines. The Philippines is a market that we have studied for a number of years, and we are very excited about the prospects for favorable growth over the next few years. We have established operations in the market, opening a local office, hiring staff, working with the appropriate government agencies for all necessary permits and establishing strong positive relationships with each of the 3 major mobile network operators in the market.\nWe are initially and primarily focused on a greenfield new build strategy in the Philippines, and we anticipate the demand to support significant new tower build numbers for the next several years. We believe our significant long-standing tower operation expertise will provide meaningful value to our customers in this market and will give us a competitive advantage. I look forward to sharing results with you in the future as we continue to grow in the Philippines.\nOverall, internationally, we have a lot of very exciting things happening, and we believe 2022 will be a very good year. Throughout the last year, we have done an excellent job with regard to our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities. During the last year, we have completed a number of significant low-cost refinancings, which have meaningfully improved our balance sheet positioning, particularly ahead of a period with potentially increasing interest rates. Our early refinancing of several of our outstanding debt securities during 2021 extended out maturity dates and produced the lowest weighted average interest rate in our company's history at 2.6%. The substantial majority of our interest cost is also locked in at fixed rates.\nWe have continued to target our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage in a range of 7 to 7.5 turns, and have invested the available capital produced by that strategy into portfolio growth and share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2021, we have grown our site portfolio by over 8%, and we have repurchased 2.9 million shares of our outstanding stock.\nWe have also been able to continue to meaningfully increase our quarterly dividend today, announcing an increase in our dividend of over 22%, while still retaining over 75% of our projected AFFO for additional discretionary investment. We believe that all of these factors will be additive to AFFO per share, and as a result, shareholder value creation.\nI'd like to take a moment to reflect on full year results. They were very good. Year-over-year, we grew cash site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share by 6.3%, 6.5%, 7.6% and 13.9%, respectively. We posted industry-leading tower cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins of 81.7% and 70.5%.\nBeyond the impressive growth rates and margins, the quality of revenue and cash flow shine through backed by predominantly U.S. macro towers. In our Services segment, we had a banner year finishing 2021 with $205 million in revenue and $46 million in gross profit among the highest in company history. Each quarter throughout the year, SBA posted sequentially higher results, a reflection of the tremendous activity we're seeing from our customers with little signs of slowing. We allocated over $2 billion in 2021 and with the lion's share going towards acquisitions and new builds, share repurchases and dividends. We added 991 and 335 sites through acquisitions and new builds, respectively, in the year following that on January 4, with over 1,400 sites acquired in Tanzania.\nFinally, we published our second corporate sustainability report at the end of the year, evidencing our continued focus on and success in environmental, social and governance matters. We take great pride in our performance throughout 2021, and we are very excited about the upcoming year. The current operating environment for our industry and our internal excellence of operational execution combined to give us great confidence that we will produce very strong results this year. And I believe our full year 2022 outlook provided in today's earnings release supports that confidence.\nOur customers are all very busy, and we believe we are well positioned to help them achieve their operational and network goals. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their commitment and contributions to our success, and I look forward to sharing our 2022 results with you as we move through the year.\nAnd with that, Ryan, we are now ready for questions."

Thanks for joining our earnings call today to discuss the results for the third quarter and the first nine months 2025 with us.\nWith me today are our CEO, Yves Padrines; and our CFO, Louise Ofverstrom. Today's conference call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available at our website after the call. Additionally, you will find the quarterly report, the presentation and the press release on our Investor Relations website as well.\nBut now let's get started. So I would like to turn over to our CEO, Yves. So go ahead.\n\nYves Padrines\n\nCEO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, Stefanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 and nine months 2025 earnings call. As usual, we have prepared a short slide deck that our Chief Financial Officer, Louise Ofverstrom and I will briefly walk you through so that we have sufficient time for your questions afterwards.\nAs usual, I would like to begin the presentation with our key messages on Page #3. Q3 2025 was another very successful quarter for our company. This success once again highlights the resilience and strength of our business model and strategy. Growth remained very strong, mainly driven by our two largest segments, Design and Build. The Build segment continued with its extremely strong development in the third quarter, even despite the expected moderation of growth due to the fading temporary transition effect of the subscription transition of Bluebeam and the higher associated comparison base. The Design segment also delivered another very good quarter. In addition to a healthy underlying demand, the segment continued to benefit from very strong momentum in its subscription transition, including an additional tailwind from multiyear contracts. As we communicated previously, these contracts are used strategically and only temporary to accelerate the transition of existing maintenance customers to a subscription-based model, mainly at our Graphisoft brand.\nReflecting our performance over the first nine months of the year, we are proud of what we have achieved. Main growth driver was once again the recurring portion of our business, in particular, the very strong increase in subscription and SaaS revenues, which is clearly reflected across all our key performance indicators.\nWhen looking at the development of our EBITDA margin, it's important to keep in mind that the profitability in the first half of the year was impacted by an extraordinary nonoperating effect in the low teens million euro range, resulting from the unexpected insolvency of a service and payment provider. The foundation for this strong operational performance is the continued progress we have made across our key strategic focus areas, whether that is in agentic AI, the successful transition to subscription and SaaS or the ongoing internationalization of our business. These investments are not only paying off already today, they are also making sure the Nemetschek Group is able to show a high and profitable growth in the future.\nLastly, as a result of the very strong development in the first 9 months, we fully confirm our already increased guidance and outlook for the financial year 2025.\nOn Page #4, you see how this key message translates into the developments of our most important key financial indicators. In a nutshell, we continued the great momentum from the first half of the year also into the third quarter. The result and in line with our key strategic priority, the transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model, our reported annual recurring revenue recorded an increase of plus 22%. If we adjust for the strong FX headwind we had in the third quarter, mainly steamed from the weaker U.S. dollar, our ARR even increased by plus 26.4%. Thanks to this substantial growth in our recurring revenue base, we were able to strongly increase our revenue in Q3 by plus 15.8% on a reported basis and even by plus 20% on an FX-adjusted basis. We also delivered no promise increase in profitability, plus 25% on a reported at plus 34% on an FX-adjusted basis.\nThe EBITDA growth clearly outpaced our revenue growth in the third quarter. The corresponding EBITDA margin reached a high 32.5% despite the ongoing transition to subscription and SaaS model in the Design segment. Last but not least, our earnings per share for the quarter increased by a very strong plus 40.7% despite the acquisition-related effects, GoCanvas.\nComing to Page #5. Before I hand over to Louise, who will provide a deeper dive into our financial results, I would like to take a moment to address what is currently one of, if not the most important topic for us. I'm, of course, talking about the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence. Let me state is very clearly upfront. At the Nemetschek Group, we are deeply convinced that AI represents a tremendous opportunity for us as a vertical software company that is deeply embedded in the processes and workflows of our customers. And we have, as you know, over seven million users of our different portfolio of products across the globe. It's mainly data. Of course, artificial intelligence also plays a key role in optimizing our internal operations. For example, in software development, services and support. However, today, I want to focus on the three main levers through which we are continuously enhancing and expanding our product portfolio with AI-driven functionality to capture this huge opportunity.\nStarting with our R&D and product development activities in-house. So Nemetschek Group has been working with and developing AI technologies for several years already. However, over the past year, we have clearly doubled down and significantly increased our investment in AI to further accelerate our pace of innovation. Our deep domain expertise and close customer relationship enable us to develop cutting-edge AI products and features. At the same time, it is equally important to us that all AI activities are grounded in ethical and trustworthy principles that place the human or customers or fans at the center. And we are here to help them to become an augmented architect, an augmented engineer and augmented program managers.\nAs a result, we have already introduced several truly value-adding AI features across all our segments over the past quarters. In our Design segment, for example, we launched new features such as the AI visualizer and our groundbreaking agentic Nemetschek AI assistant, one of the first of its kind in our industry. And also across all other segments, we are making strong progress. For example, in the Build segment, recently announced Bluebeam Max, Unbound, where we had over 1,200 Bluebeam fans in Washington, D.C. and Bluebeam Max is combining the AI developments from Bluebeam with the innovative technology of our latest acquisition, Firmus AI. Integration of Firmus agentic AI-based platform into Bluebeam's PDF workflows enables early risk detection during preconstruction design reviews, increasing efficiency and helping to minimize costly work.\nIn addition to our strong internal R&D capabilities, we are also accelerating our AI road map through targeted M&A and venture investments. The already mentioned Firmus AI acquisition, along with Manufacton are strong examples of how we are using technology-driven M&A to further strengthen our position in AI-driven innovation and to complement our portfolio with leading-edge capabilities.\nOur venture approach, we are also investing in highly innovative and potentially disruptive start-ups, for example, Handoff, Reconstruct, or Document Crunch and many more, as you know. These investments give us early access to emerging technologies and also help foster and broader innovation ecosystem around the Nemetschek Group.\nOur ambitious AI road map is further strengthened with strategic partnerships, both on the commercial and also the academic side. On the commercial side, for example, we are partnering with Google Cloud to further enhance Nemetschek's position as an AI-first industry leader and to create a strong platform for continued market expansion. On the academic side, we have already been collaborating for many years with the Georg Nemetschek Institute for Artificial Intelligence for the Built World at the Technical University of Munich, TUM. We are very pleased that we announced recently in addition, we have signed strong partnership with prestigious universities such as Stanford University in the U.S. and also with NTU in Singapore.\nAll of these partnerships is to jointly advance R&D and innovation in the field of AI and to strengthen knowledge transfer between research and practice, thereby also helping to define international standards for our industry.\nYou see a lot has already happened, and this is just the beginning. We will continue to use all available levers to position the Nemetschek Group to benefit maximally from this major opportunity.\nAnd with that, I will now hand it over to Louise.\n\nLouise Ofverstrom\n\nChief Financial Officer & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, and a warm welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter as well as for the first nine months of the financial year 2025 from my side as well.\nYves has already briefly touched on some of our key financial figures. I would therefore now like to look in more detail at the most important financial aspects of our Q3 and nine months results as well as at the underlying drivers.\nAs usual, we will begin with an overview of the key financial highlights of the first nine months of our financial year 2025 on Page #7. And I would really like to underline Yves's assessment that we had a very successful first three quarters of this year with continued strong and profitable growth. And this is especially encouraging and mentionable given our ongoing transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model in the Design segment and the associated short-term accounting burden on our financial results of this during the transition.\nSo let me start with our accumulated revenue for the period from January to September, which grew by 22.9% on reported and even 25% on an FX-adjusted basis to EUR 866 million. And apart from the inorganic contribution from GoCanvas acquisition in the first half of the year, the recurring part of our business once again proved to be the main growth driver. And this clearly demonstrates the strong progress we are making in executing our strategic road map towards a subscription and SaaS-based business model. And consequently, the revenues in this category increased by an impressive 61.3% to EUR 614.7 million. And our reported EBITDA increased by 28.4% to EUR 264.3 million, and that is corresponding to a reported EBITDA margin of 30.5%.\nAnd please allow me to emphasize here that if we adjust for the extraordinary nonoperating effect due to the unexpected insolvency of a payment and service provider from the first half of the year, the underlying profitability would have been at a high 31.8%. On the right-hand side of this slide, you can also see our strong cash generation with a high cash generation up 111% as well as the continued very high quality of our balance sheet.\nIf we turn to the next slide, Page #8, you'll find an overview of the development of our four segments in the first nine months of 2025. Let me start with our Design segment, which primarily serves architectural and engineering customers throughout the globe. In Q3, the segment continues its strong growth momentum from the first half of the year. This is driven by a very strong increase in the segment subscription and SaaS revenues due to the continued successful ramp-up of the subscription transition at our Graphisoft brand. And in addition to this, growth was also partly supported by three-year contracts, although at a slightly lower level compared to recent quarters. And these contracts are being used strategically and only temporary to accelerate the migration of existing maintenance customer to a subscription-based model, mainly at the Graphisoft brand.\nFor the first nine months of the year, revenues accumulated to EUR 389.3 million, a plus of 13.1% year-on-year. And the reported EBITDA margin of 27.5% remained stable year-over-year despite the associated short-term accounting-related dampening effects of the subscription transition and the extraordinary nonoperating effect from the insolvency of the service and payment provider in the first quarter. When adjusting for the extraordinary service and payment provider effect only, the underlying EBITDA margin would have been above the prior year level despite the ongoing transition to subscription.\nSo let's continue with the development of our Build segment, which once again delivered a stellar performance in the third quarter. This was driven by sustained strong customer demand, particularly at Bluebeam. And in addition to this, GoCanvas, which has now been fully consolidated into our Build segment since Q3 2024, continued to deliver as planned. And as expected, we saw slight moderation in growth, reflecting the fading temporary elevated effect after Bluebeam's successful subscription transition and the resulting higher comparison base.\nSo after the first nine months of the year, reported growth stands at 47.2%. And adjusting for the quite strong FX headwind in the third quarter that stems from the weaker U.S. dollar, growth even reached 51.1% on a constant currency basis. The EBITDA margin on the reported level came in at a strong 35.7%. This is an increase of around 350 basis points year-on-year. And despite the dilutive effect of the GoCanvas acquisition as well as our continued investments to support the future growth of this highly dynamic segment, amongst other, as Yves said, the acquisition of the Firmus AI.\nLet's move on to our Manage segment, which recorded only a modest growth in the first half of the year. Now we saw a clear reacceleration of growth momentum in the third quarter with a plus of 7.3%. The growth in Q3 was driven by a positive momentum in new large customer orders and is clearly an effect of the measures taken to refocus and restrengthen this segment. Year-to-date, the cumulative growth now stands at 3%. And importantly, and despite continued investments into this segment's product portfolio and future growth opportunities, the margin expanded significantly to 10.5%, up from just 7.3% in the prior year.\nSo, last but not least, our Media segment, which continued to be impacted by mixed market dynamics, particularly in the important U.S. market, including somewhat cautious customer spending in some areas. The segment is also still feeling the effects of the missing subscription sales in the first half of the year following the insolvency of a payment and service provider, as we alluded to earlier in this year as well. In total, revenue in the Media segment, therefore, increased only moderately by 1.3% to EUR 89.8 million during the first 9 months of the year. However, when adjusting for the special one-off effect of the service and payment provider, the revenue growth in the first nine months would have been in the mid- to higher single-digit percentage range.\nAnd thanks to very good cost control in addition, the margin in the third quarter remained at a very high level of 37% and in line with last year. However, due to the extraordinary nonoperating effect in the first half, the reported EBITDA margin after nine months remains below the prior year level at 31.1%. And without this extraordinary nonoperating effect in the first half, the EBITDA margin would have been at the prior year level.\nLet's turn to Slide 9 that comprehensively summarizes the financial results of one of our key strategic priorities, which is, of course, the transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model. Already alluded to the fact that our recurring revenues were once again the main growth driver in the first nine months of 2025. That is really confirming the good progress of the transition we see from a license-based model to a fully recurring, and therefore, subscription-based model. As you can see on the right-hand side, this exceptional development continued also in the third quarter with an ARR growth of 26.4% and a subscription and SaaS growth of 46.4% on a currency-adjusted basis. Therefore, and fully in line with our strategy, license revenues declined by 38% year-over-year in Q3, and that is reflecting the continued shift from perpetual licenses to subscription models. As expected, this more volatile and less predictable revenue stream now accounts only for approximately 5% of our group revenues.\nBut looking at the longer-term picture at the left-hand slide of the slide here, you can clearly see the speed and the scale of our progress in building up our recurring revenue base. Over the last four years, we have seen an almost sevenfold increase in subscription and SaaS revenues, representing an impressive CAGR of over 60%. And as a result, the recurring revenues now represent 92% of total revenues. And this is a new record high for the Nemetschek Group after the first nine months of the year.\nTo conclude our review of the results for the first nine months of 2025, we provide a more comprehensive overview as you are used to, of our key P&L and cash flow items on Page #10. And as we have already discussed during the H1 call, the effects from the GoCanvas acquisition and the insolvency of a payment and service provider were clearly visible in our reported results for the first half of this year, not only in our key KPIs such as revenue growth and the EBITDA margin, but also, of course, across the main OpEx categories.\nIn the third quarter, there is no longer any bad debt impact from the service and payment provider insolvency. And the effect from the GoCanvas acquisition is now starting to normalize as we have fully consolidated the GoCanvas business for a year. And that is, of course, resulting in a more comparable base. As a result, we are now seeing a clear normalization across our main OpEx categories in Q3.\nLet me start with the largest component of our overall cost base, which is the personnel cost. We saw a reported year-on-year increase of 24% in this category in the first half of the year, and that was mainly driven by the GoCanvas addition and of course, smaller effects, as we alluded to also in the H1 call, such as reevaluation of stock appreciation rights, et cetera. And as announced already in our last earnings call, we began to see a normalization in the growth rate of personnel cost in the third quarter with an increase of only around 10%. So this underlying run rate despite our continued high top line growth reflects our healthy operational leverage and our consistent focus on operational excellence, even as we continue to invest strongly in strategic and organizational resources for our future strong growth.\nThe nonoperating effect was also the main reason behind the strong increase in other operating expenses in the first half of the year, which is clearly well above a normal level of our business. And with the growth in the mid-teens only in Q3, the growth rate came down materially versus the first half. So without the aforementioned negative payment and service provider effect and on a more comparable base in terms of additional amortization charges related to the GoCanvas acquisition as well as reduced interest cost due to our very strong deleverage after the acquisition, our earnings per share grew clearly over proportionally in the third quarter by almost 41%.\nOur underlying free cash flow generation in the third quarter was again very strong and additionally supported by favorable tax cash flows resulting from changes in the U.S. tax regime that eliminated the mandatory capitalization of development expenses for tax purposes. So looking at the development over the last nine months of -- the first nine months of the year, the very strong increase of 44.5% in our free cash flow before M&A once again underlines the very high quality of our earnings.\nFinally, and thanks to our very strong operating performance, Nemetschek maintains a strong balance sheet with an equity ratio of 44.1% and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio again below 1x. This gives us the flexibility to both continue to delever quickly, but also retain significant financial headroom for future M&A and continued investments in our business and into innovative start-ups, et cetera.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to you, Yves.\n\nYves Padrines\n\nCEO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, Louise. To wrap up our presentation, let's turn to Page #12 and to take a look at our outlook for the financial year 2025. As a result of the very strong foundation we have laid over the last three quarters, we continue to be very confident to again achieve all our financial targets for the current financial year. We, therefore, fully confirm our financial outlook for the year 2025, which we already increased with our Q2 reporting in July. In particular, that means that from today's perspective, the Executive Board expects a currency-adjusted revenue growth for the Nemetschek Group in a range between plus 20% and plus 22% for the year 2025, including an M&A-related revenue contribution from the acquisition of GoCanvas of around 400 basis points. And we, therefore, also clearly are targeting the upper end of this range for 2025. The EBITDA margin, including the dilution effect from GoCanvas, is expected to be around 31% reflecting, among other things, the extraordinary nonoperating effect from the unexpected insolvency of a service and payment provider.\nBased on our very strong fundamentals, we expect to continue our very strong path with a very attractive strong growth at a high profitability this year as well. So even despite last year high comparison base and the ongoing subscription and SaaS transition of our business model. And in the coming years, we are very confident to continue to deliver a very attractive average organic revenue growth in the mid-teens.\nAnd with that said, I would like to thank you for your attention, and we are now ready to take your questions. So operator, please, back to you."

The design segment had another very good quarter.\n\nIn addition to strong underlying development. This segment's performance also benefited from a strong momentum the subscription transition, including a stronger than anticipated demand for multiyear contracts. These contracts were strategically levered to accelerate the design segment transitioned.\n\nTo our subscription and SaaS centric business model.\n\nAnd as a results we are very pleased to report that.\n\nThe share of recurring revenues increased to a new record high of 93% at the end of the second quarter.\n\nTogether.\n\nThe strong start to the year in Q1, we had a very successful first half of the year 2025.\n\nThe main growth driver was once again, the recurring part of our business.\n\nIn particular was a very strong increase in our subscription and SaaS revenues, which is also reflected in all of our major kpis, where we reach new record levels across the board.\n\nFinally underlying profitability paid on a.\n\nThe high level, the reported group EBITDA margin with.\n\nOur next Roddenberry nonoperating effects in the low teens million Euro range.\n\nAs a result it.\n\nThe insolvency of the service and payment provider, which impacted our design and media segments. During the first half and therefore, nothing to do with our underlying strong operational developments.\n\nFoundation of strong operational performance is the continued progress we have made across our key strategic focus areas.\n\nWhether that's it is in products.\n\nNation, AI or the ongoing transition to subscription and SaaS.\n\nInvestments are not only paying off already today. They are also making sure that group is fully prepared for the next phase of growth.\n\nAnd lastly.\n\nAs a result of the strong development in the first six months.\n\nWe have raised our outlook for currency adjusted revenue growth in 2025.\n\nFrom the previously communicated range of 17% to 19%.\n\nNow plus 22 plus 22%.\n\nAs usual on page number four an overview of our key Q2 kpis.\n\nIn line with our key strategic priority.\n\nTransition to a subscription centric business model or annual recurring revenue, which includes the contribution from acquisition.\n\nThird a reported increase of plus 35, 1% and plus 38, 7% on an FX adjusted basis.\n\nHowever, if we stripped out the M&A contribution to AOR growth remained at a high level at plus 29, 4% at a constant currency basis.\n\nThis continued strong increasing they are is an important indicator for the group's revenue and cash flow growth potential in the coming months and quarters.\n\nInterest is very strong growth in our recurring revenue base reported revenue in Q2 increased significantly and plus 27, 4% on a reported as well as present, 35% on an ethics agitated phases 290 to 290 million euros.\n\nOrganic revenue in Q T substantially increased by plus 18, 9% on a reported basis.\n\nIf we adjust for the FX headwind and his team from the weaker U S. Dollar our organic revenue increased by plus 21, 6%.\n\nOur EBITDA for the quarter increased clearly over proportionally by plus 44%.\n\nTo $88 5 million Euro Keith despite the dilutive effect from our mccandless ongoing investment into the future growth of our business as well as a negative.\n\nNonoperating.\n\nFrom the PSP provider.\n\nCurrent bonding EBITDA margin reached 35 persons, we adjust for the extraordinary non operating effect due to the insolvency of the service and payment provider EBITDA margin will have reached even 31, 5%.\n\nLast but not least our earnings per share for the quarter increased under proportionally by plus 25%.\n\nthe effect from the acquisition, such as higher PPA adjustment in financing costs as well as the negative effect due to the insolvency of payments and service provider.\n\nBefore Louise will deep dive deeper into our Q2 financial result, as well as the first half of the year I would like to use this opportunity also give you an overview of the .\n\nhighlights in the first six months of the year in each of our five defined strategic focus areas on page number five.\n\nStarting on the left side.\n\nArtificial intelligence plays a pivotal role for us.\n\nImportantly in optimizing our internal processes, but also in advancing our product development to deliver even greater value for customers.\n\nIn doing so is essential to ask that all AI activities are grounded in ethical and trustworthy principles that puts the human or customers or users our fans.\n\n.\n\nOver the past quarters, we have already introduced several truly value, adding AI features into our product portfolio.\n\nThe AI visualize it.\n\nBut we are especially proud of launch of our new groundbreaking at Gentex AI assistance, one of the first of its kind in our ACO.\n\nThe AI assistance, we are building a strategic platform that fundamentally changes how users interact with our products and laid the foundation for a new generation of agent based solutions.\n\nThe assistance booked three core objectives.\n\nDriving utilization.\n\nEnabling a new user experience powered by conventional.\n\nAI for example.\n\nAnd connecting tools and brands through intelligent data interpretation.\n\nInitial use cases use cases, just product knowledge support and design compliance assistance are already live.\n\nThe next step will introduce active agents and automate workflows provide smart recommendation.\n\nAnd offer fully customizable AI experience for our users so stay tuned.\n\nOur ambitious AI roadmap is further strengthened our strategic partnership with Google Cloud positioning as an AI first industry leader and creating a strong platform continued market expansion.\n\nAs you all know.\n\nOne of the absolute priorities remain strengthening both of resilience and long term growth potential by steadily increasing the share of recurring revenues.\n\nIn particular.\n\nThrough our transition to a subscription and SaaS centric business model.\n\nI'm very pleased to say that this transition is progressing extremely well.\n\nWe're seeing very strong momentum across the group.\n\nIn the design segment, where the pace of the shift has accelerated significantly as.\n\nAs a result, we reached a new record share of recurring revenue. The group are direct results of the dynamic growth in our subscription and services business.\n\nOver the past six months, we have continued to bring our go to market approach to a new level, especially by expanding our international presence.\n\n42 fold first to make our business more resilient by reducing our dependency on the European market and second to unlock new growth opportunity for the limited group of high potential regions.\n\nThis is why we are focusing on fast growing markets like India, and Saudi Arabia, where we Offloaded launched operation in May.\n\nThe opening of , Saudi Arabia and rehab.\n\nWe started the construction sector is booming with over $1000 in Mega project part of the vision 2030 initiatives.\n\nBy expanding in India, and the Middle East, we want to be part of this enormous growth not just in the coming years, but the next phase.\n\nOur cloud platform and infrastructure.\n\nAnother corner stores.\n\nOur corporate strategy.\n\nHere, we're targeting a comprehensive ecosystem by eliminating information silos and by enabling end to end workflows.\n\nIt also helps us to better meet ever increasing.\n\nDemand connected cloud features.\n\nAs you know M&A has always been an integral part of DNA and a key driver of our long term success story.\n\nWe have a strong track record of highly successful and value accretive acquisitions.\n\nThe most recent example is larger.\n\nThe largest acquisition in history.\n\nIm very pleased to report that the integration is progressing as planned and is delivering in line with our.\n\ngrowth targets.\n\nThe strong performance gave us the confidence and capacity to continue pursuing value accretive acquisitions.\n\nAnd they include smaller bolt on deals like manufacturer who.\n\nWho is AI and data driven solution enhanced offsite construction and pre fabrication.\n\nAnd we have also prepared.\n\nFirst two larger opportunities comparable to or potentially even higher and also smaller ones. This focus on AI for example.\n\nParallel we are also pursuing a dedicated venture investment strategy over the past year. We have made several minority investment in highly innovative AI driven startup aligned perfectly with our long term AI and technology strategy.\n\nA good example is our recent investment in handles a startup whose platform use artificial intelligence to make administrative processes for construction companies.\n\nAnd at this time.\n\nIn the area of business enablement, we work on a further amortization across group.\n\nFoods continued effort to further enhance our operational excellence.\n\nTo ensure that we'll be able to continue to make the most are tremendous growth opportunities and with that and hand it over to .\n\nThank you and a warm welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter as well as the first six months of the financial year 2025 from my side as well.\n\nWell as has already touched on some of our key financial figures I will now go a little deeper and have a deeper in a bit more detail at the results.\n\nThe underlying drivers.\n\nAnd most important financial aspects of our Q2 and the first half year 2020.\n\nYes, like eight IC first half of the financial year 2025, as a strong contemplation.\n\ngroup is on the right path.\n\nHey, hi, and highly profitable.\n\nAs well as good and consistent progress in all of our strategic focus areas.\n\nPage number seven you can see a summary of the results of our strong progress in the first half of 2025.\n\nWith our reported revenue, which unlike previous here includes the contribution from the canvas the period from January to June.\n\nIt grew by 26, 8% to $572 8 million euros.\n\nAdjusted for the FX headwind.\n\nImpacted us, especially in the second quarter due to the weaker U S dollar decreased 27, 8%.\n\nEven when excluding the contribution from the cameras in the first half we achieved strong organic growth of .\n\n18, 8% or even 19, 5% on an FX adjusted basis.\n\nAs expected and fully in line with and confirming the good progress of the execution of our strategic growth.\n\nThe main growth driver was once again the recurring part of our business that is reflected in our annual recurring revenue.\n\nThe increased by 31, 5% to nearly $1 1 billion euros.\n\nThe key contributor to this dynamic various AUM development was our subscription and service revenues.\n\nby an impressive 74, 8% and reaching $403 6 million euros.\n\nOur reported EBITDA increased by 34% to $169 1 million corresponding to a reported margin of 29, 5% on an organic basis. So excluding the dilutive effects from glucan less indicate margin the EBITDA.\n\nMargin reached 31%, but let me emphasize here again, our message in Q1 that when we adjust the extraordinary nonoperating effects due to the unexpected insolvency of the payment service provider the underlying profitability would have been at very attractive high level of 31 five.\n\nPerfect.\n\nOn the right hand side of the slide you can also see continued high cash generation with a strong cash conversion of 118% as well as the very high quality of our balance sheet. Despite natural and intended year over year increase in debt as a result of the acquisition.\n\n.\n\nOn page eight let's have a look at the development of our four segments. During the first half of 2025.\n\nWith us from the less satisfied with our design segment.\n\nContinues its strong growth trajectory in the second quarter as well.\n\nFor the first six months of the year revenues accumulated 261 million euros are plus a 14, 1% year on year.\n\nIn this segment was picked.\n\nOkay, driven by subscription and SaaS revenues.\n\nWe recorded an exceptional growth of more than 100%.\n\nFollowing the successful launch of .\n\nThe subscription transition at our graph the purpose of brand at the start of this year and this is a testament to our strong progress in the transition to assess based business model also in our largest segment design.\n\nThis strong growth also reflects a stronger than anticipated demand for multiyear contracts, which are being strategically neighborhood.\n\nTo accelerate the segment's transition to a subscription based business model.\n\nReported EBITDA margin confirmed prior year levels.\n\n27, 2% despite the associated short term accounting related dampening effect on profitability of the subscription transition on the margin and despite extraordinary nonoperating effects from the insolvency of a services provider in the first quarter as I just mentioned.\n\nAdjusting for this extraordinary effect the underlying EBIT margin for the segment would be approximately 150 basis points higher.\n\nHigher and therefore, an underlying margin improvement year on year.\n\nThat has continued to the build segment and here you can see that our ending momentum from the start of the year that also.\n\nunchanged and the build segment in the second quarter.\n\nGrowth was supported by unchanged very strong customer demand on top of the lasting tailwind from the successful completion of the bleeding subscription transition at the end of 2024.\n\nOn Ireland organic basis revenue in the first half grew by a very strong 35, 6% when including contribution from unless the overall growth reached $129 2 million euros, that's an impressive plus of 61, 2%.\n\n3% at constant currency the reported EBITDA margin came in at an impressive 34, 6% and this is despite the dilutive effect of the margin and our continued investments to support the future growth in this highly dynamic segment.\n\nExcluding the impact the organic EBIT for the segment the EBITDA margin in this segment reached a very high 37, 1%.\n\nOur smallest segment manage which accounts for less than 5% of the group's revenue saw a slight increase of 1% in the first half of 2005.\n\nThe segment's growth continued to be partially negatively impacted by discontinuation of low margin Advisory service unit in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nDespite the ongoing investments into the segments business expansion as well as future strong growth opportunities then EBITDA margin expanded from 180.\n\nStandard by 190 basis points to nine 3%.\n\nAnd last but not least our media segment continued to be affected in the second quarter by the unexpected insolvency of a payment as a service provider earlier in the year and impacting by a low single digit million euro amount, while the market environment remains stable and some brand delivered a good underlying.\n\nPerformance the segment's reported revenues, therefore increased only moderately to two 1% to $59 5 million euros.\n\nThe extraordinary normal breaking affect the weighted on profitability, reducing the reported EBITDA margin to 28, 1%.\n\nHowever, when adjusting for the special one off effects revenue growth in the first six months would have been in the highest single digit percentage range.\n\nEBITDA margin at the prior year level and this again confirms that.\n\nThat Maxim continues to outperform the broader market on an underlying basis also in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs outlined at the beginning of this call the ongoing international expansion of our business remains one of our key strategic priority.\n\nSlide number nine clearly shows that we have successfully continued to strengthen.\n\nTo expand our international presence in the first six months of 2025 as well.\n\nLooking at the regional revenue development, our business outside of Europe, which includes the Americas region at 46% year on year growth Asia Pacific region at 37% were the main growth drivers over the last six months in the Americas region. The important U S market.\n\nCan you to benefit from a continued very good demand environment in particular for our bleeding brand, which continued to be our main growth driver in the region. Additionally, our growth in the region was further supported by the catalyst acquisition in July 2024.\n\nCurrently only have 10% of our revenues in Asia Pacific.\n\nAnd that remains a key focus region for our future expansion H one 2025.\n\nThis region continued to enjoy ongoing very good market conditions, and obviously huge potential in the mid to long term in southeast Asia and India in particular.\n\nAnd is supported by our recently installed new go to market offices in the region.\n\nIt's still at a strong absolute euro level, the relative share of Europe of our total revenues has steadily declined over the recent years now accounts for 46% of our group revenues.\n\nWe continue to navigate the particularly challenging German speaking market design segments, but while we only recorded this development in our domestic market Germany.\n\nOur growth in Europe outside of Germany was very promising and significantly stronger at 18% year on year.\n\nGrowth was supported by a strong performance in our bill payment in Europe, particularly I've been particularly benefit from the good progress.\n\nOur regional expansion of .\n\nWell as you can see we are starting to capitalize as well on the success of our international expansion strategy.\n\nOn the continued diversification of our global footprint.\n\nAs we move forward, we remain focused on capturing new growth opportunities are simultaneously strengthening our leading position in our key markets.\n\nNow I'll turn to what is one of my favorite slides in our tire presentation on page number 10.\n\nAnd then just showcasing our highly successful transition to a subscription and SaaS centric business model, which in turn as you know is one of our key strategic priorities for the group.\n\nAnother one of the key strategic priority is these key strategic priority for the group.\n\nThe navigate group is quite unique in that we're not transitioning our entire portfolio to subscription and SaaS centric model all at once with a one size fits all approach.\n\nWe're taking it in a structured and stepwise approach in short full success and value creation, both for our customers and for the imaging group.\n\nOne of the advantages of our brand setup.\n\nIt is clearly that it allows us to migrate in a phased approach helping to ensure that we can offer our customers an even higher value with the new model and at the same time, Mickey mitigate risks and making the short term accounting related effects on revenue and profitability on all performance easier digestible.\n\nSo looking at the left hand side of this chart you can clearly see that the speed and the scale of our progress in building up our recurring revenue base through our move to subscription and south models.\n\nEach one 2021, we have seen an almost seven fold increase subscription and sales revenues, representing an impressive cases over 60%.\n\nAs a result, the recurring revenues now represent 92% of our total revenue base.\n\nNew record high for dynamic route.\n\nAnd you can see on the right hand side. This exceptional development continued also in the second quarter with an growth of 35, 1% and the subscription and SaaS growth of 57, 3% on a reported basis.\n\nAt the same time.\n\nfully in line with the strategy the license revenues declined by 44% year over year. In Q2 reflects the continued shift from perpetual licenses to subscription models and as expected. This more volatile and that's pretty incredible revenue stream our accounts for only 5% of our total group revenues.\n\nAs usual and to conclude our revenues of the first half of 2025, we provide a more detailed overview of key P&L and cash flow items on page 11.\n\nI've already covered the impact of our on underlying performance the catalyst acquisition and the insolvency of a payment incentive provider on headline figures like revenue and EBITDA margin.\n\nLooking further down the P&L. These effects are all .\n\nin the development of our different opex categories.\n\nStarting with the personnel cost the largest component of our cost base. As you know we saw a reported year over year increase of 24, 3% in 2025. This is clearly above our normal run rate. However, when excluding the impact of the more than 300 go countless employees, who we were happy to rail.\n\nComtech group on July one 2020 for the organic increase was already significantly lower than the mid teens. Additionally.\n\nThe personnel costs in the first six months of 2025 also included and one of the effects of a revaluation of stock appreciation.\n\nWhich is part of the total compensation packages for key senior leaders of the imaging group.\n\nThe underlying run rate there.\n\nWell reflect the strong operational leverage we see in light of our strong revenue growth.\n\nReflecting both our strong focus on operational excellence.\n\nOur continued investment in strategic and operational resources and structures.\n\nEven stronger in the build segment, while we delivered exceptional growth in the first half of the year and continue to see substantial opportunities ahead.\n\nIn addition, the extraordinary nonoperating effects from the insolvency of a service and payments provider explains the 29% increase in other operating expenses and will therefore normalized during the course of the year.\n\nNow and this effect these.\n\nThese items combined with higher amortization and interest charges year on year led you to go cameras acquisition led to a more modest non adjusted EPS increase of 15, 2% in the first half of the year.\n\nOur free cash generation was again very strong despite some extraordinary effects in the Q2 cash flow.\n\nThat does go through a few such as state.\n\nU S tax remain prepayment that we had in here.\n\nHere that has shift year over year, the second quarter versus the third quarter last year with personnel bonus payments with effective payments now in Q2 as partially had that in Q1 in the previous year and the impact of the multiyear contracts in the design segment, where we see in the short term are high.\n\nPositive impact on EBITDA due to revenue recognition and cash flow due to the yearly payment structure of the multiyear contracts. Nevertheless on in some of the free cash flow before M&A.\n\nNearly 194 million euros in H, one a plus of 42, 7% and clear underpinning our high quality of earnings.\n\nAnd Lee and thanks to our very strong operating performance image it maintains a.\n\nOur balance sheet with an equity ratio of 42, 2% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio below one time this gives us the .\n\ntwo both continued to deliver quickly and to retain significant financial headroom future M&A and continued investment in innovative startups and with that.\n\nI'll hand, it back to you.\n\nThank you Louise.\n\nThe detailed overview of our financial results.\n\nSo to wrap up our presentation, let's turn to page number 13 and take a look.\n\nOur updated outlook for the financial year 2025.\n\nSo to summarize today's presentation, we had a highly successful first half of 2025.\n\nDriven by strong development in our design and segments.\n\nCrude by the very strong growth in our recurring revenues across both segments.\n\nInvestments we are making.\n\nAlong with the continued progressing our strategic focus areas in two markets internationalization and AI ops.\n\nOur.\n\nAnd we will position the limiter group to fully capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in our end markets for years to come.\n\nBut I don't see strong fundamentals of our business as well as a very good start to the year.\n\nincreased our revenue guidance for the financial year 2025.\n\nIn particular that means up from today's perspective, the executive Board expect currency adjusted revenue growth for the Limiter group, so including in a range between plus 20% and plus 22% for the year 2020.\n\nVersus 17% to 19% previously.\n\nIt includes an M&A related revenue contribution from the acquisition of Camber.\n\nOf around 450 basis points.\n\nEBITDA margin, including the dilution effects from golf Converse is still expected to be around 31 persons.\n\nCollecting.\n\nOne of the things extraordinary non operational effects the unexpected in solvency of our services and payment provider.\n\nBased on our strong fundamentals.\n\nExpect to continue our growth path with a very attractive strong growth at a profitability level in 2025 as well.\n\nThird despite two year high comparison base, the ongoing subscription SaaS transition of our business model as well as the continued challenging market conditions.\n\nAnd with that said I would like to thank you for your attention and we are now ready to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.\nToday, I'm joined by Karyn Ovelmen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Natascha Viljoen, our Chief Operating Officer; along with the rest of my executive leadership team. And we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call.\nPlease note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.\nWe have begun the year with a strong operational performance, which in turn has driven a robust financial performance. These results enabled us to generate record first quarter free cash flow and have kept us on track to deliver on our full year commitments. And last week, we also reached an important milestone for Newmont with the completion of our divestment program, positioning us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, return capital to shareholders and apply our full attention to our go-forward portfolio.\nWith the first quarter and our divestment program now under our belt, Newmont's priorities for 2025 remain clear and unchanged: first, to strengthen our safety culture; second, to stabilize our 11 managed operations; and third, to execute on capital returns.\nStarting with our safety culture. For every person who works at Newmont, safety is more than a priority, it is a core value, one that is fundamental to who we are and how we operate. In the first quarter, we saw a notable decrease in the frequency of significant potential events that we are experiencing across our business, a key lagging indicator for safety performance. This improvement was driven by visible felt leadership in the field, a more consistent application of our safety systems and an increased focus on learning from incidents and implementing corrective actions.\nOver the last year, we have been diligently undertaking a refresh of our safety work. And with the completion of our divestment program, and the clarity of our go-forward portfolio. This month, we launched Always safe, our reinvigorated safety program focused on delivering a set of prioritized improvements across our portfolio of managed operations and projects as well as our exploration and legacy sites.\nMoving to our operations. During the first quarter, we produced 1.5 million ounces of gold and 35,000 tonnes of copper, in line with our full year guidance and the indications we provided on our last earnings call. And as a consequence, we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.2 billion in free cash flow, both first quarter records.\nOn the back of safe and stable operating performance, these results were favorably impacted by the rise in gold price in recent months, driven by unprecedented volatility in our global financial and commodity markets. And although it is still early days, we are closely monitoring the evolving tariff situation and are very much focused on managing the variables that are within our control.\nI'm really pleased that we have successfully completed the divestment of all 6 of our high-quality noncore operations through the program we announced early last year. At the end of February, we finalized the sale of Musselwhite and Eleonore in Canada and Cripple Creek & Victor here in the United States. And last week, we completed the sale of Porcupine in Canada, and Akyem in Ghana. From these 5 transactions, we have now received more than $2.5 billion in after-tax cash proceeds this year. And when you combine these proceeds with those from the sale of Telfer and our other investments last year, we have generated a total of $3.2 billion in after-tax cash proceeds.\nAnd on top of that, when valued at today's prices, we have -- we now have nearly $1.2 billion in both equity and deferred consideration. This is a significant milestone for Newmont as the completion of this divestment program over the last year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on safely improving the performance of our go-forward portfolio of 11 managed operations and 3 projects in execution.\nTo further strengthen our balance sheet with $1.5 billion in debt retired over the last 12 months, including $1 billion repaid since the start of this year and to deliver on our third priority, capital returns, we have now completed approximately $2 billion in share repurchases and from our $3 billion program, including $755 million so far this year.\nBuilding upon our solid performance year-to-date and looking ahead to the rest of the year, we remain on track to achieve our 2025 commitments and progress our disciplined capital allocation priorities. As we move into the second quarter, we will continue to focus on safely generating industry-leading free cash flow, maintaining a strong financial position and investment-grade balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders with predictable dividends and ongoing share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll now turn it to Natascha to take you through our operational performance and then Karyn to take you through our financial results and capital allocation achieved. Over to you, Natascha.\n\nNatascha Viljoen\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Tom. Our first quarter operational results were in line with our previous indications, and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance. With this in mind, from an operational standpoint, we are focused on 2 simple but very important objectives. First and foremost, is continuing to strengthen our safety culture, as Tom covered at the start of his remarks. And second is executing with consistency and focus to deliver on our performance metrics.\nI will now step through the progress we made during the last quarter at each of the large long-life assets in our portfolio, starting with our Tier 1 copper gold operation, Cadia. In the first quarter, Cadia delivered consistent production whilst also successfully completing planned maintenance activities at our mall. We are continuing the transition to our new panel cave PC2-3 and expect gold and copper production to be approximately 60% weighted towards the first half of the year.\nAs factored into our guidance, we expect to continue delivering lower growth until the panel cave is fully ramped up, and the last [ store bell ] is fired in the second half of 2026. In tending to this, we are progressing the underground development for PC1-2, and we are also continuing to catch up on the historical underinvestment in both tailings remediation and storage capacity as mentioned during our last earnings call.\nAt Tanami, we focused on underground development as planned. As a direct result, we continue to expect to access higher grade stopes in the third quarter and deliver more than 30% step up in production in the second half of the year. In addition, we are also advancing the expansion project at Tanami, with the completion of the shaft and underground materials handling systems remaining on schedule. We completed the installation of expenses or in shaft barrier, which is a significant milestone for the project. The pentice allows us to isolate the lower part of the shaft from work happening in the upper portion.\nWith this barrier in place, we are able to raise for the bottom 160 meters of the shaft while concurrently fitting out the top portion with services and infrastructure without risk of harm to the people below. This is just one example of the innovative work our team is doing to safely and efficiently advance this project. Due to these efforts, we remain on track to begin commissioning of our 1.5 kilometers shaft in the first half of 2027 and reach commercial production by the second half of that year.\nAt Boddington, we completed our scheduled plant shutdown for maintenance and primarily process lower grade stockpiles in the first quarter. We continued stripping laybacks in both the North and South pits, which is expected to continue through early next year. However, by the fourth quarter, we expect to start adding higher grade gold ore from the mine to our mill feed. As a result, we anticipate a strong finish to the year from Boddington with gold production approximately 53% weighted to the second half of the year.\nShifting now to Lihir. We delivered solid gold production in the first quarter and successfully completed a total plant shutdown for maintenance, building upon 2 [ auto glide rebuilds ] last year. We expect to maintain this production momentum into the second quarter. We saw production decline slightly in the second half of the year when we begin processing lower-grade material as part of our planned mine segments.\nMoving to Penasquito. In March, we achieved a new daily record with 10,000 gold equivalent ounces produced in a single line. In the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong gold production and steady co-product production from high grades in the Penasco pit. Gold production levels are expected to remain relatively steady through the second quarter before beginning to shift to a higher proportion of silver, lead and zinc content through the third and fourth quarters and a lower proportion of gold as planned.\nAt our Ahafo Complex, Ahafo South continued to deliver strong gold production from both the Subika open pit and underground operations. We expect this trend to continue through the second quarter before we move to mining lower grade ore from the one sub bit. As we mine the last ore and complete the final size of the Subika open pit during the second quarter, we are closely monitoring and safely managing the interaction between the open pit and Subika underground mining activities beneath it.\nAnd as production from our Ahafo sales declines in the second quarter -- apologies in the second half of the year. we expect new low-cost ounces to come in from a half a North project later this year. During the first quarter, we completed the highway diversion and are preparing to commence the commissioning of the mill and processing facilities next month. We expect to pour our first gold in the second half of the year, and we look forward to declaring commercial production towards the end of the year.\nFinally, I want to touch on 2 of the emerging Tier 1 assets in our portfolio. At Cerro Negro, our focus remains on strengthening safety performance and culture at this underground mine. And although there were temporary pauses in milling during the first quarter as part of our focused efforts to improve safety, the team did an excellent job stockpiling the ore mined and positioning Cerro Negro to ramp up production in the second quarter.\nYanacocha has remained a strong performer, increasing production volumes by 13% over the last quarter, and we expect to maintain this momentum through the rest of the year, as we continue to recover ounces from the leach pads with the application of our patented injection leaching technology.\nTaking all of these factors into account and including the ounces from our non-managed assets, we continue to expect that gold production from our core portfolio will remain around 52% weighted towards the second half of the year, with approximately 24% of this year production volumes expected in the second quarter. We also continue to anticipate that capital spend from our core portfolio will remain first half weighted as indicated. And with lower-than-planned capital expenditures for the first quarter we expect sustaining capital spend at several of our global managed operations to increase in the second quarter, particularly at Cadia, where we are investing in a tailings strategy to support cave development and extend mine life, as mentioned in our last earnings call.\nI will now turn it over to Karyn for a review of our financial priorities and performance. Over to you, Karyn.\n\nKaryn F. Ovelmen\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Flowserve Corp.\n\nThanks, Natascha. Let's turn to the next slide and get started with our first quarter results. As Tom mentioned, Newmont reported strong financial results in the first quarter driven by robust production volumes and a supportive gold price environment. And gold all-in sustaining costs remained in line with our full year guidance at $1,651 per ounce for the first quarter. Taking this into account, Newmont delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and adjusted net income of $1.25 per diluted share.\nThe most significant adjustments to net income for the quarter were $0.25, primarily related to a gain from the sale of noncore assets as part of the successful completion of our divestiture program that Tom mentioned previously and $0.25 related to non-realized mark-to-market gains on equity investments and options primarily driven by an appreciation in the shares received from the sale of our Telfer operation and interest in the [ Haveron ] project. But most noteworthy, we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operations. and $1.2 billion in free cash flow, setting a new record for first quarter cash flow performance at Newmont.\nAnd these results are exclusive of the $1.7 billion in after-tax proceeds received from the divestitures completed in the first quarter and the approximate $850 million received in April. However, as we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect working capital to be adversely impacted by the regular timing of cash tax payments, which are typically highest in the second quarter, and the timing of interest payments, which are typically highest in the second and fourth quarters.\nAdditionally, we expect to pay approximately $200 million in cash taxes related to the finalization of our noncore divestments. Although the proceeds are recorded as investing activities on the statement of cash flows, these tax payments will come through as working capital adjustments. Also impacting working capital, we expect to continue ramping up spending for the water treatment plants at Yonacocha which was significantly lower than planned during the first quarter. Additionally, we expect our sustaining and development capital to increase into the second quarter compared to the first quarter, as Nitasha just mentioned.\nAnd with the recent completion of our divestiture program, our financial results will no longer include the production and associated free cash flow from our noncore operating assets, which was approximately $200 million in the first quarter. While we are pleased with our record cash flow performance during the first quarter and the strong cash flows we expect to generate in future quarters we realize that we still have work to do to improve our margins and leverage the full strength of our portfolio for the benefit of our shareholders.\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain committed to our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding cash-generative capital projects and returning capital to shareholders. Beginning with our first commitment, we maintained a strong and flexible balance sheet and ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash, above our target average of $3 billion. And it's worth noting that in addition to our cash balance, following the successful completion of our divestiture program, our equity stakes in [ Greater Gold ], Discovery Silver and our existing position in Orla Mining are now valued at over $1 billion.\nAs Tom mentioned, the proceeds generated from our noncore divestiture program have more than exceeded the initial commitment we made to the market when we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest in May of 2023. As a result, we achieved our debt target of up to $8 billion faster than originally anticipated, and we reached an outstanding principal balance of $7.8 billion as of March 31.\nTaking into account the strong gold price environment we are benefiting from today and the feedback we have received from our investors, we are continuing to assess opportunities to further reduce our outstanding debt. proactively creating a flexible and resilient balance sheet that is able to navigate the commodity price fluctuations.\nMoving to the second commitment in our capital allocation strategy. We continued to steadily reinvest in our business with the goal of generating robust free cash flow over the long term. And in the first quarter, we incurred $459 million in sustaining capital. and $323 million in development capital as we continue to advance our highest return projects from our deep organic pipeline. And as we look ahead, we expect capital spend at several of our managed operations to ramp up in the second quarter, as I just mentioned.\nAnd finally, moving to our third commitment, we continue to return capital to shareholders. We declared a fixed common first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with the past 6 quarters. And we repurchased $755 million in shares so far in 2025. And as we continue to generate free cash flow from our unmatched portfolio of Tier 1 operations, we remain well positioned to reward our shareholders with predictable dividends and ongoing share repurchases in 2025 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Tom.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Karyn. To bring it all together, we have had a safe and strong start to the year, producing 1.5 million ounces of gold, 35,000 tonnes of copper as well as 6 million ounces of silver and 59,000 tonnes of zinc, generating record first quarter free cash flow of $1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and we remain on track to achieve our 2025 guidance. We also completed our divestment program, receiving more than $2.5 billion in net cash proceeds this year.\nAnd we continue to advance our disciplined capital allocation strategy, strengthening our balance sheet with $1 billion in debt reduction as well as delivering $1 billion in shareholder returns through our predictable dividend and ongoing share repurchases so far this year. And we are very focused on ensuring that we carry this momentum into the second quarter and the remainder for 2025.\nAnd with that, I thank you for your time and turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions."

Thanks for joining our earnings call today to discuss the results for the financial year 2024 and the outlook for 2025 with us. With me today are our CFO, Yves Padrines; and our CFO, Louise Ofverstrom. Today's conference call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available at our website after the call. Additionally, you will find the annual report, the presentation and the press release on our Investor Relations website as well. But now let's get started. So I would like to turn over to our CEO, Yves.\n\nYves Padrines\n\nCEO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, Stefanie. Welcome, everyone, to our financial year 2024 earnings call. As usual, we have prepared a short but informative presentation on the highlights of the financial year 2024 that our CFO, Louis Ofverstrom and I will briefly walk you through so that we have enough time to address any questions you may have during the Q&A session.\nAs you can see on Slide #2, we have a few topics today that we would like to talk about. We'll start with a short review of the financials as well as the strategic highlights of the past year 2024, before we give you an update on the considerable progress we have already made in our transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model.\nAfter that, I will hand over to Louise, who will dig a bit deeper into important aspects of our financial results. Finally, we will also talk about our financial outlook for the current financial year 2025. After celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Nemetschek Group in 2023, we reached another significant milestone last year, the 25th anniversary of the IPO of Nemetschek SE.\nThe company's IPO in 1999 marked the start of an impressive success story. Over the past 25 years, the Nemetschek Group has grown from a small German software provider to a leading global provider of digital solutions for the AEC/O and media industries. This success story is first and foremost rooted in the strength of our operational business. And this operational strength that has made 2024 another very successful year for the Nemetschek Group despite the growing global challenges and economic uncertainties, particularly in the construction industry.\nThanks to our clear strategic direction and innovative strengths, we have mastered the challenges of the market and also further strengthened our position in our AEC/O and media industries. When we translate what I just said about our past financial year into measurable KPIs, you will see on Page #4 that we achieved or even clearly exceeded every single one of our financial goals in 2024.\nStarting at the top, the revenue growth. We had a very strong finish of the year, especially in our Design and Build segment. We finished the year with a total revenue of EUR 996 million or organic, so without the contribution of GoCanvas and currency adjusted growth ended at plus 14%, significantly above our guidance range of 10% to 11%.\nIf we look at the contribution from GoCanvas, which we consolidated as of July 1, 2024, we'll see that the acquisition has also delivered a very strong result, adding around 300 basis point to revenue growth and therefore, exactly in line with our plans. Main growth driver was once again our recurring revenue and in particular, the demand for our subscription and SaaS solution that is captured in our annual recurring revenue KPI, which grew by plus 34.6% organic, so clearly above our target of more than 25%. The same is true if we look at the ARR growth, including GoCanvas, with a growth of plus 41.9%, the increase in ARR is significantly exceeding our revised outlook of more than 30% as well.\nGroup EBITDA, including all transition and acquisition-related effects grew by plus 16.8% to EUR 301 million. The corresponding reported EBITDA margin, including GoCanvas was 30.2% as well as the organic EBITDA margin, so excluding the dilutive effect of the still lower profitability of GoCanvas and the impact of the PPA charges of 31.1% were, in both cases, slightly above the upper end of our forecast range of 29% to 30% and the revised one 30% to 31%.\nAnd last but certainly not least, the success of our subscription and SaaS strategy becomes evident by looking at the development of our recurring revenues. In line with our guidance, the share of recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue strongly increased by plus 10 percentage points year-over-year to a new record high of 86.5%. In addition to our financial highlights, you see an overview of the various strategic highlights in 2024 in each of our defined focused area on Page #5.\nStarting on the left side, artificial intelligence plays a key role in optimizing our internal processes as well as in our product development to further enhance solution of our customers. In this context, it's important to us that all our activities are based on ethical and trustworthy AI practices. To further accelerate our AI activities, we have established our AI and data innovation hub in 2024. The idea behind this hub is to drive efficiency and innovation across the entire Nemetschek Group and to create synergies.\nWhile we have again introduced multiple new AI capabilities in 2024, we will continue to add additional AI features to our solution in the future. So stay tuned. As you all know, it's virtually impossible to achieve any of the global climate targets without making the construction and operational phases of buildings more sustainable. Therefore, aim to set new standards with our leading solutions for an environmentally friendly and resource-efficient construction industry and have consequently integrated sustainability more deeply into our corporate strategy.\nOf course, one of our absolute key priorities is to further strengthen our resilience by continuing to increase the share of our recurring revenue, in particular, by transitioning to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model, already mentioned the new record high that we achieved in this area in 2024. As we want to keep you updated on the progress of one of our key strategic priorities, we'll provide a detailed update on our subscription transition in a few minutes.\nOver the last year, we also continued to improve our go-to-market strategy, for example, by further strengthening or expanding our international footprint. Our aim is to further increase our resilience, for instance, by continuing to reduce the dependency on the European market. In order to achieve this goal, we focus on higher growth regions such as North America and Asia Pacific.\nIn Q2 2024, for example, we opened our first Nemetschek India go-to-market office in Mumbai with a dedicated local team to sell multiple solutions under the Nemetschek brands. By expanding presence in the Indian market, we want to participate in the enormous growth potential of the Indian construction market in the coming years and decades. India is the third largest construction market in the world.\nGoing forward, we'll not only continue to address additional high-growth markets such as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but also continue to strengthen our cross-selling activities. Our cloud platform and infrastructure are another cornerstone of our corporate strategy. Here, we are targeting a comprehensive ecosystem by eliminating information silos and by enabling end-to-end workflows.\nThis also enables us to introduce new and innovative products such as our open data-centric digital twin solution, dTwin. As you all know, M&A has always been an integral part of Nemetschek's DNA as well as the company's tremendous success story. We are, therefore, very excited that we were able to acquire GoCanvas in July 2024.\nGoCanvas is a leading provider of field worker collaboration software that digitized traditionally paper-based processes, simplifies inspection and improves safety. It is by far the largest acquisition in our company's history and also a perfect fit for Nemetschek in terms of technology, customer base and geographic presence. And as we were already able to report in our Q3 results, integration of GoCanvas is going according to plan, and we continue to be very pleased with the operational development.\nGoing forward, M&A will remain a cornerstone of our strategy, and we'll continue to screen the market for next value-accretive acquisition that are perfect fits for portfolio. Another way to be at the [indiscernible] latest technological developments and trends in our industries is via our venture investment strategy.\nOver the last year, we again made several minority investments in a series of young and highly innovative companies. An example is Document Crunch, which uses machine learning to analyze the risk within the thousands of page of construction contracts for each project. In the light of recent events, one of their most popular feature at the moment is their tariff risk assessment tool, which analyze impact of tariffs on construction contracts and thus on projects.\nIn total, over the last 3 years, the Nemetschek Group has acquired minority stakes in more than a dozen companies that will help us to further increase our innovative strength and to cover important future topics like cloud solutions or artificial intelligence. Finally, in the area of business enablement, we work on a further harmonization across the Nemetschek Group.\nThis includes continued efforts to further enhance our operational excellence in order to ensure that we will be able to continue to make the most of our tremendous growth opportunities. Let's now focus on our main priority, our journey to a recurring business model.\nOn Slide #7, you will find a comprehensive overview of the current status of the transition. As you all know, the Nemetschek Group is quite unique in that we do not transition our entire portfolio to a subscription SaaS-centric business model all at once. One of the advantages of our brand setup is that we can migrate our portfolio in a phased and segmented approach. This not only give us substantially more control over the entire transition process, thus significantly reducing the associated risk.\nIt also makes the migration more easily digestible for our customers and users as well as for our shareholders. Furthermore, it allows us to have an individual subscription strategy for each of our segments that is tailored to their specific characteristics. As a result, transition is differently far advanced in our 4 segments. For example, migration of our Media segment is already completed for quite some time with a subscription revenue share of around 59%.\nManaged segment is also well advanced with a share of around 50% of subscription SaaS revenue. Since this segment has a structurally higher share of services and hardware revenues, we are also in the final phase of the transition here. In the Build segment, we completed the highly successful subscription transition at our Bluebeam brand at the end of 2024 and reached the [indiscernible] subscription share of 90% at our largest brands within the Nemetschek Group.\nThe transition in the Build segment was further supported by the acquisition of GoCanvas, which is already operating on a fully SaaS-based business model. Overall, at the end of last year, the segment was almost entirely based on recurring revenue with a share of [ 89% ] as well with the most of revenue coming from subscription and SaaS models. This leaves us in the Design segment, where we have now also a high portion of recurring revenues at around 80%.\nIn addition, we will significantly accelerate the segment's transition to subscription and SaaS models in 2025 with the ongoing and already well-advanced transition of Vectorworks. And that also beginning of this year selling perpetual license for new customers at Graphisoft and existing customers have until the end of this year to buy perpetual license. Allplan is also accelerating its migration to subscription business model.\nWhile we will feel the temporary accounting-related impacts at the individual brand level in the Design segment, the impact at segment and especially at group level will, however, be very digestible. So I believe it's fair to say that Nemetschek continues to be one of the very few companies that is able to show an attractive top line growth, combining with a high profitability while transitioning to a subscription SaaS-centric business model. And with that, I hand it over to you, Louise.\n\nLouise Ofverstrom\n\nChief Financial Officer & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, Louise, and a warm welcome to our earnings call for the financial year 2024 from my side as well. Well, Yves has already touched on some of our key financial figures. So I would therefore now like to look a bit more in detail at the most important financial aspects of the fourth quarter and, of course, also of the full year 2024 as well as also on the underlying drivers.\nAs usual, begin with a short overview of the last quarter on Page #9. And all in all, I really think it's fair to say that we had an exceptionally good end of the year with a very strong growth and continued high profitability. And as you will see in our segment overview in a few minutes, the strong Q4 was mainly driven by a strong development in our Design and Build segments.\nIn line with our strategic priority on transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model, our reported annual recurring revenue, which includes the contribution from our GoCanvas acquisition, recorded an increase of 41.9%. However, even if we strip out this M&A contribution of GoCanvas, the ARR growth remained at a high level with a plus of almost 35%. And as you all know, this continued strong increase in ARR is an important indicator for the group's revenue and cash flow growth potential in the coming 12 months.\nThe main growth driver was once again the revenue from our subscription and SaaS models, which grew organically by 87.6%. Including the additional revenue contribution of GoCanvas to this KPI, which is already running on a fully SaaS-based business model, as you heard from Yves, the growth even reached an impressive 102%. And thanks to this strong growth in our recurring revenue base, we were able to substantially increase our organic revenues in Q4 by 26.2% despite the unchanged challenging economic environment in our end markets as well as our ongoing subscription and SaaS transition and the associated short-term accounting-related impact on our financial results thereof.\nIncluding the contribution of Luuchanvas, the reported revenues for the months from October to December increased by 32.5% to EUR 290.9 million. Our EBITDA for the quarter increased despite our ongoing investments into the future growth of our business by 37.4% to EUR 95.1 million. The corresponding EBITDA margin reached 32.7% in the fourth quarter.\nIf we adjust for the currently still lower profitability of GoCanvas, along with the IFRS-related revenue haircuts, our organic EBITDA for the quarter reached 34.1%. The acquisition of GoCanvas and its related effects such as the increased amortization charges and interest expenses for the financing of the deal resulted in an underproportional EPS increase of 9.6% compared to our very much higher top line and EBITDA development.\nWe continue with an overview of our full year 2024 results on Page #10. And here, I would like to underline Yves assessment that we had a very successful financial year 2024 with a continued strong and profitable growth. And this is especially encouraging given our ongoing transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model and the associated short-term accounting burden on our financial results during this time and also given the continuous challenging environment in our European design markets.\nWe have already touched on the key revenue and profitability figures for the financial 2024. So I would therefore like to focus on the right-hand side of the slide, where you can see important balance sheet metrics such as the equity ratio, which is at 44.2% as well as a net debt position of EUR 295 million that showed the natural and intended increase in debt as a result of the GoCanvas acquisition and the financing thereof. And all in, a very healthy balance sheet.\nIf we look at the development of these KPIs on a quarter-on-quarter basis, though, you will see that thanks to our continued very strong cash generation, which is at almost 102%, net debt position has already improved by EUR 75 million versus the end of Q3. And similarly, the equity ratio has improved by more than 500 basis points.\nOn Page 11, you will find the development of our 4 segments during the financial year 2024. Let's start from the left with our largest segment, Design. We achieved a strong revenue growth of 13.1% to almost EUR 489 million. In particular, the fourth quarter showed a significant acceleration in growth with a plus of 27.1%, driven by a very strong business performance at year-end.\nThe last time sale of licenses to new customers as well as successful campaigns to migrate existing maintenance customers to subscription contracts at Graphisoft contributed strongly to this growth. And the EBITDA margin for our Design segment for the financial year 2024 expanded despite higher bonus payments and the simultaneous transition of the business to subscription and SaaS models to 29.6% versus 27.7% in the previous year.\nAnd as promised, also our Build segment showed a stellar performance in the fourth quarter, which reflects our largest brand within the group, Bluebeam was here coming out of the successfully completed transition of its business model to a subscription-centric business model. On an organic basis, revenues in Q4 for Build grew by 38.3%. If we add the contribution of GoCanvas, which is consolidated in this segment since July 1, the growth rate reached almost 60% in the fourth quarter.\nSo for the full year, the revenue growth of the Build segment, including GoCanvas, amounted to an impressive 28.4%. However, the segment also recorded a strong organic growth of 18%. EBITDA margin reached 31.8%, mainly here due to the dilutive effect of GoCanvas and also the continued investments into the future growth of this strongly growing segment and Bluebeam's subscription transition.\nOur smallest segment, Managed, which accounts for 5% of the group's revenue, saw a slight decline of 1.5% in the financial year 2024. However, the segment's growth was partially negatively impacted by the discontinuation of a low-margin service unit -- advisory service unit that we disposed of. Despite the continued investment into the segment's product portfolio as well as investments into future growth opportunities, the margin expanded markedly to 10.2% from just 3.6% last year.\nAnd finally, in our Media segment, revenues grew by 7.8% to EUR 120.1 million in 2024. The [ Maxon ] brand, therefore, again grew faster than the underlying market, although its business was still impacted by the ongoing [ restrained ] demand environment in the important U.S. market. The EBITDA margin in the Media segment remained at a high level and reached 35.7%. As we outlined at the beginning of this presentation, the continued internationalization of our business remains one of our key strategic priorities.\nOn Slide #12, you can clearly see that we have successfully strengthened and expanded our international presence during the course of 2024 as well. And looking at our regional revenue development, our business outside of Europe, which includes the Americas region at 24% growth and the Asia Pacific region at 28% year-on-year growth, these were the strongest growth drivers over the last 12 months.\nIn the Americas region, the important U.S. market continued to benefit from ongoing good market conditions and continue to be our main growth driver in this region. Additionally, of course, our growth in the region was further supported by the GoCanvas acquisition. With currently 10% of our group revenues, Asia Pacific remains a key focus region for future expansion. In 2024, the region continued to enjoy a continued good demand environment and offers a huge potential in markets such as India.\nAnd then to Europe, which still accounts for 49% of our group revenues, we continue to navigate the partially challenging markets in the Design segment. And while we only recorded a growth of 2.8% in our domestic market here in Germany, the growth in Europe outside of Germany was very promising and significantly stronger at 14.7%. This growth was supported by a strong performance in our Build segment in Europe, particularly from Bluebeam and a good development in our Media segment as well.\nOur internationalization strategy and the ongoing diversification of our global presence are paying off, and we will remain committed to strengthening our position in key markets while seizing new growth opportunities. Now turn to what is one of the most important strategic priorities for us here at the Nemetschek Group on Page 13.\nOur highly successful transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model. And as you can see on the right-hand side, we once again delivered exceptional growth in recurring revenues in Q4. Our annual recurring revenue, ARR, grew on a reported basis by 41.9% and on an organic basis by 34.6% year-over-year, demonstrating the strong momentum of our subscription and SaaS transition.\nExcluding maintenance contracts, which is also included in this category, the underlying subscription and SaaS growth was even higher with more than 100% growth on a reported basis. At the same time, and as expected, license revenues declined by 10.8% year-over-year, in line with our strategy and the continued shift from perpetual licenses to a subscription model.\nOn the left-hand side of this slide, we highlight the longer-term impact of this transformation. Recurring revenues now represent 87% of our total revenue base, a new record high for the Nemetschek Group. And looking at the chart, it becomes very clear what is driving this strong performance, and that is our systematic execution of the subscription-first strategy.\nEver since 2020, we have an almost sixfold increase of our subscription and SaaS revenue base, achieving an outstanding compound annual growth rate of over 50%. This strong trajectory underscores the resilience, the predictability and the long-term value creation of our business model. And we are fully focused on continuing this successful transformation, further strengthening our recurring revenue streams and driving sustainable, profitable growth.\nTo conclude our review of the results for the financial year 2024, we provide a more comprehensive overview of our key P&L and cash flow items on Page #14. As we have already addressed our reported as well as our organic revenue, ARR and EBITDA development in detail, I'd like us to look further down the P&L. You'll see that the impact from the largest acquisition in the company's history being GoCanvas is also reflected in the reported development on the various [indiscernible] categories.\nFor example, if we take a closer look of what is by far the largest driver of our cost base, our personnel costs, you will see a year-on-year increase of 12.5%. However, if we analyze the main components of this growth, you will see that after the very modest increase of just 3.8% in the first half of the year, personnel costs grew sharply by around 20% in the second half of the year. And as one would expect, the higher growth rate is the effect of the more than 300 additional GoCanvas employees who joined the Nemetschek Group on July 1, 2024.\nIf we were to strip out this additional cost, the underlying organic growth in personnel cost is significantly lower and more in line with previous years underlying the continued focus we keep on our cost base. In addition, we have also already mentioned the M&A-related reason for the underproportionate increase in EPS, in particular, the additional amortization charges as well as interest expenses as a result of the GoCanvas acquisition.\nAs we have communicated before, we initially financed GoCanvas with [ just ] over EUR 600 million, a large portion of the purchase price with new debt through a revolving credit facility as well as a bridge loan. In the fourth quarter, we refinanced this original bridge loan by issuing the first promissory note, the German Schuldschein in Nemetschek history. We are proud to report that the Schuldschein was met with very high demand from domestic and foreign investors and was highly oversubscribed.\nThe resulting successful placement of the transaction at the attractive conditions at the very lower end of the marketing range once again confirms the great confidence investors have in our strong business model and our solid financial position and in our future prospects. Looking at important balance sheet metrics as the equity ratio of 44% or the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of only around 1x, I think it's fair to say that Nemetschek still maintains a very solid balance sheet also after the GoCanvas acquisition.\nAnd in addition, thanks to our aforementioned strong operational performance as well as very strong cash flow generation capabilities, we are able to continue to very quickly delever and recreate a substantial leverage headroom for further potential M&A activities as well as investments in highly innovative start-ups. And with that, I'll hand it back to you, Yves.\n\nYves Padrines\n\nCEO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Louise. Louise has provided a very good overview of the underlying drivers that have enabled us to achieve or significantly exceed all of our targets in 2024. And it is also clear that our targets for 2025 will be even more ambitious in light of our very strong performance last year and therefore, substantially higher comparison base.\nSo before we come to the end of our presentation with our outlook for the financial year 2025, let me briefly highlight on Slide #16, why we are still so confident to reach our ambitious goals in 2025 and beyond as well. In short, the strength of our underlying operational business, which became even more diversified and thus resilient in the recent years.\nRecently, there have been a lot of discussion about the impacts from geopolitical issues, global conflicts, tariffs, inflation or a potential downturn of the global economy. While Nemetschek will not be immune in the case of a global recession, I would still like to use this opportunity to highlight on Page #16, how well diversified and resilient our business has become over the last years.\nStarting with the chart at the top. Over the last years, we have already shown that our AEC/O segments are affected by deteriorating market conditions at different points in time. This helps us to better manage a potential downturn across our portfolio. In addition, you see that we have become less dependent on a single customer group or segment, in this case, Design, which today accounts only 49% versus 59% in 2019. The increased share of the Build segment, along with our successful internationalization strategy, also resulted in a better diversified geographic exposure or put differently, we are less dependent on a single regions or countries.\nLastly, in this call, we have already discussed the perhaps most important development in recent years. The strong increase in the share of our recurring revenues, along with our high customer retention rates, this revenue provides a more stable and better plannable revenue stream even during more challenging economic conditions. Coming to the end of our presentation on Page #17.\nAfter our successful year 2024, we aim to continue our very attractive double-digit organic growth also in the coming years, further advancing also our strategic priorities. In particular, the financial year 2025, that means that from today's perspective, the Executive Board expects currency-adjusted revenue growth of the Nemetschek Group, including GoCanvas, in a range between 17% and 19%.\nThis includes an M&A-related revenue contribution from the acquisition of GoCanvas of around 350 basis points. The EBITDA margin for the Nemetschek Group, including the dilutive effect of GoCanvas, is expected to be around 31%. Please keep in mind that these figures do not yet reflect the full potential of the GoCanvas acquisition, both the revenue and EBITDA contribution in the first half of 2025 are still reduced due to the IFRS-related purchase price allocation.\nBased on our strong fundamentals and despite this year's higher comparison base, the ongoing subscription SaaS transition of our business model as well as the continued challenging market conditions, we expect to continue our growth path with a very attractive strong growth at a high profitability in 2025 as well.\nAnd with that, I would like to thank you for your attention, and we are now happy to take your questions. Operator, please back to you."

Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'm joined by our executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call.\nTurning to the next slide. Please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Before I cover our results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the important work we are doing to reinvigorate our safety systems. Following the tragic loss of 4 of our colleagues over the last year. We initiated a comprehensive systematic review of our safety and risk management systems in order to better understand the key challenges and opportunities we have to improve our safety performance going forward. Our enhanced approach includes a heightened level of diligence across our entire fatality risk management assurance model, bolstering our leadership work in the field to ensure we have a balanced approach between both the quantity and quality of our critical control verifications and an increased focus on leaders, coaching leaders and their teams aimed at building and strengthening capability through all levels of our organization. With this reinvigorated approach, we are actively driving improvements in safety performance and strengthening operational effectiveness across all of our managed operations.\nTurning now to our second quarter highlights. We delivered solid operational performance as planned, keeping us firmly on track to achieve our 2024 guidance and positioning us to deliver improving financial results. These solid results have also enabled us to progress our capital allocation priorities, which I'll touch on in a moment. With a continued focus on safely delivering, we've also made meaningful progress on the 4 key commitments we made to our shareholders at the start of the year.\nFirst, we continue to strengthen Newmont's position as the gold industry's recognized sustainability leader. During the second quarter, and as I just mentioned, we launched a safety refresh across our managed operations globally and are leveraging this important work to reinvigorate our safety systems, tools, standards and in-field leadership work. Supported by this approach, we restarted operations at Cerro Negro in late May, returning our focus to safe and efficient mining in this highly prospective district in Argentina.\nIn May, we also published our annual climate report, summarizing our performance for the sites managed by Newmont throughout 2023. Moving to our second commitment. Newmont has created a world-class portfolio focused on Tier 1 and emerging Tier 1 operations and districts. From this portfolio in the second quarter, we produced 1.6 million ounces of gold and 477,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Notably, this included 38,000 tonnes of copper for the quarter. We generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $594 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And yesterday, we announced the monetization of our [ Butte ] deferred payment obligations, and we expect to receive $153 million upon closing by September 30.\nIt is also worth noting that Newmont received $44 million associated with contingent payments from production of [ late Egil ], bringing total proceeds that we will receive this year from our former operation to $197 million. In addition, we received the first $180 million payment from the sale that we announced last quarter [ of our ] London gold financing facilities. From these 2 transactions, we will receive nearly $530 million by the end of this year. With this progress, and with the confidence we have in our divestiture program, we now expect to reach at least $2 billion from the sale of our 7 high-quality noncore assets alone. Taking all of this into account, we continue to build momentum, enabling us to advance our capital allocation priorities.\nSince our last call, we continue to safely progress the projects we have in execution from an industry-leading organic project pipeline, including the second expansion at Tanami, our [ new miner Hafa North ] and the 2 new block caves at Cadia. We have retired $250 million in debt, and we have approximately $540 million to shareholders in the form of regular dividends and share repurchases, which Karyn will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.\nTurning now to synergies. We remain firmly on track to deliver above and beyond our initial commitment of $500 million. In the second quarter, we achieved $100 million in synergies, bringing our run rate to $205 million since we closed our acquisition of [ Den Crest ] only 8 months ago. With this solid momentum, we have now disbanded our back-office integration team and remain firmly on track to achieve a $335 million run rate by the end of this year, well ahead of our initial estimates.\nLooking at the 3 components of our synergy delivery, and starting with full potential. We are now advancing into the delivery stage of the initiatives we have identified at Lihir, Cadia and Red Chris, with the largest value drivers coming from our 2 new Tier 1 assets in Lihir and Cadia. On our call last quarter, we provided an update on the opportunities we have identified at Lihir. In this quarter, I'll briefly describe some of the opportunities we see in front of us at Cadia. We recently completed our full potential diagnosis phase at Cadia, from which we have identified a series of initiatives that are expected to deliver more than $100 million of value by the end of next year.\nDuring this first phase, we had a team of experts from Newmont's Global Technical Services group working to support the site to identify opportunities to higher production and improve cash flows. As 1 example of this, and through collaboration with Boddington, Cadia is working to optimize the output from its high-pressure riding roll circuit in the mill. With these HPGR improvements, Cadia will be able to lift its mill feed by approximately 80 tonnes an hour or more than 600,000 tonnes a year, implementing the initiatives we have identified and leveraging the experience we have gained over the last 10 years with our Full Potential program. We are working with the team at Cadia to increase average mill throughput to 34 million tonnes per annum representing a meaningful step up in productivity from this world-class gold and copper asset. With Lihir, Cadia and Red Chris all now entering the delivery phase of full potential, we are on track to meet our initial $200 million commitment.\nTurning to supply chain synergies. We continue to leverage our combined scale to drive improved commercial outcomes for both pricing and terms. In the second quarter, we realized $60 million in synergies from around 40 initiatives in contracted services, mining equipment, energy, information technology among other categories. And we have a clear line of sight to reach $140 million run rate by the end of this year as we progress our commercial work across several spend categories, including chemicals, explosives, grinding media, ties, fuel, as well as spare parts and rotables.\nAnd finally, turning to G&A synergies. We have now achieved 95% of our initial $100 million commitment with an additional $15 million realized during the second quarter. The latest G&A synergies have primarily been coming from continued labor rationalization and ongoing reductions in our contractor spend. Taking these synergies into account, combined with the higher production volumes anticipated in the second half of this year, we expect to deliver lower unit costs in the third and fourth quarters. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Natascha and then on to Karyn for an update on our operational and financial performance for the quarter. Over to you, Natascha.\n\nNatascha Viljoen\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our managed operations delivered solid second quarter results in line with our expectations and outlook for the year. With a focus on [ such ] of our managed operations, we are heading into the second half of the year with confidence in our ability to deliver on our business plan and the commitments Tom reiterated earlier. And similar to the first half of the year, our operational results in the third and fourth quarters will be largely driven by reduction from our 6 managed Tier 1 operations.\nReflecting on these and beginning with Tanami, we delivered higher production in the second quarter as planned, while effectively progressing the second underground expansion. Tanami continues to be a reliable performer and remains well positioned to access higher grade stopes in the second half of the year from the[ Liberate ore ] body.\nMoving to Boddington. We reported consistent results as stripping in the North and South pits continued ahead of plan in the second quarter. And with [ flat log ] and pressure maintenance now beside us, Boddington is expected to deliver strong [ mold ] throughput and slightly higher gold and copper production in the third quarter. At Penasquito, we delivered higher gold and zinc production due to higher grades from the Chile Colorado pit and strong mill performance in the second quarter. Production levels are expected to remain steady in the third quarter with significant increase in gold production in the fourth quarter as we return to mining ore from the Penasco pit toward the end of the year.\nTurning now to Ahafo. The [ Gorski ] replacement was slightly completed ahead of schedule, and I'm really proud of the [ Halo ] team for completing this significant body of work so efficiently. The change-out spanned over 12 months and involved that fabrication of a new 6.5-meter diameter girth gear, along with the transport with more than 50 tonnes of steel all the way from Australia to Ghana. During this entire time, the team continued to optimize the processing circuit, ensuring our most productive milling circuit was able to run as efficiently as possible. Beginning in the third quarter, we expect a meaningful step-up in production from Ahafo as we will improve mill throughput, deliver consistently strong mining rates from [ Subika ] Underground and access higher grades from the [ Subika ] open pit.\nAt Cadia, we delivered solid gold and copper production as planned due to steady grades of strong bond performance in the second quarter. As flagged into our guidance, production at Cadia is expected to gradually decline through the rest of the year as we transition mining to the next panel cave, and we expect these lower grades to continue until the next panel cave is fully wrapped up. And finally, [ at Lihir ], second quarter production decreased from the first quarter primarily due to heavy [ rifle ], which contributed to soft ground conditions that in turn impacted mine sequencing. Production levels are expected to remain consistent in the third quarter as the site commences a planned 120-day shutdown of the primary autoclave.\nAnd just to bring the [ autoclave ] shutdown into perspective, the process includes not only shutting down the [ autoclave ] itself, but also removing the [ brick ] layer at [ virus ] membrane, inspecting the 5.5-meter diameter steel shell, applying a high-temperature tolerant membrane and rebricking the 48-meter long structure, which is nearly the length of a new Olympic swimming pool. Once complete, we anticipate coal production will return to normal levels in the fourth quarter, positioning Lihir for a strong finish to the year. Taking everything into account, we anticipate an increase in gold production mix quarter, setting us up to deliver Lihir's higher production in the fourth quarter.\nOur performance in the second half of the year will be driven by higher grades at Penasquito, Ahafo and Tanami, improved throughput from Lihir and Boddington, along with an expected improvement from our non-managed operations. During the second quarter, we continue to progress the 4 key projects we currently have in execution. At Ahafo North, the construction of the crusher and mill are advancing well. We have 4 the concrete foundations for the [ SAG and ball ] mills and have erected all 6 carbon in leach tanks. Earthworks continue for the tailing storage facilities, along with the pre-mine development activities for this very exciting new mine in West Africa.\nAt the second expansion at Tanami, our team remains focused on the concrete liner on the lower section of the shaft, and we continue to advance construction activities both underground and on surface. Underground, we are progressing the pressure and conveyor systems and have just safely and successfully completed boring nearly 200 cubic meters of concrete for the underground [ pressure ] chamber. On surface, we are working to complete the winder building, which will house the wasting operations for many decades to come.\nTurning to Cadia. The 2 blocks are each progressing well. We are continuing to commission 2 new [ do ] points at [ panel caves ] 2 and 3, and we are anticipating that initial caving is expected to remain by the end of the year. For panel caves 1 2, we are advancing underground development and the engineering work needed to design the crushing and material handling systems at this Tier 1 gold and copper operation. With that, I'll turn over to Karyn to cover our financial performance and the progress we are making on our capital allocation priorities.\n\nKaryn F. Ovelmen\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Flowserve Corp.\n\nThank you, Natascha. Turning to the next slide. Let's begin with a review of the financial highlights for the quarter. Building upon Tom and Natascha's remarks, Newmont delivered strong operational and financial results in the second quarter. We reported $4.4 billion of revenue at an average realized gold price of $2,347 per ounce and costs [ appoint ] to sales of $1,152 per [ bolt ] ounce an all-in sustaining cost of $1,562 an ounce, which were higher over the first quarter, primarily due to lower production volumes, higher royalties from a stronger gold price environment and increased sustaining capital this quarter due to spend on tailings work at Cadia and the planned purchase of additional trucks at Merian. Taking everything into account, we reported adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion, driven by solid production volumes and higher gold prices.\nAdjusted net income was $0.72 per diluted share and was more than 30% higher than the first quarter. The most notable adjustment to net income for the quarter was an approximately $0.20 add-back related to a noncash impairment to reflect our progress at the conclusion of Phase 1 in the divestment process for North America. As a reminder, assets that are classified as held for sale require a specific evaluation under U.S. GAAP and need to be recorded at the lower carrying value or fair value of cost to sell. And we will continue to assess the current carrying value of all assets held for sale each quarter, which may result in future adjustments until the assets are divested. It is important to note that this impairment does not reflect the future potential of these operations in their entirety or what the ultimate purchase price might be.\nWe also generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $594 million of free cash flow, which does not include the first $180 million payment received from the sale of the [ Lundin Gold ] financing facilities announced last quarter. It does include $263 million of unfavorable working capital changes, largely due to a build of stockpiles of $185 million primarily attributed to Lihir and [ Tofer ], a build in trade and other receivables of $140 million due to higher grade concentrate produced at Penasquito and the timing of sales at Cadia and $107 million of reclamation spend primarily related to the construction of the Yanacocha water treatment facilities. With $166 million in reclamation spent to date, we expect that payments will continue ramping up in the second half of the year, which will be a working capital headwind in the third and fourth quarters.\nAnd whilst we are pleased with the improvement in free cash flow, we are still not satisfied and are working to further improve margins. Looking ahead, we anticipate higher free cash flows in the second half of the year driven by increased production values and lower unit costs, as Tom and Natascha just mentioned. Heading into the second half of the year, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance of reduction, cost and capital spend. And as Natascha mentioned, production is expected to increase in the third quarter, with the year's strongest performance anticipated in the fourth quarter.\nUnit cost will be closely correlated to production with the added benefit of full potential improvements and additional synergies realized in the latter part of the year. Today, we announced 2 divestments, including the monetization of our [ Otahuhu ] deferred payment obligations and the sale of our [ Lending Gold ] financing facilities. In total, these divestitures are expected to generate nearly $530 million in gross proceeds by the end of the year. With this momentum, the benefit of higher commodity prices contributing to enhanced free cash flows and the confidence in our asset divestiture program, we were able to prioritize shareholder returns sooner than anticipated while concurrently executing on debt reductions.\nSince our last earnings call, we repurchased 5.7 million shares at an average price of $43 per share for a total cost of $250 million, including $104 million repurchased during the second quarter and $146 million in July. And we purchased $250 million in nominal debt for $227 million, or $0.90 on the dollar. Additionally, we maintained an investment-grade balance sheet and ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in total liquidity. And we declared a fixed common second quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with dividend declared for the past 2 quarters.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of the year, we will continue to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding cash-generative capital projects and returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll pass it back to Tom for closing remarks.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Karyn. At the start of this year, I outlined the 4 key commitments that we have made to our shareholders. And I'd like to end today's call with a recap of the progress we have made against them in the second quarter. First and most importantly, we commenced a systematic review of our safety and risk management systems. We safely delivered solid production as planned, keeping us firmly on track to meet our full year guidance for both ounces and costs. We announced meaningful progress on our portfolio optimization commitments with the monetization of our [ Bartel ] deferred payment obligations. We realized $100 million in synergies, bringing the total delivered to $205 million since we closed our acquisition of [ Newcrest ] in November last year. We've demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns, delivering $540 million through both regular dividends and share repurchases. And we strengthened our balance sheet with $250 million of debt reduction.\nAs we enter the second half of this year, I am confident in our ability to deliver high production, more potential improvements and additional synergies, all of which will contribute to lower unit costs in the third and fourth quarters, and execute on our portfolio optimization strategy through the divestment of our noncore assets, and to progress our capital allocation priorities, all positioning Newmont for a strong finish to this year. And with that, we thank you for your time today and turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, the event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Overman and will all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. Can I please ask you to note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. .\nBefore we begin today, I'd like to take a moment to remember the 3 colleagues who sadly lost their lives working for Newmont this year. Mike Kabeda Morrison or Koby, as he was known to his friends and colleagues with a dedicated and hard-working member of our Ahafo North project team and a natural leader. Koby was a son, a husband, a father a dear friend to many and he'll be greatly missed.\nRosana was daughter, a wife and a father 2 young daughter. Civil engineer Rosana was part of the original team that developed Cerro Negro 11 years ago and had aspirations to soon become a part type pharma in Argentina. And Daniel a son, a father to 2 young boys, a partner and a brother. He has been described by his colleagues as a strong team member with ambitions to further develop his career in mining.\nThe investigations into these tragic incidents have been led by 2 of our managing directors from different business units. With the support of teams of subject matter experts, to ensure that we truly understand the cause of the incidents. Our response will include implementing both immediate measures from early observations from the investigations as well as taking a structured approach to reinvigorate our safety systems, tools and in-field leadership activities that will all have a heavy focus on the quality of application.\nSadly, these recent incidents are a stark reminder of the need to maintain discipline and a relentless focus on safety fundamentals. The loss of added Kennedy, Cole, Rosana and Daniel over the past 6 months has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we will continue to challenge ourselves to ensure that everyone working in our business goes home safely to their loved ones.\nTurning to our quarterly results. We are firmly on track to deliver our 2024 guidance. We are pleased with our operational performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering consistent results as guided over the remainder of this year and beyond. I also want to reiterate the 4 key commitments that we have made to our shareholders. We continue to make progress on these commitments, and I'd like to provide a brief update on our first quarter achievements.\nStarting, we're strengthening Newmont's position as the gold industry is recognized sustainability leader. Last week, Newmont published our 20th Annual Sustainability Report along with our third annual taxes and royalties contribution report, both providing a detailed and transparent look at our values-driven approach to sustainability, and the economic contributions we made in the jurisdictions and communities that we operate in. With this sustainable foundation in place, we have created the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions.\nAnd from this portfolio, we produced 1.7 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,439 an ounce in the first quarter. We continue to expect these unit costs to improve throughout the year driven by both higher production in the second half and the delivery of synergies. I'd also note that in the first quarter, our go-forward Tier 1 portfolio produced 1.4 million ounces of gold at $1,378 an ounce.\nOur Tier 1 portfolio also produced over 480,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc and included in this number is the 35,000 tonnes of copper that we produced and sold. We generated $776 million of cash flow from operating activities in Q1, including a $666 million reduction from working capital which Karyn will cover in a few minutes.\nAnd when we exclude the $291 million onetime stamp duty payment we made in February in connection with our acquisition of Newcrest free cash flow for the quarter would have been $217 million. Our second quarter production and costs are expected to remain relatively consistent with the first quarter. And we continue to expect that our gold production will be weighted to around 53% in the second half of the year, remaining firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance on both production and cost basis.\nIn the first quarter, we also continued to progress the divestment of our 6 high-quality noncore assets this year. And this morning, we announced the sale of our London gold financing facilities, generating $330 million in cash proceeds and furthering our commitment to maximizing shareholder value by monetizing our noncore assets. We continue to maintain our exposure to Fruta del Norte through our equity interest in London Gold.\nUnderpinned by the industry's strongest portfolio of gold and copper assets, we remain committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. As part of this, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We refinanced approximately $2 billion in debt related to the Newcrest acquisition. And we continue to advance our 4 key projects we have in execution, our second expansion at Tanami our new mine, North and at 2 new block caves at Cadia.\nAnd finally, turning to synergies. We remain firmly on track to deliver on our commitments. In the first quarter, we achieved $56 million in synergies, bringing the total delivered to $105 million since we closed our acquisition of Newcrest in November last year and building solid momentum towards our commitment of delivering a $500 million synergy run rate by the 1st of January 2026.\nWe have identified a series of initiatives, each with action plans and dedicated resources in place that have us on track to achieve a $335 million run rate by the end of this year, representing 2/3 of our $500 million synergy commitment and well ahead of the run rate we estimated when we announced this commitment in May of last year. Beginning with the core of this value delivery, we are seeing great opportunities emerging from our full potential work and we are just getting started.\nAt we recently completed the first phase of full potential from which we have identified initiatives that will deliver more than $150 million of value close to double the synergy target we allocated to this new Tier 1 operation in our portfolio. I've just returned from and the key to extracting this value will be simplification following a very similar approach to the 1 we used at Penasquito 5 years ago. We have key members of our Newmont technical team on the ground in P&G supporting the site team to work on simplifying operations by focusing on the areas that would genuinely move the needle and stopping the nonvalue activities that have historically played this operation.\nOne example of this work is the work we are doing to debottleneck the materials handling and crushing circuits, which have been limited by the years different oil properties, resulting in downtime from spillage, block shoots and block crushes. From this initiative alone, we expect to improve mill throughput and generate over $50 million in annual cash flow improvements and the future waves of opportunities already identified at Lihir we remain very excited about the untapped potential at this Q1 operation.\nWe are also well into the first phase of our full potential work at Cadia, Red Chris and Brucejack and have already identified several high-value opportunities that we will progress in parallel with the initiatives now underway at Lihir. For our supply chain synergies we have already realized close to $30 million from negotiating more favorable terms and pricing for materials and equipment as well as first consolidating and then renegotiating service contracts. As we look ahead, we will continue to work closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our unmatched scale and global partnerships to seek improvements through negotiations and tenders over the course of the year.\nThen turning to G&A. We have already achieved over 80% of the synergies that we committed to and we expect to exceed our $100 million G&A commitment by the end of this year. Most of our G&A synergies are coming from employee and contractor rationalization as we expected and to a lesser extent, from reductions in insurance premiums and other administrative fees. We look forward to realizing the significant production and cost benefits from our synergy work and we will continue to provide you with updates on our progress each quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll now pass to Natascha and then Karyn for an update on our operational and financial performance for the quarter. Over to you, Natascha.\n\nNatascha Viljoen\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. After the loss of our colleagues at Ahafo North and Cerro Negro, Tom and I have spent time at these 2 sites. And with the project operational and investigations teams to get a firsthand understanding of the incidents to inform our global response to address our safety performance. In addition to Ahafo North and Cerro Negro, I had the privilege of visiting 5 of our 6 managed Tier 1 operations and spend time with our colleagues at Burlington, Achim, Ahafo and Lihir as well as Yanacocha and Merian.\nOur operations delivered a strong first quarter performance in line with our business plan and outlook for the year. With full potential underway at many of our sites, we remain confident in our ability to deliver safe and efficient production keeping us on track to deliver on the commitments Tom just described. I will cover the first quarter performance and outlook for our Tier 1 operations, starting with Tanami.\nTanami achieved planned production for the quarter and despite the heavy wet season in the Northern Territory that resulted in a 6-week closure of the Tanami track. In the first quarter, Tanami delivered higher tonnes mined from deeper underground and successfully completed its planned mold shutdown, positioning the site to deliver at least a 20% increase in gold production in the second quarter compared to the first.\nAt Boddington, the stripping of the current laybacks in both the North and South pits, continued to ramp up in the first quarter an investment that will bring forward stronger gold and copper grades starting in 2026. Total material moved increased over the fourth quarter due to improved tonnes mined and higher shovel productivity through the introduction of double-sided loading for our autonomous truck fleet, representing a major milestone for this ore fleet as the performance of this technology continues to go from strength to strength.\nPenasquito delivered strong silver and lead production from Colorado that's in the first quarter, as wise stripping continues to progress in the Penasco pit as previously indicated. As a result and as planned, we continue to expect gold production to be around 60% weighted towards the second half of the year at this world-class polymetallic mine. As we return to mining ore from the Penasco pit towards the end of the year, we will have access to these higher gold in the fourth quarter and into next year.\nAt Ahafo, we continue to optimize the processing circuit in the first quarter achieving a 37% increase in mill throughput compared to the prior quarter. The newly fabricated gear for 1 of the 2 SAG mills has arrived on site and we remain on track replies this year in by of this year. Once the new is commissioned, we anticipate a 10- to 20-day ramp-up period to reach full processing rights resulting in even stronger production levels at Ahafo into the second half of the year. Galia continued to deliver strong gold and copper grades from the in the first quarter. However, as factored into our guidance, these growths are expected to gradually decline over the remainder of the year as we transition from mining this cave to Panel Cave 2 3. And the work we are doing on both tailings rectification and expansion at Cadia, as mentioned last quarter is progressing well.\nTom and I visited a year in early April, and we're impressed with the team's dedication and understanding and then implementing full potential work. As Tom said, this work will focus on simplifying the operation and being clear on the highest value option that will drive stability through the mining value chain. In addition, I want to flag that the largest of our 4 auto at Lihir will come down in quarter 3 for planned maintenance. This shutdown is included in our guidance. During the first quarter, we continued to progress the 4 key projects we currently have in execution. we are advancing the construction of the processing plant and mine service facilities, along with wide stripping activities to allow the mining of ore to commence towards the end of this year. We are diligently focused on progressing the project safely and efficiently and looking forward to delivering new low-cost ounces in the second half of 2025.\nAt the second expansion of Tanami our focus is on safely lining the lowest section of the shaft. And as you can see in the photo, we also continued to progress the construction of the underground infrastructure, including pouring the concrete foundation for the crusher chamber during the first quarter. The 2 block at Cadia are both progressing well. We are advancing cave development to bring production online at Panel 2 3, and we are progressing underground development work for Panel Cave 1 2.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Karyn to cover our financial performance and capital allocation priorities for the remainder of the year. Thank you Natascha.\n\nKaryn Ovelmen\n\nAI Assigned\n\nLet's get started with a review of the financial highlights for the quarter. Newmont delivered solid first quarter earnings, driven by strong production volumes and favorable metal prices. And as a reminder, results included only 2 months of our equity investment in Lundin Gold, which is accounted for 1 quarter in arrears.\nIn the first quarter, Newmont delivered $4 billion in revenue, at an average realized gold price of $2,090 per ounce and copper price of $3.72 per pound. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion, and adjusted net income of $0.55 per diluted share. The most notable adjustment to net income for the quarter was a $0.43 add-back related to noncash impairments, noncore assets that were classified as held for sale as of March 31.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, assets that are classified as held-for-sale require a specific evaluation and need to be recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. As a result of this evaluation, Newmont realized a noncash loss on assets held for sale, including the associated tax impact, of $485 million, primarily related to the Coffee project as opposed to assets that are currently operational.\nAs I indicated on our previous call, we anticipated minimal free cash flow in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of production and payments. We generated over $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter before a working capital reduction of $666 million. These changes in working capital included a onetime payment of $291 million related to stamp duty tax stemming from the acquisition of Newcrest, which was accrued for last year.\nThe building stockpiles primarily at our newly acquired sites of $193 million. a build in accounts receivable of $84 million, largely due to the ramp-up of operations at Penasquito in the first quarter and the timing of concentrate sales, and $59 million of reclamation spend primarily related to the construction of the Yanacocha water treatment facilities.\nYanacocha's ongoing closure advanced to the feasibility state at the end of last year and continues to address several complex closure issues, including water management, social impacts and tailings. This long-term water management solution will replace 5 existing water treatment facilities with 2. We commenced our construction of the Yanacocha water treatment plants as planned this quarter and expect spending to ramp up throughout the year and continue to adversely impact working capital.\nHistorically, Newmont's stand-alone reclamation spend averaged around $200 million to $300 million per annum, but we expect to spend around $600 million in 2024 and peak around $700 million in 2025 before beginning to decline in 2026. As previously mentioned, the first half of the year traditionally tends to produce adverse working capital changes. And this normal trend is expected to continue into the second quarter but with a slightly lower impact due to the regular timing of cash tax and interest payments.\nProduction also weighted toward the second half of the year, we anticipate that the majority of our cash flow after working capital will be realized in the third and fourth quarter. positioning Newmont for a stronger second half of the year from both an earnings and cash flow perspective as we continue to focus on operational delivery.\nAs Tom mentioned, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance for production, costs and capital spend. Production is expected to increase in the second half of the year. With the year's strongest performance anticipated in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong grades at Penasquito, and Tanami. And unit costs will be closely correlated to production with the added benefit of full potential improvements and additional synergies realized in the second half of the year. Capital discipline is a key focus area for us with our transformed portfolio.\nAs mentioned on our last call, we continue to expect to invest an average of $1.3 billion per year of development capital and projects that will generate the highest returns, which we plan to provide more information about during our Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy, which focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding cash-generative capital projects and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe maintained an investment-grade balance sheet and ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in total liquidity when including the cash reclassified to current assets held for sale. We reinvested $317 million of development capital as we continue to advance our highest return projects from our deep organic pipeline. And finally, we declared a fixed common first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with the dividend declared during the fourth quarter.\nLooking ahead, our capital allocation priorities have not changed and the cash flows generated from our operations and the proceeds from divestments will be allocated first, to have an approximate cash balance of $3 billion and then to reduce debt up to $8 billion over the next few years. Additionally, once we have line of sight on meeting our balance sheet targets, we intend to repurchase shares as we see value in buying back our shares maintaining a disciplined and structured approach to capital allocation throughout the year, will better position Newmont to deliver value to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll hand it to Tom for closing remarks. Back to you, Tom.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Karyn. In closing, and as we look ahead to our priorities for the year, I'd like to reiterate our focus areas and key commitments. First, we will reinvigorate our established safety program and continue to strengthen Newmont's position as the gold industry's recognized sustainability leaders.\nSecond, we will continue operating the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. Third, over the next 2 years, we will deliver $500 million of annual synergies an additional $500 million in cost and productivity improvements and over $2 million in cash from portfolio optimization.\nAnd finally, we will drive a disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation, creating our resilient and returns-focused future for our organization and our shareholders. From our go-forward portfolio, focused on Tier 1 gold and copper operations, we are well positioned to deliver on these commitments and more routing an attractive value proposition to new and existing investors during this unique time in the gold industry.\nAnd with that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Rob Atkinson and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce Natascha Viljoen, who officially joined the Newmont executive leadership team at the start of this month. Natascha is a seasoned industry leader and brings more than 30 years of technical, operational and executive leadership experience across a diverse range of commodities, and we are very excited to have her join our team at Newmont.\nBefore we begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic plan, underpinned by a very clear and focused strategy. We are leveraging our leadership and collective experience, along with the strength of our global portfolio and operating model to build a resilient and sustainable future for Newmont.\nOur pending acquisition of Newcrest is a significant event for our industry. It combines two of the sector's top senior gold producers to set the new standard for sustainable, responsible gold and copper mining. I think this Is a very exciting and transformational time for Newmont and all of our stakeholders. But before we provide an update on the Newcrest transaction and what's to come, I'd like to start with a review of our safety performance.\nAs a company, we have been on a very intentional and significant safety journey, and we are proud that Newmont has not had a fatality in 5 years. During this time, we redesigned our fatality risk management system to ensure our standards and critical control verifications were focused on risks and behaviors that could result in a fatality. We have completed more than 1.6 million interactions by our leaders in the field that were focused on the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities.\nWe modified the safety targets in our annual incentive program to deliberately move away from the traditional lagging personal injury rates to the leading metrics, focused on fatality risk reduction and fatigue management. And we focused on doing a few things really, really well, including pre-start meetings, pre-task hazard assessments and infield verifications. As a consequence of these actions, we have experienced a significant improvement in our safety performance, which is evidenced by the metrics you see here on this slide.\nWhether health and safety is an area where you must always maintain a sense of chronic we still experience at least 1 significant potential event every 8 days. Each and every one of these are an opportunity to learn from and improve because the safety of our workforce must be considered in everything that we do, every hour, every shift and every day.\nTurning to our quarterly highlights. During the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million ounces of gold and 10,000 tonnes of copper, generating $933 million in adjusted EBITDA and over $1 billion of cash from continuing operations, a 53% increase over the prior quarter, and we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share from our established framework. Over the last few months, we achieved a number of important milestones at our key development projects, including fully mining the upper section of the new production shaft at Tanami in Australia, receiving full funds approval for the Pamour project Porcupine in Canada and reaching commercial production at the San Marcos deposit at Cerro Negro in Argentina.\nImportantly, earlier this month, we also reached a resolution with the union at our Peñasquito mine in Mexico. And we are now focused on safely returning our teams to work and ramping up operations at its Tier 1 polymetallic mine. Throughout the negotiations to resolve this issue, we maintained a strong position and held steadfast to our values, honoring the collective bargaining agreement that we had in place and ensuring that we protected the long-term value for this mining operation, our workforce, local communities and all of our stakeholders.\nThis unnecessary strike has caused significant hardship for many, many people. And our focus this quarter, we are on the safe ramp-up of our operations, along with the seamless integration of the Newcrest assets into Newmont's global industry-leading portfolio.\nNow that we have a resolution to the strike at Peñasquito, we are updating our outlook for the remainder of the year to incorporate the following 3 impacts. The first is to reflect the suspension of operations at Peñasquito for early June to mid-October. The second is to reflect the lower than anticipated production from both Nevada Gold Mines Pueblo Viejo. And the third is to reflect lower throughput at the Ahafo mill, and Rob will provide some more details on these matters in a moment.\nSo for 2023, we now expect to produce 5.3 million ounces of gold from the current Newmont portfolio, with a resulting all-in sustaining cost of $1,400 an ounce. As a reminder, our full year results for 2023 that will report in late February next year will incorporate around 7 weeks of production from the 5 acquired Newcrest assets with the transaction currently on track to close on Monday, the 6th of November.\nI'll now turn it to Rob and then Karyn to take us through the quarterly results and the important work ahead to deliver a strong fourth quarter, then I'll provide an update on the Newcrest transaction and what will be the focus of our integration efforts from day 1. Over to you, Rob.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my discussion around the high-margin Tier 1 assets in our portfolio today, starting with Boddington. During the third quarter, I had the opportunity to visit Boddington and spend time with the team as they continue to ramp up the planned waste movement in the North and the South pits and prepare for the planned mill maintenance shutdown in the fourth quarter. Laybacks are progressing well, and Boddington delivered solid production in the third quarter as expected.\nThe strong quarterly performance has helped to offset the impact from mill maintenance and unusually wet weather. Despite the heavy rainfall in the third quarter, effective utilization for the autonomous whole fleet has improved significantly compared to this time last year. Funds mined are expected to increase in the fourth quarter. And I'm pleased to say that we have successfully completed the commissioning of a further 5 new Cat autonomous haul trucks to accelerate stripping in 2024 and position this cornerstone gold copper mine to reach higher grades in 2025.\nTurning to Tanami. Our Tier 1 mine in the Northern Territory continues to deliver consistently strong results. following the record wet weather and extended flooding experienced in the region during the first quarter of the year. We achieved record mill throughput in August, beating the previous record we set in March of this year. And we continue to expect to reach the year's highest rates and production levels in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, we are closely monitoring the impact and the status of the very large wildfires currently burning in the immediate vicinity of Tanami and in the Northern Territory, and we will continue, as always, to prioritize the health and the safety of our workforce. We also continue to progress our second expansion project at Tanami, and I was encouraged to see the headway the team is making during my recent visit.\nWe've achieved a significant milestone in the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft, fully aligning the upper sections and removing the mid-shaft And as is typical with projects of this size, we will review the project plan as we commence the lining of the lower sections, taking into account the work that has been done so far, the current ground conditions and the overbreak needing to be mitigated in the lower section of the shaft.\nOnce complete, this project will deliver significant ounce and cost improvements, further strengthening the already strong margins at our Tier 1 operation at Tanami, and we look forward to providing an update with our guidance in February of next year.\nTurning to Ahafo. As Tom mentioned, third quarter mill throughput was impacted by routine condition monitoring by our asset management team, identified hairline fractures to one of the large grinding mills at Ahafo. To reduce any further deterioration to the and to prevent a catastrophic failure, we made the decision to operate at less than full capacity, bringing throughput to around 60% for the third quarter. We have in October swapped the gut tiers between our 2 milling circuits at Ahafo to ensure our most productive milling circuit is able to run at 100%.\nThis will allow Ahafo to run at approximately 80% of until we again reached full processing rates in the second quarter of 2024 when we will install a brand-new Also, during the quarter, Ahafo accessed higher-grade ore from Subika Underground and successfully commissioned the replacement conveyor ahead of schedule and below budget. The Ahafo North project continues to progress as planned, and we have access to all critical parcels of land to commence construction of the processing plant and mine services facilities.\nAirports are ongoing, heavy mining equipment is being assembled and commissioned, contractors are fully mobilized, and we remain on track to commence pre-stripping of the first mining area called the pit in the fourth quarter of this year.\nTurning to Peñasquito. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, we reached a definitive agreement with the union and received approval from the Mexican Labor Court on October 13. We have safely restarted operations, and the ramp-up is progressing well so far. We are anticipating a return to full productivity in the next 2 to 3 weeks, and we have restarted waste stripping in the Peñasquito pit and are now feeding the crusher with ore from the Chile Colorado pit. We are importantly also continuing to strongly focus on the engagement with our workforce.\nThis unnecessary strike caused significant hardship for all of our employees, contractors communities, suppliers and customers. Peñasquito is the largest employer in Zacatecas with a direct workforce of more than 5,000 and another 28,000 people in neighboring communities who are part of the mines local and national supply chain, service providers and contractors. As we look ahead to the exciting and profitable future for Peñasquito, we will continue to honor our commitments, work closely with all of our stakeholders with the law and the collective bargaining agreement and work to protect the long-term value of this Tier 1 polymetallic mine.\nMoving to our non-managed joint ventures. Through our joint venture partnerships, Newmont has an interest in 4 Tier 1 assets Cortez and Turquoise Ridge. The joint ventures are core to Newmont's portfolio and contributed 352,000 ounces or 27% of attributable gold production in the third quarter. As Tom mentioned, reported performance from our non-managed operations has been below expectations for the year, impacting our ability to achieve our production and cost targets for 2023.\nWe have adjusted our projections for both Pueblo Video and Nevada Gold Mines and look forward to an improved performance in the fourth quarter from our joint venture partners. On top of the 800,000 ounces of gold produced from our Tier 1 operations and joint ventures, the remainder of Newmont portfolio contributed approximately 500,000 ounces of profitable gold production, an increase of more than 100,000 ounces compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate solid results from these efforts through the rest of the year.\nBefore I hand it to Karyn, I'd like to take a moment to cover a few highlights from our development projects we are currently executing. On top of the achievements that I already noted at our second expansion at Tanami and Ahafo North, we also achieved key milestones at Cerro Negro, Porcupine and At Cerro Negro, we declared commercial production for San Marcos across the 6 ore bodies associated with this exciting district expansion. This opens up a further 650,000 ounces of high-grade gold, which will be mined over the coming 10 years.\nThis milestone was delivered on time and on budget, and we expect to start realizing the benefit from these high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter of this year. At Porcupine, the Pamour project has been approved for full funds by the Board. This opens up a further 2.1 million ounces of gold and will be mined over the coming 11 years, which helps extend the Porcupine complex operational life to at least 2035. Our mining team will commence pre-stripping in the fourth quarter and are tracking well to produce in 2024.\nAnd finally, we advanced our underground project to Akyem to the feasibility stage, where drilling from the surface has already delivered results that are beyond our initial expectations. And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.\n\nKaryn F. Ovelmen\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Flowserve Corp.\n\nThank you, Rob. Let's get started with the financial highlights. During the third quarter, revenue was $2.5 billion at a realized gold price of $1,920 per ounce, and adjusted EBITDA was $933 million, was up 10% from the third quarter of last year, driven by higher gold prices and lower direct operating costs.\nWe also generated $1 billion of cash from operations and $397 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to move through a period of significant reinvestment back into our business. And we closed the quarter with a steady cash position of $3.2 billion in a leverage ratio of 0.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nFrom a financial standpoint, our goal is to maintain a best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet while funding value-accretive projects and delivering healthy returns. And in recognition of Newmont's ongoing balance sheet strength and financial flexibility, I'm pleased to say that we have received a first time A- rating from Fitch with a stable outlook. We also maintained solid margins in the third quarter, despite the challenges that Rob mentioned at Peñasquito, Ahafo and our non-management joint ventures.\nThird quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $157 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Adjustments this quarter included $0.14 related to revisions in reclamation and remediation plans at former operations, $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.02 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest and $0.05 related to tax adjustments and other items.\nTaking these into account, we reported third quarter adjusted net income of $0.36 per diluted share. As a reference to those modeling included in our quarterly results are $131 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito. This quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis. This dividend was declared within our established framework calibrated at a gold price of $1,700 million per ounce and in line with our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share.\nNewmont had paid over $5 billion in dividends since closing the Goldcorp transaction in 2019, demonstrating our commitment to our shareholders. On the close of the Newcrest acquisition, Newmont will integrate 5 new operations into our robust global operating model. February of next year, we expect to provide our 2024 outlook for the combined company with our fourth quarter and full year results.\nConsistent with our process, our outlook will inform our 2024 dividend payout range, which we will calibrate within our established dividend framework. As a reminder, we assess the variable portion of our dividends annually in alignment with the business planning cycle, projected cash flows and the current macroeconomic environment. Similar to this year, our 2024 dividend payout range will apply to our fourth quarter dividend to be declared in February and will be reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors each quarter.\nFor a longer-term view of our portfolio, we will apply a disciplined and thoughtful approach to setting market guidance for the combined company. We expect to provide our long-term outlook after we've had some time on the ground with the Newcrest assets and following our annual strategy session with our Board of Directors, which typically takes place in June.\nWe look forward to and providing more information on the exciting opportunities ahead for both current and future stakeholders. And with that, I'll pass it on to Tom for an update on the Newcrest transaction.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Karyn. The combination of Newmont and Newcrest represents an exceptional value proposition for shareholders and all our other stakeholders. Through an unrivaled platform, featuring the industry's best talent, growing the highest concentration of Tier 1 assets in the most favorable jurisdictions, Newmont is uniquely positioned to generate superior returns for decades to come. Recognizing the strategic rationale to create the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets, 96% of votes cast by Newmont shareholders and 93% of votes cast by Newcrest shareholders were overwhelmingly in favor of this transformational transaction.\nAll of the regulatory approvals and shareholder votes now secured, we expect to close the transaction on Monday, the 6th of November, and set the new standard for gold and copper mining across the industry. Following the close of the transaction, the core of our portfolio will be 10 Tier 1 assets, representing more than half of the world's top-tier gold mines. And these assets will have the scale, mine life, cost profile and resilience to position Newmont to deliver strong and stable returns for several decades.\nLeveraging the learnings from operating our current Tier 1 assets, along with our comprehensive asset strategy work, we will be applying the strength of our operating model, our people and our systems with the newly acquired Tier 1 assets in Lihir and Cadia as well as Brucejack and Red Chris in our emerging Tier 1 district of British Columbia. There is no doubt that Newmont will be operating the world's best gold copper portfolio under one umbrella, benefiting from our existing portfolio, operating model, sustainability practices and disciplined capital allocation process.\nEvery one of our assets is managed through our integrated global operating model, supported by a big bench of experienced leaders and subject matter experts with a track record of safely delivering value. And within this global operating model, we will have 6 regional business units, each led by a dedicated managing director. From the start of November, Natascha will assume accountability for our Australian business unit, led by Mia Gous, our North American business unit led by Bernard Wessels and Papua New Guinea, where we have Alwyn Pretorius returning to Newmont to head up this newly established business unit.\nThrough early 2024, Rob will continue to have accountability for our African business unit led by Dave Thornton, our Latin American and Caribbean business unit led by Mark Rogers, and our Peruvian business unit led by Rahman Amoadu. We are very fortunate to have Rob as a continuing member of our executive leadership team, particularly during this important integration period. Natascha and Rob will work together closely in the coming months, and both leaders will be pivotal in delivering synergies for the Newcrest acquisition and driving operational results that demonstrate our position as the benchmark gold equity.\nIn just a few days, we'll be welcoming our Newcrest colleagues to Newmont. And on day 1, my extended leadership team and I will be on site across every Newcrest location. As we begin our integration work with the Newcrest team, we'll be focused on 3 key systems that have been fundamental to our success at Newmont. The first is our fatality risk management program, which is at the very core of our safety approach. And put simply, great companies do not kill people.\nSecond is our Respect@Work program, a key benefit from bringing these 2 companies together is the alignment in our values and culture, in particular, around safe and inclusive workplaces. We have the opportunity to learn from each other with the programs we both have in place. Like many other companies in the mining industry, we know there are systemic issues that allow sexism, racism, discrimination, harassment and bullying to continue to be experienced in our workplaces.\nThese disrespectful behaviors have no place at Newmont. And we'll be working together to take actions to create a workplace with everyone is welcome and safe. The third key system is our full potential program, which will commence rolling out at both Lihir and Cadia in November to support the delivery of our synergy commitments. Full Potential is a program that I have led at the Newmont over the last decade. It is the most sustainable improvement program that I've worked with in my 35-year career in the industry, and it was key to delivering over $1 billion in synergies from our acquisition of Goldcorp some 4 years ago.\nHowever, Full Potential delivers much more than just cost savings and productivity improvements. It sustains and improves our culture by breaking down barriers and encouraging active participation, global collaboration and sharing lessons learned across our organization.\nDuring our due diligence work back in May, we identified and committed to $500 million in annual synergies across 3 categories: G&A, supply chain and Full Potential. As we look ahead to the closing of the transaction and the delivery of these synergies over the first 24 months, we are very excited about the long-term value and opportunities it will bring to both sets of stakeholders and our combined workforce. This transaction creates the best possible collection of Tier 1 gold and copper assets in the industry, all supported by the industry's best talent, technical capabilities, sustainability practices and disciplined capital allocation process.\nWe'll also increase our investor outreach, welcoming shareholders from Australia that will form an important part of our shareholder base as we look to establish and then grow our listing on the ASX. We have a long history and a shared heritage in Australia, and we will be strengthening our presence in this key mining jurisdiction. We're upon the close of this transaction, around 30% of our revenues will be derived.\nWe're looking forward to welcoming the experienced and talented team at Newcrest and providing our first integration update on the combined business for the first quarter of next year. And with that, I thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience, and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team.\nBefore I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.\nGuided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy.\nAnd while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond.\nDuring the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations.\nThere were 4 important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Peñasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the union representing our workforce in Mexico. This dispute is associated with a profit-sharing agreement that we made with the union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit-sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor.\nAt Newmont, Peñasquito sits within a strong, balanced global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet. During this important time for Peñasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleon Gomez to cease this strike action and return their members to work.\nThe second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Éléonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance.\nThird, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for 2 weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there.\nAnd finally, at Chim, we made the decision to process lower-grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the gen pit over the next few months.\nAs planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tons mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tons mined at Cerro Negro as the first wave of our district expansion comes online in the third quarter. Higher tons mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grade for the year in the fourth quarter. Higher grade run-of-mine ore processed in the Chim as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our 2 non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pela Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance.\nWe ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment-grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.\nWe remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp 4 years ago as we build out our integration plans.\nWe have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, backing the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years.\nAt Newmont, we recognize that a strong, safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well-run business. It is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability.\nIn June, we promoted Suzy Retallack for the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving value-based decisions. Over the last 5 years, as our Senior Vice President, Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance, in particular, in the area of fatality risk management. Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from a reckless, assault, bullying and discrimination.\nI'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with 5 additional trucks as we increased the planned waste movement in both the North and the South pits. This investment into the next layback at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance, and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.\nMoving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the Northern Territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation in Tanami.\nMoving up to Africa. In June, I visited both the Ahafo South and Achim as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana. At Achim, I spent time with the team as we work through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months.\nAs a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges.\nAt Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we access the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Fined with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half. Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter, and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year.\nAnd finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation in bulk airports continue to progress very well. And with the new mining fleet in place, the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year.\nMoving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec, particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June, as the fire front approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Éléonore on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors. During this time, our first priority was and will always be the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We're now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate. And we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis.\nMoving to Porcupine. We delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden Underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year. We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the Pamour project and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024.\nAt Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progress planned development activities that will increase score availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double lift score. As a consequence, we expect tonnes mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter.\nAnd finally, Cripple Creek and Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities.\nAnd now moving down to South America. Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian Pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance.\nMoving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tons mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to, and grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher-grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of 6 new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro. San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023.\nFinally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Peñasquito on June 7 as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly, fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Peñasquito.\nAnd now I'll wrap up on the next slide with our 2 non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second half.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.\n\nKaryn Ovelmen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have.\nBefore I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success.\nJoining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed our initial expectations.\nOver the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle.\nTurning to the next slide. Let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million. Cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by a draw on receivables. We would expect to draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters. The tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years.\nIn total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and merchants in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter, driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs.\nSecond quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items.\nTaking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito since the strike commenced and at Éléonore, while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires.\nAs Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last 2 quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the time line from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Karyn. Over the last 2 months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood.\nOver the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government.\nEarlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials including Prime Minister James Marape, Deputy Prime Minister John Russo and Mining Minister Sir Anaplan. As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Waihi gold boom project.\nWe are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio. Then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results.\nWith that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Newmont's first quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson; and Brian Tabolt along with other members of our executive leadership team and will all be available to answer questions at the end of the call.\nBefore I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.\nNewmont continues to lead the gold industry in safety, sustainability, profitable production and shareholder returns. Our solid first quarter performance is underpinned by our unmatched portfolio of world-class assets, our proven operating model, a balanced, disciplined approach to capital allocation and most importantly, our values-driven commitment to leading sustainability practices. With a strong outlook combined with the strength of our team and the quality of our assets, we remain on track to continue safely delivering long-term value to all of our stakeholders.\nDuring the first quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million ounces of gold and 288,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and all in line with the expectations we provided in February for Q1. We continue to expect the gold production for this year will be weighted 55% to the second half and we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance ranges.\nWith $6.5 billion in total liquidity, we continue to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet providing the financial strength to sustain our business throughout the price cycle as we continue to invest in our most profitable growth projects and return cash to our shareholders.\nThrough our established dividend framework, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and the confidence that we have in our business.\nDuring the first quarter, we further rationalized Newmont's portfolio with the sale of our interest in Triple Flag, generating $179 million in cash proceeds. And we remain on track to deliver an incremental $440 million of full potential cost of productivity improvements this year. A key part of Newmont's continued efforts to deliver stable production and strong margins from the industry's best portfolio of world-class assets.\nOur core values are safety, sustainability, integrity, inclusion and responsibility. They have been developed and embedded over a long period of time and through multiple generations of leaders at Newmont. Together, they are fundamental to how we run our business, where we choose to operate and how we conduct ourselves on a daily basis.\nLast week, Newmont launched our 19th Annual Sustainability Report and our second Annual Taxes and Royalties Contribution Report providing a detailed and transparent look at our values-driven approach to sustainability and an overview of our tax strategy and economic contributions. And next month, we will issue our third Annual Climate Report, outlining Newmont's climate risks and opportunities, our strategic planning around various climate change scenarios and the specific actions we are taking to reduce our carbon footprint. Each of these reports are part of a robust set to detail our company's management of the sustainability areas that matter most to our stakeholders and to our business.\nAt the very core of Newmont's leading sustainability practices is our commitment to driving a fatality, injury and illness-free workplace. And this begins with a disciplined, laser focus on safety fundamentals. In the first quarter, we completed more than 172,000 interactions by leaders in the field that were focused on the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. To highlight one of the direct consequences of this work compared to the same quarter last year, in Q1, we experienced a 56% reduction in potentially fatal incidents or what we call significant potential events. This improvement could not have been achieved without our dedicated workforce and the supporting systems that we have in place to maintain and improve our safety culture.\nLast month, we recognized several members of our team through our Annual CEO Safety Awards, acknowledging those teams and individuals that set the standard for high-quality built and safety practices. From a pool of over 50 nominees, we selected winners in 3 categories: safe lead up, safe team and partner in safety. We are really proud to be able to recognize the dedication demonstrated by our team members each and every day.\nWe are also proud of our heritage as a values-driven organization with a clear purpose. We have learned that achieving our purpose requires strong governance and a commitment to accountability and transparency. As part of that commitment, Newmont has been disclosing our sustainability performance since 2004.\nAmong the key highlights shown on this slide from our 2022 sustainability report is one of the most important focus areas for the mining industry today, creating a safe, healthy and equitable workplace, one that values our differences and ensures that everyone feels safe and is safe working at Newmont.\nOver the last 18 months, the mining industry has come under significant scrutiny following a West Australian Parliamentary inquiry into issues of sexism, racism, harassment and bullying in the workplace. I'm disappointed to acknowledge that Newmont is not immune to this unacceptable behavior that is taking place in workplaces across the world. And it is vital that its leaders, we make sustainable changes to address and eliminate these behaviors. To manage our response last year, I appointed a senior operational leader reporting directly to me and tasked with listening to our workforce to better understand what is being experienced so that we can make lasting and meaningful change. Over the last few months, more than 1,000 people have provided thoughtful feedback and personal experiences through 100 focus groups and more than 150 one-on-one interviews, assisting us in understanding the extent, nature and root cause of these behaviors in our organization.\nWe will remain transparent in our acknowledgment of these behaviors. Andrew provided an overview of the emerging themes from these conversations in our annual sustainability report. This ask and listen process is helping us to identify the improvements required in our systems, the symbolic actions that we can take and our changes in our leadership behaviors that will drive a sustainable change in our workplaces.\nI'll now turn it over to Rob and then Brian to take us through each of our operations and key development projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Then I'll wrap up with a brief update on our proposed acquisition of Newcrest. Over to you, Rob.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, John and good morning everyone. Since the start of the year, I visited 3 of our 4 regions at Newmont. I spent underground with the team at Tanami, reviewing the status of our expansion project to this world-class asset with Mia Gous, our Senior Vice President in Australia and our experienced leadership team. I traveled to Ghana to see firsthand progress at our Subika Underground mine and the Ahafo North project with David Thornton, our Senior Vice President in Africa.\nI also traveled to each one of our sites in Canada, Eleonore, Musselwhite and Porcupine to review the productivity improvements we are achieving under the leadership of our North American Senior Vice President, Bernard Wessels. And as Tom just described, our site and regional leaders are very focused on safely delivering their plans, whilst continually working to create a safe and inclusive environment for each person working at our operations.\nSo turning to the next slide. Let's begin with an update from South America. Peñasquito continues to deliver strong mill performance largely due to the implementation of our full potential program over the last 4 years and with the ongoing support from our operations support networks with more than $300 million in annual synergies from processing. Improvements alone. Our team has been hard at work further de-bottlenecking Peñasquito's processing circuit, improving flotation and filtering capacity as well as optimizing maintenance schedules to increase mill availability. And as a direct result, Peñasquito processed 9.9 million tonnes in the first quarter, putting us on track to mill an impressive 37 million tonnes of ore in 2023.\nMining continues in the Chile Colorado pit plant. And whilst gold production was lower when compared to the fourth quarter, it was completely in line with the expectations that we had previously communicated due to mine sequence at this very large polymetallic mine.\nLinked to this sequence, coal production was strong this quarter, generating $266 million in revenue due to higher silver, lead and zinc grades being delivered from the Chile Colorado pit. And also, please note that 55,000 gold equivalent ounces in finished goods inventory at Peñasquito was built up at the end of the quarter as a result of planned timing on concentrate shipments. This concentrate has since been sold and the revenue will be realized in the second quarter.\nAlso in Q2, we expect both gold and silver grades to decline by around 10% compared to Q1 due to the planned mining sequence with the full expectation that higher silver, zinc and light grades in the second half and resulting gold equivalent ounces will offset the planned lower gold grades in 2023. We expect gold and coal production at Peñasquito to be weighted around 55% to the second half of this year.\nTurning to our leach-only operations in Peru, Yanacocha delivered steady results in the first quarter. Production is expected to increase by more than 20% beginning in the second quarter when we start to realize the benefits from our continued use of our injection leaching technology combined with our re-leaching programs.\nAt Merian, our team has begun the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian pit and as reflected in our guidance, this will result in higher waste tonnes being mined and lower ore tonnes in ore grade being processed this year. And finally, in Argentina, Cerro Negro delivered another solid quarter due to higher underground mining rates and mill throughput. Gold production is expected to steadily increase each quarter from a combination of sustained productivity improvements and the progression of the first wave of our district expansions at Cerro Negro. We anticipate production will be weighted around 56% to the second half of this year, with the site on track to add high-grade ounces from San Marcos beginning in the third quarter.\nNow turning to Australia. Boddington continued its momentum from the fourth quarter, delivering strong gold and copper production in the first quarter, while it's also completing a plan, 7-day preventative maintenance shutdown of the processing plant. And as we look ahead, the site is expected to deliver improved results during the second quarter, supported by steady ore grades and strong mill performance. And as we ramp up waste stripping in the South pit in the second half of the year, we expect to increase total material mine to around 20 million tonnes per quarter helping to maintain steady gold and copper production despite planned lower ore grades being delivered to the mill.\nNow moving up to Tanami. And as previously discussed, the Northern Territory in Australia experienced record wet weather and associated extensive flooding during late 2022 and the start of 2023, which resulted in the complete closure of the main route for supplies to Tanami from late December with the Tanami track only being fully unable to transport normal loads in late February.\nAs described during our last earnings call, this road closure impacted our ability to move key consumables to site, resulting in the depletion of all of our wet weather stocks on site and the suscitation of milling operations and gold production for 32 days during Q1. However, during this period, our team remained agile and responded to this event with mining operations continuing and ore being stockpiled in front of the mill.\nScheduled maintenance was moved forward to reduce downtime in subsequent quarters and in partnership with the Northern Territory government and local contractors, we successfully repaired and reopened the Tanami track. Due to these efforts, Tanami expects to cover most of the ounces from this event over the course of 2023 and is on track to more than double gold production in the second quarter.\nIt's also important to note that all our key consumable stocks at site have returned to normal operating levels and we have continued to progress our second expansion at Tanami. The team has now completed more than 565 meters of the concrete shaft lining in addition to account expansion to accommodate our current and future workforce. And despite the temporary closure of the main access route during the quarter, the project remains on track to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements in the second half of 2025.\nAnd now moving to Africa. Akyem delivered lower ore grade in the first quarter as our team commenced stripping of the next layback in line with the expectations previously communicated. Strip ratios will remain high throughout the year as planned with stronger gold production expected in the second and third quarters due to higher grades coming through.\nAt Ahafo, we delivered a solid quarter, a strong mining rates and plant throughput partially offset lower grades due to planned underground rehabilitation that impacted access to high-grade material at the Subika Underground. During Q1, the site experienced a conveyor failure that impacted 1 of the 2 conveyor systems transporting ore from the secondary crusher to the mills. However, the team was able to put a system in place to bypass conveyor and offset any impact to production.\nAs a result, Ahafo remains on track to achieve its annual guidance range with steady increases to production each quarter still expected as we open up additional draw points on the Subika Underground. We anticipate gold production at Ahafo will be weighted around 60% to the second half of this year due to higher mining rates and the delivery of more high-grade ore to the mill over the course of the year.\nOur Ahafo North project continues to progress well with approximately 85% of the total land area available for construction. And as you can see in the photo on this slide, we have transported a large portion of the necessary civil construction and mining equipment from Ahafo South to Ahafo North as we prepare to develop this next important phase of Ahafo complex in Ghana.\nNow moving across to North America. As discussed during our last earnings call, our North American operations have made tremendous progress due to the guidance from our experienced team of leaders, the strength of our integrated operating model and the support from our proven full potential program.\nStarting with CC&V, our leach-only operation remains a solid contributor with slightly lower production compared to the previous quarter due to waste stripping in the Globe Hill pit as planned. At Éléonore, the site delivered another strong quarter, driven by improved mining rates and mill performance compared to the fourth quarter. And these improvements combined with the progress we have made in workforce stability, will enable Éléonore to continue generating daily production levels throughout the year more than offsetting plant lower ore grade.\nMusselwhite delivered lower ore grade and mining rates compared to the fourth quarter as the team focused on backfill activities to expose high-grade stopes. And when combined with the efficiency improvements achieved through double-lift stoping, Musselwhite is expected to deliver increased production each quarter in 2023 with nearly 56% of production anticipated in the second half of the year.\nAnd finally, Porcupine delivered higher ore grade and improved tonnes mine, largely offsetting the impact on planned mill maintenance during the first quarter. Pamour project continues to progress well as we prepare for an investment decision in late 2023.\nCollectively, our Canadian sites have improved production by 26% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to continued focus on closely managing labor vacancies and absenteeism, whilst improving productivity and reliability with greater access for our leadership and full potential teams post the Canadian border restrictions.\nÉléonore, Musselwhite and Porcupine each achieved the highest quarterly performance in terms of development meters. And for comparison, this is an overall improvement of 37% versus Q1 2022. And also as a direct consequence, tonnes mined improved 26% and ore tonnes processed also increased 7%. These very pleasing results are a true testament to the power of our operate model and its ability to replicate leading practices across our global operations. And these improvements will be on just the ounces delivered. We have also seen the significant potential event frequency rate in our 4 North American operations, cut in half due to an increased focus on critical control verifications, proving once again that a strong safety culture is key to delivering on our commitments.\nFinally, to our 2 non-managed joint ventures, our 38.5% ownership of Nevada Gold Mines and 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 321,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter, representing 20% of our combined non-managed joint venture production guidance for the full year.\nAs highlighted at our full year earnings presentation in February, a tragic workplace fatality occurred in our joint venture in Nevada Gold Mines. The fatality occurred at the Carlin Gold stream underground operation on the 23rd of January and a detailed investigation was carried out by our JV partners, which included one of Newmont's most senior safety leaders as a key member of the investigation team.\nNGM and Newmont's executive leaders have also met to discuss and share safety strategies, interventions and tactics to help ensure tragedies of this nature do not occur again at NGM. Both of these joint ventures are core to the Newmont portfolio and we look forward to continuing to work with our managing partner to help ensure a safe and productive future for Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Brian to cover our financial results. Over to you, Brian.\n\nBrian C. Tabolt\n\nInterim CFO & Executive VP, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the financial highlights. In the first quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,906 per ounce, driven from 21% of our anticipated full year production and including $376 million from our copper, silver, lead and zinc co-products. Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion and cash from operations of $481 million, which includes $360 million of unfavorable working capital movements, partly due to the timing of concentrate shipments at Peñasquito.\nAs stated previously, we are currently in a period of meaningful reinvestment with capital spend for the first quarter of $526 million as we continue to progress our near-term projects and position our portfolio to be profitable and resilient for decades to come. Additionally, through the continued rationalization of our portfolio, we sold our stake in Triple Flag, which generated $179 million of proceeds, contributing to Newmont's strong liquidity profile at the end of the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This investment-grade balance sheet continues to be an integral part of our capital allocation strategy, maintaining financial strength and flexibility while balancing sustainable reinvestment and meeting shareholder returns.\nFirst quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $339 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to a gain from the sale of our interest in Triple Flag as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization, $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments and $0.08 related to tax adjustments. Taking these into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.40 per diluted share, relatively in line with the previous quarter despite lower production as planned and previously communicated.\nThese results also include the impact from higher average realized price, lower sales volumes including the impact from the timing of concentrate sales at Peñasquito, as mentioned earlier and lower total cost applicable to sales driven by lower overall production and higher oil prices. And as a reminder, this higher gold price environment results in both favorable inventory adjustments as well as higher royalties and production taxes.\nAs the year progresses, we anticipate that unit costs will decline as production increases and inflationary pressures stabilized, improving margins and strengthening our financial position.\nAs a reflection of the confidence in our business and our strong financial position, this morning we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, set within our established framework and in line with our fourth quarter dividend. This continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector and remains within the top 20% of large-cap dividend payers in the S&P 500. With this dividend declared, Newmont will have returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends since introducing our framework in October 2020. And we have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 10 consecutive quarters.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back to Tom.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident & COO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. I would now like to provide an update on our potential acquisition of Newcrest. To briefly recap the key events and milestones over the last 3 months, on February 5, Newmont confirmed that we had submitted a nonbinding proposal to acquire Newcrest. Then on February 15, Newcrest advised that they had rejected our proposal, but offered to provide us access to limited nonpublic information. After negotiating an appropriate nondisclosure agreement, we were provided access to this information. As part of this process, my executive leadership team and I, along with some of our key subject matter experts, held a face-to-face meeting with the Newcrest management team.\nAfter reviewing this additional information, we submitted a revised nonbinding proposal to the Board of Newcrest with the following terms: a proposal to acquire 100% of the issued share capital by way of an Australian scheme of arrangement under which Newcrest shareholders would [report $0.4] Newmont shares for each Newcrest share. Newcrest would have the right to fund and paid shareholders special dividend of up to USD 1.10 per share to realize the value of franking credits and that the Newmont offer is best and final, subject only to no superior proposal emerging.\nOn April 10, the Newcrest Board then agreed to grant Newmont access to confirmatory due diligence to enable us to put forward a binding proposal. Newmont has been provided exclusivity for a 4-week due diligence period that ends at midnight on May 11. Our proposed acquisition would combine the assets and talent of 2 of the sectors of senior gold producers and set the new standard for safe, profitable and responsible gold mining.\nNewmont has a long history and a shared heritage with Newcrest, establishing our Australian subsidiary way back in 1966, a subsidiary that would become Newcrest some 25 years later. And as part of that share history, our companies also have shared commitments to a strong safety culture and leading sustainability practices, which is in addition to the complementary portfolios of world-class assets located in low-risk mining jurisdictions.\nOur proposed acquisition would strengthen our established position in Australia, creating efficiencies and value with a shared workforce, technical expertise and large-scale supply chain optimization and it would build upon the district potential in British Columbia's highly prospective golden triangle through a combination of operating mines and development projects that would deliver value through shared technology, mobile capabilities and ore body expense.\nWith our scale and track record of successfully managing some of the world's top Tier 1 assets, this transaction would leverage Newmont's experience from the Goldcorp acquisition, where we have demonstrated over the last 4 years that we can generate meaningful improvements to performance, stability and profitability, especially at large open pit and underground operations.\nSince we closed the Goldcorp acquisition, just over 4 years ago, on April 18, 2019, we have delivered more than $1 billion in annual synergies, significantly exceeding our initial commitment of $365 million. More than 3/4 of this synergy value was generated by focusing on the fundamentals of mining and processing and achieved for the disciplined application of our Proven Full Potential Program and leveraging our Nemont operating model with an experienced team of leaders and subject matter experts.\nPeñasquito, as the only Tier 1 asset in the Goldcorp acquisition has been the main driver of this value, generating more than $700 million in annual synergies. At this very large open pit mine, we have increased the average payload on our fleet of 85 large 330-tonne haul trucks by 17 tonnes per load with scope for further improvement. This translates to an additional 12 million tonnes of material moved per year for next to zero cost.\nCombined with other load-and-hold improvements, we have increased the annual total material moved at Peñasquito by more than 20% compared to 2020 with no additional equipment. Then turning to the processing plant at Peñasquito, we have worked to understand and then address the bottlenecks in the crushing, grinding and flotation circuits of this complex polymetallic operation, delivering a 7% increase in annual throughput compared to 2020, which translates to around $300 million in free cash flow improvements each year from this operation.\nThe Goldcorp acquisition involved the integration of 5 new operations, of which one Peñasquito was a Tier 1 asset. It also involved the entry into 3 new jurisdictions. By comparison, our proposed acquisition of Newcrest would also involve the integration of 5 new operations. But importantly, only one new jurisdiction. And notably, to the operations, Cadia and Lihir are Tier 1 assets with Red Chris and Brucejack representing a Tier 1 district in the golden triangle of British Columbia.\nIn the 4 years since April 2019, we have delivered on our value proposition and exceeded the commitments that we made. We have strengthened our position as the industry's recognized responsible gold leader. We have enhanced our portfolio through the successful integration of the former Goldcorp assets into our Newmont operating model delivering over $1 billion in annual synergies. We have optimized our portfolio, generating over $2 billion in proceeds from the divestments of Red Lake, our share of both KCGM and Continental Gold, along with the continued rationalization of our non-core equity portfolio.\nNotably, $1.5 billion of the proceeds from these divestments was delivered within the first 12 months of the acquisition closing and we have led the industry on capital returns, returning more than $5.5 billion to shareholders over the last 4 years while also completing over $1.5 billion in opportunistic share buybacks.\nFinally, our successful integration of the Goldcorp assets goes far beyond the synergies, assets divestments and leading shareholder returns. We have led the alignment of the former Goldcorp organization with Newmont's purpose, values, experience and culture. We have fully implemented Newmont's safety systems and processes. We have integrated our sustainability goals and targets. Through our disciplined capital allocation process, the former Goldcorp assets have significantly benefited from the combined entity's free cash flow generation capability and we have learned to operate in 3 new jurisdictions and forge lasting community and host country relationships.\nSo in closing, I'm not able to provide any further details on the Newcrest proposal at this time as it is a live engagement. But I want to be clear with everyone on today's call that we will continue to be disciplined as we work through the due diligence process and determine synergies, and we will act in the best interest of our shareholders.\nThank you for your time today. And with that, I now turn it over to the operator to open up the lines for questions."

At this time, the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. Let me now turn the floor over to your host, Stefanie Zimmermann, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nStefanie Zimmermann\n\nVice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication\n\nThank you, operator, and hello, everyone, and a big welcome. Thanks for joining our Earnings Call today to discuss the results for the financial year 2023 and the outlook for the current year results. With me today are our CEO, Yves Padrines, and our CFO, Louise Ofverstrom. Today's conference call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available at our website after the call.\nAdditionally, you'll find a report, the presentation, the press release and our new CSR report on our Investor Relations website as well. But now let's get started. So I would like to turn over to our CEO, Yves.\n\nYves Padrines\n\nCEO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, Stefanie. Welcome, everyone, to our Financial Year 2023 Earnings Call. As usual, we have prepared a short and informative presentation on the highlights of the Financial Year 2023 that our CFO, Louise Ofverstrom and I will briefly walk you through so that we have enough time to address any questions you may have during the Q&A sessions.\nAs you can see on Slide #2, we have a few topics today that we would like to talk about. We will start with a short review of the 2023 financials as well as strategic highlights before we take a look at the considerable progress we have already made in our transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model. After that, I will hand over to Louise, who will dive deeper into important aspects of our financial results.\nAnd last but not least, we will also talk about our financial outlook for the current fiscal year 2024 as well as our strong ambition for the year 2025. 2023 was a very special year for us. The Nemetschek Group celebrated its 60th anniversary. In 1963, Professor Georg Nemetschek, found the IngenieurbÃ¼ro fÃ¼r das Bauwesen in Munich, the start of an impressive success story that continues today as we will see on the floor lowering slides.\nThe former engineering office has developed over the last 6 decades into one of the world's leading software companies for the digital transformation of the AEC/O and media industries. The continuous pursuit of innovation leadership, the clear focus on customer proximity and customer value as well as an early understanding of the potential of new technologies for the benefit of our customers is where and are the most important components for the Nemetschek Group's success story.\nAs you will see on the next Slide #4, we are happy and proud to continue this success story with a continued profitable growth in the Fifth Financial year 2023 as well. Slide #4. When we translate what I just said about our past fiscal year into hard measurable KPIs, you will see that we achieved or even exceeded our financial goals for the last year.\nStarting at the top with the revenue growth. We are very pleased that with revenue of EUR 852 million and currency adjusted growth of plus 8%, we ended up at the upper end of our previously raised guidance range of 6% to 8%. This is a strong testimony to the resilience of our business model given the still challenging macroeconomic environment as well as the ongoing transition of our business model to subscription and SaaS offerings.\nMain growth driver was once again our recurring revenue, and in particular, the demand for our subscription and SaaS solutions, which is captured in our annual recurring revenue KPI, which grew by 26.7% on an FX-adjusted basis. Despite the accounting related negative short-term effects on our revenue and earnings due to the subscription and SaaS transition, we were able to maintain our high level of profitability and achieved an EBITDA margin of 30.3%, which was even slightly above our forecast range of 28% to 30%.\nThe success of our strategy also becomes evident by looking at the development of our recurring revenues. In line with our guidance, the share of recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenues strongly increased by 10 percentage points year-over-year to 76.6%. On Page #5, you can see an overview of the various strategic highlights in 2023 in each of the defined strategic focus areas.\nStarting with innovation and technology leadership, which has always been an integral part of our company's DNA. This is not only the reason why we were once again able to win some of the most important innovation award in our industry in 2023, but also the reason why our brands continued to drive development of new products and solutions in areas such as Digital Twins and Cloud solutions.\nThe result of this effort is, for example, our Digital Twin Platform called dTwin, which we just launched at the end of last year and which represents an innovation and a major step forward for the entire AEC/O industry. And of course, the field of artificial intelligence always plays a major role in our R&D activities.\nOne of our group-wide goals is to be a leader in the field of Artificial Intelligence in the AEC/O and media industries. AI is, therefore, a focus of our group R&D activities. In addition, we are also committed to an ethical, trustworthy and sustainable approach to artificial intelligence for the build environment and media and 3D animation.\nWhile we are working on a number of different initiatives internally to increase our own productivity, but of course, also to further improve our solution to help our customers to be more efficient, and we have already introduced new features in 2023, such as the AI visualizer from Graphisoft. Bluebeam launched beginning of this year new Artificial Intelligence features as well and also Vectorworks. We will continue to add additional AI features to our solution in the future, so stay tuned.\nAnother way to be at the pulse of the latest technological developments and trends in our industries is via on venture investments. Over the last year, we made minority investments in a series of young and highly innovative companies such as Briq, Preoptima, SmartPM, Live Costs or Stylib and many others, which will help us to further increase our innovation, strength and to cover important future topics like artificial intelligence and generative design.\nIn the area of business enablement, we worked on a further harmonization across the Nemetschek Group. This includes the continuous effort to further enhance our operational excellence in order to ensure that we will be able to continue to make the most of our tremendous growth opportunities. Over the last year, we also improved our go-to-market strategy by upgrading our e-commerce presence and web stores across the group and by strengthening our internationalization and cross-selling activities.\nAnd as you know, our customer base is majority SMBs, especially in the Design segment. We, therefore, have increased our focus on larger customer segments. We are convinced that we have the best products in the market, of course, and we want to make it easier for customers, especially the larger multinational and multidisciplinary ones to do business with us, for example, by offering the solution on the Nemetschek Group out of one hand.\nGoing forward, our goal is also to further increase our resilience, for instance, by further reducing the dependency on the European market. In order to achieve this goal, we continue to focus on higher growth regions, such as North America, but also Asia Pacific. We have, for instance, driven forward the preparations for the launch of Nemetschek India. By entering the Indian market, we want to participate in the enormous growth potential of the Indian construction industry in the coming years and decades.\nThe most important way to further strengthen our resilience is, however, by continuing to increase the share of our recurring revenue, in particular, by transitioning to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model. I already mentioned the new record heights that we achieved in [indiscernible] 2023. But as we promised, we want to keep you updated on the progress of our main top strategic priority in detail.\nYou will therefore find a comprehensive overview of the current status of our journey to our recurring business model on Slide #7. Given its strategic importance for the Nemetschek Group, please allow me to briefly explain the reason for this important initiative again. We are convinced that the move to a subscription and SaaS model has many benefits for us, of course, but also if done correctly for our customers, which is paramount in our customer-first mentality here at the Nemetschek Group.\nOur customers are more flexible and no longer have the high upfront investment is especially attractive for many customers during the economically challenging times. At the same time, they also benefit from a higher speed of innovation and improved services. In addition, we also see major benefits for our group.\nApart from the previously mentioned increased resilience and predictability of our revenue streams, we can address completely new customer groups, expand the customer lifetime value and tap into new and cross-selling opportunities. As you all know, the Nemetschek Group is quite unique in a way that we do not transition all at once our entire portfolio to a subscription SaaS-centric model. We are migrating our portfolio in a phased approach.\nThis does not only give us substantially more control over the entire transition process has significantly reducing the associated risk. It also makes the migration more easily digestible for our shareholders. Furthermore, it allows us to have a tailored subscription strategy for each of our 4 segments. Consequently, each of our segments are in a different stage.\nWhile the migration of our Media segment is basically completed with a recurring share of more than 90%, the Build segment substantially accelerated its move to subscription and SaaS with a highly successful transition of our group-wide biggest brand, Bluebeam. The transition of Bluebeam continues to progress as planned. We have now migrated roughly 50% of Bluebeam business, and we continue to expect that we will reach a level of around 90% by the end of this year.\nThe recurring revenue part of the segment was therefore already at more than 75% at the end of 2023. We have a comparably high recurring level in our design segment. However, the share of subscription is still significantly lower than in the Build segment as we [indiscernible] our dual offering strategy for our 2 largest design brands. That being said, here, we have also accelerated our transition in 2023.\nMultiple brands have started or are already in different stages of their move to subscription and SaaS offerings, most prominently our brand Vectorworks. In the managed segment, the vast majority of the more than 60% in recurring revenue is already subscription and SaaS related today. However, compared to the other segments, manage as a structurally higher share of services and a small portion of hardware revenues.\nOn the right-hand side of the slide, you will see the end results if we combine the progress that we have already made in each of our 4 segments. The share of recurring revenues at the group level increased dramatically in the last years and stood at almost 77% at the end of 2023. More details now on this topic in a few minutes from our CFO, Louise Ofverstrom. And with that, I will hand it over to you, Louise.\n\nLouise Ofverstrom\n\nChief Financial Officer & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you, Yves, and a warm welcome to our Full Year 2023 Earnings Call from my side as well. If has already touched on important strategic topics and progress for the past financial year, but I would now like to take a closer look together with you at our strong financial results for 2023 and the underlying drivers thereof. As usual, we will begin with a short overview of the last quarter of Page 9.\nIn sum, I think it's fair to say that we had a very good end of the year with a strong growth and at a continued high profitability. Despite the unchanged difficult demand environment in our AEC market, particularly in the European design markets, we were able to achieve continued strong revenue growth of 8.2% to EUR 220 million. Adjusted for the significant FX headwind of 270 basis points that we faced in the last 3 months of the year, the increase at constant currencies even amounted to 10.9%.\nWell, the main contributor to our strong growth was once again the recurring part of our business, which is represented by our annual recurring revenue KPI or showed ARR. That increased by 26.7% on a currency-adjusted basis to almost EUR 719 million. This impressive development in ARR is an important indicator for our group's revenue and cash flow growth potential in the coming 12 months.\nThe over proportional EBITDA growth of 24% to EUR 69.2 million is a function of the high growth, a healthy operating leverage as well as our continued focus on both efficiency and effectiveness in our cost base. The corresponding margin of 31.5% remained on a high level. This is especially true considering our continued investments into our future growth as well as our ongoing position to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model and the associated short-term accounting burden on our financial results out of that.\nLooking at the bottom line, our net income and correspondingly, our earnings per share for the quarter increased by 38.6% to $0.41. If we now look at our results for the full year on Page 10. The picture is very similar to Q4, strong, highly profitable growth, driven in particularly by the recurring part of our business. 2023 was therefore another very successful year for the Nemetschek Group despite a challenging environment and the ongoing transition to subscription and SaaS. Thanks to our resilient business model and the intact structural long-term growth drivers in our end markets.\nSo I believe it's really fair to say that Nemetschek continues to one of the very few companies, if not perhaps the only one that is able to show an attractive top line growth, combined with a high profitability while transitioning to a subscription in SaaS-centric business model. Yves has already touched on the key revenue and profitability figures for the year.\nSo I would therefore like to focus on the right-hand side of this slide, which shows that we have also improved the quality of our already very solid balance sheet even further throughout 2023. The most important KPIs I want to mention here are equity ratio, which improved by 390 basis points year-over-year, as well as our net cash position, which reached a new all-time high of more than EUR 260 million.\nTherefore, our extremely solid balance sheet, in combination with the strong underlying earnings and cash development provides us not only with a high degree of safety going forward but simultaneously enables us to act flexibly, should value-generating M&A targets and venture opportunities emerge in the coming months and quarters.\nIn addition, I think we should say that this also enables us to let our shareholders apart from the very strong share price development we have seen participate appropriately in the company's success. We, therefore, continue our attractive and sustainable dividend policy also for the financial year 2023 with a proposed dividend of EUR 0.48 per share. And this corresponds to a year-over-year increase of approximately 7% and marks the 11th consecutive increase.\nOn Page 11, you will now find the development of our 4 segments during the fiscal year 2023. Let's start from the left with our largest segment design, we achieved a strong revenue growth of 9.7% on a currency-adjusted basis, despite a continued difficult market environment and at the segments accelerated move to subscription driven, for example, as mentioned by the start of the transition of our third biggest design brand, Vectorworks.\nConsequently, the subscription and SaaS revenues of the Design segment grew clearly over-proportionally by 46%, and the EBITDA margin reached 28.4%. Going forward, and as expected, the performance of our Build segment reflects that our largest brand within the Nemetschek Group, Bluebeam was going through the midst of its move to a subscription and SaaS model in 2023.\nNevertheless, the slight top line growth with a plus of 4.8% on a currency adjusted basis as well as under these circumstances, continued high profitability of 35% show the resilient customer demand, especially in the US as well as our high internal operational efficiency, especially in the fourth quarter, with Bluebeam coming out of the transition trough and helped by a substantially lower comparison base, the segment recorded a strong FX adjusted growth of 16%.\nGoing forward to the Media segment, we felt the negative effects here of the long-lasting strikes in the film and TV industry in Hollywood that thankfully ended in 2023, but where we could still see some lagging effects in Q4. And for the full year, however, the currency adjusted revenues grew by 8.6%, while the underlying subscription revenue increased by more than 20%. So in addition, the segment's profitability of 38.7% continued to be clearly above group average.\nSo the last but not least on this page, our smaller segment managed reported revenues of EUR 59 million, a growth of 9.8% at constant currencies. Our continued investments into our digital twin business unit as well as into future growth opportunities to position this segment optimally for long-term growth, thanks to several megatrends such as screen buildings and energy efficiency weighted on the segment's profitability in 2023. We now come to what is arguably the most important slide in our entire presentation on Page 12.\nSo it comprehensively summarizes the financial results of one of our key strategic priorities, our highly successful transition to a subscription and SaaS-centric business model. As you can see here on this page, on the left-hand side, we are proud to report that by the end of 2023, the share of recurring revenues reached 77%. This is a new record high and an increase of almost 11 percentage points year-over-year.\nThis development was mainly driven by a strong expansion in the share of subscription and SaaS revenues, which almost doubled over the last 2 years and now accounts for 35% of our total revenues. But looking at the right hand of the slide, you can see the corresponding growth of each of these types of revenues in the last quarter. One important operational KPI during the transition is the annual recurring revenues, and that continued to grow over proportionately to EUR 719 million, a plus of 26.7% on a currency adjusted basis.\nAnd as you probably already know, our ARR definition includes all types of recurring revenues, so also the maintenance contracts. That means if we were to strip out the maintenance part, the underlying subscription and SaaS growth, in ARR would have been even substantially higher to be precise, the subscription and SaaS part of our business increased in line with our strategy by an impressive 61% on reported and 66% on a currency adjusted basis in Q4.\nSo as expected, with the termination of the license sales for existing customers at Bluebeam as well as the ongoing transitions of several of our design brands, our license revenue fell steeply by 37%. This is, however, absolutely in line with our plans. As a result, this more volatile revenue category now accounted for only 19% at the end of 2023.\nI therefore believe that with our increase in recurring revenue, the continuous expansion of our global presence and our constant focus on operational excellence, we have made great progress in 2023 towards an even more robust and resilient business model, and we are well shaped for the future. To conclude our financial review for the financial year 2023. We provide a more comprehensive overview of our most important P&L items on Page 13.\nAs you can see here, and we have already addressed our most important KPIs, revenue growth, ARR and EBITDA in detail. However, looking closer at the development of our biggest cost components, you will see that we ensure that our OpEx base increase at a very reasonable rate while going through the transition.\nFor example, if we take a closer look at the largest component with a share of more than 42% of our overall cost base being the personnel cost, you will see that they have increased only by 7% year-on-year. Given the strong wage inflation we are seeing in many industries, we managed to keep the increase at a moderate level while continuing to hire in selected areas and without any kind of large-scale layoffs you have seen across many players in the software industry.\nSo looking at our cash flow generation over the last 12 months, you'll notice that despite a flattish earnings development, we still managed to grow our free cash flow substantially by more than 30% year-on-year. This increase was driven by a reduction in CapEx that came from an extraordinary high level last year, but also a strong improvement in working capital due to an increase in our recurring revenues.\nThis, once again, does not only underpin the high quality of our earnings but also shows one of the many benefits of our transition to our subscription and SaaS-centric business model. And with that, I hand it back over to you, Yves.\n\nYves Padrines\n\nCEO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Louise. Now as we are already coming to the end of our presentation, I would like to turn to our outlook for the current fiscal year 2024 as well as our ambitions for the following year 2025 on Page #15. As we have demonstrated on the previous slides, we have already made great progress in laying the foundation for the company's next phase of growth.\nAlready today, our business model is characterized by a strong resilience. This resilience is based on the high proportion of our recurring revenue and a strong global diversification. Combined with the tremendous growth opportunities in the global AEC/O industry, which is only at the beginning of a long-term transformation towards a more efficient, environmentally friendly and resource-saving way of building, we look very confident into the future.\nTherefore, based on these strong fundamentals, we expect an attractive growth at a high profitability in 2024 also. So even despite the still challenging market and [indiscernible] and the ongoing transition of our business model to subscription and shaft models and its accounting-related dampening effect on the revenue and earnings. In particular, that means that from today's perspective, the Executive Board expects a revenue growth at constant currency of 10% to 11%.\nThis is in line with our ambition, which we published 1 year ago and even despite the substantially higher growth and, therefore, also comparison base that we achieved in 2023. In addition, the EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 30% to 31%. The ARR growth is expected to be around 25%. As a result, the share of recurring revenues is expected to reach around 85% by the end of the year. Furthermore, our ambition for 2025 is unchanged. Following the successful transition of the majority of our business to subscription and SaaS models by 2025, we expect a further acceleration of growth to [indiscernible] at least in the mid-teens, so significantly above the market growth.\nIn summary, I therefore strongly believe that we are very well positioned to enter the next growth phase of our company and continue the more than 60 years success story of the Nemetschek Group in the coming years and decades. And with that said, I would like to thank you for your attention, and we are now happy to take your questions. So operator, please back to you."

(Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call -- conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please, go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining Newmont's fourth quarter results and 2023 guidance call.\nToday, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson; and Brian Tabolt, our Interim CFO, along with other members of our executive team, and we will all be available to answer questions at the end of the call.\nBefore I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. We have quite a bit to cover this morning, so I wanted to give you an overview of the topics we'll be sharing.\nFirst, I'll cover the highlights for '22 and our strong finish to the year. Then I'll pass to Brian to take us through the financials. Next, Rob will walk us through our operational results for the fourth quarter and give a preview of what to expect this year from each of our operations and our 2 key projects. I'll then summarize our 2023 and longer-term outlook, along with our capital allocation strategy and the expectations for our 2023 dividend. And finally, I'll wrap up with some comments on our proposed combination with Newcrest.\nSo with that, let's get started with our 2022 highlights. Newmont finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, leveraging our scale, our teams and our unmatched portfolio of world-class assets to deliver industry-leading ESG, operational and financial results. We are well positioned to continue leading the sector whilst remaining firmly grounded in our values and driven by our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable, responsible mining.\nAt Newmont, when we talk about being a values-driven organization, we have at the very core of this work the protection of the health and safety of our workforce. This simply must be at the heart of any sustainable and responsible mining business. And perhaps the most important thing to share with you today is that we have remained fatality-free for over 4 years. We remain committed to continuously improve our disciplined and dedicated approach to safety, maintaining a clear focus on eliminating the risks that could lead to a fatality.\nWe do this through the globally consistent management of the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent a fatality. Last year, we completed more than 620,000 interactions by our leaders in the field that were focused on these controls, a process that we call critical control verifications. This was an increase of more than 30% over the previous year, demonstrating the importance that we place on visible felt leadership to maintain a safe environment at every one of our 12 managed operations, our major projects, and our exploration sites around the world.\nWe also continued the work to improve the effectiveness of our critical control verifications through increased coaching and development of our frontline leaders. And last year, more than 50 Newmont leaders from across the world participated in field-based fatality risk and culture reviews at sites that they do not typically work at. The purpose of these reviews is to identify any systemic issues or improvement opportunities at our managed operations.\nAs a direct consequence of all of this work, in 2022, we experienced a 36% reduction in the number of significant potential events from the previous year. However, health and safety is an area where you must always maintain a sense of chronic needs. We still experience at least one significant potential event every 10 days, and each and every one of these are an opportunity to learn and improve.\nAt Newmont, we've recognized that a strong safety culture is not only an indicator of a reliable, well-run business, it is fundamental to sustainably delivering on our commitments to our employees, our contractor partners, our local communities and all of our stakeholders.\nNewmont delivered a strong fourth quarter, safely meeting our commitments in '22 and finishing the year in a position of strength with momentum coming into '23. We met our original guidance for production set back in December '21 producing an industry-leading 6 million ounces of gold and 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. We ended the year in line with our guidance ranges for unit costs as we continue to manage our exposure to the global pressures on input prices and labor costs that have impacted the entire mining industry. These results generated $4.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $3.2 billion in cash from continuing operations, with $1.1 billion in free cash flow after reinvesting $2.7 billion into our business last year.\nAs a key part of that reinvestment, exploration has always been and continues to be a core competency at Newmont. It is a critical component of our long-term strategy. This morning, we announced that our global reserve base now sits at 96 million ounces, and we have successfully replaced depletion for the year.\nIn fact, in the almost 4 years since we acquired Goldcorp and established the joint venture in Nevada, we have replaced all of our depletion with strong reserve additions. As well as our robust base of gold reserves, we also reported nearly 600 million ounces of silver reserves and 16 billion pounds of copper reserves, providing natural exposure for a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions.\nThroughout 2022, we maintained a strong, flexible investment-grade balance sheet whilst continuing to reinvest in our future and providing shareholder returns of more than $1.7 billion through our established dividend framework. These results along with our stable financial position and strong free cash flow from the world's largest attributable gold production base as Newmont positioned to safely deliver on our commitments in 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it across to Brian to take us through our financial results for the fourth quarter.\n\nBrian C. Tabolt\n\nInterim CFO & Executive VP, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the financial highlights for the quarter. Newmont had a strong finish to the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $3.2 billion in revenue, driven by higher sales volumes and strong gold prices. Adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.2 billion and an impressive $4.6 billion for the full year despite historically high and industry-wide inflationary pressures. And strong free cash flow of $364 million.\nIt is worth noting that fourth quarter free cash flow included nearly $650 million of capital spend, an increase of more than $200 million from the fourth quarter of last year, as we are now firmly in a period of meaningful reinvestment. This demonstrated commitment to reinvestment is a core component of Newmont's clear strategy to progress the most profitable projects in our industry-leading organic pipeline, further strengthening Newmont's portfolio for the long term. Compared to the third quarter, Newmont delivered strong top line performance with a 16% increase in gold sales driven off the back of a strong fourth quarter production and an improved realized gold price of $1,758 per ounce.\nHowever, fourth quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million or $1.87 per share, driven by approximately $2 billion of noncash accounting adjustments. These adjustments, which are further detailed in our earnings release and 10-K, include $700 million of noncash reclamation adjustments primarily related to higher estimated closure costs at Yanacocha and Porcupine resulting from cost inflation and increased water management costs and nonoperating portions of the sites, and $1.3 billion of noncash impairments, which were comprised of approximately $500 million of asset impairments of CC&V and $800 million of goodwill impairments at Cerro Negro and Porcupine.\nThe site-specific goodwill amounts originated from the Goldcorp purchase price allocation 4 years ago, which was based on best estimates of each site's value and country risk assumptions at that time. It should be noted that incrementally more value has been generated at Peñasquito than was originally allocated at the time. As Peñasquito alone has since delivered more than $700 million in annual synergies, far exceeding the value of these noncash targets.\nTaking these adjustments into account, along with other immaterial items, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $348 million or $0.44 per diluted share, which despite slightly higher costs from inventory write-downs and royalties, represents an increase of $0.17 from the previous quarter.\nDelivered by our balanced global portfolio, these strong results demonstrate Newmont's continued financial strength and stability, enabling us to be flexible and resilient as we continue to generate long-term value for our shareholders heading into 2023.\nNow I'll hand it over to Rob for an update on our operational results for the fourth quarter and a preview of 2023.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, our team safely delivered an exceptional finish to the year, and we're very proud of what our 30,000 strong Newmont team was able to achieve during 2022, despite the very challenging and volatile operating environment that the whole mining industry was navigating.\nToday, I'll cover the site level highlights for the fourth quarter along with an overview of what to expect in 2023 from each of our operations and our 2 key development projects. So turning to the next slide. Let's get started with Peñasquito.\nWhen we acquired Goldcorp in 2019, we committed to delivering synergies of $365 million per year by applying the Newmont operating model to deliver value from G&A, supply chain and most importantly, the implementation of our proven, full potential continuous improvement program. Peñasquito alone has blown that target out of the water, delivering more than $700 million in annual synergies since we closed the acquisition nearly 4 years ago.\nOur core capability at Newmont is safely operating Tier 1 open pit and underground mines, and over 80% of this value was delivered from mining and processing improvements, and we have not stopped yet. Peñasquito delivered a strong fourth quarter, setting a new record in December for the tons we moved ex pit and exceeding our full year production guidance for the third consecutive year under the Newmont operating model.\nDuring the fourth quarter, mining was primarily from the Chile, Colorado pit, as planned, resulting in lower gold grades and higher levels of silver, lead and zinc content. And as we progress this year, we expect this mining sequence and trend to continue at our 2 pit polymetallic mine, as previously communicated and in line with our long-term mine plans.\nIn the first quarter, we expect gold grade to decline more than 20% compared to the fourth quarter due to this mine sequence. And for the year, we expect gold production to be around 25% lower than 2022, whilst our gold equivalent ounces will be steady year-on-year.\nIn South America, Yanacocha delivered slightly higher production during the fourth quarter compared to quarter 3. With higher production expected in 2023 from higher leach recoveries due to the continued use of injection leaching, we continue to progress our review of the scope and the pace of the sulfides project and expect to spend approximately $300 million to $350 million of development capital in 2023 and again in 2024. This spend is related to advanced engineering, procurement and completing camp construction.\nAt Merian, the site delivered its highest quarterly production in 2 years due to record mill performance, combined with higher grades mined from both the Maraba and Merian 2 Pit. Merian is expected to deliver lower production and higher unit costs in 2023 as we begin stripping the next phase of the Merian pit, resulting in lower grades presenting to the mill as part of our planned mine sequence for the site.\nIn particular, in the first quarter, we expect grades to decline more than 15% compared to quarter 4 as we enter the stripping campaign. And finally, at Cerro Negro, the site delivered another solid quarter due to higher grade and strong mill performance. Production from Cerro Negro is expected to steadily increase each quarter in 2023 due to sustained productivity improvements from our Newmont operating model. This will result in progressively higher tons mined and process throughout the year.\nWe continue to progress the first wave of district expansions at Cerro Negro, which will contribute to the higher production this year. And we just hit an important milestone with the first blast to commence development at the Silica Cap portal.\nIn December, this project received approval for $200 million that will be spent over the next 2 years to develop Cerro Negro's future through both the Marianas and Eastern Districts. And these funds will primarily be spent on underground development activities. This investment will extend mine life beyond 2030, and we expect to see annual production increase to above 350,000 ounces beginning in 2024.\nSince we acquired Cerro Negro nearly 4 years ago, we've improved underground development rates by more than 50% and doubled the size of our land package to over 1,000 square kilometers, demonstrating both our operating capability and our confidence in the untapped growth potential from this highly prospective gold district in Argentina.\nIn North America, our Canadian operations all delivered higher production in quarter 4, a combined increase of 30,000 ounces compared to quarter 3 due to strong grades and improved productivity.\nAt Eleonore, we finished 2022 with the strongest quarterly performance of the year. And importantly, key roles are all filled, and the team is ready to deliver higher ounces in 2023. This increase is largely driven by sustained productivity improvements as higher underground mining rates and strong mill performance will offset the lower grades coming through.\nAt Musselwhite, we delivered our best quarterly performance in terms of gold production, development meters and total tonnes mined in more than 5 years. We anticipate production in 2023 to be weighted around 65% to the second half of the year, steadily increasing each quarter as mining continues in the PQ deeps area.\nPorcupine delivered its strongest quarterly performance of the year and annual production is expected to slightly improve in 2023 due to higher tonnes mined and higher grade. We continue to progress the project to replace production from the Hollinger pit production with a layback of the Pamour pit. An investment decision is now expected in late '23 as we've been able to implement improvements to extend the life of the Hollinger pit.\nAnd at CC&V, we achieved our highest December production in over 3 years, resulting in a solid fourth quarter for higher tonnes mined and placed on our leach pads. Production in 2023 is expected to decrease slightly due to lower grades as we extend mine life through the stripping of a layback in the Globe Hill pit.\nIn 2023, our 4 North American operations are expected to deliver nearly 1 million ounces of gold. This increase over 2022 will be safely delivered by a strong leadership team of experienced general managers who are in place, a stable workforce and without the challenges and constraints from COVID that we had to navigate through during the first half of last year.\nBoddington delivered an exceptionally strong quarter. with 20% higher gold production and more than 50% higher copper production compared to quarter 3. We set 2 important records in the fourth quarter, a new all-time monthly production record in December for both gold and copper on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance, and the best quarterly performance for our autonomous haul truck fleet for the tonnes moved per hour, a key metric for every open pit mine.\nReaching these important milestones at a cornerstone operation like Boddington is a tremendous achievement, and we are proud of the hard work and dedication that our team has demonstrated in implementing leading technologies to promote both safety and productivity. The lessons we have learned will benefit not only Newmont but the gold industry as a whole, and we will look to leverage this technology and our experience at Boddington as we expand the use of autonomous solutions across our global business.\nIn 2023, gold production is expected to remain steady compared to 2022, as continued strong mill performance and the tonnes mined offset lower grade associated with further stripping in Boddington South Pit.\nTanami maintained strong production throughout the year and reliably delivered a solid fourth quarter from higher tonnes mined combined with higher grades despite an extreme weather event and record rainfall across Northwest Australia late in the quarter. Gold production is expected to be lower in 2023 and 2024 due to lower grades from the planned stope sequencing to allow for the underground construction of the crushing and conveying infrastructure associated with the Tanami Expansion project.\nDue to the extreme weather events and associated flooding the main access route for supplies to Tanami and Tanami track has been closed from late December through mid-February. And although our fourth quarter was largely unaffected by this event, critical consumables such as cyanide, explosives and other regions that can only come to site by road have not been able to be delivered over the last 6 to 8 weeks, and we have consumed the stocks that we maintained on site.\nAs a consequence, we had to cease milling operations at Tanami over the last few weeks, and this will have an impact on gold production for the first quarter. However, the bottleneck at Tanami is the mining operation, not the milling plant, and mining has continued throughout this period with the ore being stockpiled in front of the mill.\nWe restart the mill tomorrow and expect to recover the ounces that will be delayed from Q1, but that now means that we will have a production profile this year that will be strongly weighted to the second half. And with this impact, we expect only around 10% of Tanami's 2023 gold production to be delivered during the first quarter.\nWe also continued to progress the expansion at Tanami. Overall progress is now at 50% with engineering and procurement effectively complete, protecting the project from any new inflationary or supply chain challenges in the coming years. 373 meters of concrete lining has now been installed in the upper part of the 1,500 meter deep shaft, and this furnishing of the shaft continues to be the critical [patchwork] for the project.\nUnderground development for the project has largely been completed with crusher and conveyor chambers, all fully excavated and ready for construction of infrastructure to commence.\nAnd as I signaled last July, following the completion of the 4 important project milestones of shaft reaming, headframe construction, underground development and the opening of state and international borders in Australia, we would assess project capital cost and schedule.\nWe are expecting total capital costs of between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion and the project completion in the second half of 2025. This is consistent with the direction we provided last July.\nTanami Expansion 2 remains a key project in Newmont's portfolio and underpins Tanami's future as a long-life, low-cost producer well into the 2040s.\nTurning to Africa. Our 2 operations in Ghana delivered this year's strongest quarterly performance in Q4, increasing production by more than 45,000 ounces compared to Q3. In December, a team delivered its strongest monthly production in 7 years on the back of higher tonnes mined, higher grades and strong mill performance.\nIn 2023, Akyem is expected to deliver lower production as we progress stripping of the next layback in the pit. And as a consequence, 2023 gold production will be around 20% lower than last year as a result of lower grades. Ore grade is expected to decline by more than 40% in Q1 compared to Q4.\nMoving across the Ahafo, the mill achieved record throughput during the fourth quarter benefiting from higher grade and mining rates as Subika Underground really starts to hit its stride.\nIn 2023, gold production from Ahafo was expected to steadily increase each quarter as we open up more draw points in the Subika Underground, lifting mining rates and resulting in the delivery of more higher grade ore to the mill over the course of the year.\nAs a consequence, gold production will be strongly weighted to the second half of the year with around 15% of the year's production to be delivered in the first quarter. And I'm pleased to announce that we are making great progress with our new mine in Ghana at Ahafo North, where we gained land access and have commenced construction and highway relocation activities.\nAhafo North expands our existing footprint in the Ahafo complex, adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life. And when combined with Ahafo South just 30 kilometers away, we expect to deliver an average of 850,000 -- 350,000 -- we expect to deliver an average of 850,000 gold ounces per year through until at least 2030 from our Ahafo complex.\nLeaning into one of Newmont's core capabilities. We have conducted extensive regulatory and community engagements to ensure that from the very start of this project, we earn and maintain social acceptance. The process of engagement is critical work that cannot and must not be rushed. There's an African proverb that we consistently apply at Newmont, if you want to go fast, you go alone. If you want to go far, we go together.\nAnd as I signaled last July, gaining land access and commencing construction activities was a key milestone for us to reach in order to assess project capital cost and schedule. We are expecting total capital costs of between $950 million and $1.05 billion and project completion in the second half of 2025. This is consistent with the direction we provided last July.\nWe remain very excited about Ahafo North and look forward to bringing you updates as we develop this new mine over the next 2 years and create value from the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa.\nFinally, to our 2 non-managed joint ventures. Our 38.5% ownership of Nevada Gold Mines and 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 1.45 million ounces of attributable gold production in 2022. For Nevada Gold Mines, disappointingly, fourth quarter and full year production fell below the lower end of the guidance range and above the higher end for costs that were provided by Barrick in November 2022.\nHowever, most concerning was that these 2 non-managed joint ventures have experienced 3 tragic fatalities over the last 12 months. As for the 2023 guidance provided last week by Barrick, gold production is expected to increase by around 10% from both Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo in 2023. Both of these joint ventures are core to the Newmont portfolio, and we look forward to our managing partners safely, delivering on their 2023 commitments.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Tom.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. So bringing everything that Rob just covered together, we finished '22 strongly, and we are bringing that momentum into this year. As we've been signaling for some time, in 2023, we are expecting to produce around 6 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of around $1,200 an ounce. Sustaining capital lifts to around $1.1 billion. Exploration and advanced project spend will be around $500 million, and we will see our highest development capital spend in a generation at around $1.3 billion. At Newmont, we developed our business plans with discipline around the assumptions we make.\nIn 2023, we anticipate that the current economic environment will continue to be volatile. And with this context, I believe that it is particularly important to understand the sensitivity of our free cash flow and all-in sustaining costs to the key assumptions we have made.\nWe have taken a conservative view of gold price for 2023 and are assuming $1,700 an ounce. This table provides our sensitivities to other metal prices, oil as well as the Australian and Canadian exchange rates. For '23, we have assumed normalizing levels of inflation as we progress through the year with an assumption that the year-over-year escalation rate will be around 3%. And as we do each year, we expect that this escalation will be offset by our ongoing discipline in delivering on full potential improvements.\nThis year, we are also including a guide on the sensitivity to our 3 main cost areas. 50% of our direct costs are labor, an area under continued pressure in our mining industry. We have assumed our labor costs will increase 4.5% compared to last year before returning to more historical levels, and we are keeping a close eye on contract labor, which tends to be much more volatile.\nMaterials and consumables account for the next 30%. We are seeing input prices for cyanide and explosives beginning to normalize with improvements in global supply chain performance. In addition, the price of the steel we use for grinding media and spare parts is now in line with last year's average prices. These 2 categories, along with fuel and energy, remain highly volatile and impacted by the many macroeconomic events the world is experiencing.\nHigh levels of inflation have a material impact on our unit costs, and we will continue to remain transparent with the market as we monitor the inflationary environment over the coming months.\nTurning now to seasonality on the next slide. We anticipate that gold production this year will be weighted 55% to the second half, driven by Ahafo, Tanami, Peñasquito and Cerro Negro, as Rob just explained. Q1 is expected to be our lowest gold production quarter with approximately 21% of annual production. However, we expect to have relatively steady spending for both our sustaining and development capital throughout the year. We anticipate that production will increase and unit costs will decline each quarter as the year progresses.\nTurning to our 5-year outlook on the next slide. Supported by the industry's most robust, balanced and diverse portfolio of operations and projects, we expect to deliver strong gold production and improving unit costs over the next 5 years, bringing our all-in sustaining cost to around $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce by 2025. This cost improvement will be driven by strong production from our world-class assets, Boddington, Tanami, the Ahafo and Peñasquito, combined with the delivery of new low-cost ounces from our investments in Ahafo North, Tanami Expansion 2 and the district expansions at Cerro Negro.\nOur near-term cost reductions are also supported by the delivery of full potential cost and productivity improvements across our 12 managed operations. This solid outlook, combined with the strength of our team and the quality of our assets, has the ability to generate substantial, attributable cash flows throughout the gold price cycle, allowing us to confidently execute on our capital allocation priorities and maintain our position as the world's leading gold company.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear and balanced strategy. First and foremost, to maintain the industry's strongest balance sheet with financial strength and flexibility; second, to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth; and finally, to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends. I'll take a moment to step through each of these priorities, explaining their significance to Newmont and how they work together in order for us to deliver a long-term stable outlook.\nStarting with our first priority. Newmont has maintained an investment-grade balance sheet with financial strength and flexibility to ensure we have the right balance between resilience, returns and the ability to react. We have made deliberate efforts over the last few years to build the industry's strongest balance sheet, growing our cash balances to $3.7 billion with total liquidity of $6.7 billion and no debt due until 2029.\nThis robust platform has allowed Newmont to enter the current phase of the commodity cycle in a uniquely strong financial position, enabling us to be resilient and agile in times of market instability.\nOur second priority is to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth, ensuring that our current and future reserve and resource position can continue to support our industry-leading portfolio of operations and projects.\nOur long-term outlook assumes annual investment of around $1 billion to $1.2 billion in sustaining capital, around $400 million to $500 million in exploration and studies, and around $800 million to $1 billion in development capital.\nCombined, this is an average annual investment of around $2.5 billion, a critical component in Newmont's strategy to sustain strong production levels and improved margins over the long term. And as I mentioned, we are currently in a period of meaningful reinvestment continuing to expand the projects that we have in execution including the expansion at Tanami and our new mine at Ahafo North.\nDue to the higher capital spend anticipated this year, you might expect to reinvest approximately $2.9 million in 2023, which is around $400 million higher than our average annual investment. And it's also important to note that these numbers exclude our equity method contributions to support the Pueblo Viejo expansion.\nThis level of reinvestment is key to maintaining our strong production profile for the next 10, 20, 30 years. Our portfolio of operations and organic project pipeline will produce more than 6 million ounces of attributable gold each year through until at least 2032, the most of any company in our industry. This profile has been further enhanced by the production of approximately 1 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Importantly, the majority of this metal production comes from the most favorable mining jurisdictions balanced across 12 finished operations, 2 non-managed joint ventures in 9 countries around the world. And it is this strength and scale that enables Newmont to confidently execute on a clear and consistent long-term strategy to deliver value to our workforce, our local communities and to our shareholders.\nThen our final capital allocation priority is to return excess cash to shareholders, which is primarily done through our industry-leading dividend framework. Recognizing the importance of shareholder returns 2.5 years ago, Newmont was the first in the gold industry to introduce a structured dividend framework. This framework provides shareholders with a stable base dividend of $1 per share, set at gold reserve price of $1,400 per ounce and a variable component based on incremental free cash flow above that base assumption.\nAs we do each year, we have evaluated the 2023 dividend payout in conjunction with our annual business planning process. The expected range for dividends to be paid this year is $1.40 to $1.80 per share and this range has been calibrated at a conservative $1,700 gold price.\nAnticipated incremental free cash flow in 2023 has been adjusted to incorporate the current input costs being experienced across the mining industry from unprecedented levels of global inflation. The $400 million of higher capital spend above our long-term average, and considering the strength of our balance sheet during this period of meaningful reinvestment.\nTaking all of this considerations into account, and in line with what we have discussing since our last earnings call in October, this morning we declared our fourth quarter dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis. This continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector and within the top 80% of large cap dividend payers in the S&P 500.\nWith this dividend declared, Newmont will have returned over $4 billion to shareholders through dividends since introducing our framework in October 2020, maintaining a dividend yield above 3% for 9 consecutive quarters.\nOur proven track record of returning cash to shareholders clearly demonstrates our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and the balanced long-term approach that we apply to our capital allocation strategy, ensuring that Newmont is well positioned to create value for many decades to come.\nSo I've just taken you through the gold industry's strongest business. Now from that solid foundation, let me walk you through the value proposition for our potential combination with Newcrest. Before I begin, please understand that other than these prepared remarks, I'm not able to provide any further details about the new press proposal at this time as this is a live engagement.\nOur proposal would combine 2 of the sector's top senior gold producers and set the standard for sustainable and responsible gold mining. Newmont has a long history and shared heritage with Newcrest, establishing our Australian subsidiary way back in 1966, a subsidiary that would become Newcrest some 25 years later.\nAs part of that shared history, our companies also have shared commitments to a strong safety culture and leading ESG practices, which is in addition to the complementary portfolios of world-class assets located in low-risk mining jurisdictions.\nOur proposed combination would strengthen our established position in Australia, creating efficiencies and value with a shared workforce and large-scale supply chain optimization opportunities. And it would build upon the district potential in British Columbia's highly prospective Golden Triangle through a combination of operating mines and development projects that would deliver value through shared technology, local capabilities and ore body experience.\nWith our scale, and track record of successfully managing some of the mining World's top Tier 1 assets, this combination would leverage Newmont's experience from the Goldcorp acquisition, which demonstrated that we can generate meaningful improvements to performance, stability and profitability, especially at large open pit and underground operations.\nWe have delivered more than $1 billion in annual synergies from our Goldcorp acquisition in 2019, far surpassing our initial estimate of $365 million and improving the ongoing performance of the acquired assets through Newmont's operating model.\nAt Peñasquito alone, we have generated over $700 million of annual synergies by optimizing the processing plant and mining fleet while sustainably addressing community relations issues that have disrupted that site for over a decade. And as a reminder, upon completion of the Goldcorp acquisition, we focused on optimizing the combined portfolio, completing asset sales of more than $1.5 billion from that combined portfolio within the first 12 months.\nAnd given the challenges that the mining industry is currently facing from a volatile macroeconomic environment, there has never been a better time for Newmont and Newcrest to come together.\nWe are disappointed that the Newcrest Board rejected our proposal, and we are currently engaging with the Newcrest team in relation to their offer to provide us access to more information. And if we can reach an agreement, this combination of industry-leading talent and decades of collective experience would create significant value across the global business with an ideal mix of gold and copper, strengthening Newmont's overall position as the world's leading gold company.\nAs I indicated, I will not be able to make -- provide any further details on the Newcrest proposal at this time as this is a live engagement. But I want to be clear with everyone on today's call that we will continue to be disciplined as we assess all of the options to move forward, and we will act in the best interest of our shareholders.\nThank you. And with that, I'll now turn it over to the operator to open the lines up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Tom, please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining Newmont's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team, and we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.\nBefore I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont delivered a solid second quarter, as we continue to differentiate ourselves through our leading portfolio of assets and projects, our proven integrated operating model, our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation and most importantly, our value has driven commitment to our purpose of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining.\nUnderpinned by these key differentiators and guided by a clear and consistent strategy, Newmont remains well positioned to safely manage through the evolving and unprecedented challenges that our industry and the world at large face.\nDuring the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.5 million ounces of gold, an increase of over 150,000 ounces from the first quarter and as expected. In addition, we produced more than 330,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, bringing us to well over 1.8 million gold equivalent ounces for the quarter from our balanced global portfolio.\nWe generated significant operating cash flow of $1 billion and free cash flow of $514 million, an improvement of more than $260 million from the first quarter. With $7.3 billion in total liquidity, we have maintained an investment-grade balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, preserving our financial flexibility whilst we continue to invest in our most profitable organic projects and return cash to shareholders.\nIn June, we completed the acquisition of Sumitomo's interest in Yanacocha, bringing Newmont's ownership in this operation and the exciting Sulfide project to 100%. And last week, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.55, maintaining an attractive dividend yield of between 3% and 4% for the last 7 consecutive quarters. Set within our established industry-leading framework and calibrated at an $1,800 gold price, our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of both our portfolio and our operating model to deliver sustainable long-term value.\nIn May, we published our second annual climate report, part of the suite of reports and our company's nonfinancial performance. To address climate change and make a real impact, we will need to leverage Newmont's leading ESG practices, our integrating operating model and the scale and mine life of our global portfolio. These are all important components, not only for creating long-term value but also for addressing the critical issues that our industry must solve, none more important than the elimination of fatalities.\nSafety is a core company value, and it is at the very heart of operating any sustainable business. I expect it to be the first consideration before anyone begins work at any Newmont location ensuring that our workforce returns home safely after each and every shift. We have continued our disciplined and dedicated approach to safety, maintaining a clear focus on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities.\nDuring the second quarter, we completed 155,000 conversations by leaders in the field that were focused on these critical controls. Two years ago, we commissioned mobile technology to gather consistent data globally around these important discussions, which we call critical control verifications. And I'm pleased to say that since then, our leaders have now completed more than 800,000 of these conversations.\nOver the last 3 years, Newmont has continued to evolve our approach to safety across our global business, improving our fatality risk management program to ensure it is as effective and as insightful as possible. By combining our learnings from significant potential events and critical control verification data, we are now able to gain a deep understanding of the mortality risks of each operation and importantly, what is needed to be done to reduce these risks.\nAt Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations, along with a pipeline of more than 20 organic projects with the scale and mine life to deliver strong long-term results. Newmont will produce more than 6 million ounces of gold each year and almost 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Combined, that is nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces every year for at least the next decade, the most of any company in our industry.\nAmong our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, nearly 9% of our attributable gold production comes from top-tier jurisdictions because we firmly believe that where we choose to invest and operate matters. And underpinning our portfolio is a robust foundation of reserves and resources, which combined with the gold industry's best organic project pipeline provides the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s.\nWe are in a period of meaningful reinvestment as we continue to advance our near-term projects, including the second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory, the development of Ahafo North in Ghana and the Yanacocha Sulfides project, the next exciting chapter in Newmont's long and profitable journey in Peru.\nAnd in addition to our 3 near-term projects, Newmont has a deep pipeline of longer-term projects that represent growth opportunities for later in this decade and beyond. These projects and operations are managed through a proven integrated operating model with a strong track record of delivering long-term value to all of our stakeholders.\nNewmont's operating model is built upon the fundamental principle that the whole is worth more than the sum of the individual parts, and it is strongly supported by our full potential continuous improvement program, a program that is at leading place for over 8 years and is more important today than it has ever been.\nOur team is taking the lessons learned during the pandemic to address the challenges that our industry faces today, including tight labor markets, inflation and supply chain disruptions. As the world is reacting to these pressures, we are actively deploying strategies to reduce our exposure.\nOur global supply chain team is leveraging our scale and the strong partnerships we have developed over many years with our key suppliers and equipment manufacturers. As the industry leader, we have best-in-class pricing as well as sophisticated rise in full formulas built into our long-term contracts to reduce both volatility and mitigate logistical constraints in order to prevent disruption in our operations.\nAnd whilst we can't talk about specific contracts, several of our major equipment and part suppliers have recently issued comprehensive price increases for the industry that range from 15% to 30%. However, through the efforts of our global supply chain team, we have negotiated lower price increases, in some cases, of only 3% to 5% for the coming year.\nIn addition to this, we are challenging the gold industry by implementing new technology to improve productivity and reduce labor risk, such as our transition last year to a fully autonomous haul truck fleet at Boddington. We are leveraging our full potential program, which has been instrumental in delivering value during these unprecedented times, helping to offset the impacts from current market conditions. And we are utilizing real-time data and our global team of subject matter experts to share knowledge and talent across our global portfolio, providing critical insights and driving improved performance that our operating teams simply cannot achieve on their own.\nIt's one of the most tangible examples of this. We have designed and implemented 3 operational support networks, covering our core areas of mining, processing and asset management. These global networks bring together our technical experts from around the world, providing 24-hour monitoring, coaching and support through a consistent platform.\nIn the mining industry, we traditionally expect our frontline leaders to obtain their own data and insights as they manage everything involved in safely leading a team of people at the start, during and end of a shift. Through our support networks, we help our leaders by monitoring operational performance and providing insights into the areas that need their attention, saving time, improving focus and removing the need for so many people at our mine sites. And by offering a more flexible work environment, Newmont is able to attract the best talent from within and beyond our industry, creating a more diverse, motivated and highly skilled team to coach and support not one, but all of our operations.\nIn addition to our dedicated and disciplined approach to cost management, you can also expect that we will remain transparent about what we are experiencing today and what we're anticipating in the future from this unprecedented environment. Over the last 8 months, we have observed cost pressures, including the impact from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an increasingly competitive labor market and the highest global inflation rates are well as seen in nearly 40 years.\nAs a consequence, we are anticipating an additional 7% of cost escalation this year. That is on top of the 5%, we had already included in our full year outlook we established last December. Around 1/3 of this increase is related to labor costs. We are seeing contracted services rates that are more than 10% higher than December last year, driven primarily by strong competition for specialized labor, higher levels of post-pandemic accretion resulting in high demand and the pass-through of higher commodity prices and transportation costs.\nThe next 1/3 of the impact comes from an increase in prices for global commodities and raw materials. We're observing escalation in the range of 20% to 30% for certain items, such as cyanide and explosives, which is being driven by the increase in the price of natural gas and the availability of ammonia as well as an increase in the price of steel that is being used in our grinding media and spare parts.\nAnd the final third of the impact is coming from higher fuel and energy costs. As an example, diesel prices have increased by more than $50 per barrel, adding approximately $20 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs compared to our original guidance.\nI'll now turn it over to Rob and then Nancy, for a more detailed look at our operational and financial performance, and they will discuss how our second quarter results have been impacted by the current environment. I will then wrap up with an overview of our outlook for the remainder of this year as we remain focused on implementing productivity improvements and offsetting the impacts of these challenging market conditions.\nOver to you, Rob.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's dive into our operations and projects, starting with Africa. Our team delivered a solid performance in the second quarter due to higher ore grade and tonnes mine, in addition to strong mill performance. And the team is working to complete an open pit layback, and we expect stripping to decrease in the third quarter as we begin to restore and create future optionality for both underground and open pit growth.\nAhafo South delivered a strong second quarter performance, increasing gold production by more than 25% compared to the first quarter due to improved ore grades, higher underground and open pit ore tonnes mined and steady mill performance. And despite the challenges experienced during the first quarter from supply chain disruptions and global border closures as a result of COVID, the team continues to successfully ramp up mining rates in the Subika Underground, which Tom will discuss later on.\nWe anticipate production at Ahafo to be weighted around 60% to the second half of this year as we continue to increase underground tonnes through increased development and reach higher grades positioning Ahafo for a strong finish to the year. And finally, the team continues to progress engineering and procurement for the Ahafo North project. All of the permitting has been completed, and we are encouraged by our recent discussions as we continue the important stakeholder engagement work with local communities, traditional leaders and regulators to ensure full land access that it is properly cleared of all structures and farms.\nAs I have mentioned in previous updates, this will be an important milestone, which will give us the opportunity to update the remaining costs and schedule to develop this prolific ore body, ensuring that we can properly incorporate the impacts from this land access delay.\nAs a consequence of working through this important activity, preliminary capital costs are expected to be approximately 15% higher than our original estimate, and we are anticipating a shift in commercial production from 2024 to mid-2025. We look forward to providing additional detail later this year as we work to add profitable production from the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa.\nAnd now turning to South America. Cerro Negro delivered another strong performance in the second quarter as a result of steady ore grade and ongoing improvements to mining rates and mill performance. The team continues to advance the first wave of expansions at Cerro Negro, including the expansion of the Marianas District and the development of the Eastern District to extend existing operations beyond 2030. The development of the San Marcos decline is progressing, and we have successfully completed the first blast in the Eastern District in May of this year, an exciting accomplishment as we continue to explore and develop the district potential in Argentina.\nAt Merian, the team delivered a steady performance despite very heavy rainfall in the second quarter, impacting mine sequencing and resulting in lower ore tonnes mined and milled in addition to lower grades. We anticipate higher production in the third and fourth quarter as the rainy season comes to an end, improving mill performance and reaching higher ore grades in the second half of the year.\nAnd finally, Yanacocha continued to deliver solid production during the second quarter, accelerating ounces from the re-leaching program and improving recoveries from the use of a richer leaching solution. We anticipate production at Yanacocha to be weighted around 55% to the first half of this year as the site decreases ore tonnes mined and placed on the leach pads while we work to develop the first phase of the Sulfide project.\nEngineering is nearly 60% complete and procurement is around 45% complete, with approximately 1/3 of the local contracts already awarded. And as you can see in the picture here, the team is progressing the camp construction and the early earthworks as planned, ensuring we have in place proper combinations for our construction workforce and for future mine operations.\nThe project team is preparing for an investment decision in late 2022, and we currently expect capital spend to be around $2.5 billion from the full funds approval date with commercial production in mid-2026. We look forward to providing an update towards the end of the year, and we remain very excited about the opportunity to develop the Sulfide potential at Yanacocha.\nAnd now over to North America. Peñasquito delivered another solid quarter as higher gold and silver grades helped to offset the impact from planned mill maintenance and higher costs associated with the workforce negotiation announced earlier this month. As part of the newly established profit-sharing agreement, Newmont Peñasquito has agreed to pay an uncapped profit sharing bonus up to 10% of profits from the operation, with an expense of $70 million related to 2021 results, adding more than $65 per ounce to North America's second quarter all-in sustaining costs for gold and over $180 per ounce for coal product gold equivalent ounces.\nFor 2022, we expect the profit sharing bonus to add additional costs of around $15 million at an $1,800 gold price, adding approximately $4 per ounce to North America's all-in sustaining costs for gold and $10 per ounce for coal product gold equivalent ounces. We reached this agreement with the workforce of Peñasquito without interruption to the site, and we continue to build an aligned and valued relationship with union leadership to support the safe and viable operation of the mine well into the future.\nLooking ahead, costs are expected to stabilize as gold production from this large polymetallic mine increases in the third quarter due to higher grades delivered from the Peñasco pit, whilst coal product grades from silver, lead and zinc begin to decline in the second half of the year as planned due to mine sequencing.\nMoving to Canada. Productivity and costs continued to be impacted by ongoing challenges stemming from a very competitive labor market. In addition to these challenges, Éléonore experienced COVID-related absenteeism during the second quarter as flight capacity restrictions and strict protocols remained in place to protect the health of our First Nation communities and workforce.\nMusselwhite and Porcupine both delivered an improved performance compared to the first quarter, increasing ore tonnes mined and processed with Musselwhite delivering its best monthly performance in over 3 years. Productivity and ore grades at both sites are expected to continue improving in the second half of the year as mining in Musselwhite progresses to the north in the PQ deeps area, and Porcupine reaches higher grades from Hoyle and Borden beginning in the third quarter.\nAnd finally, at CC&V, the site delivered improved production compared to the first quarter due to higher ore tonnes mined and processed at our leach facilities. And as Tom will discuss later on, the mine is now operating as a leach-only facility with steady production from optimized ore placement and declining per unit costs for the remainder of the year.\nAnd now turning to Australia. As mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, the Western Australian border was reopened in early March, resulting in significantly higher case counts, ongoing testing requirements and strict close contact protocols throughout the state. Approximately 1/3 of the Boddington workforce and half of the Tanami workforce tested positive for COVID in the second quarter and high levels of absenteeism from positive cases and close contact isolation protocols continue to challenge productivity at both sites.\nIn addition, Australia is experiencing a tightening of the labor market as the competition for skilled workers and contracted services has intensified in recent months. Yet despite these challenges, Boddington delivered a strong second quarter performance. The team reported an increase in gold and copper production of more than 25% compared to the first quarter as higher mill throughput and grade more than offset lower tonnes mined due to inclement weather.\nPerformance from Boddington's fleet of fully autonomous haul trucks continues to improve each quarter. And for the remainder of the year, Boddington will focus on achieving record mill throughput rates and increasing tonnes mined from this cornerstone asset.\nAt Tanami, the site also delivered improved production with an increase of more than 25% compared to the first quarter due to higher ore grades, an increase in tonnes mined and improved mill performance, helping to offset the impacts from higher contracted services costs in a very competitive labor market.\nWith the ongoing challenges of securing specialized labor and contracted services, the team continues to successfully progress the second expansion at Tanami, a project that will extend mine life beyond 2040. Nearly 90% of the project engineering and procurement has been completed protecting the project from a number of inflationary pressures.\nDuring the third quarter, the team will complete the reaming of the 1.5 kilometer deep, 5.5-meter wide shaft and the installation of the head frame and hoisting infrastructure, which, as you can see here, is nearly 95% complete. And as I have mentioned in previous updates on this project, this will be an important milestone as we evaluate the remaining schedule and cost to complete the project with the key work remaining involving the concrete lining of this production shaft. This process will also ensure that we properly incorporate the significant impacts from COVID-related restrictions and protocols and the current market conditions for labor and materials.\nWe continue to operate in a very competitive labor market in the Northern Territory with significant demand from mining competitors and infrastructure initiatives throughout Australia. Based on our preliminary view, we expect capital costs to be approximately 25% higher than our prior estimate and a shift in commercial production from 2024 into early 2025. We look forward to providing additional detail later this year, and we remain excited to deliver significant pounds, cost and efficiency improvements at this world-class asset.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Let's start with a look at the financial highlights. Newmont delivered a solid performance in the second quarter with $3.1 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,836 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion and solid free cash flow of $514 million. Our strong cash flow generation allows Newmont to provide superior shareholder returns, largely to our industry-leading dividend framework.\nLast week, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, calibrated at $1,800 per ounce, demonstrating our confidence in our future outlook and our commitment to leading returns. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we're in a period of meaningful reinvestment, an essential component in growing production, improving margins and extending mine life.\nIn the second quarter, we invested more than $600 million through capital, exploration and advanced project spend as we continue to progress our near-term projects and invest in our future. In July, we paid $34 million in advanced project spend, part of our initial $100 million commitment to Caterpillar, as we work to develop autonomous battery electric haul trucks for our open pit at CC&V and our underground mine at Tanami.\nCompared to the first quarter, adjusted net income declined more than $0.20 due to the macroeconomic factors that Tom mentioned earlier. In addition to lower realized metal prices for gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc. We sold 46% of our mill in the month of June, an average gold price of $1,834 per ounce, substantially decreasing our average realized gold price for the quarter compared to the LBMA gold price of $1,871 per ounce.\nAverage realized metal prices were also impacted by $105 million of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on provisionally priced sales due to a sharp decline in metal prices on June 30. These impacts alone resulted in a reduction to net income of approximately $0.19 per share compared to the first quarter, largely offsetting a 12% increase in gold sales volumes due to higher production from our operations in Australia and Africa.\nIn addition, we experienced an increase of approximately $80 million from higher labor and materials costs and nearly $50 million from higher diesel and energy prices compared to the first quarter. And as Rob mentioned, we incurred a $70 million expense in the second quarter related to the Peñasquito profit-sharing agreement. These impacts, along with smaller, less meaningful items, resulted in second quarter adjusted net income of $362 million or $0.46 per diluted share.\nDespite the current market environment, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear strategy to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects, to maintain financial strength and flexibility in our balance sheet and to continue to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. In the first half of this year, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment into the business with the advancement of our near-term projects and an ongoing commitment to our robust exploration strategy.\nEnhancing our ownership of world-class assets and proven mining jurisdictions through the acquisition of the remaining interest in Yanacocha and the Sulfides project.\nMaintaining our industry-leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis and sustaining a strong balance sheet with $7.3 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, preserving Newmont's financial flexibility with no debt due until 2029.\nAs we look towards the second half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and creating long-term value for the business and all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Tom to talk about what to expect for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Nancy. And turning to the next slide. During our first quarter earnings call in late April, we provided an update on the impacts to our managed operations as a consequence of safely managing through the Omicron surge over the first 4 months of this year. We also discussed the emerging impacts from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, combined with the ongoing impacts from the global pandemic on labor markets and global supply chains. And as a consequence, input costs.\nWe advised that we are closely monitoring these matters during the second quarter and would provide an update with our Q2 earnings in July. As a consequence of this work, we have decided to update our full year guidance to incorporate the following items. First, as we discussed in our earnings call in April, ramp-up mining rates at our new Subika Underground mine at Ahafo South have been impacted by supply chain disruptions that have delayed the delivery of the required production drills and global border closures that have impacted labor availability of the key talent necessary to develop this new mine and train our operators.\nAs also discussed in April, I can now confirm that we are advancing the development of a third production level at Subika, which will add optionality for this mine and minimize future disruptions. We expect first ore from this new third level around the middle of next year.\nSecond, as we discussed in April, with the pending conclusion of our contracts to supply concentrate from Cripple Creek and Victor to Nevada Gold Mines, we stepped back to assess our operating strategy at Cripple Creek and Victor to determine if there was the potential for a simpler, higher-value, longer life, leach-only operation that does not carry the complexity and cost of running a mill to process a relatively small amount of the ore mine. This work has now been completed, and we have made the decision to put the mill into care and maintenance and move to a heap leach-only operation reducing production levels into the second half of this year and beyond as a consequence.\nThird, as Rob discussed, we continue to be impacted by the ongoing challenges associated with safely managing through the global pandemic. These challenges are particularly pronounced in Canada and Australia, where we continue to adhere to strict close contact isolation protocols and test requirements impacting productivity and increasing costs.\nAnd finally, as I discussed earlier, the impact on our input costs from escalation in the 3 key areas of labor, material and consumables and fuel and energy. These impacts to our managed operations have been built into our second half forecast as we work to address the critical global issues we face today and deliver on our updated guidance.\nSo for 2022, we now expect to produce 6 million ounces of gold, which is within our original guidance range, but now incorporates the following changes from the impacts I just described. 80,000 ounces at Ahafo South operations, 50,000 ounces across our Canadian operations, 40,000 ounces at Cripple Creek and Victor and 30,000 ounces across our Australian operations.\nThe impact from these lower production volumes, coupled with higher input prices from inflationary pressures, has also increased our gold all-in sustaining cost for this year for $1,150 per ounce. We remain within guidance for sustaining capital. However, we anticipate our spend to be weighted around 55% to the second half of this year due to global supply chain delays in the first half and higher input costs. The unprecedented and evolving market environment has also impacted our expectations for development capital since we established our guidance in December last year. As a consequence, we have reduced our estimate for development capital for this year to $1.1 billion, incorporating delays in sending primarily associated with Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides.\nIn addition, over the next few months, we will pass through the land access milestone for Ahafo North and the completion of Shaft (inaudible) milestone for the Tanami expansion and be in a position to clearly evaluate the remaining cost in schedule to complete both these important projects. Building on the trends that Rob just described, we'll be in a position to provide additional detail on both these projects later this year.\nAs we look ahead, we expect that inflationary pressures and the impacts from a competitive labor market will persist into 2023, resulting in production levels and unit costs that will be similar to this year. We are actively working on our 2023 business plan and look forward to providing you with additional detail on our long-term outlook when we deliver our annual guidance in early December.\nWe will continue to be transparent regarding the challenges we are managing as a mining industry, and we remain firmly committed to advancing the initiatives that are most important to our business, including climate change.\nIn May, we published our second annual climate report, providing stakeholders with a more comprehensive understanding of how we manage the impacts of climate change at our operations and projects. We believe that climate change is one of the greatest existential threats to our way of life. And this report outlines Newmont's climate-related risks and opportunities, our strategic planning around various climate change scenarios and the specific actions we are taking to reduce our carbon footprint.\nIn addition to our climate report and our annual sustainability report published in April, we will launch Newmont's inaugural tax transparency report during the third quarter, which will provide an overview of the taxes we pay as part of the value we create in the countries where we operate.\nIn closing, we have a tremendous opportunity to address the challenges of our dynamic and changing world from inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions to climate change and reducing fatalities in the mining industry. Started by our clear and consistent strategy, we believe that Newmont has the size, scale, leadership and experience to navigate these challenges as we continue into our next 100 years of sustainable and responsible mining. And we are both ready and excited for what is ahead.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you, operator."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Newmont's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team, and we'll be available to answer questions at the end of the call.\nBefore I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont delivered on a challenging first quarter, as our operations and the mining industry as a whole, safely managed through the Omicron surge over the first 3 months of this year. As we emerge on the other side of this wave, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver solid performance in 2022, leveraging our scale and proven operating model to deliver long-term value from the world's best mining jurisdictions.\nThe strength of our people and stability of our global portfolio not only allows us to enjoy our short-term disruptions, it is the foundation of Newmont's clear and consistent strategy to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining.\nTurning to our quarterly results. Let's take a look at the highlights. During the first quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million ounces of gold and 350,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. And despite challenges from the Omicron surge and the knock-on impact from this global pandemic, we remain on track to achieve our 4-year guidance ranges as we build momentum for a strong second half.\nI recently visited Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana, as well as the Boddington mine in Australia, where I saw firsthand the significant efforts our teams are taking to protect the health and safety of our workforce, while continuing to move critical projects forward. With $7.3 billion in total liquidity, we have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility to sustain and grow the business. We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Ahafo North, the second expansion at Tanami and Yanacocha Sulfides. Just last week, we announced the acquisition of Sumitomo's interest in Yanacocha, which will bring Newmont's ownership in this operation and the exciting sulfides project to 100%.\nAnd yesterday, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, set within our established dividend framework and consistent with our last 5 quarter. Newmont's core values of safety, sustainability, integrity, inclusion and responsibility are essential to creating long-term value for our investors, host governments, communities and employees.\nLast week, Newmont launched its 18th annual sustainability report, providing a transparent look at our ESG performance and the issues and metrics that matter most to our stakeholders. And in March, we committed $5 million to provide relief and medical supplies to the millions of people affected by the war in Ukraine. We take pride in being a values-driven organization and our core values are fundamental to how we run our business and where we choose to operate.\nIn light of the brief geopolitical events and the Omicron surge that have impacted so many around the world, our commitment to sustainable and responsible mining is more relevant today than ever before. During our fourth quarter earnings call in late February, we provided an update on how the Omicron surge and the lingering effects of the pandemic were affecting our operations. And the impacts that our stakeholders could expect in the first quarter.\nAs you can see here on the slide, over the first 3 months of this year, we saw the largest spike of positive COVID cases at Newmont since the start of pandemic. And this graph only shows positive cases and does not include absenteeism from adhering to close-contact isolation protocols. As a rule of thumb, every positive case identified at site, approximately 2 co-workers were sent home to isolate for a minimum of 7 days. In addition, many of our team also needed to take time off to care for sick children and family members as COVID cases spiked in surrounding communities.\nFortunately, due to our verified vaccination status, the severity of any positive cases has remained low. As of today, 8 of our 12, that is operations, have a fully vaccinated workforce of employees and contractors, positioning us to emerge strongly on the other side of this wave and others that may come.\nHowever, as a consequence of managing through the Omicron surge, our operations have been impacted during the first quarter by lower productivity from close-contact isolation protocols, by capacity constraints and various other safety measures. We've also experienced pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and the impacts from various state and national border restrictions. This has affected both labor availability and the delivery of equipment and critical spares. And Although our operations were not directly impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it has resulted in new and developing complexities of global supply chain and input costs.\nAs we described in our guidance webcast slide in December, we issued that escalation factor in 2022 when we developed our business plan to account for higher inflation expected during this year. During the first quarter, we remain in line with our inflation assumptions, but we are closely monitoring critical commodities and materials, such as natural gas and the ammonium used for the production of explosives and cyanide. And although difficult to predict at this stage, the cost pressures from these new supply chain disruptions may increase our unit cost by another 3% to 5% and toward the high end of our guidance range. We will be closely monitoring this through the second quarter, and we'll provide you with an update during our Q2 earnings call in July.\nOn the production front, we are well-positioned to land within our guidance and are tracking to around 100,000 ounces, below our midpoint for gold. We continue to expect both production and unit cost to improve through the second half, with approximately 53% of our production weighted to the back half of the year, driven by Tanami, Ahafo, Cerro Negro and our Canadian operations. And as we have demonstrated since the start of the pandemic, we will continue to be transparent as we can with our updates to the market as we leverage our proven operating model and balanced labor portfolio to overcome these near-term uncontrollable disruptions and deliver on our long-term commitments.\nAt Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations, along with a pipeline of more than 20 organic projects, with the scale and mine life to deliver long-term results. Newmont will produce more than 6 million ounces of gold each year and almost 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Combined, that is nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for at least the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. And it is important to note that this is attributable production.\nAmong our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, nearly 90% of distributable gold production comes from top tier jurisdictions. And with the acquisition of the remaining 5% ownership in Yanacocha, 11 of our 12 managed operations will be 100% owned, ensuring that our stakeholders receive the full benefit from Newmont's clear strategic focus and superior execution.\nWe firmly believe that where we choose to invest and operate matters. We have a disciplined geopolitical risk program that ensures we retain and assess our jurisdictions and our risk tolerance to deliver long-term results from established mine jurisdictions.\nUnderpinning our portfolio is a robust foundation of reserves and resources, which combined with the gold industry's best organic project pipeline, provides the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. We are entering a period of need for reinvestment, as we continue to advance our near-term projects including a second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory, the development of Ahafo North in Ghana and the Yanacocha Sulfides project, the next exciting chapter in Newmont's long and profitable history in Peru.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Rob and then Nancy for a more detailed look at our first quarter performance. Over to you, Rob.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's dive into the operations and projects starting with Africa. Tom and I had the opportunity to separately visit Ghana recently, and we are impressed with the progress of both operations as they continue to advance important growth opportunities in this proven mining district, including sublevel shrinkage at Subika Underground, the Akyem layback and of course, Ahafo North.\nAs indicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, Ahafo saw a challenging start to the year. The site's first quarter performance was impacted by supply chain disruptions and global border closures, impacting labor availability and the delivery of new equipment and critical spares. As an example, last year, the site ordered 4 new drills for the underground and open pit operations, and we only received the first drill in March this year, with delivery of the remaining drills expected sometime in the third quarter, much later than originally planned.\nIn addition, the delay of inflation of parts for existing drills is compounding the situation, creating availability challenges with the equipment that we have on hand today. Improved mill performance has helped to offset these delays, but the impacts from the pandemic have affected our ability to ramp up mining rates in the Subika Underground. And as a consequence, we are evaluating ways to improve our mining rates, which may include adding a third production level to access higher grades in late '22 and into '23, and we expect to have an update with our quarter 2 earnings in July.\nAkyem delivered a solid performance in the first quarter due to sustained throughput and strong recoveries. The team continues to progress stripping of the next layback in the open pit, which will extend mine life by an additional 4 years and provide future optionality for both underground and open pit growth.\nAnd finally, we continued the development of the Ahafo North project. Engineering is nearly 90% complete, and procurement is 60% complete, as we continue to work together with local communities, traditional leaders and regulators to get full land access and commence construction.\nAnd just in the last few weeks, Tom and I met separately with 3 stakeholders and received strong support for this important project. And last week, we also achieved an important milestone with the cabinet in Ghana, formally approving the diversion of the highway that currently passes through a section of the new mine site.\nWhen operations begin, Ahafo North is expected to add approximately 300,000 ounces of gold per year, while creating lasting value for host communities through enhanced local sourcing and hiring, as we develop this prolific ore body.\nAnd now, turning to Australia. At Boddington and Tanami, we experienced the impact from the Omicron surge in the first quarter, as labor availability and close-contact isolation protocols impacted the region. In addition, the West Australian border was reopened in early March, leading to an increase in on-site cases, but also allowing our teams, contractors and business partners to move more freely throughout the country and to Tanami for the first time in many months.\nAt Boddington, we reported more production compared to the fourth quarter due to planned maintenance and COVID-related absenteeism, as we saw our first COVID cases on the site. These impacts were partially offset by improved rates and higher ore tonnes mined from Boddington's fleet of fully autonomous trucks. The team is diligently working multiple base positions in the circuit to access higher grade ore. And we expect tonnes mined and grade to remain strong throughout the year, as we continue to optimize consistently, efficiency and productivity from our autonomous truck fleet, a key component to delivering a strong finish to the year.\nAt Tanami, the site delivered a strong performance despite the impact from the Omicron surge in the first quarter and a very competitive labor market in Australia. The site also delivered lower ore grade in the fourth quarter due to mine sequencing and unplanned maintenance at our processing facilities. The team continues to progress the second expansion at Tanami, a project with the potential to extend mine life beyond 2040. As you can see here in the photo, the assembly of the headframe is nearing completion, which is an important milestone as we transition from the reaming of the shaft to commencing the shaft lining activities.\nNearly 85% of the project engineering and procurement has been completed. And over the coming months, the site will focus on the completion of the headframe installation and commencement of the shaft lining, bringing Tanami that much closer to delivering significant earns, cost and efficiency improvements.\nAnd now, over to North America. Peñasquito delivered another solid quarter, a strong mill performance that delivered higher core product production from lead and zinc offset lower gold production. Stripping has continued in both Peñasco and Chile Colorado pits, with lower gold grade and harder ore coming from Chile Colorado in the first quarter.\nAnd looking ahead, due to efficient sequencing, gold production from this large polymetallic mine is expected to decrease in the second quarter, but increased in the third quarter due to higher grade delivered from the Peñasco mine.\nMoving to Canada. Our operations in the country as a whole continue to be impacted by ongoing challenges stemming from the global pandemic and a very competitive labor market. As indicated a couple of months ago, the Omicron surge reintroduced flight capacity constraints, testing requirements and strict close contact isolation protocols. And working closely with the First Nations, we have maintained our stringent protocols and testing regimes, even as restrictions have relaxed.\nDue to the remote applications, these impacts were particularly pronounced at Musselwhite and Éléonore, where both sites delivered lower tonnes mined and processed compared to the fourth quarter. As an example, we saw absenteeism rates as high as 15% to 20% during the peak of the Omicron surge at our Canadian operations. And in Musselwhite, we decided to place the site on care maintenance for 7 days in February to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the health of our workforce and communities.\nAt Porcupine, our ore grade was offset by lower tonnes processed as a result of COVID-related labor absenteeism and mill maintenance, in addition to challenging rain conditions and some ventilation constraints at Hoyle Pond. The site continues to progress at Pamour layback, a project that will extend mining at Porcupine through 2035.\nConstruction of the water treatment plant is well underway as the team prepares to dewater the pit and advance towards full funds approval in the second half of this year.\nAnd finally, CC&V, the mine required a mill shutdown from a conveyor fire that occurred during the first quarter. With the pending conclusion of our contract to supply concentrate from CC&V to Nevada Gold Mines, we are stepping back to assess our operating strategy at the site to determine if there is a potential for a simpler, higher value, over-the-life leach-only operation that does not carry the complexity and cost of running a mill to process a relatively small amount of ore mined. This work is underway, and we expect to have an update with our quarter 2 earnings in July.\nComing to South America. Merian delivered a solid performance despite very heavy rain and mill maintenance during the first quarter, as the site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to balance steady grade and strong mill performance. In Yanacocha, record rainfall resulted in a federal emergency declaration of Peru, impacting the site as it continues to deliver leach-only production while we worked to develop the first phase of the Sulfides project, which continues to advance towards an investment decision in late 2022.\nEngineering is approximately 50% complete, and the early efforts and construction activities continue to progress at site. And once finished, the camp will allow the construction workforce to begin ramping up in 2023. And finally, Cerro Negro delivered a strong performance in the first quarter, as a result of higher grade mined from Mariana Norte in Mariana Central and ongoing improvements in productivity despite disruptions from the Omicron surge. During the first quarter, the team successfully completed the tailing storage facility expansion project, and we continued to progress the first wave of expansions at Cerro Negro, including the development of the Marianas and Eastern districts to extend existing operations beyond 2030.\nThe team is currently advancing the development of the San Marcos [decline]. And as you can see in the photo, the construction of the roads, infrastructure platforms and ports of access are all well underway in the Eastern District.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Let's start with a look at the financial highlights. In the first quarter, Newmont delivered $3 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,892 per ounce. Adjusted net income of $546 million or $0.69 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion and solid free cash flow of $252 million, which includes unfavorable working capital movements of $465 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by timing of cash collections and over $420 million of tax payments largely attributable to 2021.\nFree cash flow was also impacted by higher capital spend, as Newmont enters a period significant reinvestment, an essential component in growing production, improving margins and extending mine life.\nFirst quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $432 million or $0.54 per share. Adjustments included $0.16 related to a noncash loss on a pension annuitization settlement, $0.04 primarily related to a loss from the sale of La Zanja as part of the transaction to increase our ownership at Yanacocha, $0.05 related to the unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments, $0.04 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance, and $0.04 of other charges.\nTaking these adjustments into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.69 per diluted share. And our balanced global portfolio, combined with our discipline, provide significant leverage to higher gold prices from the largest production base in the world. For every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year.\nAnd Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, allowing us to confidently execute our capital allocation priorities and build from our position as the world's leading gold company.\n1.5 years ago, Newmont was the first in the gold industry to announce a clear dividend framework, with a decisive strategy to provide stable and predictable returns. Yesterday, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share or $2.20 per share on an annualized basis, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a conservative 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. We continue to review our dividend each quarter with our Board, assessing gold price performance along with our operational and financial outlook over the long term to determine the payout levels within our dividend framework.\nSince its introduction 18 months ago, Newmont has returned $2.5 billion to shareholders from dividends, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our ability to maintain financial flexibility, while steadily reinvesting in our future.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear strategy: to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects, to maintain financial strength and flexibility on our balance sheet and to continue to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment into the business, with the advancement of our near-term projects and an ongoing commitment to our robust exploration strategy.\nEnhancing our ownership of world-class assets and proven mining jurisdictions through the acquisition of the remaining interest in Yanacocha and the Sulfides project. Maintaining our industry-leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis, sustaining a strong balance sheet with $7.3 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, preserving Newmont's financial flexibility across price cycles.\nAs we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business and maintaining our position as the world's leading gold company. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 20.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Nancy. Newmont has a long history of leading change in our approach to ESG. And these practices have been embedded in our culture and strategy, and are woven into the very fabric of our company. Last week, Newmont launched its 2021 Annual Sustainability Report. Part of the suite of reports in our company's ESG practices in the key areas that matter most to our stakeholders, including health, safety and security, human rights, the environment, social acceptance, governance and inclusion and diversity.\nSome of the highlights from this year's report include 0 work-related fatalities for the third year in a row, with our focus on verifying the critical controls that prevent fatalities and coaching frontline leaders to provide visible, felt leadership. Continuing to put the health, safety and well-being of our workforce and host communities at the heart of every decision we made and continue to make during this pandemic. A key part of this was adopting the requirement for all of our workforce to be fully-vaccinated. With contributions through our Global Communities Support Fund, we supported COVID testing facilities, vaccine awareness campaigns and vaccine rollouts in areas near our operations.\nWe established the industry's first sustainability-linked bond, a bond that holds Newmont to account for meeting our 2030 emission reduction target and also, to reach gender parity in senior leadership roles by 2030. By linking the interest rate paid to our ESG performance, this represents the next important step in aligning our financial performance with our sustainability performance.\nAnd finally, Newmont played an important role in creating economic value, contributed $10.8 billion to our workforce, both communities and jurisdictions through wages and benefits, operating costs, capital spend, royalties and taxes. Next month, we will launch our second annual climate report, which will outline Newmont's climate-related risks and opportunities, our strategic planning and the pathways we are taking to achieve our climate targets. We have been disclosing our nonfinancial performance since 2004, regularly ranking as one of the most transparent companies in the S&P 500 and positioning Newmont as the gold sector's recognized sustainability leader.\nWe understand that strong ESG performance is an indicator of a well-run organization, and we will only be successful if we forge and maintain strong partnerships with local communities and demonstrate our ability to mine the matter that protects the environment and creates opportunities for people.\nIn order to address the critical global issues we face today, the mining industry will need leaders with scale, mine life, superior cash flow generation and an unwavering commitment for leading ESG practices. And we believe that Newmont is one of those leaders. We will continue to differentiate ourselves through our clear strategic focus and discipline, our unmatched global portfolio of operations and projects and an integrated operating model with a deep bench of experienced leaders as we continue into our next 100 years of sustainable and responsible mining.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team. and we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.\nNewmont delivered a strong finish to the year and has maintained its position as the world's leading gold company with our unmatched portfolio of operations and projects in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. As we move into our next 100 years of sustainable and responsible mining, Newmont will continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders, and differentiate ourselves through our clear strategic focus, superior operational performance and an unwavering commitment to leading ESG practices.\nTurning to our [high] of 2021. Newmont continue to operate from a position of strength in 2021, leveraging our scale and mine life to deliver strong ESG operational and financial performance. First and foremost, our focus has remained on protecting the health and well-being of our workforce and local communities as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic.\nWe continue to be recognized for our leading ESG performance, building new pathways to decarbonization and publishing our first climate strategy report. And during the fourth quarter, we safely commissioned the gold industry's first autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington and formed an industry-leading strategic alliance with Caterpillar to achieve zero emissions mining and support Newmont's climate initiatives. We finished the year strongly, meeting our updated full year guidance and producing 6 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,062 per ounce.\nAnd in addition, produced 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. These results generated $4.3 billion in cash from continuing operations and $2.6 billion in free cash flow. More than 99% of which is attributable to Newmont and available to execute on our balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities. We refinanced near-term debt with the mining industry's first sustainability leap bond, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility as we further align our financing strategy with our ESG commitments.\nIn 2021, we returned $1.8 billion through our clear dividend framework and completed $525 million of share repurchases, leading the gold sector in shareholder returns. We also completed the acquisition of GT Gold, continue to advance our most profitable near-term projects. And 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Bonaventure interest in Yanacocha, increasing Newmont's ownership in one of the largest and most productive gold mines in South America.\nWe have successfully operated in Peru for more than 30 years, and we have a deep knowledge of Yanacocha and the value that it brings to Newmont's stakeholders. Since 1993, Yanacocha has produced nearly 40 million ounces of gold. And similar to our acquisition of GT Gold in British Columbia's Golden Triangle, this transaction is in line with Newmont's strategy of district consolidation, enhancing our ownership of world-class assets in proven mining jurisdictions.\nIncreasing our ownership in Yanacocha also means that Newmont is increasing our stake in the sulfides project, which is the next exciting chapter in Yanacocha's long and profitable history. With a multi-decade mine life from just the first phase, this project will generate profitable production of more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at attractive all-in sustaining costs.\nImportantly, the metal producing sulfides be approximately 45% gold, 45% copper and 10% silver, substantially increasing Newmont's copper position as the world transitions to a green economy. And looking ahead, we are already evaluating the second and third phases of the sulfides project, which has the potential to both increase production and extend mine life well beyond 2040.\nWe are very fortunate to have had a strong partnership with Buenaventura over several decades and look forward to continuing to work with the people of the Cajamarca region and local agencies to sustainably and responsibly develop the next phases of Yanacocha's long life.\nTurning now to the strategic value that differentiates our portfolio. Each year, Newmont's portfolio of operations will produce more than 60 ounces of gold, along with nearly 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Combined, that is nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for at least the next decade, the most of any company in our industry.\nAt Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations and projects around the globe with the scale and mine life to deliver strong long-term results. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, over 90% of our attributable gold production comes from top-tier jurisdictions. And with the opportunity to acquire the outstanding 5% ownership in Yanacocha, 11 of our 12 managed operations will be 100% owned, ensuring that our stakeholders receive the full benefit from Newmont's clear strategic focus and superior execution.\nUnderpinning our portfolio is a robust foundation of reserves and resources, including our recent acquisition of an increased interest in Yanacocha, Newmont's reserve base now sits at 96 million ounces of gold and 68 million gold equivalent ounces from other metals, predominantly copper.\nWe also offer substantial upside through a resource base of over 112 million ounces of gold, and a further $112 million gold equivalent ounces from other metals, which includes almost 30 billion pounds of copper. Through our industry-leading organic project pipeline, we have multiple opportunities to increase copper production through the development of Yanacocha Sulfides, Saddle North, North Abierto, Neva Union and Galore Creek, providing natural exposure to a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions and facilitating ongoing transition to a new energy economy.\nReserve replacement is a long-term process. And as Newmont has done for many years, we develop and implement plans that target replacing our annual depletion on average over time. In 2021, we replaced more than 80% of reserve depletion despite the challenges created by the pandemic. And it is important to note that this does not include the 3 million ounces of gold reserves we just acquired through our purchase of Buenaventura interest in Yanacocha. At Newmont, we firmly believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is critical in combating the spread of the virus and preventing severe illness and death.\nAs you can see in this slide, the vaccination rates at our managed operations exceed national rates in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Last September, we took the important step of deliberately moving towards a position where all of our global workforce will be required to be vaccinated. To support this, Newmont continues to deliver vaccination awareness programs, while also working with local communities and governments to both provide and improve access to the vaccines.\nAnd one of the most meaningful contributions that our leaders have made in the fight against COVID-19 is the time that they have spent with their teams, holding individual meetings, answering difficult questions, coordinating facilitated sessions with health professionals and guiding our workforce as they make the important decision to protect themselves and their love lines.\nWe are very proud of the work we have done and we will continue to be a values-driven organization that makes decisions that prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local communities above all else. Over the first 2 months of this year, the Omicron surge has impacted our operations and the mining industry as a whole.\nFortunately, due to our high vaccination status, the severity of any positive cases has been low. Our workforce remains healthy, and we are well positioned as we emerge on the other side of this current search. However, as a consequence of safely managing through this surge, we expect that our production results in the first quarter of 2022 could be impacted by as much as 150,000 ounces. Around 1/3 of that impact is coming from our Canadian operations and Cripple Creek and Victor. It's flight capacity constraints at our fly in, fly out operations and close contact isolation protocols have impacted productivity.\nAnother 1/3 comes from Africa, where we are experiencing COVID-related supply chain disruptions and global border closures, which are impacting the availability of skilled workers from Australia, and the delivery of critical spares and equipment. And the final third comes from our operations in Australia, but we are seeing the impacts of productivity and labor availability as we adhere to interstate border closures and close contact isolation protocols. We are closely monitoring the reopening of the Western Australian border, which is currently planned for March 5. And this may lead to a surge of cases impacting the mining industry in that state.\nHowever, the reopening of this border will also allow 1/3 of our team at Tanami who live in Western Australia, to now move freely between work and home for the first time in months. As we near the end of February, we are encouraged to see declining case counts and have reported only 1 hospitalization associated with the Omicron surge. Despite the challenges presented by managing the Omicron surge, we remain on track to end the year within our guidance ranges.\nWe expect the production and unit costs will substantially improve each quarter with approximately 53% of our production weighted to the back half of this year, driven by Boddington, Ahafo, Cerro Negro and our Canadian operations. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob and then Nancy for a more detailed look at our fourth quarter performance. Over to you, Rob.\n\nRobert D. Atkinson\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Newmont Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. To echo what Tom said, the pandemic continues to present challenges across our operations and the mining industry as a whole. I'm very proud of the resilience of our people and our systems and I'd like to recognize the very significant efforts that continue to be applied at all of our operations in order to keep our teams safe and healthy.\nTurning to the next slide. Let's take a deeper look, starting with Australia. Tanami delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter as higher rates and strong mill performance more than offset impacts to productivity from COVID. And despite a tightening labor market and heightened protocols, the team that added more than 800,000 ounces in reserve additions through drilling.\nWe expect Tanami to remain a solid contributor throughout the year due to steady production and higher grade as we progress our investment in the second expansion at Tanami, a project with the potential to extend mine life beyond 2040. The team continues to advance the construction of the head frame. 80% of the nearly 1 mile deep shaft has now been rained and more than 80% of the project engineering procurement has been completed, an important step in locking in long lead time materials and limiting exposure to rising costs. At Boddington, we delivered the site's best quarterly performance of 2021. Overcoming challenges encountered during the third quarter and reporting improved production and lower costs as the team reached higher gold and copper grades in the South pit.\nWe expect tonnes mined and grade to further improve starting in the second quarter with 52% of production expected in the second half of the year. And I'm very pleased to announce that the gold industry's first autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington has reached full productivity, increasing ore tonnes mined in the fourth quarter and positioning Boddington to deliver a strong performance this year.\nEarly in 2020, our Newmont team came together with our partners at Caterpillar to plan, construct, test and deploy the gold sector's first fully autonomous haul truck fleet. And despite facing some challenges while fine-tuning this new technology to operate in a deep open pit mine for the first time, the Boddington AHS project was completed on budget and in record time.\nA major accomplishment for Newmont and the industry as a whole. Today, our autonomous trucks are operating at parity with a conventional haul truck. And we have a deep pipeline of optimization projects aimed at improving consistency, efficiency and productivity throughout the year. The introduction of this technology allowed the site to replace 41 conventional trucks with 36 autonomous vehicles, resulting in important safety improvements and substantial cost savings over the long term.\nAlready, our AHS fleet has moved over 45 million tonnes of material, and these trucks have traveled more than 1 million kilometers, generating tremendous results so far. Vehicle damage has declined nearly 50% in 2021 compared to 2020 and tire damage decreased 93% from more controlled and efficient haulage. But more importantly, we've reported zero injuries in the mines since going live in October last year.\nIn addition to improving productivity, and autonomous haul fleet is fundamentally safer, removing the exposure to potential vehicle interactions and the risks associated with fatigue. In November, we took another step forward in the use of technology to improve mining, announcing our revolutionary strategic alliance with Caterpillar to deliver first-of-a-kind battery electric autonomous vehicles at Tanami and CC&V as we make progress towards achieving zero emissions mining. We will look to leverage our team of experts within both Newmont and Caterpillar, along with the lessons that we've learned at Boddington as we continue to implement important improvements to safety and productivity throughout our portfolio, while also building pathways to decarbonization.\nShifting to North America. Peñasquito delivered another strong quarter with sustained mill performance and higher gold grade. The site is expected to deliver lower gold production and steady coal product production this year due to the planned sequencing at the Peñasquito and the Chile Colorado pit, combined with lower grade and harder ore coming from the Chile Colorado pit.\nStripping in the Peñasquito pit will continue through 2022, and the site will also begin stripping the next phase of the Chile Colorado pit in the second half of the year. And in the first half of this year, Peñasquito will increase capital spend as the site expands camp facilities, ensuring that our team members have the appropriate privacy and accommodation to get proper risk, as well as improving our ability to manage the spread of any future surges of core variants.\nTurning to our Canadian operations. Éléonore delivered solid fourth quarter results due to improved ore tonnes mined and mill. In addition, the site added more than 800,000 ounces in reserves from drilling and favorable revisions. Musselwhite generated the year's strongest quarterly performance from high-grade mine and improved mill performance in the fourth quarter.\nAnd Porcupine delivered consistent fourth quarter results as higher throughput and recovery rates helped to offset less high-grade ore being mined from oil pond. In addition, the site continues to advance the Pamour project, just 10 kilometers from our existing plant infrastructure. This project involves a significant layback of the Pamour pit and will extend mining at Porcupine through 2035.\nThe Pamour pit will need to be dewatered as part of this project and the concrete foundations for the associated water treatment plant have been completed. Study work is progressing as the project prepares for full funds approval in the second half of this year. And finally, at CC&V, the mine continued to experience lower grades and recoveries in the fourth quarter, in addition to lower labor availability due to COVID.\nTurning to Africa. Akyem delivered another solid performance in the fourth quarter from higher grade sustained throughput and strong recoveries. Akyem has begun stripping the next layback, extending mine life and providing future optionality as we continue to evaluate underground and open pit growth opportunities.\nAhafo delivered a strong finish to the year, adding more than 400,000 ounces in reserve additions from drilling and generating a 19% production improvement over the prior quarter due to higher tonnes mined from the Subika open pit, coupled with strong mill performance, which more than offset challenges with labor and equipment availability at our Subika underground operation.\nThese challenges were driven by COVID-related supply chain disruptions and international border closures at a time that we are ramping up sublevel shrinkage at Subika Underground. Consequently, we are expecting production at half or to be weighted around 60% to the second half of this year as we increase underground tonnes and reach higher grade.\nAnd finally, in Africa, we continue to advance our Ahafo North project. In the fourth quarter, we received a tailings storage facility and water infrastructure permits from the EPA and we expect to gain full land access later this year as we work together with local communities and regulators to develop this prolific ore body.\nNow turning to South America. Mariana remains a strong performer, delivering higher throughput and steady grade in the fourth quarter, while adding nearly 400,000 ounces in reserve additions primarily from drilling at the Maraba open pit.\nProduction is expected to slightly increase this year as ore grade continues to improve through the first half and the site continues to utilize our ore blending strategy to maintain strong mill performance. Yanacocha continues to deliver leach-only production while we developed the first phase of the sulfides project. Early stage engineering continues to progress as the pandemic allows and accommodation facilities for the construction and full-time workforce are expected to be completed in the first half of the year as the site prepares for an investment decision in late 2022.\nAnd finally, productivity and performance continues to improve at Cerro Negro as higher ore tonnes mined were partially offset by lower grade in the fourth quarter. We expect production this year to remain in line with 2021, with around 55% weighted toward the second half of the year. Our team continues to advance the San Marcos decline and the first wave of district expansions, which includes the development of the Marianas and East Centric to extend operations beyond 2030 and provide a platform for further exploration and future waves of expansion.\nThe drilling and airport contracts have been put in place, and Cerro Negro added more than 1.1 million ounces to reserves from drilling in the eastern industry, more than offsetting revisions and reinforcing the growth potential in this highly prospective and underexplored gold district. We look forward to bringing you further updates about our progress at Cerro Negro as we bring this project for full funds approval next year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Rob. Through discrete portfolio and proven operating model, Newmont is able to generate the highest levels of attributable free cash flow in the gold sector. And our disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us to maintain financial strength and flexibility, while balancing steady reinvestment into our future and industry-leading returns to our shareholders. In 2021, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, ensuring that we are well positioned to sustain our business and continue leading the industry for decades to come.\nLet's start with a look at the financial highlights. As you can see, Newmont delivered a strong finish to the year. In the fourth quarter, Newmont achieved a record $3.4 billion in revenue, driven by higher sales volumes and strong gold prices. Adjusted net income of $624 million or $0.78 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion for the quarter and a record $6 billion for the full year; and strong free cash flow of nearly $900 million for the quarter, an amount entirely attributable to Newmont.\nOur unmatched cash flow generation enables Newmont to provide superior shareholder returns, largely through our clear and stable dividend framework. This week, we again declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of approximately 3.5% and positioning Newmont among the top 10% in the S&P 500.\nIn addition to our dividend, we continue to execute on our second $1 billion opportunistic share repurchase program, a separate and independent tool that does not impact our dividend payouts. Since December 2019, Newmont has repurchased over $1.5 billion in share buybacks at an average price of less than $49 per share, contributing significant value to shareholders.\nWith an additional $475 million left on the current program, we will look to execute on opportunities over the next 10 months to repurchase our shares. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $61 million or $0.08 per share. Adjustments included $1.10 primarily related to noncash reclamation adjustments at nonoperating sections of the Yanacocha site.\nBased on our ongoing studies of water management and closure activities, the liability was increased by $1.6 billion, of which approximately 1/3 relates to the estimated cost to construct 2 additional water treatment plans over the next 5 years, and the remainder of the increase relates to ongoing closure operating costs, which we estimate include over a period of 50 years.\nAdjustments also include $0.21 related to the sale of the KCGM Power business and the South Arturo asset exchange with Nevada Gold Mines. $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments and $0.02 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $0.78 per diluted share.\nOur balanced global portfolio, combined with our discipline and integrated-operating model, provides significant leverage to higher gold prices from the largest production base in the world. And for every $100 increase in gold prices, above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year.\nNearly 18 months ago, we led the gold industry by announcing our dividend framework, differentiating ourselves with a clear and decisive strategy to provide stable and predictable returns to our shareholders. This framework provides a stable base dividend and returns 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated above a $1,200 gold price.\nThe fourth quarter dividend declared was consistent with the last 4 quarters, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Since introducing our framework, Newmont has returned more than $2 billion through dividends alone, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our commitment to leading returns. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear strategy to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects, to maintain financial strength and optionality in our balance sheet, and to continue to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders.\nThroughout the year, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment into the business with the advancement of our near-term projects and an ongoing commitment to our robust exploration strategy. Delivering the first autonomous haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving safety and productivity at Boddington, advancing district consolidations with the GT Gold transaction and increasing our ownership in Yanacocha, returning $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share buybacks, issuing the industry's first sustainability linked bond, efficiently refinancing near-term maturities and resulting in no debt due until 2029. And maintaining a strong balance sheet with $8 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility to sustain the business across price cycles.\nAs we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business and all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom to wrap up.\n\nThomas Ronald Palmer\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Newmont Corporation\n\nThanks, Nancy. Over the last year, as we celebrated our 100th anniversary, it has been an important milestone to pause and reflect on our company, our industry and the lessons we have learned. Our clear strategy lays the groundwork to truly differentiate Newmont as we position ourselves to continue leading the gold industry today and well into the future.\nAnd as we begin a new year, I am confident that our clear strategic focus, proven operating model, superior execution and leading ESG practices will enable Newmont to deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders through sustainable and responsible mining.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."

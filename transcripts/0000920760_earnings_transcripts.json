[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for the reading of the forward-looking statements.\n\nDavid M. Collins\n\nChief Accounting Officer & Controller, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Lennar's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results.\nBecause forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption Risk Factors contained in Lennar's annual report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\nOperator\n\nI would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and Co-CEO. Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Katherine Martin is here. She's our new Chief Legal Officer. Welcome, Katherine, and Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services, along with a few others as well.\nI do want to note that Mark Sustana, our 20-year General Counsel is not here today, and he's thoroughly missed. I don't believe that Mark has missed an earnings call in his 20 years with the company and his service to and with the company has been truly remarkable. While Mark recently retired, and we have Katherine here as our Chief Legal Officer, Mark will remain a strategic adviser and consultant to the company, and we're sure that Mark can help listen today. So Mark, you're definitely here in spirit. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction cost, cycle time some of our land strategy and positions.\nAs usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight along with some guidance for the fourth quarter. And then, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period. And as usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many as possible. So let me begin. We are pleased to review Lennar's third quarter 2025 results against the backdrop of what might be the beginnings of an improving economic landscape for the housing market.\nWith that said, our third quarter results reflect the continued softening of market conditions and affordability through our third quarter. Sales volume was difficult to maintain and required additional incentives in order to achieve our expected pace and to avoid building excess inventory. While our deliveries were just below our goal for the quarter, and while we sold more homes than expected during the quarter, these accomplishments came at the expense of further deterioration of margin which came down to 17.5%. Accordingly, we're going to begin to ease back our delivery expectations for the fourth quarter and full year in order to relieve the pressure on sales and deliveries and help establish a floor on margin.\nWe will reduce our delivery expectations for the fourth quarter to 22,000 to 23,000 homes and we will reduce our full year expectation to 18,500 to 18,000 -- I'm sorry, 81,500 to 82,500 for the full year. For Lennar, this is an opportune time to pause and let the market catch up a little bit. Even though mortgage rates began to trend downward towards the end of the quarter, stronger sales have not yet followed. We have certainly begun to see early signs of greater customer interest and stronger traffic entering the market with lower mortgage rates purchasers are showing greater interest in considering their home purchase. And this is generally an early signal of stronger sales activity to follow, assuming rates remain lower. And if interest rates continue to fall, we're quite optimistic that this all will happen soon. The extended period of higher interest rates for longer than expected, forced us, however, to adjust construction costs in order to enable sales in difficult market conditions.\nOur lower construction cost structure, together with reduced margins, enabled us to meet affordability and support the supply and demand balance. We drove sales pace to match production pace and we fortified our -- as we fortified our market share and position in each of our strategic markets. We are now situated with a lower cost structure, efficient product offerings and strong market positions to accommodate pent-up demand as rates moderate and confidence, ultimately, returns. As I said before, this is the right time. This is just the right time for us to pull back just a little bit. We believe that we've gotten ahead of the current market realities, and we've built what we believe is a stronger long-term margin driving platform. We know that this has taken some time as the market has remained weaker for longer. But we also know that our strategy has helped to build a healthier housing market and has positioned Lennar for strong cash flow and bottom line growth in the future.\nWe are optimistic that if mortgage rates approach the 6% level or even lower, we will soon see some firming in the market, and we will benefit from stronger affordability and therefore, demand. Accordingly, we'll remain focused on volume and even float reduction, although at just a little slower pace. We will maintain responsible volume to maintain an affordable cost structure and we will find the floor and rebuild our margin as the overall housing market continues to remain short on supply. So let me turn quickly to a quick macro overview of the housing market. Consistent with last quarter's earnings call, the macro economy remained challenging throughout our third quarter. Mortgage interest rates remained higher and consumer confidence remained challenged by a wide range of uncertainties, both domestic and global. Across the housing landscape, actionable demand remained diminished by both affordability and consumer confidence and therefore, the market continued to soften as we moved through the quarter.\nNevertheless, as we came to the back half of the quarter, interest rates began to drift downward, and that drift began to accelerate as we came to the end of the quarter and into the fourth. Today, we are possibly getting closer to 6% mortgage rate. That's fluctuating a little bit and we're just beginning to see consumers return to the market. Against that backdrop, supply remains constrained in most markets, driven by years of underproduction. New construction has slowed as builders have pulled back on production due to slow sales and affordability concerns, therefore exacerbating the chronic supply shortage. Demand is still high as people want and need homes, but affordability and waning confidence around buying now have been constraining that demand. This has been a difficult cycle as low supply fuels high prices and high prices lock out many of our buyers.\nAs I've said before, mayors and governors around the country continue to lift the housing shortage as a priority concern and point to affordability or attainability as a priority. I do suggest that if you want to better understand the conundrum of the housing market, read the book abundance by as recline to better understand that housing has a long-term future defined by both structurally short supply and not just growing demand but growing need for housing as well. The current environment is all about recognizing that short supply is keeping prices higher and that the -- and that only lower prices enabled by lower cost structures will achieve affordability.\nTurning to our results. In our third quarter, we started approximately 21,500 homes we delivered approximately 21,500 homes and sold just over 23,000 homes. While we were just short of delivery expectations, we exceeded our sales expectations and we were able to grow our community count positioning us better for the remainder of the year. As mortgage interest rates remained higher and consumer confidence declined, we continued to drive volume with our starts while we incentivize sales to enable affordability and limit inventory build. We have successfully focused on maintaining inventory within our 2 completed unsold homes per community level that has been reflected historically. As a result, during the third quarter, sales incentives rose to 14.3% and reducing our gross margin to 17.5%, which was lower than expected on a lower-than-expected average sales price of $383,000.\nOur SG&A came in at 8.2% and which produced a net margin of 9.2%. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that our margins will continue -- it will come in at approximately 17.5% and consistent with last -- with our last quarter, of course, depending on market conditions. We expect to sell between 20,000 and 21,000 homes and deliver between 22,000 and 23,000 homes. We expect our average sales price to be between 380,000 and 390,000 as we expect to continue as we expect to somewhat alleviate pricing pressure on homes that will be sold during the quarter as a result of taking some pressure off of our sales pace. And as I noted earlier, we expect to deliver between 81,500 and 82,500 homes for the year 2025. We expect our overhead in the fourth quarter to continue to run between 7.8% and 8% as we continue to invest in and evolve various Lennar technology solutions that will define our future. These initiatives, as I've said before, have been and will continue to add to SG&A as well as corporate G&A for some time to come for some time to come as they represent a significant investment in our differentiated future. So in conclusion, let me say that while this has been another difficult quarter in the housing market, it is another constructive quarter for Lennar.\nWhile the short-term road ahead might seem a little choppy, we are very optimistic about our future. We are well aware that our numbers aren't where we would like them to be, but neither are market conditions. We are well situated with a strong and growing national footprint, growing community count and growing volume. We have continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we all know persist across our markets. And as we have driven growth, production and volumes, we have positioned our company to evolve and create efficiencies and technologies that will make us a better company built for the future. Perhaps most importantly, our strong balance sheet and even stronger land banking relations of Fortis flexibility and advantaged opportunity to consider and execute on strategic growth for the future as well.\nIn that regard, we will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to use our land partnerships to grow, and we will lean into reshaping our business. by developing and using modern technologies with a focus on cash flow and high returns on capital in order to drive long-term shareholder value. So before the end, I can't help but note how inspired I am by the resurgence of a technology company that Lennar has supported for many years. We are quite confident that open door with its new CEO, Kaz, that's how he's referred to, will be a contributing force and partner in Lennar's technology journey and evolution, has joined Opendoor after 6 years at Shopify, where he is mission-driven as he takes the helm of a company that has the ability and the ambition now to bring modern technology to change the homeownership market forever.\nI have always said that the Opendoor platform functioning properly will add significant bottom line to Lennar while creating convenience and joy for our customers. As Kaz took the CEO position, he sent out a note on why he joined Opendoor and left a flourishing career behind at Shopify. This is what he said in part. It is incredibly important that we use all of our energy and modern tools at our disposal to build products that make home ownership easier. We must make the process of buying and selling a home less frictionful. So more people do it. home ownership isn't about a house. It's about families and community. And that is why I am so incredibly proud that I get to support this team in our mission to use every tool at our disposal to make selling, buying and owning a home easier. AI gives he goes on AI gives us the chance to accelerate this work in ways never before thought possible.\nFrom simplifying the process of buying and selling to unlocking personalized pathways to ownership. AI can help millions of families access homes more efficiently, more affordably and more transparently than ever before. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to redefine what's possible in real estate. That is the message from Kaz we can all do better, we can all be better. Our mission is worthy. Lennar is on that same mission, and we are connected to the success of open door as well. We are extremely well positioned for our future, and we look forward to keeping you up to date on our progress. And with that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nGood morning, Everyone. As Stuart described, we remain intensely focused on executing our core strategy, maintaining consistent high-volume production by leveraging advanced technology throughout our homebuilding operations. This is all about driving efficiencies and position us as the leading technology-enabled low-cost homebuilding manufacturer. Our ongoing strategy has resulted in greater efficiencies, evidenced by improvements in our cycle time, inventory churn and overall cost.\nIn this update, I will discuss our third quarter performance concerning sales pace, cost reduction, cycle time improvements and the execution of our asset-light land strategy. For the third quarter, we achieved a sales pace of 4.7 homes per community per month which aligns with our sales plan. To reach this goal, we utilized Lennar machine, beginning with attracting qualified leads through our digital funnel. We then focus on a rapid response with each customer, along with the quality engagement. Notably, our average response time leads improved by 53% from our second quarter, reducing it to just 46 seconds. This means that when a lead submit a request for information, they typically receive a call or text within 46 seconds. Supporting our sales process, our Internet sales consultants benefit from real-time analytics for coaching immediately after each interaction, thanks to proprietary software.\nThis technology-driven approach results in an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in appointments. Additionally, we utilize our dynamic pricing tool that matches home prices to real-time supply and demand inputs helping us reach our targeted sales goals. Our pricing technology continues to evolve using the feedback and data from our results. The successful execution of Lennar machine has enabled us to sell the right homes at current market prices, keeping our inventory well positioned with an average of under only 2 unsold homes per community -- completed homes per community.\nAffordability continues to challenge customers throughout all of our markets in the quarter as incentives increased by approximately 100 basis points to achieve our sales target. It is this ongoing affordability challenge that drives our focus on production first strategy. As the foundation to this strategy, we delivered a consistent start pace of 4.4 homes per community per month in the quarter. This sustained volume benefits the supply chain, allowing us to leverage volume to reduce both costs and cycle times. Consistent volume supports ongoing negotiations with our trade partners, resulting in lower costs. Over the last 11 quarters, we have achieved cost reductions in 10 of them. The average decrease for each of the 11 quarters is $1.50 per square foot.\nDirect construction costs for the third quarter were down approximately 1% from the second quarter and about 3% year-over-year, reaching the lowest construction cost for our company since the third quarter of 2021. This trend of decreasing direct construction costs will continue into our fourth quarter. We have now achieved cycle time reductions for 11 consecutive quarters with a 6-day sequential decrease from Q2. Bringing the average cycle time for single-family detached homes down to 126 calendar days. This represents a 14-day or 10% year-over-year reduction and marks the [ low cost ] toward the lowest cycle time in our company's history. Technology continues to drive these improvements by providing our construction teams with real-time information displayed in user-friendly dashboards, facilitating better scheduling and field problem solving.\nProof cycle times and technology-driven quality assurance processes have also contributed to higher home quality, evidenced by fewer work orders and a reduced warranty spend down about 35% year-over-year. Our focus on efficiency and cost reduction extends to land development, where we apply similar volume-based strategies to negotiate lower costs with trade partners in the slowing land market. In the third quarter, we began to see meaningful progress in these efforts and expect further improvements in the coming quarters. Land acquisitions are strategically structured to be just in time utilizing our land bank relationships and phased takedowns to minimize carrying costs.\nRegarding our asset-light strategy, we concluded the quarter with improved metrics our supply of owned homesites decreased to 0.1 years from 1.1 years a year ago, and the percentage of controlled home sites increased to 98% from 81% a year ago. Together, these operational improvements have led to an increased inventory trend in the third quarter, now at 1.9% versus 1.6% last year, representing a 19% improvement. In the fourth quarter, our team will continue to focus on executing the strategy of maximizing efficiencies to drive down costs across our operating platform. And now I'll turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding operations. So therefore, I'm going to provide a quick summary of our financial services operations summarize our balance sheet highlights and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter. So starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of $177 million. The strong earnings were primarily driven from our mortgage business and were driven by a higher profit program as a result of higher secondary margins. Once again, our financial services team worked in partnership with our homebuilding teams with the goal of providing a great customer experience for each home buyer.\nTurning to our balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were highly focused on generating cash by pricing homes to market conditions. The result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash and total liquidity of $5.1 billion. As John noted, consistent with our land-light lower-risk manufacturing model, our year supply of owned homesites was 0.1 years our homesites controlled percentage was 98%. We ended the quarter owning 11,000 home sites and controlling 512,000 homesites, for a total of 523,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio of home site provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share and scale in a capital-efficient way. With our focus on turning inventory, our inventory turn increased to 1.9x, and our return on inventory was 24%.\nDuring the quarter, we started about 21,500 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 42,500 homes in inventory. As Stuart mentioned, we carefully manage our inventory levels ending the quarter with fewer than 2 completed unsold homes per community, which is within our historical range. And then turning to our debt position. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion outstanding on our revolving credit facility and our homebuilding debt to total cap was 13.5%. We had no redemption or repurchases of senior notes this quarter. Our next debt maturity of $400 million is not due until June of 2026. Consistent with our commitment to increasing total shareholder returns, we repurchased 4.1 million of our outstanding shares for $507 million, and we paid dividends totaling $129 million.\nOur stockholders' equity was just under $23 billion, and our book value per share was about $89. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with confidence and financial flexibility as we progress through the remainder of 2025. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q4 and provide some guidance estimates, starting with new orders. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 20,000 to 21,000 homes as we match production and sales paces. We anticipate our Q4 deliveries to be in the range of 22,000 to 23,000 homes with a continued focus on turning inventory into cash. Our Q4 average sales price on those deliveries should be about 300,000 to 390,000 and gross margin should be approximately 17.5%, consistent with the prior year. And our SG&A percentage should be in the range of 7.8% to 8%. All these metrics, of course, are dependent on market conditions. For the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other categories, we expect earnings of approximately $50 million.\nWe anticipate our Financial Services earnings to be approximately $130 million to $135 million. For our multifamily business, we expect a loss of about $30 million as we continue to strategically monetize assets to generate higher returns. Turning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of $35 million, excluding the impact of any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments. Our Q4 corporate G&A should be about 1.9% of total revenues, and our foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our Q4 tax rate to be approximately 23.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 253 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $2.10 to $2.30 per share for the quarter.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the operator."

And as usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlights along with some guidance for our third quarter of 2025. And then, of course, we'll take questions in our question-and-answer period. As usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as possible.\nSo let me begin. We're very pleased to review our 2025 second quarter results against the continuing backdrop of a challenging economic environment for the housing market. In the second quarter, we remained focused on our stated strategy by driving volume and growth, matching production and sales pace using margin reduction to enable affordability and sell and deliver homes to avoid building excess inventory. While our margin and earnings have been adjusting and of course, falling in order to accommodate the realities of the housing market conditions, we remain focused on volume and even flow production to enable rerationalized cost structure and overhead in order to find a floor and rebuild margin even as the overall housing market continues to soften. We expected that the new normal of higher interest rates for longer would mean lower margins for longer as we drove affordability. We knew that we and the industry, we're initially going to have to bring down the price of homes we build through incentives and mortgage buydowns to meet affordability and normalize the supply and demand balance. We also knew that you rationalize margin from a lower average sales price would only be -- we would only be able to rebuild margin from a more efficient cost base. We believe that we have gotten ahead of these market realities, and we are building what will become a stronger margin driving platform by using volume to enable us to drive costs down across our platform. We know this takes time, but we also know it will help build a healthier housing market and position Lennar for bottom line growth even as the market remains soft. Admittedly, we haven't gotten there yet, but we believe that we're getting very close to the bottom and the time when we will build back margin from a lower cost structure, and I'll explain that in more detail shortly.\nFirst, I'll discuss the market environment, then review our strategy then relate strategy to our reported numbers and expectations for the near future. Let me start with a macro view of the housing market. Consistent with last quarter's earnings call, the macro economy remains challenging as mortgage interest rates have remained higher, while consumer confidence has been challenged by a wide range of uncertainties both domestic and global. Across the housing landscape, actionable demand has been diminished by both affordability and consumer confidence and therefore, has continued to soften. At the same time, supply remains constrained by years of underproduction. New construction has slowed as builders have pulled back on production due to mixed demand signals, exacerbating the chronic supply shortage that derived from the Great Recession and its aftermath. Additionally, restrictive land permitting, along with higher impact fees remain supply constraints, while labor and material costs, lumber is a particular are generally increasing. Accordingly, given short supply, home prices remain high with median sales hovering around $400,000 in many markets.\nDemand, however, is still high as people want and need homes. Millennials are hitting the prime buying age and are realizing the benefit and perhaps imperative of home ownership. But affordability and waning confidence around buying now are sending confusing signals. We certainly don't want to overstate the negative as the market is definitely not crashing, but it just continues to cool. Inventory is up slightly from last year's lower levels, but still relatively limited. It's just that the housing market right now is driven by supply and demand that can't be properly aligned. This is a difficult cycle as low supply fuels high prices and high prices lock out many of our buyers. Mayors and governors around the country continue to decline the housing shortage and point to affordability or attainability as a priority concern.\nAs a case in point, I and many other homebuilding leaders last week heard from Governor Cox of Utah, explained that there's a significant housing shortage in this state, and they simply need more supply. In fact, they are running a need more supply publicity campaign in the state. He noted that the American dream is homeownership and his state has a 350,000 home deficit that is maintaining prices at an unaffordably high level. He emphatically argued that they need more starter homes in the state that are affordable to those who are just beginning their careers and their families. He describes how he and his state are making noteworthy efforts to eliminate or modify restrictions in zoning and timeliness in order to attract more supply, which will help narrow the supply gap and help align supply and demand. This is a common refrain.\nThe post-pandemic days of strong actionable demand driven by low interest rates are behind us. Initially, many in the housing market held on to the hope that the higher interest rates were temporary, expecting inflation to subside and rates to drift back to lower levels. However, this expectation has not materialized. Looking ahead, there is little evidence to support expectations of materially lower interest rates in the near term. As a result, elevated interest rates have solidified as the new normal. The environment is about recognizing that short supply is keeping prices higher and that only lower prices enabled by lower cost structures will define affordability. This trend has started with reducing margins and using incentives to enable affordability. But looking ahead, it is much more about transitioning to lower cost structures.\nAgainst this backdrop, let me turn to Lennar's operating strategy. Our strategy is and has remained very clear. First, operationally, we are building and delivering consistent value by meeting the market at affordability and using volume, we -- using volume, we push efficiencies through our platform. And second, financially, we are focused on driving an efficient asset-light land life balance sheet to effectively hold and develop our land assets and to build cash flow. As I said earlier, we are not there yet, but we are certain that we are finding a floor with margin and getting close to building it back even in a softer housing market environment.\nAs the current market softness unfolded, we focused on consistent volume by matching our production pace with our sales pace. Although some have questioned why we have maintained volume rather than protect our margin, we are very clear and steadfast on our strategy. Historically, we protected margin as market conditions solved, and we generally led the way in protecting short-term profitability. But we learned through those times that once we step backwards and lose momentum, it becomes increasingly more difficult to restart and recapture volume. The machine slows and does not restart easily. We have concluded that by maintaining volume, we can create new efficiencies and new solutions that are durable for the future and will result in meaningful long-term efficiencies in our cost structure. When we stop and pull back, the restart is difficult and expensive, but even worse, we end up coming back as the exact same company we were before with no significant changes for the future.\nToday at Lennar, we are laser-focused on injecting technology-assisted solutions into our platform with the expectation that we become meaningfully different and decidedly better. We believe that with volume, we can design and engage real change that will produce significant recurring returns for years to come. It really comes down to using hard times to push, to force and accomplish hard things, and this is exactly what we're doing. As many know, we have spent considerable time working with, investing in and exploring technology. And the general business community is consumed with the possibilities and opportunities enabled by modern technology. We think about the extraordinary companies that we made their business by incorporating technology solutions into an older platform like Walmart or Home Depot. They invested heavily in their technology-enabled solutions and cemented themselves as industry leaders. We believe in the virtues of technology solutions and the value and efficiency it can bring. We clearly believe that technology properly configured can enhance productivity. Today's technologies can and will, combined with extraordinary management teams to bring efficiencies that have never been seen before. We believe that productivity and efficiencies can be enhanced by orders of magnitude when technology assistance solutions intersect with company-wide adoption.\nWe have learned that modern technology is not plug and play. In order to get excellent product development and achieve adoption, it requires substantial monetary investment, management time and widespread engagement. Additionally, it needs a lot of volume to run through the system for development and for AB testing. These solutions are very hard to create and even harder to incorporate into an organization that is accustomed to old ways and old habits. But we are certain that the returns on investment will be significant in both cost savings and efficiency in the way that we acquire and interact with our customers. This is why we are driving volume and focus on using that volume to enable unique Lennar technology-enabled solutions. I'll review some examples shortly.\nBut first, let me briefly reflect on our second core strategy of driving an efficient asset-light, land-light balance sheet to efficiently hold and develop our land assets and build cash flow. As I noted last quarter, the Millrose spin was a critical part of our asset-light, land-light strategy, but there is more to accomplish. The land strategy also benefits from our volume as greater predictable volume enables greater certainty for the capital market and will help build a more capital-efficient market for this very important part of our business. We are continuing to drive certainty with volume for our land bank partners, and this will help ensure stability and dependability. In turn, that dependability will translate into certainty and predictability for Lennar. Additionally, this part of our strategy also benefits from our technology-enabled solutions work as a technology-based administration system will enable efficiency at many levels, and I will further address this shortly as well.\nSo now let me turn to our results. As I noted earlier, we're quite pleased with the success embedded in our second quarter results and accomplishments. In very complicated market conditions, Lennar associates have been executing our strategy, while learning and developing new technologies for our future. This hard work -- this is hard work, and I thank them all for their amazing contribution to that future.\nIn our second quarter, we started over 24,000 homes making up for last quarter's shortfall. We delivered over 20,000 homes and sold 22,601 homes. As mortgage interest rates moved higher for longer and consumer confidence declined, we continue to drive volume with our starts while we incentivize sales to enable affordability. As a result, during the second quarter, sales incentives rose again to 13.3%, reducing our gross margin to 18%, excluding purchase accounting, as expected, on a lower-than-expected average sales price. By that, I mean the partners who put in the roads, water and sewer on each attractive land that we develop. They too are dependent on consistent volume to ensure that their investment in heavy equipment is continuously working. Idle equipment costs money with no income. Our focus on volume enables us to have conversations and build relationships that were impossible when the market was headed and strong.\nGiven those initiatives, we look ahead to the third quarter of 2025. We expect that our margin will come in at approximately 18%, of course, depending on market conditions. We expect to sell between 22,000 and 23,000 homes and deliver between 22,000 and 23,000 homes. We expect our average sales price to be between $380,000 and $385,000 as we expect to continue to see pricing pressure on homes that will be sold during the quarter. Nevertheless, we are focused on driving sales and closings and driving strong current cash flow even at reduced profitability. We are focused on maintaining properly sized inventory within our 2 homes completed unsold per community level per month. overall. So that if market conditions stabilize or improve, we will benefit. And if the market conditions soften, we are prepared. We expect our overhead in the third quarter to continue to run on the high side at between 8% and 8.2% as we continue to invest in and evolve various Lennar technology-assisted solutions that will define our future. These initiatives have been and will continue to add SG&A as well as corporate G&A for some time to come as they represent a significant investment in our differentiated future.\nLet me give you some examples. You might remember the program that we once described at the Lunar machine. The machine, which is overseen by Ore Klein, Jeff Moses and Benoit, and they do an amazing job is -- it was and still is our primary digital marketing and customer acquisition product and it has become central to our overall marketing and sales efforts. It operates on a sales force backbone, which ingests Dave from across the Lennar sales landscape. The machines components have become native to the Lennar way of selling. We have invested heavily in the future of this high technology program, which is designed to reduce our customer acquisition cost both internal and external and manage the dynamic pricing of our homes. Perhaps most importantly, we are working closely with executives at Salesforce as well as our advisers at Mackenzie to evolve and design a Lennar agent force that we'll be able to quickly engage with customers in coordination with our sales team as well as independently in off hours.\nOur development of this tool requires significant data flow, and is another reason that we maintained our volume to continue to build our digital marketing and customer acquisition program. Another example is in the land arena. We are at the front end of developing a technology-driven land management system in cooperation with the team at Palantir. Our Lennar interface with Palantir is Jen Lu, who is driving that innovation. We -- as we developed our essential housing and Millrose business engagement, we knew that asset light and land light wasn't enough. Off-balance sheet acquired land with just-in-time delivery of home sites can potentially harbor inefficiency. The day-to-day administration from purchasing land to the development of that land and to the delivery of developed homesites is being crafted with a state-of-the-art high technology-enabled program. This system will help manage every part of the land and land capital relationship and journey. Of course, in order to execute, it requires money, overhead executive management time and attention and substantial volume running through the system that will enable this system to properly evolve.\nFinally, in July, we will execute, which has lost the 2-year transition of our ERP system to JD Edwards E1 system. This has been a massive undertaking by the extraordinary Lennar professionals, professionals in our IT group that was led by Scott Spradley until his retirement a few weeks ago, and to be transitioned by his leadership for Lee and Jason. You guys know who you are, who are ready to complete this rather complex feet. Through the -- although this is really considered just a technical transition, it will enable our combined team of the IT leadership group and Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; to begin on modernization of our entire financial platform from the main office to the field.\nMany of you might have noticed that we at Lennar get prepared fairly quickly to report earnings. The reality is that we close our books within 3 days of quarter end, we have a full numbers package 3 days later, and we have a complete forecast 3 days after that. The good news is that we could report earnings on the tenth day after the quarter end. The bad news is that this extraordinary time frame is handled with limited automation that has been limited by our old school ERP. David Collins really leads this effort. Our financial team does an exceptional job but they will be truly supercharged and capable of much more as we get these processes automated, and we will.\nSo in conclusion, let me say that while this has been a constructive quarter for Lennar, while the short-term road ahead might seem choppy, we are very optimistic about our future. We are well aware that our numbers this quarter aren't where we would like them to be, but neither is the market. And this is a tough time to be spending heavily on innovation, but we are -- this has been an important quarter for Lennar, and we couldn't be prouder of the work and dedication of our extraordinary associates who work together to make it all happen. Together, we have upgraded the financial and operating platforms as we drove production and sales. We are well prepared with a strong and growing national footprint, growing community count and growing volume. We have continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we all know persists across our markets. And we have driven growth, production and volume -- and volume, we have positioned our company to evolve and create efficiencies and technology that will make us a better company and built for the future. Perhaps most importantly, our strong balance sheet and even stronger land banking relations and soon our technology-enabled solutions will afford us flexibility and advantaged opportunity to consider and execute on strategic growth for our future as well. In that regard, we will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to use our land partnerships to grow with a focus on high returns on capital and equity. Lennar is extremely well positioned for the future and we look forward to keeping you up to date on our progress.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Stuart has described in detail the why and how behind our strategy of being a consistent high-volume, technology-enabled homebuilding manufacturer and our commitment to execute that strategy. We strongly believe this strategy will produce greater efficiencies and drive down costs throughout our platform. I'll further review this as I discuss our performance on sales pace, cost and cycle type reductions and the execution of our asset-light land strategy for the second quarter.\nOur sales pace for the second quarter was 4.7 homes per community per month, in line with our sales plan. The well-documented softness of the spring selling season that showed the impact of affordability challenges driven by higher interest rates and elevated home prices along with the uncertainty associated with the macro environment. As the market softened, we leaned into our people and processes define market and maintain sales pace. This involves the rigor of a daily review of marketing and sales data to make needed adjustments. Based on a real-time analysis of traffic, sales, sales pace and inventory, we would even make no adjustments to prices, increased incentives or decrease incentives. This is powered by some of the technology that Stuart referenced as we've added new automated pricing capabilities to Lennar machine. This particular technology analyzes all of this marketing and sales data and provides pricing recommendations. It is in its early stages, but we're encouraged thus far.\nWe continuously make pricing adjustments with the goal of ending the week with both the targeted number of sales and with a focus on selling our completed or suite-related inventory. If any community falls short of these goals at any given week, analysis of the data provides us, of course, correcting actions. By hearing to this discipline, we ended the quarter well positioned with an average of under 2 uncompleted -- 2 unsold completed homes per community. All of the markets we operate in experienced some level of softening. Even in our strongest performing markets, buyers needed the assistance of incentives. Incentives while vary across the different markets, were primarily in the form of assistance with mortgage rate items. The markets that experienced more challenging conditions during the quarter were the Pacific Northwest markets of Seattle and Portland, the Northern California markets of the Bay area in Sacramento, the Southwestern market of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Colorado and some Eastern markets such as Raleigh, Atlanta and Jacksonville. These markets experience sensitivity to higher home prices and/or the macro impact on the technology workforce.\nTurning to the production side of operations. As Stuart highlighted, achieving construction efficiencies with the goal of our production first strategy. Our start pace in the second quarter was 5.1 homes per community per month providing meaningful volume to the supply chain, which is critical to accomplishing our mission of lowering cost and cycle times. Achieving these goals is measured by reducing costs across our entire platform. The proper execution of this strategy will deliver savings in direct construction, land development, land acquisition, indirect cost and SG&A. Volume and importantly, consistent even flow volume along with efficient to-buill plans and digitally enabled scheduling and quality control processes all drive cost savings. Our commitment to this consists volume move our trades can drive down their own cost structure as well as work successfully on lower margins, allowing us to stabilize and ultimately grow our margins. The cost reduction discussions with our supply chain are grounded in both the recognition that our consistent volume and market conditions require a recalibration of cost.\nDirect construction costs in the second quarter were lower sequentially by 1.5% from Q1 and on a year-over-year basis by 3.5% to our lowest direct construction costs since Q3 of 2021. This trend will continue into our third and fourth quarters. Another benchmark of efficiency is our cycle time. Our second quarter cycle time decreased by 5 days sequentially from Q1 down to 132 calendar days on average for single-family detached homes. This is an 18-day or 12% decrease year-over-year and is lower than pre-pandemic cycle times. We expect to see continued improvement in cycle time as well throughout our third and fourth quarters. Our operating strategy is also resulting in reductions in land development costs and in restructuring land acquisitions. As Stuart noted, our consistent volume comes into play as it provides the predictable work the land development contractors to depend on utilization of heavy equipment. Similarly, the consistent and dependable takedown of land in a slowing macro environment allows for the proper alignment of timing of land closing and a recalibration of the purchase price of land.\nWith respect to the question regarding tariffs. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have had no impact to date to our costs from tariffs. We work closely with the supply chain to prepare for alternative sourcing if it becomes necessary as well as the expectation that our trade partners will work with us to mitigate and offset cost impacts should they present themselves. As Stuart addressed, we are able to provide further details, we continue to execute on our asset-light strategy. We ended the quarter with our supply of owned homesites improving to 0.1 years, down from 1.2 years a year ago and controlled home site percentage increasing to 98% from 79% a year ago.\nDuring the quarter, land banks acquired a harbor half of about 17,000 home sites from about $1.4 billion and a commitment of about $2.1 billion in land development. We purchased during the quarter from our various land bank partners, almost 22,000 finished homesites for about $2.7 billion. The cost and processes in and around land banking provide another area for efficiencies, as Stuart discussed. Our focus on the coordination between land sellers and land banks of just-in-time land acquisitions with the commencement of land development. Our consistent volume provides the opportunity for processes and technologies that will lead to cost reductions. These improvements in execution of all of our operating strategies enable capital and production efficiencies, leading to an improved inventory churn, which now stands at 1.8 versus 1.6 last year, a 13% improvement. In our third quarter, we will continue to focus on meeting our planned sales pace while intensifying our efforts to reduce costs and maximize efficiencies across our operating platform. I want to thank all of our Lennar associates for their hard work, focus and dedication for the work accomplished in our second quarter and for the hard work that lies in front of us.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our operating performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operation, summarize our balance sheet highlights and then provide estimates for the third quarter.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the second quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of $157 million. The strong earnings were primarily from our mortgage business and were driven by a higher profit per loan as a result of higher secondary margins and also due to a higher capture rate. The financial services team is intensely dedicated to providing a great customer experience for each homebuyer and has created a true partnership with our homebuilding team to best accomplish that goal. Our LSS team together with our homebuilding divisions are truly one Lennar.\nTurning to our balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were highly focused on generating cash by pricing homes to market conditions. The result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and $5.4 billion of total liquidity. We are now positioned as a land light of lower-risk manufacturing homebuilder. Our year supply of owned homesites was 0.1 years, as Jon noted, and our homesites control percentage was 98%. We ended the quarter owning 12,000 home sites and controlling 520,000 homesites for a total of 532,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share and scale in a capital-efficient way.\nWith our focus on returns, we are pleased that our inventory turn increased to 1.8x with a solid return on inventory of 27%. As we stated in the past, we balance margins and asset turnover as both contribute to higher returns. During the quarter, we started approximately 24,200 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 42,100 homes in inventory. This inventory number includes 2,900 homes that were completed unsold, which as noted, is under 2 homes per community and continues to be within our historical range.\nTurning to our debt position. We opportunistically raised $700 million in senior notes at 5.2% due in July 2030. We primarily used the proceeds to pay off $500 million of senior notes that matured in May. As a result, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 11% at quarter end. Our net debt maturity of $400 million is not due until June of 2026. Consistent with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns, we repurchased $4.7 million of our outstanding shares for $517 million, and we paid dividends totaling $134 million. Our stockholders' equity was just under $23 billion our book value per share was about $87. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with confidence and financial flexibility as we progress through the balance of 2025.\nWith that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q3 and provide some guidance estimates. Starting with new orders. We expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 22,000 to 23,000 homes as we matched production and sales pace. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to also be in the range of 22,000 to 23,000 homes with a continued focus on turning inventory into cash. Our Q3 average sales price on those deliveries should be about 380,000 to 385,000 and gross margin should be approximately 18% and as we continue to price to market and use incentives to enable our customers to attain affordable homes.\nOur SG&A percentage should be in the range of 8% to 8.2%, and impacted by our continued investment in technology solutions. All of these metrics, of course, are dependent on market conditions. For the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect a loss of about $25 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings to be approximately $175 million to $180 million. For our multifamily business, we expect a loss of about $40 million as we continue to strategically monetize assets to generate higher returns.\nSo turning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of $35 million, excluding the impact of potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments. Our corporate G&A should be about 1.8% of total revenues, and our foundation contribution should be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be approximately 25.3% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 257 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $2 to $2.20 per share for the quarter. In conclusion, I like Stuart and Jon would like to say thank you to the financial teams in our division and in our corporate office. We bring an incredible amount of dedication to the table each and every day, and it is greatly appreciated.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; and Fred Rothman, our Chief Operating Officer.\nAs usual, today, I'm going to give a brief macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction cost, cycle time some of our other operating positions. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for the second quarter of 2025. And then, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period. And as usual, I'd like to ask you to please limit to 1 question and 1 follow-up so we can accommodate as many as possible. So let me begin.\nAs we noted in our press release last night, we're very pleased to review our 2025 first quarter results against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment for the housing market. We adhere to our strategy and focus on driving consistent volume and growth by matching sales and production base and using our margin as a circuit breaker. We completed our Moro spin-off, distributing shares to our shareholders and supporting our transition to an asset-light land-light model, and we completed our Rausch Coleman acquisition using our asset-light model as we expand into new markets. While margin and earnings have been adjusting to movements in the overall housing market, we are confident that our focus on volume and even flow will position us very well for resilience, durability and growth in the future. Let me briefly discuss the overall housing market.\nConsistent with last quarter's earnings call, the macro economy remains challenging as mortgage interest rates have remained higher for longer, which has left the overall housing market weaker for longer. Across the housing landscape, actionable demand has slowed materially. On a bad news is good news basis, all of this has led to the long-waited environment where the costs of both homes, new and existing and apartments start to come down. As we noted in our press release, our average sales price this quarter net of incentives declined to $408,000, 1% lower than last year. Evidence suggests that the time is now and the sticky and large housing component of inflation might soon contribute to curtail the last mile to the 2% target. While underlying demand for homes remains strong, actionable demand is limited by affordability and credit, which remained challenged by limited funds for down payments as well as income qualification for mortgage.\nMost recently, even where household income indicates an approvable mortgage qualification, elevated personal debt levels have often presented as an additional impediment to already strained mortgage access. Additionally, until recently, consumers have been generally confident that they will remain employed and that their compensation is safe. But more recently, even that safety has been called into question. A somewhat confused consumer and wavering consumer confidence have challenged the consumer's desire and ability to transact. While there continues to be considerable traffic of customers looking for homes, the urgency to actually transact remains tested. The overall supply of homes has also remained constrained by years of underproduction.\nAdditional shortfall in production will likely be triggered by now music demand together with already existing restrictive land permitting and higher impact fees at local levels and higher construction costs across the housing landscape. Additionally, new approaches to both immigration and tariffs have potential limiting impact, and John will discuss this further in just a few minutes. In summary, the housing market has softened as affordability and consumer confidence have limited actionable demand. Incentives have been increasing and net housing prices seem to be moderating. At very least, housing will not be contributing to inflationary pressures and while demand is constrained, supply is equally limited. Against this backdrop, let me turn to Lennar's operating strategy.\nOur strategy is and has remained very clear. That is simplify our business by focusing on the 2 core tenants of our operating strategy. Operationally, build and deliver consistent volume to maximize efficiencies. And financially drive asset-light land light focused to build cash flow. Now that we have completed our Millrose spin-off, we have intensified our focus on each. First, we focus on consistent volume by [indiscernible] production phase with our sales base. This means that as market conditions change to the positive or to the negative, we focus on driving and delivering consistent volume at the division level and at the community level in order to maximize efficiencies in construction costs and cycle times in SG&A and in all elements of marketing and sales.\nWe also strive to deliver consistent and even slow volume to our trade partners so they can be more efficient and deliver cost savings to us. While we are not there yet, we are getting better each quarter and will accelerate progress now that the spin is behind us. Our execution in the first quarter was materially better than in the fourth quarter last year when we missed our expectation on sales volume. This quarter, we did adjust and adapt to market conditions in real time as we adjusted incentives and pricing, we achieved expected sales volume and we did not enable our inventory levels to spike.\nWe are laser-focused on keeping sales volume up in order to catch up pace and find even flow in each division and each community. By maintaining this discipline, we will not build up inventory in either built homes or in developed home sites, and we will efficiently convert production to cash. As I noted last quarter, the catching up comes at a cost, and that cost is additional pressure on margins. Accordingly, we have looked ahead to the second quarter of 2025 and as we look ahead to the second quarter of 2025, we expect to sell between 22,500 and 23,500 homes and deliver between 19,500 and 20,500 homes.\nWe expect our margin to be approximately 18%, depending on market conditions as we expect to continue to see margin pressure on deliveries that will be sold during the quarter. Nevertheless, we are focused on driving sales and closings and driving strong current cash flow even at reduced profitability while maintaining properly sized inventory levels so that as market conditions stabilize or improve, we will benefit from normalized margins across our growing volume. On a side note, our margins are actually quite strong, except for the approximately 13% incentive we are using to enable affordability. These are outsized for the moment and normalized incentives should be around 5% to 6% and that would track to a normalized margin for a normalized margin to be in the mid-20s percent margin.\nWe remain focused on consistent volume in current market conditions, and we will be very well positioned as the market normalizes. The second focus of our operating strategy is to refine our assets like configuration. We are much closer to the completion of the strategic rework of our operating platform from being a traditional homebuilder with sizable land assets to becoming a pure-play land like asset-light manufacturing model homebuilder that benefits from just-in-time delivered a just-in-time finished homesite delivery. The Millrose spin completed the backbone structure of that rework now we are and have the time to focus on refinement of that platform. With Milo's operational, we now have a strong complement of land bank partners that enable the land and land development activity that enables the just-in-time delivery of fully developed homesites as a manufacturer. Of course, each of these valued partners operate a little differently and has a different cost structure. But with the diverse land trade partners, we will refine cost and execution over time.\nAs with all of our trade partners, our land partners will benefit from our consistent and predictable volume and our cost structure will benefit as a direct result. As we've noted before, once refined, we have conviction that our structured asset-light land-light model enables far more predictable volume and growth with a much lower asset base and lower risk profile. We are confident that our operating strategies of consistent volume and an asset-light land light just-in-time delivery system of developed homesites will continue to enable our company to be best positioned to rationalize our cost structure and be best positioned with strong volume as margins normalize. Let me turn back briefly to our first quarter 2025 results.\nAs I noted earlier, we are quite pleased with the successes embedded in our first quarter results and accomplishments. In our first quarter, we started 17,651 homes, delivered 17,834 homes and sold 18,355 homes. As mortgage interest rates remained higher for longer and consumer confidence search for footing, we drove volume with starts while we incentivize sales to enable affordability. As a result, during the first quarter, sales incentives rose to approximately 13%, reducing our gross margin to 18.7%. Our SG&A came in at 8.5%, which produced a net margin of 10.2%, although we were able to maintain construction costs and reduce cycle time, as Jon will detail shortly.\nWe exceeded our sales and delivery expectations while we were able to grow our community count from 1,447 last quarter to 1,584 communities this quarter, including our Raush Coleman acquisition, and we're better prepared and we are now better prepared for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to deliver between 86,000 and 88,000 homes in 2025. Our results represent a consistent and strategic quarter of operating results in the context of a very difficult economic environment, all while completing a time-intensive Millrose spin and growing into new markets with the Raush Coleman acquisition. We clearly were able to walk into government at the same time.\nAdditionally, on the positive side, we have driven our operating strategy to enable consistent cash flow, which has enabled us to strategically allocate capital. Our strategy has enabled us to repurchase another 5.2 million shares of stock for $703 million in the first quarter, while we continue to deliver a strong dividend. Additionally, we distributed as a dividend to Lennar shareholders, 80% of the shares of Mill Rose Property Corporation and through that Millrose ownership, they will receive a regular dividend while providing the permanent capital, which will drive the future success of Lennar. As for the remaining 20% of the Millrose shares, Lennar will shortly dispose of that remaining 20% in either a further distribution of Millrose shares or at Lennar's option may execute a potential exchange for Lennar's shares which would basically effectuate a cashless buyback of Lennar shares.\nJust to say this again, the additional 20% interest will be retained for a relatively brief period of time and will either be distributed for exchange for Lennar shares to effectuate the cashless stock buyback. After our stock repurchases and dividends, we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of cash on book and an 8.9% debt-to-total capital ratio. We are well positioned after the Millrose spin to be able to continue to return capital to shareholders as we continue to grow our business. We are very well positioned from a balance sheet to operating strategy to be able to adjust and address as the market unfolds as we execute through the year. So let me conclude and say that while this has been a constructive quarter for Lennar and while the short-term road ahead might still seem a little choppy, we're very optimistic about the longer-term road ahead.\nThis has been a very exciting quarter for Lennar, and we couldn't be proud of the work and dedication of our extraordinary associates who worked together to make it all happen. Let me also take a minute to welcome to the team, the talented new members of Lennar who have joined from our Raush Coleman combination. We couldn't be prouder to now have us all working together as one. Together, we've expanded our platform as we have upgraded the financial and operating platforms of Lennar and as we will continue to drive production and sales. We've continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across the market. And as and men interest rates normalize, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated and our margin will quickly recover.\nAs a company, we are well prepared with a strong and growing national footprint, growing community count and growing volume. Perhaps most importantly, our strong balance sheet and even stronger land banking relations afford us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful growth for our future. In that regard, we will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to use our land partnerships to grow with a focus on high return on capital and on equity. We will also continue to focus our pure-play business model and reduce exposure to noncore assets. We will continue to drive to just-in-time home site delivery and an asset-light balance sheet. And as we complete our asset-light transformation, we will continue to refine our platform and generate strong cash flow and return the capital to shareholders through dividend and stock buyback while we also pursue strategic growth.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Stuart has highlighted for you our strategy of being a consistent high-volume homebuilding manufacturer. I'll further review this as I discuss our performance on sales pace, cost reduction and cycle time reduction along with the execution of our asset-light demand strategy for the first quarter. As noted, our overall first quarter sales pace of 4.1 homes per community per month was wide in line with our stock case of 4.0. This was accomplished with consistent starts and accurate cycle time, which determine the sales pace leaders at each community. Knowing the output of this production, our marketing and sales teams engaged Lennar machine to turn digital needs into appointments and they convert appointments into sales. Throughout each week, we evaluate leads, appointments and sales activity to measure if we are on track to achieve the [ mediate ] pace.\nWe continuously adjust to ensure we end the week not only with a targeted number of sales but the sales of the right home. If the community falls short on pace in any given week, there's a clear focus on taking action to course correct and get back on pace. To drive the needed level of quality appointments, we focus on improving the experience for our customers to achieve higher conversion rates versus the alternative of chasing more top of funnel needs, which increases marketing spend. We believe our approach produces more qualified and motivated customer appointments, which we can convert into sales at higher conversion rates.\nDuring the quarter, as we move past the beginning of February, we do not see the seasonal pickup typically associated with the beginning of the spring selling season. So we continue to lean into our machine, focusing on converting leads and appointments and adjusting incentives as needed to maintain sales pace. These adjustments came in the form of mortgage rate buydowns, price reductions and closing cost of systems. In general, homebuyers in Florida and Texas are 2 highest-volume states needed more help than most other markets around the country. We need more incentives in Florida and Texas markets to assist buyers achieve mortgage payments they can afford as well as to offset both a slowing in-migration environment and increased inventory.\nAll markets around the country require incentives to assist buyers in the current home buying environment. In this challenging macro environment, we utilized on our machine, along with our dynamic pricing model to identify unsold homes nearing completion. [indiscernible] are set for those homes and prices are established to achieve sales preventing the buildup of inventory. Accordingly, we ended the quarter with an average of about 2 unsold completed homes per community. Our production team continued its stride of being an ever more highly efficient homebuilder, the disciplines of planning for and delivering consistent construction starts, designing efficient to build floor plans, deploying digitally enabled scheduling and quality control processes and a well-trained construction management team, all allow for the development of meaningful strategic partnerships with our entire supply chain.\nThe continuous improvement of these strategic relationships with our trade partners is the core of how we drive down both construction costs and cycle time quarter after quarter. In the first quarter, our construction costs were lower by 1% from Q4 and decreased on a year-over-year basis by 2.5% to our lowest direct construction costs since Q3 of 2021. We expect this trend to continue for our second quarter and into the year. Also in our first quarter, cycle time decreased on average by 1 day sequentially from Q4 down to 137 calendar days on average for single-family detached homes. This is a 17-day or 11% decrease year-over-year. We also expect continued improvement in cycle time reduction for our second quarter. As Stuart discussed, the execution of our strategy of matching our sales pace to our production pace, required sales incentives of 13% in the quarter, about 700 basis points above normal.\nOur trade partners know that we are doing this to maintain production levels, which they greatly benefit from. Our trade partners work with us to reduce their operating costs and when needed to lower their margins. This is critical to our execution of reducing construction costs in each quarter. Let me address tariffs. We've been in discussions regarding the potential impacts of tariffs with our supply chain. These discussions all start with a review of margin reductions or already taken. This leads to a constructive effort to identify alternative sourcing and material strategies. Additionally, we prepare our trade partners to absorb potential increases to their supply chain costs and events of tariffs.\nTo date, we have no impact -- sorry, today, we have had no impact to our costs from tariffs and we'll work closely with all our trade partners to further tariffs present themselves to mitigate and offset cost impacts. Similarly, with respect to potential labor disruptions that could derive from immigration policy enforcement our consistent high volume makes our construction a priority for our trade partners. Today, there's been no shortage of labor or impact to cycle time. Again, our strategic trade partners appreciate the financial impact on margins and maintaining our consistent high volume, and we expect to be as well positioned as possible should any disruptions present themselves.\nAs Stuart addressed and as Diane will provide further details, we have further executed on our asset-light strategy with the Millrose spin. Post Millrose, we ended the quarter with our supply of owned homesites improving to 0.2 years, down from 1.3 years and controlled homesites increasing to 98% from 77% a year ago. During the quarter, land bank acquired on behalf of about 29,000 home sites for about $1.8 billion and a commitment of about $1.1 billion in land development. We purchased during the quarter from our various land banks. Land bank partners almost 15,000 homesites for about $1.6 billion. Operationally, our production first discipline of even close starts allows for the planning and consistency of takedowns from land banks, providing for efficiencies in the operations of land management by both our land bank partners and ourselves.\nAs we move forward, we are focusing on refining the efficiencies in and around the coordination of just-in-time land acquisitions by our land partners and us with the commencement of land development and/or home construction. These improvements in the execution of all of our operating strategies enable capital and production efficiencies, leading to an improving inventory turn, which now stands at [ 1.7 ] versus [ 1.5 ] last year, a 13% increase. In our second quarter, we will continue to refine the execution of Lennar marketing and sales machine, our even flow, high-volume production and all land acquisition and development activities to be even more operationally and capital efficient. I also want to extend a welcome to our Rausch Coleman associate to the Lennar family and thank all of our Lennar associates for their hard work, focus and dedication.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart and John have provided a great deal of color regarding our operating performance. So therefore, I am going to spend a few minutes summarizing balance sheet highlights and then provide estimates for the second quarter. So starting with the balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were highly focused on turning our inventory and generating cash by pricing homes to market conditions. The result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $3 billion revolving credit facility. This provided total liquidity of approximately $5.3 billion.\nAs noted, during our first quarter, we completed the distribution of shares of Millrose properties to our shareholders. As a result, we spun off from our balance sheet, $5.6 billion of land, representing 87,000 homesites and $1 billion of cash. With this strategic transaction, we completed the next milestone in our journey of becoming a land-light just-in-time manufacturer of home and established a provider of recyclable cash for the future. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of Rausch Coleman home, which extended our footprint into both new and existing markets. As a result of the Millrose and Rausch transaction, we ended the quarter owning 13,000 homesites and controlling 533,000 homesites for a total of 546,000 homesites.\nAs Jon noted, this translated into our years owned supply improving to 0.2 years and our homesites controlled increasing to 98%, our lowest years owned and highest controlled percentage in our history. We believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share and scale in a capital-efficient way. As we look at ratios, our inventory churn was 1.7x, and our return on inventory was almost 30%. During the quarter, we started approximately 17,700 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 38,300 homes in inventory, this inventory number includes approximately 3,100 homes that were completed unsold, which is about 2 homes per community well within our target historic range. Turning to our debt position.\nWe had no redemptions or repurchases of senior notes this quarter. Our net debt maturity of $500 million is not until May 2025. Our homebuilding debt to total capital was 8.9%, including the impact of the Millrose spinoff. Consistent with our commitment to increasing total shareholder returns, we repurchased [ 5.2 million ] of our outstanding shares for $703 million, and we paid dividends totaling $132 million. This was, of course, in the distribution to the Millrose shares. Our stockholders' equity was just under $23 billion, and our book value per share was about $86.\nIn summary, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we progress through 2025. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q2 and provide some guidance estimates. Starting with new orders. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 22,500 to 23,500 homes as we match sales and production paces. We anticipate our Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 19,500 to 20,500 per with a continued focus on turning inventory into cash. Our Q2 average sales price on those delivery should be about [ 390,000 to 400,000 ] as we continue to price to market to meet affordability. We expect our gross margin to be approximately 18%, which excludes purchase accounting, depending on market conditions.\nMargin is impacted by our use of incentives as a bridge to customers and affordably priced homes. Our SG&A percentage should be in the range of 8% to 8.2% to maintain sales activity, so the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect a loss of about $15 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. For our multifamily segment, we expect to be about breakeven for the quarter. Then turning to on other.\nWe expect a loss of between $25 million to $30 million, excluding the impact of any potential mark-to-market adjustments for our public technology investments. Our Q2 corporate G&A should be about 2% of total revenue, and our foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our Q2 tax rate to be approximately 25.3% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 261 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $1.80 to $2 per share for the quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good, and thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President, Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Fred Rothman is here, our Chief Operating Officer; and Marshall Lanes as well, Chairman of the Lennar Charitable Foundation along with a few others.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating some construction cost, cycle time and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlights along with some limited guidance for the first quarter of 2025. And then, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period. And as usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit to 1 question, 1 follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many as possible.\nSo let me begin. Our fourth quarter was a challenging quarter at Lennar as interest rates declined approximately 100 basis points through the quarter and further challenged affordability. Starting early in the quarter, we saw sales stall at then existing price and incentive levels. That necessitated increased incentives, interest rate buydowns and price adjustments to activate sales and avoid increased inventory buildup. Accordingly, our fourth quarter results missed expectations as new orders were 16,895 short of the 19,000 we expected, and our gross margin was 22.1%, short of the 22.5% that we expected.\nThe shortfall in margin resulted from increased incentives on homes sold and delivered within the quarter. Accordingly, we are moderating our expectations for margins and sales in the first quarter of 2025 as the market adjusts and stabilized. Overall, the economic environment, which we believe last quarter was constructive for the homebuilding industry, has certainly turned more challenging as longer-term interest rates, along with mortgage rates have climbed steadily since our last earnings call.\nWhile underlying demand for new homes remains very strong and the supply of available dwelling remains chronically short, a combination of wavering consumer confidence and elevated cost of acquisition have challenged the customers desire and ability to transact. While there continues to be considerable traffic of customers looking for homes, the urgency to actually transact has quieted as customers adjust to a new normal.\nOf course, affordability has been a limiting factor for demand and access to homeownership for some time now. Inflation and interest rates have hindered the ability of the average family to accumulate a down payment or to qualify for a mortgage. Higher interest rates have also locked households in lower interest rate mortgages and curtailed the natural move up as families expand and need more space. Rate buydowns and incentives have enabled demand to access the market.\nWhile consumers remain employed and are generally confident that they will remain employed and their compensation will rise, higher interest rates and inflation have outstripped their ability or desire to act. While strong employment often goes hand in hand with a strong housing market, interest rates have put many with need on the sidelines. As strong demand enabled by incentives and mortgage rate buydowns has driven the new home market over the past years. We expect the broad-based demand cycle to reestablish to reestablish as rates stabilize or even moderate and as pent-up demand continues to build against short supply.\nWhile demand has been constrained by affordability, the supply of homes remains constrained. The well-documented chronic housing shortage is the result of years of underproduction. This shortage is exacerbated by continuing shortfalls in production driven by now muted demand, together with already existing restricted land permitting and higher impact fees at local levels and higher construction costs across the housing landscape. Mayors and governors across the country are acutely aware of the housing shortage and shortfall in their respective geographies. Many have been pounding the table about the need for affordable housing attainable housing and workforce housing in their respective markets.\nOn a final note, immigration and tariffs have recently been added to the list of questions and potential concerns confronting the industry. We recognize that the landscape is still being shaped around these issues and cannot be addressed with certainty. Nevertheless, our early evaluation suggests limited impact to us and to the industry, and Jon will discuss this in further detail shortly.\nAgainst this macro backdrop, we continue to have conviction around the 2 poor parts of our operating strategy. First, we are focused on volume and matching our production with the sales base. While our execution in the fourth quarter was challenged by the rapid and unexpected change in the direction of interest rates, we did adjust and adapt to new market conditions, and we adjusted incentives and pricing and we did not enable our inventory levels to spike. We are currently focused on keeping sales volume up as we accelerate in order to catch our pace and correct the sales miss that we had in the fourth quarter.\nOf course, the catch-up in sales pace comes at a cost and that cost is additional pressure on margin. Accordingly, as we have looked ahead to the deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, we expect to sell between 17,500 homes and 18,000 homes and deliver between 17,000 and 17,500 homes. We expect our margin to be 19% to 19.25% and as we expect approximately 50% of the deliveries in the quarter will be sold during the quarter, and this will dilute the 20% margin that is already embedded in our backlog. Nevertheless, we are focused on driving sales and closings, driving strong current cash flow even at reduced profitability and maintaining carefully managed inventory levels so that as market conditions stabilize or improve, we will benefit from normalized margins across our growing volume.\nSecondly and simultaneously, we continue to migrate our operating platform to an asset-light configuration. We are much closer to the completion of the strategic rework of our operating platform from being a land company that happens to build homes to becoming a pure-play land light asset light manufacturing model, homebuilder that benefits from just-in-time finished homesite delivery. Again, we have conviction that our structured asset light land -- land-light model enables far more predictable volume and growth with a much lower asset base and lower risk profile that has been and will continue to be at the core of our operating model. The value of this structure will be seen in the execution of our Rausch Coleman combination in conjunction with the Millrose spin, and I'll discuss this in more detail shortly.\nConsistent volume and growth enables improving operating efficiencies in construction costs, cycle time, customer acquisition costs and SG&A. Additionally, it has driven consistent and dependable cash flow even with variable bottom line results. And finally, it has enabled the consistent and predictable takedown of just-in-time delivered fully developed home sites, and that has attracted capital to the structured land banking partnerships that have driven the nearly $20 billion of transactions that have enabled our land-light transformation to date. We are confident that our operating strategy of consistent volume and growth with a just-in-time delivery of developed homesites will continue to enable our company to be best positioned to rationalize our cost structure and be best positioned with strong volume as margins normalize.\nLet me turn back briefly to our fourth quarter operating results. As I noted earlier, while we are disappointed with our first quarter -- with our fourth quarter actual results, they do represent a consistent and strategic quarter of operating results in the context of a difficult affordability environment. As mortgage interest rates migrated higher, to around 7% through the quarter, we drove volume with starts, while we incentivized sales to enable affordability.\nIn our fourth quarter, we started almost 18,500 homes, sold almost 17,000 homes and closed approximately 22,200 homes. While I've already talked about market conditions, later starts in sales were also attributable to a lighter community count at the beginning of the quarter, which has now been corrected. We have been able to solve the community comp shortfall that we described last quarter, and we brought our community count up from 1,283 communities at the end of the third quarter to 1,447 communities, which is now 13% higher than last quarter and 15% higher than the prior year. Our community count positions us materially better to drive the volume we expect at lower absorption rates as we enter 2025. We expect lower absorption rates to put less stress on our margin over time as we deliver between 86,000 and 88,000 homes in 2025, reflecting an 8% to 10% increase over 2024.\nDuring the fourth quarter, sales incentives rose to 10.8% as we addressed affordability and the community can lag. As an offset, we were able to maintain construction costs and reduce cycle time, as Jon will detail shortly, and we have maintained our customer acquisition costs while our SG&A rose to 7.2% and reflecting our lower volume and lower average sales price leverage. On the positive side, on the positive side, we have driven production pace in sync with sales pace and abused our margin as a point of adjustment to enable consistent cash flow. Our strategy has enabled us to repurchase another 3 million shares of stock for $521 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total stock repurchase for the year to 13.6 million shares for over $2 billion in cash.\nWe ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash on book and a 7.5% debt-to-total capital ratio. We are extremely well positioned to spin Millrose and to be able to continue to repurchase shares and reduce debt as we have driven strong overall operating results to date. We continue to be exceptionally positioned as a company from our balance sheet to our operating strategy to be able to adjust and address the market as it unfolds as we enter 2025.\nWith that said, we're very optimistic about our future. On the one hand, we remain confident that the current volatility driven by affordability and interest rates will subside. Demand will adapt to a new normal and the supply shortage will remain the dominant theme. Volume will continue to help reduce our cost structure and incentives will normalize and margins will normalize, and our increased volume will multiply bottom line. On the other hand, we are equally enthusiastic about the Millrose spin and the Rausch Coleman acquisition and the way both will work together.\nAs most of you know from yesterday's press release, Millrose properties, the subsidiary reform to carry out the spin that we announced some time ago, has now filed a public SEC registration statement, and it is available on the SEC website. In the very near future, the spin-off will be public and that will complete our now almost 5-year migration to an asset-light operating model. Millrose will be the first publicly listed land banking REIT and will use our homesite option purchase platform that we call the hopper to provide just-in-time fully developed home site inventory for Lennar, for Lennar related ventures and subsequently to other homebuilders across the U.S. as well.\nThe hopper is a comprehensive suite of systems and procedures used to operate and manage the acquisition, financing and development of land assets at scale designed and refined by Lennar over the past 20 years. Millrose will be externally managed by a subsidiary of Kennedy Lewis Investments and institutional alternative investment firm with approximately $17 billion in AUM and extensive experience with both Lennar and with the land and land development business for homebuilders. All of Millrose's operating costs will be paid by Kennedy Lewis through its management fee, and Millrose will have no employees of its own.\nMillrose will receive consistent cash flows pursuant to option contracts. It will receive a recurring monthly option payments, which will be used to pay predictable dividends to shareholders and will additionally receive initial deposits and proceeds from the sale of fully developed homesites. Millrose will recycle proceeds from the sale of fully developed homesites into new acquisition and development land deals without needing to raise new investor funds. Accordingly, Millrose is an added source of more permanent capital for Lennar and as an addition to organically negotiated option agreements with developers and other professionally managed programs that are currently private equity base. As such, Millrose is an important evolution of our land-light strategy as it enables growth and inorganic opportunities, improved cash flow generation and strong returns on equity and inventory to Lennar.\nLennar will contribute to Millrose approximately $5.2 billion of undeveloped and partially developed land and approximately $1 billion of cash. Additionally, Millrose will acquire approximately $900 million of land assets as part of our Rausch Coleman acquisition, while Lennar will acquire the WIP inventory and the homebuilding operations. We believe that the ongoing relationship with Millrose can facilitate other transactions in an asset-light manner as well. Millrose will be positioned with adequate capital to operate its core business and will have a balance sheet that enables additional debt or equity as needed for strategic engagement or for growth. Lennar will distribute 80% of the stock of Millrose to Lennar shareholders. There will be 1 share of Millrose stock for every 2 shares of Lennar. Lennar will shortly thereafter dispose of the remaining 20%, which, by the way, is nonvoting in a distribution of Millrose shares or a potential exchange for Lennar shares, which would basically effectuate a cashless buyback of Lennar shares.\nLet me say this one more time as it might be a little confusing. The additional 20% interest which is nonvoting shares will be retained by Lennar for a very brief period of time and will quickly either be distributed or exchanged for Lennar shares to effectuate a cashless stock buyback. Needless to say, we are very excited to bring Millrose public in the very near future.\nNow let me turn briefly to the Rausch Coleman acquisition. As I have noted, the Milo spin will work hand in hand with our previously announced purchase of Rausch Coleman Homes, which is based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Rausch Coleman is led by Jon Rau, a fourth-generation builder who built this company into the 21st largest homebuilder in the country. We look forward to welcoming Jon and his extraordinary team to the Lennar family as Jon will continue to work alongside Lennar as a partner and many of the Rausch Coleman associates will actually join the company.\nThis acquisition fits squarely into our strategic growth plan of acquiring companies in concert with our Millrose property spin-off, where Lennar acquires the operating assets, including WIP and Millrose acquires the landholdings. This enables Lennar to acquire with a limited investment and producing a high return enabled by the Millrose platform.\nRausch Coleman builds in 12 primary markets across 7 states and is the #1 builder by market share in 6 of these markets. This acquisition will result in our expanding into new and desirable markets in Arkansas, Campus and Missouri, while growing our existing operations in Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma and Florida. Rausch Coleman is a very strong cultural fit for Lennar, sharing a common operational philosophy focused on building on the building of reasonably priced homes with strong basic home designs. Like Lennar, Rausch Coleman offers few optional changes in proven markets and has an overall commitment to delivering high-quality homes within budget and on schedule.\nWe expect that the acquisition will add approximately 100 communities, 4,000 deliveries and 4,000 new orders in 2025, assuming that this acquisition closes by the end of the first quarter. after the 2025 activity, there will be more than 37,000 homesites controlled through Millrose for Lennar's operations in 2026 and beyond. The 2025 activity is concentrated 30% in markets where Lennar has existing operations and 70% in new markets where Lennar will take advantage of Rausch Coleman's exceptional reputation and well-run operations as we integrate into one Lennar. We are very excited about the Rausch Coleman addition to the Lennar footprint.\nSo we've covered a lot. And in conclusion, let me say that while this has been a difficult quarter and year-end for Lennar, while the short-term road ahead might look a little choppy, we are very optimistic about the longer-term road ahead. In spite of bumps in the road, this is an exciting time for Lennar. At Lennar, we are upgrading the financial and operating platform as we drive production and sales. We have continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persist across our markets.\nWith that said, as interest rates normalize, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated and margin will recover, and we are well prepared with a strong and growing national footprint growing community count and growing volume. Perhaps most importantly, our strong balance sheet and even stronger land banking relations afford us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful growth for our future. In that regard, we will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to use our land partnerships to grow with the focus on high returns on capital and equity. We will also continue to focus on our pure-play business model and reduce exposure to noncore assets. We will continue to drive just-in-time home site delivery and an asset-light balance sheet.\nAnd as we complete our asset-light transformation, we will continue to generate strong cash flow and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and stock buyback while we also pursue strategic growth. For now, we are guiding to 17,000 to 17,500 closings in the first quarter of '25 with a margin of 19% to 19.25%. We -- and we expect to deliver approximately 86,000 to 88,000 home in 2025. We also expect to continue to repurchase stock in 2025, and we will determine the amount as we watch the evolution of our Millrose spin and our land light operating model perform. We look forward to 2025. And for that, I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus, effort and talent.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, our operational teams at Lennar continue to focus on executing our operating strategy to become consistent high-volume homebuilding manufacturer using margin as a shock absorber. I will discuss our fourth quarter performance on sales pace, cost reduction cycle time reduction and asset light land position. Our focus begins with knowing the sales pace needed to match our production pace, while our production both start pace and cycles time performed as expected, as Stuart noted expected affordability to ease, and we priced accordingly. However, mortgage rates declined instead of lowering and this pricing led to our [indiscernible] the designed sales pace for the first part of the quarter.\nAs we saw that mortgage rates remained higher and the consumer needed more help with affordability, we adjusted our pricing to meet the market where it was. As we made these adjustments, we then continuously measured results against the desired pace. And if we were still not achieving pays, we adjusted further. These incentives primarily were in the form of mortgage rate buydowns and for some buyers, we use closing cost or price reductions to address their specific needs. In addition to adjusting pricing, our divisions engaged daily with Lennar machine to evaluate if we have the volume of leads and appointments needed and if not we adjusted the digital marketing plan.\nThe sales shortfall led to our overall fourth quarter sales pace of 4.2 homes per community per month being lower than our start pace of 4.6. While sales were slower for the first part of the quarter, we adjusted, as I noted, resulting in our November pace of 4.6 sales per community per month that enabled us to end the quarter with an average of about 2 unsold completed homes per community. To be clear, it wasn't that the market improved in November, it was our adjusting incentives to where the market was at improved pace.\nContrasted with a more challenging sales environment, our construction cost and cycle time continue to benefit throughout the fourth quarter from our focus on even flow production along with our high volume. This focus on a manufacturing approach, along with the maximized efficiencies of our core product strategy will allow us to continue to improve cost and cycle time into 2025. The fourth quarter, our construction costs were were consistent with Q3 and decreased on a year-over-year basis by 2%. Accomplishing a 2% cost reduction during an inflationary environment consisting of higher labor and material cost inputs for the supply chain over the past year demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and affirms the benefits of our builder of choice approach. This manufacturing strategy also resulted in continued reduction in cycle time.\nOur fourth quarter cycle time decreased on average by 2 days sequentially from Q3, down to 138 calendar days on average for single-family detached homes. This is a 23-day or 14% decrease year-over-year and a material contributor to our inventory turn improvement. I also want to comment on the potential as each has the potential of affecting cost and cycle time. With respect to tariffs, we made a major shift starting 8 years ago to move away from Chinese and other Asian manufacturing to where today, the majority of what we purchase from our supply chain is from U.S.-based manufacturers. There remains some parts made in China, primarily electronic components used in the manufacturing of products that are assembled here. These components become subject to tariffs, we estimate the potential cost impact to be in the range of $5,000 to $7,000 per [indiscernible]. With respect to lumber, we've already shifted to more usage of domestically grown timber.\nOn the issue of immigration, the potential impact of [indiscernible] immigration policies is much more difficult to assess. First, we do not know what policies will be implemented. Additionally, there is no reliable information on what percentage of the workforce for local labor trades or for our manufacturers may be subject to new regulation and enforcement. What we do know, just likely the supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, is that we will be able to work with our local trades and national manufacturers to find the most effective solutions to minimize the impact from disruptions, we believe we'll be able to do the same again.\nIn the fourth quarter to effectively work with our strategic land developers -- sorry, in the fourth quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land developers and land bank partners to purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time finished homesites to our homebuilding machine. Diane will give the detail on how our land bank purchases in the quarter break out, but most of the purchases are just-in-time takedowns to match our start pace on a community-by-community basis.\nDuring the quarter, land banks acquired on our behalf of about 17,000 home sites for about $1.5 billion in land acquisition and a commitment of about $640 million in land development. With the focus on being asset-light, our supply of owned homesites decreased to 1.1 years, down from 1.4 years and controlled homesites percentage increased to 82% from 76% year-over-year. These improvements in the execution of our operating strategies enabled reduced cycle time and less land owned, resulting in improved inventory turn, which now stands at 1.6% versus 1.5% last year, a 7% increase.\nFourth quarter was a challenged operating environment as mortgage rates moved higher, and home buyers needed more help to achieve a monthly payment they can afford. We will continue with our strategy of pricing to market as we navigate whichever direction of the rates move in 2025. We will lean into the [indiscernible] sales machine and stay focused on even flow high-volume manufacturing production, and with Millrose in place, execute even better on our asset-light land strategy. I also want to acknowledge and thank our extraordinary associates for their hard work, focus and execution.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our operating performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes summarizing the balance sheet highlights and then provide estimates for the first quarter. So turning to the balance sheet.\nOnce again, as you've heard, we adhere to our volume-based strategy of maximizing returns by turning inventory at the appropriate market margin. The result of these actions was that we drove cash flow and ended the year with $4.7 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.9 billion revolving credit facility. This provided total liquidity of approximately $7.6 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investments, we once again continue to migrate towards our goal of becoming land light. At year-end, our years owned was 1.1 years, and our homesites controlled was 82%. And our lowest years owned and highest control percentage in our history.\nWe ended the year owning 85,000 home sites and controlling 394,000 homesites for a total of 479,000 on sites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. We spent $2.1 billion on land purchases this quarter. However, almost 80% were finished home sites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis.\nOf the homes closed during the quarter, approximately 66% were from third-party land structures where we purchased the home site on a finished basis. And finally, our inventory turn was 1.6x, up from 1.5x last year, and our return on inventory was 29.2%. As we move forward with the Millrose spin-off and thus, continue to reduce our ownership of land and purchase homesites on a just-in-time basis. Our earnings should more consistently approximate cash flow and over time, it would be our goal to align capital return to shareholders more closely with this cash flow. During the quarter, and consistent with our production focus, we started about 18,400 homes and ended the quarter with 35,600 homes in inventory. This inventory number includes approximately 2,900 homes that were completed, unsold which is about 2 homes per community and within our historical range.\nAnd then turning to our debt position, we had no redemptions or repurchases of senior notes this quarter. However, for the 2024 year, we repaid $554 million of notes. And since 2018, we have repaid or repurchased over $7 billion of notes with an interest rate savings of almost $400 million. These actions for our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio down to 7.5% at year-end, our lowest ever. and our next debt maturity is not until May of 2025. Consistent with our commitment to increase shareholder returns, as Stuart noted, we repurchased $3 million of our outstanding shares for $521 million. This brought the total for the year to 13.6 million shares totaling $2.1 billion. Additionally, we paid total cash dividends this quarter of $135 million and a total of approximately $550 million for the year.\nSo in the aggregate for fiscal 2024 we returned about $3.3 billion of equity and debt holders. Our stockholders' equity increased to almost $28 billion, and our book value per share increased to $104. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence in financial flexibility as we move into 2025. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q1 and provide some guidance estimates. Note that these estimates do not include the impact of the acquisition of Rausch Coleman or Millrose spin-off. So starting with new orders. We expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 17,500 to 18,000 homes as we match sales pace with production. We anticipate our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 17,000 to 17,500 homes with a continued focus on turning inventory into cash.\nOur Q1 average sales price on those deliveries should be about $410,000 to $415,000 as we continue to price to market to meet affordability. We expect our gross margins to be between 19% and 19.25%. So as Stuart has alluded to, to provide additional context, the gross margin in our backlog expected to close in the first quarter is about 20%. What we do not have visibility into at this point is the gross margin on homes we expect to both sell and close in the first quarter, which we anticipate will be roughly 50% of the closing. As we sit here in mid-December with the limited visibility we are going to have into the spring selling season, we anticipate these closings will have a lower gross margin than our backlog. However, if market conditions improve, we will benefit from this upside. Additionally, recall that our Q1 margins are always negatively impacted by the current period expensing of field costs since revenues in Q1 are the lowest of the year. Additionally, as historically is the case, the first quarter will be the low point for margins during 2025.\nOur SG&A percentage should be in the range of 8.7% to 8.8% as we anticipate increased costs to maintain sales activity. For the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to be about breakeven. We anticipate our financial services earnings to be approximately $100 million to $110 million. For our multifamily business, we expect a loss of about $10 million.\nTurning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of about $20 million However, remember that this excludes the impact of any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments. Our Q1 corporate G&A should be about 2.6% of total revenues, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 266 million shares. So on a consolidated basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $1.60 to $1.80 per share for the quarter. And since -- as we turn to 2025, as we noted, since market conditions are uncertain, we are only providing delivery guidance, we're targeting to deliver between 86,000 and 88,000 homes for the full year of 2025, including the Rausch Coleman acquisition.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross is here, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services, and we are a few others as well.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company, after my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction cost, cycle time and some other operating overviews. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlights, along with some limited guidance for our third quarter and full year 2024. And then, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period. And as usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as possible.\nBut before I begin, however, I would like to express, on behalf of all of the associates of Lennar the sadness we all feel for the recent loss of another pioneer of our industry [ Don Gorton ]. While we homebuilders compete sometimes aggressively in the field and across geographies, it is always with humble admiration and respect for our competitors. We learned from each other, we have reference for all of their accomplishments. We learned from their successes and sometimes their failures and we are pushed to be our very best by their comparative accomplishments. This business is not easy and those who succeed over years are to be admired.\nDon was a tremendous success among homebuilders and hit success spanned decades. He climbed from humble beginnings to the greatest types within our industry. To the associates of [ D.R. Horton ] as well as to [ Don Horton's ] family, we express our most sincere condolences and we look forward to continuing to live to learn, to admire MDS, to compete with the D.R. Horton name as you carry on Don's tremendous legacy.\nWith that said, let me begin my remarks today. We're very pleased to report another consistent and solid quarter of operating results for Lennar. We have continued to execute our operating plan effectively throughout the first half of 2024, as we have driven production pace and sales pace in [ Sing ]. While we have used our margin as a point of adjustment to enable consistent production even as market conditions have changed. This program has driven excellent operating results to date and we have simply never been better positioned as a company from balance sheet to operating strategy to execution to be able to adjust to a changing market as it unfolds for the remainder of 2024 and beyond.\nIn the second quarter, we started approximately 21,400 homes. We sold approximately 21,300 homes and we delivered approximately 19,700 homes, keeping us on target to deliver approximately 80,000 homes for the year. Next quarter, we expect to start, sell and deliver similar consistency as we continue to drive a continuously improving even flow manufacturing model that we believe will continue to enhance our cash flow, our bottom line as well as our predictability. We've continued to target a consistent production and growth rate in order to maintain volume, minimize production costs, maintain even flow production and sales, all in order to drive cash flow, effective capital allocation and higher returns.\nOur primary goal is to migrate to a pure-play, asset-light manufacturing model that will be supported by a durable just-in-time home site delivery program that will enable simultaneous growth and cash flow. We believe that a cash flow enabled capital allocation strategy will drive higher shareholder returns, higher returns on assets and ultimately higher returns on equity. As we migrate to our desired end state, margin is the springing mechanism that enables this all to happen.\nThis quarter, our margin was somewhat higher than expected at 22.6% up from 21.8% last quarter. Next quarter, we expect our margin to be approximately 23% depending on market conditions. And for the full year, we remain focused on driving margin to be approximately the same as last year's full year margin of 23.3%. While we understand that we will require that, that will require a substantially higher fourth quarter margin. That accomplishment is partially embedded in our backlog, while as I have said before, the rest of that story will depend on market conditions, interest rates and consumer confidence as we go through the remainder of the year, we will see.\nWhile we have been refining our operating platform, we've continued to drive strong cash flow and have allocated over $600 million to repurchase approximately 3.8 million shares of stock. And additionally, to repay over $550 million of senior debt as we continue to improve our balance sheet with a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of just 7.7%. Though while we continue to hold a sizable $3.6 billion of cash on our book, we are crafting our strategy for strategic capital allocation in pursuit of our structural objectives which I will discuss further in just a few minutes. But let me briefly address the economic environment.\nOverall, the macroeconomic environment remains relatively constructive for homebuilders. There are challenges and there are opportunities. The demand for housing remains strong, limited by affordability, interest rates and sometimes wavering consumer confidence. Additionally, the chronic housing shortage driven by over a decade of underproduction of housing stock is additionally problematic for families seeking affordable or attainable supply. Demand remains robust if it can be supplied an attainable price point, with interest rate support that enables the consumer to transact.\nThrough our second quarter, interest rates started lower and felt constructive at approximately [ 6.25% ] as the market was adjusting to a new name. Then for the quarter, rates began a gradual climb to 7.3% before dropping again as the quarter ended. Concurrently, consumers remained employed they are confident that they will remain employed and they believe that their compensation will rise as well. This is most often the foundation of a very strong housing market but the chronic supply shortage, the impact of interest rates on affordability as well as persistent and stubborn inflation have moderated housing market strength.\nIn response, new homebuilders have worked out incentive structures that range from interest rate buy downs to closing cost pickups to price reductions designed to meet the purchaser at their intersection of needs and affordability. Those incentives have increased and decreased as interest rates have moved up and down. Homebuilders, particularly those with strong balance sheets and ready access to capital have been able to adjust, capture demand and drive efficiencies by using incentives to reduce the affordability constraints and enable purchases to transact.\nAgainst this backdrop, in our second quarter, we have continued to execute our core operating strategy. That strategy has been to refine a manufacturing production model that is pure-play homebuilding and land light asset light and simply put, that is what we are refining. As I noted last quarter, we have begun -- we have been refining our manufacturing model. We have also been actively migrating to a pure-play and land-light operating structure across our homebuilding platform and each of our 4 homebuilding divisions. We'll start with manufacturing. We've continued to refine our manufacturing platform that has maintained production and shelf space while we continue to engineer our homes for efficiency and volume, driving volume enables us to offer more attainable products. We add needed supply to the market, we meet the needs of the consumer, and we contribute to building a balanced and, therefore, healthier housing market.\nIn doing so, we have enhanced our inventory turn and grown volume as we generate substantial cash flow. The consistency of our production and sales program across our platform, together with constructive capital allocation enable us to simultaneously enhance shareholder returns, returns on inventory and ultimately, return on equity.\nLet me turn to pure play. We are a homebuilder that builds affordable housing in strategic markets that fill the chronic supply shortage. We will continue to reduce exposure to all noncore assets. We are intensifying our focus on producing affordable and attainable products across our platform. Land is more expensive, impact fees are getting more expensive and labor and material costs have been rising as well. We can only reduce the cost of housing by increasing productivity through efficiencies of our operations. Our focus has been on doing just that. We are building more consistent products that we call our core products that are carefully value engineers, and we are using our start pace to refine and engineered production cycle enabling us to reduce cycle time and with our trade partners to build efficiencies in logistics and the way that we run our community production.\nWe are building attainable homes for primary purchasers who can afford a down payment and qualify for a mortgage. And as market conditions dictate, we have and will use incentives to enable primary purchasers to purchase and achieve home ownership. We have also continued working on additional product approaches to help build a more healthy housing market. We have intensified our focus on build-to-rent community scale and single-family for rent scattered homes across markets. We believe that we can and need to build additional production for professionally owned housing that can fill an important additional need. Those professional purchasers need cost efficiencies in today's interest rate environment in order to make their rents attainable and we can provide that. There are many families who are building their future and aspired to single-family lifestyle with backyards, schools and parks. But we can't yet afford a down payment or don't have the credit characteristics to qualify the mortgage that they need.\nInstitutional buyers fill that void for those families. Many have criticized the professionally owned market and the investor class that competes with primary homeowners to purchase product for rentals, this is quad thinking. We are also engaged in repurposing our blue-chip multifamily platform to build attainable rental product in an off-balance sheet configuration. We will build a singular product, another core product called our [ Emblem ] series. It will be built by our homebuilding divisions, but will be built with private equity capital. We have a strong history of successfully building multifamily products across the country. We have been building those products in an off-balance sheet configuration, and we expect to continue to build this vital attainable product without encumbering our balance sheet.\nConcurrently, we are repatriating capital that has been deployed in prior multifamily engagements. We are under contract to sell the assets of LMV 1 Fund 1, and LMB Fund 1. There are multiple buyers, and we are working through the closing process of each asset with those buyers. We expect the assets will close throughout the second half of 2024. Also, as we continue to stay laser-focused on our pure-play and asset-light strategy of generating cash and increasing returns, we are regularly reviewing the best strategy for other multifamily assets that are on book, and we may decide to monetize additional assets also in the second half of 2024. On a combined basis, these transactions could result in cash proceeds of approximately $250 million in the second half of the year.\nSo let me turn to just-in-time. We have been complementing our manufacturing model with a durable just-in-time finished home site delivery system. Every home that is going to be built needs a home site with a permit, and those home sites need to be option and off balance sheet until we are ready to build. We continue to focus on a just-in-time delivery program for land just like we have for lumber and appliances, and we continue to make excellent progress in this regard. While we have always executed -- executed option land deals with third-party developers. Those deals are not always available, and there are no developers in many of our markets. We only become structurally and durably land light and asset light by both negotiating option deals with landowners and developers and also creating structured land strategies with private equity capital or permanent capital.\nAccordingly, we have worked with a series of private equity partners to create a home site purchase platform where land held and developed and ultimately delivered on a rolling option basis to the manufacturer as homes are ready to be started. This platform is a backstop for purchased land to be developed and delivered just-in-time to the manufacturer without land risk to that manufacturer.\nBy consistently focusing on our land-light strategy, we have materially enhanced and generated consistent cash flow through the ups and downs of interest rate changes and we have enhanced our balance sheet and our liquidity. Our balance sheet, as I noted earlier, is situated with a 7.7% debt-to-capital ratio -- [ on though ] the debt-to-capital ratio with $3.6 billion of cash on hand and $0 drawn on our revolver. We have the flexibility to allocate capital strategically. First, of course, to grow while also retiring debt, paying appropriate dividends and repurchasing shares of Lennar stock.\nWe are aware that many have suggested that we have accumulated too much cash on our balance sheet, and our leverage is very limited, which limits the ability of our returns to move higher. While we have understood the concern, we have remained patient as we have evolved not just the migration to land like configuration, but also have remained focused on the long-term durability of the structures involved.\nPrivate equity capital can be fickle. By driving volume for these programs, we have gained advantaged insights into the refined workings of our strategic land programs. Although we have a number of constructive partners in this regard, I would like to especially thank [ Ryan Millette ] and [ Angela Gordon ] for being an incredible and selfless partner in helping to evolve these programs over the past years. He has been truly invaluable in execution and evolution and, of course, never immersion in any engagement. With Ryan's help, the underlying plumbing system for the land strategies have been refined and questions have been answered as to the durability of the relationships that make up the counterparty relationship with the homebuilding partner.\nHitting on our experience on -- building on our experience. On our last earnings call, we announced that we were rekindling our focus on a strategic spin-off of most of our remaining land in order to create a permanent capital vehicle that can option developed homesites to Lennar, recycled capital into new home sites and distribute market appropriate returns to shareholders. I am pleased to inform you that we have made substantial progress over the last 90 days, and we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the SEC a few weeks ago.\nWe are currently looking at approximately a $6 billion to $8 billion -- $6 billion to $8 billion of land that we expect to spin off into a new public company with no associated debt. The goal of the spin-off is to accelerate our land life strategy, which would allow for off-balance sheet treatment of the land assets. We are excited about the opportunity that we believe this spinoff will bring us through the innovations that we have developed for the operation of the spun-off entity. Following the spinoff, the new public company will be completely independent from Lennar. Lennar will have option purchase agreements to purchase back finished homesites on a just-in-time basis.\nOur team, led by [ Fred Rothman ] has been fully dedicated to bringing this project to life as soon as we can, but we are still early in the process and there is no specific time line to completion or guarantee that the transaction will be completed. Because of the ongoing review by the SEC, we cannot comment further on the spin-off but we look forward to providing you with an update on progress and timing in the future.\nAfter the spin-off, the new company would be another bucket of capital, in other words, additive, consistent and compatible with other relationships that have existed and will continue to thrive alongside Lennar. Such a transaction would distribute capital to shareholders it would reduce inventory on Lennar's books, and it would provide permanent dependable capital for future land options. Our balance sheet would remain very strong with consistent earnings and cash flow to continue to pay down debt and to repurchase stock.\nSo let me conclude and say, at Lennar, we are continuing to modernize and upgrade the Lennar operating platform as we drive consistent production and sales. It has been a busy and productive quarter, and we have continued to execute in the short term while we build our platform for continued and future success. Our second quarter of 2024 has been another strategic and operational success for our company. While market conditions have remained challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market -- to address market needs. We know the demand is strong, and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across our markets.\nWith that said, as interest rates inside and normalize, and if the Fed is actually going to begin to cut rates, we believe the pent-up demand will be activated, and we will be well prepared. If not, we will continue to produce volume and add to market supply. For that, we are well prepared. Even though higher rates have remained sticky, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Given the consistent execution, we are extremely well positioned for even greater success as strong demand for affordable offerings continues to see short supply.\nPerhaps most importantly, our extraordinarily strong balance sheet affords us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful innovation for our future. We will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to execute. We will focus on our pure-play business model and reduce exposure to noncore assets. We will continue to drive to just-in-time home site delivery and an asset-light balance sheet. And we will continue to allocate capital to growth, debt retirement and stock repurchases as appropriate. We have the luxury to execute flawlessly in the short term, while we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and stock buyback, while we also, and I emphasize also pursue strategic distribution to shareholders that fortifies our future. We have clearly earned an enviable position.\nAs I look forward to a successful 2024, we are well positioned and expect to see much more of the same. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, perform and drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance. We are guiding to 20,500 to 21,000 closings next quarter with approximately a 23% margin. And we do expect to deliver approximately 80,000 homes this year with a little over a 23% margin. We also expect to repurchase in excess of $2 billion of stock in 2024 as we continue to drive very strong cash flow. We look forward to a very strong year.\nAnd for that, I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus, effort and talent. And with that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nGood morning. As you heard from Stuart, our operational teams at Lennar continue to refine and improve on the execution of our core operating strategies. Each quarter, our divisions further refine elements of these strategies and how they can more effectively work in concert. We are laser-focused on creating an even flow production first homebuilder designed to deliver maximum results.\nAs part of this process, Stuart, myself and our regional presence travel to our divisions, meeting with our management teams after the close of each quarter to review each of the elements of our operating strategy. In fact, we're in the middle of these reviews right now. Taking today off of course, to address our earnings but back added tomorrow. In these meetings, we learned together what is working and what needs improvement. With the end go in line of even flow production, we have built a strong sense of confidence from the liability and results driven by selling the right homes at the right pace.\nEvery day, our divisions learn from their engagement with the Lennar machine, constantly adjusting and trying new tactics. The machine produces information in the form of dashboards for analysis and decision-making. There is a continuous feedback loop as needs move from the top of the funnel through the funnel and ultimately to a sale. This review enables lower customer acquisition costs while also improving the customer experience. Again, this quarter, our operating results produced starts that were evenly matched with sales and are projected to be evenly matched again in the third quarter. We will continue to refine this process of matching sales and production pace, delivering even more dependable and predictable production, which provides maximum benefit to our supply chain and our trade partners.\nLast quarter, I described to you how our divisions hold machine Monday meetings to optimize the selling of the right homes at the right price based on the prior week's activities. Our operating teams review dashboards comparing actual results to the planned activity and make adjustments in real time to marketing plans for the upcoming week. Currently, these meetings are focused on how to cost effectively to have higher quality leads, what we refer to as less hay and more needles. In turn, this reduces the overall number of leads we interact with, delivering more higher-quality leads to our team. These improvements will result in a better customer experience, higher conversion rates and lower customer acquisition costs.\nIn our second quarter, as interest rates [ fluctuate ] around 7%, this process informed us after where we have prior [indiscernible] or where we need to buy out of interest rates and/or other incentives to achieve the desired pace. Delivery pace resulted -- or achievement pace resulted in ending the quarter with an average of less than 1 unsold completed home per community and enabled our growth of 19% in sales and 15% deliveries year-over-year. Our sales pace of 5.7 homes per community in Q2 is up from the pace of 4.8 last year. This increase was by design to match the start pace of 5.8 homes per community in Q2. The [ mat ] sales pace to production pace means the sales pace we achieved varied across our markets. We're able to flex sale pace faster or slower as needed in order to match production on a community-by-community basis.\nNext, I'll discuss cycle time and construction costs. As I mentioned, by continuously improving the way we execute this game plan of predictable and reliable production, we deepen the partnerships with our trade partners. We focus on maintaining both a high volume and importantly, a consistent volume of homes under construction that allows our trade partners to use their input costs despite the inflationary macro environment. This strategy, along with guiding engineering and [ skiasialization ] produces many efficiencies benefiting our trade partners. By consistently starting homes, Lennar's interest rates rose during the quarter, we increased our stock by 9% from the prior year and [ 7% ] sequentially from Q1.\nFor the second quarter, [ vacating ] decreased by 4 days sequentially from Q1 down to 150 days on average to single-family homes, a 30% decrease year-over-year. We expect to see cycle continue to improve as we become increasingly more efficient. Looking at the second quarter, as expected, our construction costs also decreased sequentially from Q1 by about 1% and on a year-over-year basis by about 9%. Moving forward to drive further efficiencies and cost reductions we are making significant progress on utilizing highly valued engineered home plans, which, as Stuart mentioned, we call our core product strategy.\nWe saw our first start of these homes in Texas late in the second quarter, and we'll see expanded start throughout Texas and Florida in the third quarter with first deliveries in our fourth quarter. The initial success of these core plans is seen as we engage with our trade partners and believe this will improve upon our position as a builder of choice. To reduce cost and time to build these core plans will help us achieve the goal of delivering more containable housing to make the needs of the home buying consumer.\nNext, I'll discuss our landline strategy. In the second quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners who made purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time home site to our homebuilding machine. In the second quarter, about 9% of our $1.7 billion or approximately 16,000 home sites acquired in the quarter were finished homesites purchased from these various land structures. This drove further progress in the quarter of our supply of owned homesites has improved to 1.2 years down from 1.7 years and control home site percentage increased to 79% from 70% year-over-year.\nThese improvements in the execution of our operating strategies, resulting in reduced cycle time and less [ WAN 1 ] has increased our cash flow as well as improved our inventory turn, which now stands at 1.6 versus 1.3 last year a 22% increase.\nThe second quarter demonstrated the ongoing progress and the execution of each of the strategies Stuart now reviewed. We started with a focus on Lennar marketing and sales machine then to our production and on to land strategies. We focus on improving and connecting these strategies together, driving even more consistency and improvement. Defining these strategies means that change is constant and the focus and hard work to execute is consistent. Yes, change can be challenging but our associates are leaning into each of these strategies embracing the challenges and are executing at even higher levels. I also want to thank our associates for their commitment to this effort.\nAnd now I'd like to turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our home building performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations, summarize our balance sheet highlights and then provide us in for Q3.\nSo starting with financial services. For the second quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of $146 million. The strong earnings were primarily driven by an increase in homebuilding volume and a higher capture rate. Additionally, there is a constant drumbeat to embrace technology to continue to find ways to run a more efficient business. Our financial services team is intensely dedicated to providing a great customer experience for each homebuyer and have created true partnerships with our homebuilding teams to best accomplish that goal. That partnership was clearly reflected in their solid results.\nSo now turning to our balance sheet. First quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market with the goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The results of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.2 billion revolving credit facility, which provided total liquidity of $5.8 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investments, we once again made significant progress on our goal of becoming land life.\nAt quarter end, as Jon indicated, our years on improved to 1.2 years from 1.7 years in the prior year, and our homesites controls increased to 79% from 70% in the prior year. Our lowest use owned and highest controlled percentage in our history. At quarter end, we owned 91,000 homesites and control 340,000 homesites for a total of 431,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to gain market share in a capital-efficient way. We spent $1.7 billion on land purchases this quarter.\nHowever, about 90% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis, which is less capital intensive. Plus the homes closed during the quarter, about 60% were from our third-party land structures will repurchase the home strike on a finished basis. As we continue to reduce our ownership of land and purchase homesites on a just-in-time basis, our earnings should more consistently approximate cash flow. And over time, it would be our goal to align capital return to shareholders more closely with that cash flow.\nAnd finally, our inventory turn was 1.6x, up from 1.7x last year, and our return on inventory was 31.4%, up 110 basis points from last year. During the quarter, and consistent with our production focus, we started about 21,400 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 40,000 homes in inventory, excluding models. This inventory number included about 1,100 homes that were completed unsold, which is less than 1 home per community as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. And looking at our debt maturity profile, we repaid $454 million of our 4.5% senior notes due April 2024, and we repurchased in the open market $100 million of senior notes due November 2027 at an average price of 98.6. Our next debt maturity is not until May of 2025.\nWe continue to benefit from our previous paydowns of senior notes and strong earnings generation, which brought our homebuilding debt total cap down to 7.7% at quarter end, our lowest ever a remarkable improvement from 13.3% in the prior year. Consistent with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns, we repurchased $3.8 million of our outstanding shares for [ $603 ] million, Additionally, we paid total dividends this quarter of $139 million. And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to almost $27 billion, and our book value per share increased to 97.88.\nIn summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through 2024 and beyond.\nAnd so with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q3 and provide some guidance estimates. We expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 20,500 to 21,000 homes as we continue to sell homes in line with our production pitch. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to also be in the range of 20,500 to 21,000 homes with a manufacturing focus of efficiently turning inventory into cash. Our Q3 average sales price on those deliveries should be in the range of 420,000 to $425,000. And we expect gross margins to be about 23%, and our SG&A to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5%, with both estimates having some plus or minus depending on market conditions.\nFor the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $20 million. We anticipate our financial service earnings -- financial services earnings for Q3 to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million based on expected product mix in our mortgage operations. We expect a loss of about $20 million for our multifamily business and this estimate does not include the impact of the multifamily transactions that Stuart outlined in his narrative since the specific timing is still uncertain.\nAnd then turning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of about $25 million for this category. This estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. Our Q3 corporate G&A should be about 1.8% of total revenues and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.25% and the weighted average ship count should be about 271 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.50 to $3.65 per share for the quarter.\nFor the full year, as we mentioned, we remain focused on delivering 80,000 homes which would be a 10% growth year-over-year, with the gross margin that is consistent with last year's gross margin. We also remain confident with our cash flow generation. As such, we are still targeting a total capital allocation of at least $2.5 billion for 2024, $1.7 billion has already been utilized to repurchase shares and reduce our debt levels through Q2, and so the balance will be applied to additional share repurchases in the second half of the year.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President, Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services and a few others are here with us as well.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, John is going to give an operational overview, updating construction cost, cycle time and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight along with some limited guidance for the second quarter and full year '24.\nAnd then, of course, we'll have our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] So let's go ahead and begin. We're very pleased to report another very solid and consistent quarter of operating results for Lennar. We've continued to execute our operating plan effectively into the first quarter driving excellent operating results, and we've never been better positioned from balance sheet to execution to operating strategy to address market conditions as they unfold for the remainder of '24 and beyond.\nIn the first quarter, we started 18,338 homes, we sold 18,176 homes, and we delivered 16,798 homes. While we expect deliveries for the year to be approximately 10% higher than last year at 80,000 homes. Next quarter, we expect to start approximately 21,000 homes, sell approximately 21,000 homes and deliver between 19,000 to 19,500 homes. Admittedly, we aren't quite there yet, but we are getting closer and closer to an even flow manufacturing model that we believe will continue to enhance our cash flow, our bottom line as well as our predictability.\nLast year, we grew at a 10% pace in a very difficult year, and we believe we'll grow at a 10% pace again this year in a complicated economic complicated economic conditions. And it is being done by a carefully designed program to maintain volume, maximize efficiencies and cost reductions around production, maintaining even flow of production and sales and rebuild our asset base and balance sheet in order to drive cash flow, effective capital allocation and higher returns.\nThat is total shareholder returns, returns on assets and returns on equity. I know I didn't mention margin yet. That's because, as I've said before, margin is the springing mechanism that enables all of this to happen. This quarter, our margin was 21.8%, somewhat higher than expected.\nAnd next quarter, we expect our margin to be approximately 22.5%, depending on market conditions. And for the full year, we expect margin to be approximately the same as last year's full year margin of 23.3%, but that, of course, will depend on market conditions as well, we will see. Additionally, we've continued to drive strong cash flow and allocate over $500 million to repurchase 3.4 million shares of stock and improve our balance sheet with a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of under 10%.\nWhile we know we have accumulated a sizable $5 billion of cash on our book, we are crafting our strategy for appropriate capital allocation. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains relatively strong for the new homebuilders. The general theme remains primarily focused around very strong demand for housing, limited by the chronic housing shortage that is particularly problematic for working class families, and their ability to find affordable or attainable supply.\nDemand for that product remains robust if it can be built at an attainable price point. The economic environment driving demand has been relatively favorable, supported by low unemployment and fairly strong consumer confidence. Generally speaking, consumers remain employed. They are confident that they will remain employed and they believe that their compensation is likely to rise. This is most often the foundation of a very strong housing market.\nAlong with the supply shortage, the additional limiting factor continues to center around affordability driven by the impact of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. With higher interest rates, affordability continues to be tested as higher monthly payments make qualifying for a loan increasingly difficult.\nAt the same time, inflationary pressures have driven traditional cost of living expenses higher over the past 2 years, which has made savings for a down payment increasingly difficult. Higher prices have also started to lead to increased personal and credit card debt as families stretch to pay their bills. We've started to see early evidence of debt delinquencies showing up and derailing some mortgage applications.\nWhile interest rates have continued to move higher and lower, as the Fed continues to see economic data indicating that inflation has been controlled, the consumer has been navigating an affordability [indiscernible] . The new homebuilders have worked out a variety of incentive structures that range from interest rate buy downs to closing cost pickups to price reductions, all designed to meet the purchaser at the intersection of need and affordability.\nThose incentives have increased and decreased as interest rates have moved up and down homebuilders have been uniquely able to capture demand by using these incentives to unlock the affordability constraints and enable purchasers to transact. Against this backdrop, our first quarter -- in our first quarter, we've been focused on and consistent in executing our core operating strategy.\nWe continue to migrate to a pure-play manufacturing model across our homebuilding platform and each of our 4 homebuilding divisions in order to reduce production costs while we generate consistent cash flow. Additionally, we are reengineering our products for efficiency and volume in order to enhance our inventory turn and grow volume to contribute to build a balanced and therefore, healthier overall housing market.\nWe have also continued to migrate to a land-light balance sheet while we grow our business and expand market share in order to drive total shareholder return, return on inventory and return on equity. We are, so to speak, continuing to modernize and upgrade the Lennar airplane while we are flying the plane and putting execution and safety first as we fly. It has been a busy and productive quarter for Lennar and we've continued to execute in the short term while we continue to build our platform for continued and future success.\nSo let me break some of this down. On the operational side, we are running under a design operational model, where we are starting homes at a pace designed to increase market share while we maximize logistics and efficiencies in order to benefit from reduced construction costs.\nOur trade partners are giving visibility on starts and timing expectations so that they can be more efficient and help past efficiency savings on to our customers through more affordable product. By driving volume, we gained market share in most of our core markets, as we lean in when others pull back.\nOur trade partners see a consistent and dependable partner that is worthy of the designation of builder of choice. We work side by side with our trade partners, while we attract additional trade partner relationships. Participants find that they have dependable and consistent work with our production strategy which leads to higher productivity and, therefore, cost savings.\nThrough market share growth in local markets, we enhanced the ability to better manage our costs enhance our efficiency of operations, reduce cycle times with efficient production templates and enhance our inventory turn. John will discuss this in more detail in just a few minutes. Driving our confidence to start homes at pace in order to achieve maximum efficiency in the field is the Lennar machine.\nThe machine is a combined program of digital marketing, sales consultant engagement and dynamic pricing. We've described the machine in prior calls, and many of you have now come to our office to see it in action. The machine has completely changed the manner in which we sell homes and enables us to drive maximum efficient production.\nIf we build a home, we sell that home. We sell by digitally acquiring leads through our digital marketing programs, then we filter those leads. So the best leads go directly to our sales professionals. They nurture those best leads or customers, while our dynamic pricing model assists in dynamically tailoring pricing in real time to meet the market, given consumer desires market conditions and competitive factors.\nThe dynamically adjusted pricing using incentives or price alterations automatically adjust our margin up or down while we maintain production and sales base. We set the production to efficiency. We match sales pace to production, and we deliver the homes we build while we carefully maintain controlled inventory levels, all while reducing production costs and driving consistent cash flow.\nI know it all sounds easy, but it's not. But this has been a core pillar of the programming that we've been reworking over the past years, and it's really starting to kick in and work quite well. Next to our laser focus on volume with production and sales being an even better alignment, we are intensifying our focus on producing affordable and attainable product across our platform.\nWe've recognized that the chronic housing shortage is a critical issue, and it's more than just a great talking point. The reality is that our industry needs to find solutions to building a healthier housing market that is attainable to participants across the economic landscape. Working-class housing is essential to the effective working of our cities across the country, and we hear that from mayors and governors everywhere.\nSo we've been working on using our strategies for production and cost efficiencies to help build a healthier housing market that is accessible to everyone. Of course, it all starts with lower production costs across our platform. Land, we know is getting more expensive. Impact fees also are getting more expensive and labor costs have been rising as well.\nWe can only reduce our input costs by increasing productivity to efficiencies of our operations. Our focus has been on doing just that. We're building more consistent products that we call our core products that are carefully value engineered, and we are using our start pace to enable an engineered production cycle as well enabling us to reduce cycle time and to work with our trade partners to build efficiencies in logistics and the way that we run our community production.\nWe've also continued working on additional product approaches to help build a healthier housing market. We've intensified our focus on build to rent that is community scale and single-family prevent scattered home sale markets. We believe that we can and need to build additional production for professionally owned housing that can fill an important need.\nThose professional purchasers need cost efficiencies in today's interest rate environment in order to make their rents attainable and we can provide that. There are families who are building their future and aspire to single-family lifestyle with backyards and schools and parks but who can't yet afford a down payment or don't have the credit characteristics to qualify the mortgage that they need.\nInstitutional buyers are filling that for those families. Many across the industry have criticized the professionally owned market and the investor class that competes with primary homeowners to purchase product for rentals. This is flog thinking. Those investors are actually filling a critical need for the underserved families who seek to bridge the lifestyle for their family while they build the down payment and credit score to ultimately achieve homeownership.\nThis is the critical equitable side of home production, and the institutional buyers are not competitors to the primary buyers, they are additive to the valuable housing stock, enabling those who don't have a family that can help them achieve the lifestyle they want while they build their capital capacity.\nWe are working across our platform with our institutional partners to produce more structured programs to provide more housing for those who need professional ownership as a stepping stone for the ultimate home of their own. We are also engaging our blue-chip multifamily platform to build a tenable rental product in an off-balance sheet configuration.\nWe have a strong history of successfully building multifamily product across the country. We have been building those products in an off-balance sheet configuration, and we expect to continue to build this vital attainable product without encumbering our balance sheet. Finally, we have built and continued to refine our land strategy by design as well in order to dovetail with our production orientation. Every home that is going to be built needs a home site with a permit, and those home sites need to be options and off balance sheet until we're ready to build.\nWe continue to focus on a just-in-time delivery program for land just like we have for lumber and appliances and other products, and we continue to make excellent progress in this regard. We accomplished this by both negotiating option deals with landowners and developers. And we also -- and also creating structured land bank strategies often with private equity capital.\nBy consistently focusing on our land-light strategy, we've materially enhanced and generated consistent cash flow through the ups and downs of interest rate changes and we've enhanced our balance sheet and our liquidity even after redeeming debt and purchasing stock over the past years, along with purchasing $500 million of shares of stock through this quarter.\nOur balance sheet is situated today with a 9.6% homebuilding debt to total cap ratio with $5 billion of cash on hand and $0 drawn on our revolver and with an expected $3.5 billion plus or minus of net cash flow over this next year. Accordingly, we have the flexibility to allocate capital strategically first of course to grow while also retiring debt, paying appropriate dividends and repurchasing shares of Lennar stock.\nAccordingly, this quarter, we raised our dividend to $2 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion of stock repurchases as we continue to drive total shareholder returns. Even with these capital allocations, many have suggested that given the tremendous success of our migration to our Land Light program, we have accumulated too much cash on our balance sheet, which limits the ability of our returns to move higher.\nWhile we have understood the concern, we have remained patient as we have evolved not just the migration to the land like configuration, but also have remained focused on the long-term durability of the land bank structures involved. Private equity capital can be fickle. By driving volume through these programs, we have gained advantaged insights into and refined the workings of our strategic land banks.\nThe underlying plumbing systems for the land banks has been refined and questions have now been answered as to the durability of the capital partners that make up the counterparty relationships with their homebuilding partner, namely us. Our consistent volume helped to find both trust and dependability and has taken those relationships to another level as we either party flinch as market conditions tested the boundaries of relationships.\nWhile adjustments were made and lessons were learned, the structures and relationships became stronger and more durable. Accordingly, we have now rekindled our focus on a strategic spin-off that can be cleanly focused on fortifying durable land strategy. By spinning our own land, excess land in a taxable spin, we believe that we can create an additional though with permanent capital vehicle that can option develop home sites to Lennar and recycle capital into new home site while distributing market appropriate returns to shareholders.\nWe have stood up a strong and vehicle that is under consideration, currently, with about $4 billion of land, it could be more, could be less, and it is under development and consideration right now. Such a transaction would distribute capital to shareholders, it would reduce inventory on Lennar's books, and it would provide permanent dependable capital for future land options.\nOur balance sheet would remain very strong with consistent earnings and cash flow to contribute to pay down debt and continue to repurchase stock. We know we've had a fall start on a prior spin concept and there's no promise of certainty or completion on this program.\nBut on the positive side, our Chief Operating Officer, Fred Rothman is singularly focused on this initiative and Fred likes to get things done. We'll keep you apprised of progress but progress should happen relatively quickly as this transaction is far simpler in structure.\nWith that said, let me conclude by saying that our first quarter of 2024 has been another strategic and operational success for our company. While market conditions have remained challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong, and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meeting the housing shortage that we know persists across market.\nWith that said, as interest rates subside and normalize and if the Fed is going to begin to actually cut rates, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated, and we will be well positioned and well prepared. If not, we will continue to produce volume and increase market share.\nTo date, we have seen overall market conditions remain generally constructive for the industry. Even though higher interest rates have remained sticky, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well positioned for even greater successes as strong demand for affordable offering continues to see short supply.\nPerhaps most importantly, our extraordinarily strong balance sheet affords us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful innovation for our future. We have the luxury to continue to execute flawlessly in the short term, while we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and stock buyback, while we also, and I emphasize the word also pursue strategic distribution to shareholders that fortifies our future as well.\nWe have clearly earned an enviable position. As we look ahead to a successful 2024, we are well positioned for and expect to see much more of the same. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, to perform and to drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance.\nWe are guiding to 19,000 to 19,500 closings next quarter with approximately a 22.5% margin. And we expect to deliver approximately 80,000 homes this year with a little over a 23% margin. We also expect to repurchase in excess of $2 billion of stock as we continue to drive very strong cash flow.\nWe look forward to a very strong year. And for that, I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus effort and talent. And with that, let me turn it over to John.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nGood morning. As you heard from Stuart, our operational teams at Lennar continued the execution of our core operating strategies in our first quarter. The focus starts within our marketing and sales machine. Every quarter, our divisions continuously learn from their engagement within our machine, gain knowledge in how to use this information for decision-making, provide feedback for enhancements and improve the machine and execution of our strategies.\nThis continuous loop of learnings and improvements drive provided analytics, which enable us to improve our matching of sales to our production pace. You can see this evolution -- you can see the evolution of this improvement in our operating results as sales were evenly massive starts in the first quarter and are projected to be evenly matched again in the second quarter.\nWhile there is more progress to be made, this matching of sales and production is leveling out our closings from quarter-to-quarter. The goal is even flow deliveries where by-design starts gradually increased quarter-over-quarter to ultimately provide a consistent number of deliveries throughout the year. This operating model produces the most significant of all the efficiencies that benefit our trade partners.\nTo optimize the pricing of each home, this strategy is more than just about selling -- about the pace of sales, but about selling the write homes at the right price. And every division, Mondays are now referred to as machine-Mondays. Our operating teams gathered to review dashboards, informing them with the prior week's results compared to the planned activity. This analysis of the prior week's activity from digital marketing leads to sales pace and price of homes sold is evaluated to see if we sold the right homes, thus informing our decision making and implied course of action for the current week.\nAs the week unfolds, this is reevaluated to make adjustments. All of this analysis enables each division to make ongoing adjustments [indiscernible] sales, unsold production as homes progress towards completion. In our first quarter, as interest rates fluctuated, this process informed us as to where we have pricing power or where we need buy down of interest rates and/or other incentives to maintain the desired pace.\nThe confidence we have in this by-design sales strategy allows us to maintain consistent starts. These starts lead to increased market share. This has seen a growth of 28% in sales and 23% in deliveries year-over-year as our consistent starts have filled the void of other buyers who pulled back. This consistency of starts and related share gain have positioned Lennar with the #1 or 2 market share and 33 of our 40 operating divisions with 23 of these 33 divisions having the #1 market share.\nHere are some examples of our markets where we have both the leading market share position and also have increased that share. In the Carolinas, [Audio Gap]\nthe goal of delivering attainable housing to meet the needs of the whole by consumer. Next, I'll discuss our land-light strategy. In the first quarter, we continued to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners with a purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time home sites to our homebuilding machine, as Stuart described. In the first quarter, about 80% of our $1.6 billion of land acquisitions in the quarter for finished homesites purchased from these various land structures.\nThis 80% reflects a prior FlexAire land purchased into these structures that is now being delivered to us for home stores. In the first quarter, about 90% of our new land acquisitions were acquired into our off-balance sheet land structures. We continue to make significant progress in the first quarter as our years of supply owned -- years supply of owned homesites improved to 1.3 years, down from 1.9 years and our control home sites percentage increased to 77% from 68% year-over-year.\nThe bottom line is focusing on our operating strategies, which resulted in reduced cycle time and the reduction in land owned has increased their cash flow as well as improved our inventory churn, which now stands at 1.5 versus 1.3 last year, a 15% increase. In the first quarter, we continue to refine the execution of the strategies Stuart has reviewed from the lower marketing and sales machine for production processes and land strategies or focus is consistent improvements are continuous and changes ever present.\nGeorge said, it sounds simple, but it isn't. It's a lot of hard work, a lot of trial there, and it takes a lot of grid. Fortunately, we have a great team of associates who have leaned into each of these strategies and are executing at the highest levels. I want to add my appreciation for their hard work and dedication. Now I'd like to turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations summarize again our balance sheet highlights and then provide high-level estimates for Q2 2024.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the first quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of $131 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $100 million compared to $59 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by an increase in lock volume, which was the result of higher homebuilding volume and a higher capture rate as well as higher profit per locked loans, which resulted from higher secondary margins and lower cost per loan as the team continues to focus on efficiencies.\nHigher operating earnings were $33 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and greater productivity as the team continues to embrace technology to run a more efficient business. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our whole building and financial services team. They truly represent the spirit of One Lennar. So now turning to our balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we will set fast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market with the goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand.\nThe results of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $5 billion of cash and mill borrowings on our $2.5 billion of credit facility. This provided a total liquidity of $7.6 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investments, we once again made significant progress on our goal of becoming asset light.\nAs Jon mentioned, at quarter end, our years owned improved to 1.3 years from 1.9 years in the prior year, and our homesites control increased to 77% from 68% in the prior year, our lowest years owned and highest controlled percent in our history. At quarter end, we owned just under 97,000 homesites and controlled 323,000 homesites for a total of 420,000 homesites.\nWe believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. As John mentioned, we spent $1.6 billion on land purchases this quarter. However, 80% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis, which is less capital intensive.\nOur goal is that over time, we will continue to reduce our ownership of land and purchase homesites on a just-in-time basis and our rents should more consistently approximate cash flow as the need to invest, reinvest back in the business direction. And finally, looking at returns. Our inventory churn was 1.5x, and our return on inventory was 30.5%.\nDuring the quarter, and consistent with our production focus, we started about 18,3000 homes and ended the quarter with just under 40,000 total homes inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,200 models and also includes about 1,000 homes that were completed unsold, which is less than one hole per community as we successfully manage our finished inventory levels.\nConsistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased $3.4 million of our outstanding shares for a total of $506 million. Additionally, during the quarter, as Stuart mentioned, we increased our annual dividend to $2 per share from $1.50 per share.\nSo we paid total dividends this quarter of $139 million. Looking at our debt maturity profile, our next senior note maturity is $454 million, which is due in April 2024 so next month. Then there are no maturities until May of 2025.\nWe continue to benefit from our previous paydown of senior notes and strong earnings generation, which brought our billing debt to total capital down to 9.6% at quarter end, an improvement from 14.2% in the prior year. We remain committed to increasing shareholder returns. Our stockholders' equity increased to almost $27 billion and our book value per share increased to [ $95.74 ] and our return on equity was 15.8%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we look through 2024.\nWith that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q2 and provide some high-level guidance. Starting with new orders. We expect Q2 orders to be in the range of 20,900 to 21,300 homes as we keep our production pace and sales pace closely aligned. We anticipate Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 19,000 to 19,500 homes with a continued focus of the efficiently turning inventory into cash.\nOur Q2 average sales price should be in the range of $420,000 to $425,000. We expect gross margins to be about 22.5%, and our SG&A about 7.2%, with both estimates having some plus or minus depending on market conditions.\nFor the combined homebuilding joint venture of land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $25 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings for Q2 to be in the range of $110 million to $115 million based on expected product mix in our mortgage operations.\nWe expect a loss of about $20 million for our multifamily business and also a loss of about $20 million for Lennar R&R/other category. So Lennar other estimate does not include any mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments since our adjustment will be determined by this by their stock prices at the end of the quarter.\nOur Q2 corporate G&A should be about 1.8% of total revenues, and our charitable contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 274 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.15 to $3.25 per share for the second quarter.\nFor the full year, we remain committed to delivering 80,000 homes, which is about a 10% growth year-over-year, with a gross margin that is consistent with last year's gross margin. We also remain confident with our cash flow generation, as we indicated. As such, we are still targeting a capital allocation of at least $2.5 billion, $154 million, which will be allocated to the April debt maturity that I mentioned and the balance to share repurchases. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

[Operator Instructions] After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the call over to David Collins for the reading of the forward-looking statement.\n\nDavid M.

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining today. I'm in Miami, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and a few others as well.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, John is going to give a rational overview updating construction cost, cycle time, and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight along with some limited guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2024. Then, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period.\nAs usual, I would like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as possible. So let's begin.\nWe are very pleased to report another very strong quarter and year-end of operating results for Lennar. We've executed our operating plan effectively over the past year and accordingly, have simply never been better positioned from balance sheet to operating strategy to address market conditions in the new year '24. Throughout 2023, the dominant theme at the macro level has been the impact of higher interest rates on the homebuilding consumer as affordability has been tested and demand has been constrained by the ability to purchase, i.e. affordability and the ability to qualify.\nGenerally speaking, consumers are employed and are generally confident as they will remain employed and that their compensation will generally rise. Overall, consumer confidence has been reasonably strong and buyers that can transact -- have transacted. Underlying this environment is a general chronic supply shortage of homes, especially affordable homes across the country as well as a growing pent-up demand for housing that is and has been held back by materially higher interest rates. There's been a very short supply of affordable products and a very strong demand for that affordable product. The new homebuilders have worked out a variety of tenant structures that range from interest rate buy downs to closing cost pickups to price reductions to meet the buyer, the purchaser at the intersection of need and affordability. The existing home market has been quiet as existing homeowners have coveted their low interest rate mortgages and remained on the sidelines.\nHomebuilders have been uniquely able to activate demand by using incentives that unlock the affordability constraint and enable purchasers to transact. Over the past quarter, this narrative has been particularly difficult as interest rates spiked through the first 2 months of the quarter and then began to ease in November. As mortgage rates began to migrate from 7.5% towards 8%, the market began to feel like it was hitting a real inflection point and the overall market conditions softened materially.\nMost recently, of course, [indiscernible] and the Fed have signaled that we might be closer to the end of the tightening cycle, and we might see lower rates as we enter 2024 and get into the new year. We will see. Against this backdrop, Lennar's consistent strategy throughout the past year has been to continue to drive volume to find affordability to meet demand by using our dynamic pricing model and using appropriate incentives and provide supply to the market. Over the past year, we have consistently detailed our operating strategy with the expectation that we would do as follows: number one, reduce our land assets while growing our business. Number two, drive strong and consistent bottom line earnings, while concurrently generating consistent net cash flow. Number three, reduce our construction cycle times while increasing our inventory turn and number four, ultimately enhance the quality of our returns on equity and return on assets by focusing on the allocation of liquid assets, i.e., cash.\n2023 was a year of strategy and successful execution for Lennar and sets us up extremely well for another strong year of execution in 2024. We began the year with a strong statement of operating strategy in a higher interest rate environment and focused on execution throughout the year. Even as the macroeconomic environment continued to shift and adjust to inflation with higher interest rates, we adhered to our strategy and drove volume and production. We believe that demand was strong, though constrained by affordability, and supply was very limited.\nAs others pulled back, we leaned in and maintained pace. We defined our operating strategy as driving production and sales pace while using price, incentives, and margin reduction to enable affordability. Rather than further constraining supply, we drove production and used our formidable size and scale to enable cost and operating efficiencies to drive affordability. As you've seen in our press release, while driving higher volume, we also achieved strong operating results.\nWe delivered over 73,000 homes in 2023, which represents a 10% year-over-year volume increase over 2022. We delivered a strong bottom line of $3.9 billion or $4.82 a share. We also generated well in excess of the $3.5 billion of homebuilding cash flow that we generated relative to what we generated in '22. And we are well positioned with land and community count to expect to deliver 80,000 homes in 2024. Again, another 10% increase year-over-year. Given the current interest rate signal from the Fed, we would also expect that margins will be at least consistent with our 2023 levels. And although we have embedded lower margins that will flow through the first quarter, those reduced margins will clear over the next quarter and using our dynamic pricing tool, we will recover margin quickly and efficiently as lower interest rates enable us to reduce incentives. The strategic benefits of driving volume came and will continue to come with advantages that are both immediately valuable as low as durable for the company's future. I'd like to briefly detail some of those advantages. First, by driving volume, we gained market share in most of our core markets as we leaned in when some others pulled that back. Our trade partners saw a consistent and dependable partner that became worthy of the designation builder of choice. We worked side by side with our traditional trade partners. And additionally, we found additional trade partner relationships with participants that found that they had dependable and consistent work with our strategy. Through market share growth in local markets, we enhanced the ability to better manage our costs enhance our efficiency of operation, reduce cycle times with efficient production templates and enhance our inventory turn.\nDon will discuss this in more detail shortly. Next, and maybe most important, by driving volume, we are positioned with land and communities for strong volume in all of our operating markets. As we drove volume and delivered homes, we purchased new land and communities for the next year's deliveries. We are extremely well positioned to continue to sell on pace as prices recover and as incentives subside alongside lower interest rates. We are positioned to drive even stronger bottom line results and cash flow as market conditions normalize. Additionally, by driving volume, we gained market share and land acquisition. Simply put, we continue to sell land by selling homes and then purchase land to replace communities, especially when others walked away. Market share advances have given us the critical position to be an even stronger land buyer of choice to the owners and developers of critical land assets. They saw a dependable market participant remain consistent as market conditions became more tenuous and we found that we were able to experiment with innovative land structures that work constructively as markets falter and then recover. Noteworthy in this regard is our variable land pricing tool that enables home site values to move up or down as a percentage of the sales price of the home as markets move up and down.\nNext, by driving consistent volume even at lower margins, we generated consistent cash flow through more challenging times and enhanced our balance sheet and our cash liquidity even after redeeming or repurchasing $1.1 billion of senior notes through the year [indiscernible] 10 million shares of Lennar stock through the year. Situated today with a 9.6% homebuilding debt-to-total cap ratio with $6.3 billion of cash on hand and $0 drawn on our revolver and with an expected 3.5% plus or minus $1 billion of net cash flow over the next year, we have the flexibility to invest capital strategically and grow while retiring debt as it matures and repurchasing shares of Lennar stock, which we expect to repurchase at least $2 billion of stock over the next year.\nFourth, by driving volume, we gained advantaged insights into and refined the workings of our strategic land banks. The flow of volume through the land banking relationships that define our current approach to land acquisition was invaluable. Questions have now been answered as to the durability of the capital partners that make up the counterparty relationship with the homebuilding machine. Our consistent volume helped define both trust and dependability in making those and taking those relationships to another level as neither party flinched as market conditions tested the boundaries of relationship.\nWhile adjustments were made and lessons were learned, the structures and relationships became stronger and more durable.\nFifth, by driving volume, especially in the more difficult interest rate environment of the last year, we were able to develop, enhance, use and improve Lennar machine. Our sales, marketing and dynamic pricing machine is quickly becoming an advanced digital engine that has materially benefited by aggressive focused use and engagement while the market was most difficult. We focused on what was required to drive volume while market conditions challenged affordability. We pushed data and engagement through the component parts of this digital tool and stressed it often into its limits. We reviewed 40 points of feedback from our 40 operating divisions and made adjustments and refinements as we learned\ntoday and the result is that Lennar's machine is becoming an invaluable partner as we drive volume by finding market at affordable pricing and driving sales at the same pace as production.\nOverall, our strategic focus on driving volume in both production and sales has enabled us to become a stronger and better positioned company that has become more durable through the ups and downs of housing cycles. Our balance sheet has never been stronger, and our operation -- our operating platform has never been better aligned. Our fourth quarter and year-end of 2023 has been another strategic and operational success for our company. While market conditions have been challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persist across our markets.\nWith that said, as interest rates subside to normalize and if the Fed is going to begin to actually cut rates, we believe that pickup demand will be activated, and we will be well prepared. To date, we have seen overall market conditions remain generally constructive for our industry. As higher interest rates have subsided, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. The most recent movements in interest rates suggest a better road ahead.\nAccordingly, we executed on our core strategy against the most difficult economic and industry backdrop. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well positioned for even greater success as strong demand for affordable offerings continues to seek short supply. We expect to start the new year with strong sales -- strong starts, sales and closings as we have guided to 16,500 to 17,000 deliveries in the first quarter, and a 21% to 21.25% margin as lower margin sales move through the first quarter.\nWe engaged the changing tides of the past year with a consistent strategy that has enabled certainty of execution throughout our company. Our strategy is well known and understood throughout our division offices, and we have a simple and consistent model of execution. We focus on maintaining volume while we price our homes to drive match base. We work with our trade base to manage costs and efficiencies and adjust product offering to meet the market. We manage both our land and our production inventories to drive efficiency, cash flow and returns on our asset base. We focus on our land light model in order to drive balance sheet efficiency. Finally, we fortify our balance sheet to have the liquidity for strength and flexibility. Knowing what to do in executing their plan has driven this quarter's and this year's success and ensures consistent success for the foreseeable future. As we look ahead to a successful 2024, we are well positioned for and expect to see much more of the same. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, perform and drive Lennar to new levels of performance.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nAs Stuart discussed, our operational teams at Lennar continued focusing on executing our operating strategies in our fourth quarter. Other divisions continuously learn from their engagement with Lennar machine, they provide feedback for enhancements and improve [indiscernible] our execution of our strategies. You can see the evolution of this improvement in our even-flow operating strategy throughout the year as starts in sales for the second half of 2023 were evenly matched at 37,053 and 37,032, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter, our production pace was defined by an average of 5 stars per community per month, an average sales pace of 4.7 sales per community per month. Importantly, this trade is not just about the pace of sales, but it's importantly about selling the right homes at the right pace. Our machine matches up unsold production as homes progress towards completion with pricing information from our dynamic pricing model on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis.\nIn our fourth quarter, as interest rates peaked, this process informed us as to how much we needed to buy down interest rates and/or offer other incentives to maintain the desired pace. We maintained consistent starts and sales paces, generating increased market share in almost all of the markets we build in. This is seen in our overall growth of 10% from last year as our consistent starts have killed the Board of other builders who are pulled back. Some examples of markets where we have a leading and increased market share in 2023 over 2022 are as follows: Here in South Florida, we are ranked as the #1 builder with a market share of 74%, up from 63% in [indiscernible] County and 33% in Broward County, up from 28%.\nAcross the state in Southwest Florida, we have a 38% market share, double that of the #2 builder. In the Carolinas, we are the #1 ranked builder in Charlotte, Raleigh, and Charleston with market shares of 10.5%, 16%, and 22.5%, respectively, representing an average increase in share of about 150 basis points.\nIn the Midwest, we are #1 in Indianapolis and Minnesota with over 25% market share in each market, an increase of over 400 basis points in each.\nIn Texas, we have increased market share in each of the markets there. In Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth, by 200 basis points to 11.5% and 10%, respectively. In Houston, by 300 basis points to 11.5%, and in San Antonio, by 700 basis points to 22.5%.\nIn Colorado, where we ranked #1 with almost 10% market share, which is double that of the #2 builder who has been the perennial market leader.\nMoving out West, in Phoenix and Las Vegas, we have the #1 share with 12% and 18%, respectively. In California, we're the #1 builder in all of the markets there and have grown a significant market share across the state from 25% in the Inland Empire and Central Valley to more than 35% in San Diego and Sacramento.\nAnd lastly, in the Pacific Northwest, we are the largest in Seattle and Portland with 14% and 17% share, respectively, both an increase of about 250 basis points. The execution of our pricing strategy is based on the strength of each individual market matched against the level of production by community in that market.\nAs Stuart noted, the market conditions in our fourth quarter were defined by the chronic shortage in housing supply and a more volatile interest rate environment compared to greater variations in market strength across our markets that we saw in prior quarters.\nIn the current market environment, all markets are benefiting to similar degrees from greater demand and supply. Our sales pace of 4.7 homes per [indiscernible] in Q4 was up from a pace of 3.7% compared to Q4 2022 further demonstrating improvement and executing the strategy of patients in Q4 is that it was the same as our overall pace for fiscal 2023. As interest rates rapidly moved higher during the quarter, our homebuilding teams worked through close coordination with our mortgage to find the right mortgage solution, homebuyer [indiscernible] buyer.\nFocused execution of the process I just described led to completing the quarter with less than 1 unsold inventory home per community. Our strategy of finding market clearing pricing to match the pace of sales to homes under construction, allows us to maintain both a high volume and a consistent volume of homes under construction, which is the foundation for our Builder of Choice program with our trade partners.\nAs we continuously improve the way we execute this game plan, we have deepened the partnerships with our trade base. Working together with our trade partners, we have consistently eliminated and/or prevented supply chain constraints and reduced cycle times. These and other efficiencies that benefit our trade partners enable us to lower construction costs in a cooperative manner with our trades. By consistently starting homes, despite the changing interest rate environment during the quarter, we increased our starts in the fourth quarter by 43% from the prior year and starts remained flat sequentially from Q3. This increase in starts attracts a larger trade base, together with a normalized supply chain environment, which led to another significant improvement in our cycle time.\nFor the fourth quarter, cycle time decreased by 22 days sequentially from Q3, down to 161 days on average for single-family homes.\nIn most of our markets, this represents being at or close to pre-pandemic cycle times. Looking at the fourth quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q3 by about 4%. In addition, our Q4 costs were down about 13% on a year-over-year basis. This is the direction of the construction costs we expect in our guidance from last quarter.\nMoving forward, we expect costs to be consistent with where they are now over the next few quarters. In order to further improve our production efficiencies we are working side-by-side with our trade partners on value engineering, quote plan series and production sequencing across markets to reduce the cost and time to bill with the goal of delivering a greater value to the home buying customer.\nNext, I'll discuss the execution of our landline strategy. In the fourth quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners with a purchase [indiscernible] on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time finished homesites to our homebuilding machine as Stuart described.\nConsistent with the third quarter, about 84% of our $1.5 billion of land acquisition in the quarter was from home sites purchased through our various land structures. We have made significant progress in the fourth quarter, as our year supply of owned home sites improved to 1.4 years from 1.9 years, and our controlled home site percentage increased to 76% from 69% year-over-year.\nThe bottom line is focusing on our operating strategies which results in a reduction in cycle time and a reduction in owned land has, as to articulated, increased our cash flow as well as help improve our inventory churn which now stands at 1.5 versus 1.2 last year, a 25% increase.\nOur community count at the end of the fourth quarter was 1,260, which is up 4% from the year ago period. We expect to increase our community count in the mid- to high single digits by the end of fiscal 2024. I want to recognize and thank all of our [indiscernible] for their hard work and dedication and focusing on the execution of our strategies and also importantly, for accomplishing the change management needed for the required process changes in implementing these strategies of our machine, while at the same time delivering a very strong fourth quarter in fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon. Good morning. So Stuart and John have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations and our balance sheet and then provide some comments on the first quarter. Looking at financial services, for the fourth quarter, the Financial Services team had operating earnings of $168 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $119 million compared to $80 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher loan volume as a result of higher orders and capture rate, and higher profit per loan as a result of higher secondary margins and lower cost per loan as the team continues to focus on efficiencies.\nTotal operating earnings were $50 million compared to $44 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volumes and greater productivity as the team continues to embrace technology to run a more efficient business. The following results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our [indiscernible] financial services team. They truly operate under the banner of One Lennar.\nNow turning to our balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn on inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes [indiscernible] with the goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The results of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $6.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $8.9 billion upon building liquidity. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we once again, as John mentioned, made significant progress on our goal of becoming asset light. At quarter end, our year [indiscernible] improved to 1.4 years from 1.9 years in the prior year, and our home [indiscernible] control increased to 76% from 69% in the prior year. Our lowest years owned and highest controlled percent in our history.\nAt quarter end, we owned just under 100,000 homesites and controlled 310,000 homesites for a total of 410,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue growing market share in a capital-efficient way. We spent $1.5 billion on land purchases this quarter, with 84% being finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin.\nThis is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis, which is less capital intensive. And finally, with the year returns, our return was 1.5x, and our return on inventory was 29%. Let me make one comment about our inventory balance. This quarter, we reclassed deposits on future land purchases from inventory to a separate line on our balance sheet. This request, which was about $2 billion at year-end, was made to better align ourselves with most participants in our industry and thus brings greater comparability and less confusion to the investor and analyst communities. During the quarter, and consistent with our production focus, we started about 18,400 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 38,200 total homes in inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,200 models and also includes about 1,200 homes that were completed and sold, which is slightly less than one home per community as we successfully manage our finished inventory levels.\nIn our continued effort to further strengthen and demerged our balance sheet by reducing our debt balances, as we've mentioned in the fourth quarter, we redeemed the remaining balance $378 million of our [indiscernible] during December 2023 and repurchased $110 million of [indiscernible] during fiscal 2024 and 2027 all at or below par for a quarterly total of $488 million.\nFor the full year, we repaid or reduced $1.1 billion [indiscernible] as a result of these debt reduction initiatives, we ended the quarter with a total senior note balance of about $2.5 billion. There is only one note due in 2024, which is $454 million due in April. Combined with strong earnings, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 9.6% at quarter end, our lowest ever which is an improvement from 14.4% in the prior year. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased $3 million of our outstanding shares for $337 million in the fourth quarter. And for the year, we repurchased 10 million shares totaling $1.1 billion.\nAdditionally, we paid dividends of $105 million during the quarter and $431 million for the year. So in total, we returned almost $1 billion to our equity and debt holders in the fourth quarter and about $2.7 billion for the full fiscal year.\nAnother few final points regarding our balance sheet: our stockholders' equity increased to almost $27 billion, and our book value per share increased to $94.61.\nIn summary, the strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we enter 2024.\nSo with that please overview, I'd like to turn to Q1. Given the evolving [indiscernible] environment, we'd like to once again provide some guidelines for Q1 to assist with your modeling. Starting with new orders, we expect Q1 orders to be in the range of 17,500 to 18,000 homes as we keep production pace and sales pace closely aligned. We anticipate our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 16,500 and 17,000 homes with a continued focus on efficiently turning inventory into cash. Our Q1 average sales price should be about $420,000 and we expect gross margins to be in the range of 21% to 21.25%, indicating some impact from higher interest rates in Q4. Additionally, also remember that our Q1 margins are always negatively impacted by the current period expensing of fuel costs.\nWhile we are working towards an even slow process of starting and constructing homes on a fairly consistent quarterly basis, revenues in Q1 are the lowest of the year because of seasonality. So for this Q1, the current period of expensing will have a negative gross margin impact of approximately 150 basis points when you look sequentially from Q4. Also on note, consistent with last year, the first quarter will be a low point of margins during 2024.\nTurning to SG&A, we expect to be in the range of 8% to 8.2% for Q1 and for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $20 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings for Q1 to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, and we expect a loss of about $25 million for our multifamily business and a launch of about $15 million for the Lennar in our other category. The Lennar other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments through our public technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of the quarter.\nWe expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2.2% of total revenues. These expenses are likely to turn up a bit as we continue to invest in cybersecurity and technology development that is robust and durable to support our future growth and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 279 million shares.\nIn [indiscernible] combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $2.15 to $2.20 per share for the first quarter [Technical Difficulty] approximately 80,000 deliveries for the year. And for gross margin, as Stuart mentioned, we expect to maintain the levels produced in 2023. Whilst we also remain confident in our cash flow generation. As such, we continue to be committed to allocating capital to our stakeholders. We're targeting a total capital of at least $2.5 billion for 2024 remembering that $454 million will be allotted to our April 2024 debt maturity and the balance of roughly $2 billion to share repurchases.\nI'd like to end [indiscernible] thanking the Lennar Financial change, accounting, planning and IR for their combined great efforts that allow us to host our year-end earnings call 2 weeks after year-end [indiscernible] And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

So today, I'm in Miami together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. We're all together in Miami together.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company and our performance. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give some color on overall market conditions. He's going to comment on our land position, and then he's going to give an operational overview, updating supply chain, cycle time and construction costs. And as usual, Diane is going to give detailed financial highlights along with some limited guidance for the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 to assist in forward thinking and modeling. We will answer as many questions as we can, and please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up, as usual.\nAs you all know, since our last earnings call, Rick Beckwitt retired, effective the end of the third quarter. Rick began his 17 years with Lennar at the very beginning of the Great Recession, as it's called, in 2006. He rejoined an industry that was operating at the top of this game and was prepared to reach for even higher heights. Rick found himself, however, in an industry that was caught in a changing and devolving economic environment that altered expectations and aspirations. Rick jumped in at Lennar and treated problems at his own side-by-side with the rest of the team. And over the next years, he worked as part of the team fixing what was broken and righting what was upside down. He became fast partners with me and with Jon Jaffe, and together, we navigated difficult times. We positioned Lennar for future success and began anew to reach for new heights, and we achieved the extraordinary.\nAll of us at Lennar appreciate Rick's service and partnership. We all benefited from his experience in the industry, his natural intellect and the camaraderie that we all share. We all reach that inevitable moment of retirement, but it is uncommon for that moment to coincide with the timing where the company is well prepared as well.\nThis is that rare moment. As a team of 3, Rick, Jon and I worked together and as partners with the rest of our operating leaders to list and position Lennar for leadership in the industry. Lennar today is both organized and positioned financially to move forward with a smaller organization structure and more efficient overhead. Rick completed 17 years of service and retired as co-CEO and President.\nRick, I know you're out there. I know you're on the call and listening because I know you just can't help yourself. I hope you're preparing to sharpen your golf game or building some wood cabinet in Maine. Rest assured that all is well and stable, and we're executing as expected here at Lennar.\nSo now let me turn to the business at hand and talk about the business of Lennar and how we are performing, as well as how we are positioned for our future. So let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that the Lennar team has -- has remained focused on balancing and maintaining production and sales pace, reducing cycle time and increasing cash flow, improving inventory turns and driving strong bottom line. And we have again produced a strong and consistent result for the quarter. Our third quarter results reflect consistent adherence to the core operating strategy that we have detailed in prior quarters against the backdrop of an evolving macroeconomic environment and a constructively configured housing landscape.\nAs I noted in our press release, the macroeconomic environment is constructive, relative to the housing -- homebuilding market. And it has certainly stabilized relative to the aggressive interest rate climb that defined the environment last year. It seems that we have entered a phase of more measured adjustments in order to curtail inflation while the Fed shrinks its balance sheet by approximately $100 billion per month and engages other mechanisms to reduce capital in the market.\nOver this time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp churns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities and housing is the necessity.\nAgainst that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to an excessive \"higher for longer\" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing and short supply, is the new normal and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher.\nGenerally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buydowns and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelters -- median shelter, and customers have responded. The net price of homes has moderated, and the net average sales prices has stabilized. We have seen in our numbers that net average sales prices on home closings have dropped approximately 10% or 11% from the peak of approximately $500,000 in 2022 to approximately $448,000 now, and we expect that pricing to remain fairly constant.\nConcurrently, Multifamily rental rates have also moderated. Two years of 500,000 apartment starts per year are now being delivered and creating supply increases, and in some geographies, excess supply, which are moderating rental rates. While we expect a sharp drop off in new starts this year, we don't expect that rents will drop significantly, but they are not likely to grow very much either in the foreseeable future.\nRentals and rent equivalents make up a significant part of the CPI calculation. Overall, we believe that the housing market has leveled and while net average sales prices are lower, cancellations have been normalizing and margins have stabilized as cost reductions in value engineering provide an offset to the price reductions. Additionally, we believe that the new supply of homes will be limited as developed land is scarce and increasingly more expensive to develop. This will continue to limit available inventory and maintain supply/demand imbalance.\nBottom line, the economy is constructive. Housing supply is short and limited, demand returned -- returned to affordable offerings, and builders who will need to continue to produce more homes to fill the void. So against that backdrop, the Lennar team has remained focused on our core strategies that are driving our company forward. First, we've continued to remain production- and volume-focused, with a primary focus on driving production efficiency, driving higher inventory turn, driving higher cash flow and strong margins and while focusing on return on assets.\nAt the same time, we maintain a carefully matched sales base using our digital marketing and dynamic pricing machine to keep production pace, and sales pace closely matched. In our third quarter, we started 18,675 homes, while we sold 9,666 ones, and we delivered 18,559 homes, or an 8% increase over last year. Our starts pace for the quarter was 4.9 homes per community per month, while our sales pace was 5.2 homes per community per month. While these numbers don't fit perfectly together, they are getting closer every quarter, and we're operating our platform more tightly than ever and by careful design.\nOur digital marketing and dynamic pricing machine helps drive our net sales pace to exceed our available starts, enabling us to backfill cancellations, which ran last quarter at a 3.3% rate. And we maintained a very controlled inventory level as a result, and that is of just over 1 home per community. This has driven the confidence to continue a consistent start base that enables operating efficiency. With this focus, we've continued to sell homes at current market prices, improving margin as conditions improve, and reducing margins when necessary.\nAccordingly, our margins bottomed in the first quarter of this year at 21.2%. And as the market has improved, margins have recovered to now 24.4% this quarter, and we're expecting flat to modest improvement next quarter with a range of 24.4% to 24.6%. Of course, through all phases of the market cycle, we are consistently producing very strong cash flow. These elements of execution are working extremely well and improving. And accordingly, we have gained confidence in our ability to now guide to increase volumes for the year of almost 71,000 and almost 72,000 deliveries with strong margins and strong cash flow.\nNext strategy, we have continued to work with our trade partners to maintain our now properly configured cost structure relative to the current sale price environment, while we continue to drive cycle time to pre-supply chain crisis levels. Jon will cover these production components in more detail shortly, but Jon and our purchasing team have been laser-focused across the platform. We were quick to reduce costs as the market corrected and we have held costs down as the market has stabilized, and considerable success in this area is reflected in our margin improvement and as well as in the number of homes that were construction-ready and available for delivery this quarter.\nOur third strategy has been to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions, as well as land and land bank strategies. While Jon will give additional detail on land, this has been a specific concentrated focus across the platform in every division to refine our approach to reducing land exposure and continuing to become increasingly asset-light. We've made some significant progress in reducing land held on balance sheet, with now just 1.5 years owned and 73% of our land control. We have made exceptional progress in creating a materially more efficient manufacturing platform. Accordingly, our land programs and partners have become strategic partners in maintaining volume and increasing market share while helping to rationalize costs.\nOur fourth core focus and strategy has been to manage our operating costs or our SG&A. So that even at lower gross margins, we will continue to drive a strong net margin. While we've been driving our SG&A down over the past years quarter-by-quarter to new record lows and many of those changes, although not all, are hardwired into permanent efficiencies in operations, there are some components that have grown, as we have seen this quarter, and we have had to address interest rate movements as we have addressed interest rate movements and sometimes more difficult market conditions. Examples are realtor costs and marketing expenses, which have had to expand as customer acquisition and engagement have become sometimes more challenging. Both of these areas saw increases in our third quarter numbers.\nNevertheless, we were able to achieve a very respectable 7% SG&A this quarter, which is higher than last quarter's 6.7%, but it is -- but it did, nevertheless, result in a strong net margin of 17.4%, which is up from 15.8% last quarter. We've continued to streamline our business even as we grow so that we can accomplish more with less. And as an example, many of that, it will need to replace Rick, as he is now retired. And the answer simply is no. Because we built systems that are now in place that enable us to operate in ways today that would not have worked in past years.\nOur fifth playbook strategy was to maintain tight inventory controls in order to control our asset base. The Lennar machine of digital marketing, sales management and dynamic pricing has materially improved inventory control by enabling a focus on selling loans and inventory, focusing maximum attention on underperforming communities and bringing attention to products and plans that are not selling as expected. Clearing the homes that are complete and closable rather than selling homes that are many quarters in the future is exactly what drives cash flow, higher inventory turns and higher returns on assets, and we're focused on this part of the business every day.\nBoth land and home inventory control is the mission control of our overall business. And in our third quarter numbers, you can see continuing quarterly improvement in our now 11.5% debt to total capitalization, down from 13.3% last quarter and down from 15% last year at this time. Additionally, with our $3.9 billion cash position, our net debt to total capital is actually negative. And our balance sheet is being carefully managed to provide extraordinary liquidity and flexibility. These elements of the business continues to be managed through an every other day management meeting where numbers are reviewed at the regional individual levels by the entire management team. Sales starts and closings are maintained and controlled balance of the fit, with the end result of volume with defined expectations.\nThe sixth playbook strategy was to continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. If we reflect on our third quarter results, not only accomplished -- not only did we accomplish excellent cash flow and bottom line results -- or bottom line results earning over $1.1 billion or $3.87 per share, but we used cash to repurchase $366 million of stock, and we also repaid approximately $475 million of senior debt. We expect to continue to generate considerable earnings and cash flow, and accordingly, we'll continue to retire debt and purchase stock opportunistically.\nLet me say in conclusion that our third quarter 2023 has been another excellent quarter for Lennar. We saw overall market conditions remain constructive for our industry, as aggressive interest rate moves subsided and the new normal defined expectations. Additionally, the housing market has continued to be defined by housing shortage and generally strong demand that is prepared -- that is prepared to transact. Accordingly, we executed on our core strategies against the economic and industry backdrop. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well positioned for continued success as strong demand for affordable offerings continues to see the current short supply.\nWe expect to finish out this year strong, and we also expect to enter 2024 with a 10% initial growth expectation, and we're very well positioned to achieve that level. We engaged the changing times of the past year with a consistent strategy that enables certainty of execution throughout our company. Our strategy is well known and understood throughout our division offices, and we have a simple and consistent model of execution. We focus on maintaining volume, while we price our homes to drive match pace. We work with our trade base to manage cost and efficiency and adjust our product offering to meet the market. We manage both lands and our production inventories to drive efficiency, cash flow and returns on our asset base. We focus on land-light model in order to drive balance sheet efficiency. Finally, we fortify our balance sheet to have liquidity for strength and flexibility.\nKnowing what to do in executing for plan has driven this quarter's success and ensures consistent success for the foreseeable future. As we look ahead to a successful fourth quarter and year-end 2023 and into 2024, we are positioned for and expect to see much of the same as we go forward. We are confident that we'll continue to grow, perform and drive Lennar to new levels of performance. Thank you. And with that, let me turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nThanks, Stuart. Good morning, everyone. As Stuart noted, the housing market is healthy overall as supply remains tight, demand remains strong and buyers have become more comfortable with higher mortgage rates. In our third quarter, we continue to offer a combination of attractive pricing in compelling mortgage rate programs to capture that demand. Our price-to-market strategy reflects our balance sheet-first focus, where we can maintain starts in sales, increase market share, generate cash flow and keep our Homebuilding machine going. The execution of our pricing strategy is based on the strength of the individual market as we get the level of production we have in that market is done on a community-by-community basis.\nIn the current environment, all of our markets are benefiting from [ vigor ] demand and supply. And while some markets like in Florida or the Carolinas are stronger than others, we were able to achieve our designed sales pace in all our markets. In our third quarter, the majority of our markets had a higher sales pace in Q3 compared to Q2 and also used higher incentives in Q3, along with an increase in marketing and broker spend.\nIn all markets, our Homebuilding teams work closely with our mortgage to find the right solution for each buyer to help fulfill their desire to purchase. Our sales strategy of fighting market clearing pricing is designed to match the pace of homes under construction, which in turn gives us confidence to maintain a consistent pace of starts. This consistent start pace is the foundation for our production-first strategy. As we continuously improve the way we execute this game plan, we have grown our trade base, maintained lower construction costs and reduced cycle time. These improvements enabled our third quarter starts to increase 17% from the prior year.\nContinued focus on our production-first strategy has enhanced Lennar's position as the builder of choice for trades. Our existing trade partners are increasing their business with Lennar, while our approach is also attracting new trades. This increase in access to trade combined with a normalized supply chain led to a significant improvement in our third quarter cycle time. For the quarter, cycle time decreased by 32 days sequentially from Q2. Progress is difficult to measure precisely as product mix changes, but we are clearly on a path to getting back to pre-pandemic cycle times and expect to continue to see improvement in the fourth quarter and into 2024.\nLooking at our third quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q2 by about 5%. In addition, our Q3 costs were down about 4% on a year-over-year basis. This was down significantly from the 8% year-over-year increase we saw in Q2. Again, this is the trajectory of cost reduction we guided to last quarter.\nLooking forward, you can expect Lennar to be focused on planned and SKU reductions, value engineering to further reduce costs and introducing additional workforce housing communities in many markets across our platform. I would like to conclude with our land-light strategy and community count. In our third quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners with a purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time finished home sites to our Homebuilding machine. In the third quarter, about 85% of our $1.5 billion land acquisition with finished homesites purchased from various land structures. We have made significant progress again in the third quarter as our year's supply of owned homesites improved to 1.5 years from 2.2 years, and our controlled home site percentage increased to 73% from 79% year-over-year, respectively.\nThe reduction in cycle time and the reduction in owned land will increase cash flow as well as help improve inventory churn, which now stands at 1.3 versus 1.1 last year, an 18% increase. Our community count at the end of the third quarter was 1,253, which was up 5% from the year ago period, and we expect to increase our community count in the high single digits by the end of fiscal 2023 from 2022.\nThe strategies of our sales pace matching production pace, which leads to lower cycle times and construction costs, combined with an asset-light focus, which leads to the reduction of owned land, are reducing risk, improving returns and strengthening the balance sheet for Lennar. I want to recognize and thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication and focusing on these strategies and for delivering a solid third quarter. I'd now like to turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our Homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations and our balance sheet and then provide guidance for Q4 2023.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our Financial Services team had operating earnings of $148 million. Looking at the details, Mortgage operating earnings were $111 million compared to $64 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher lot volume as a result of higher orders and capture rates and higher profit per lot to loan as a result of lower cost per loan as the team continues to focus on efficiencies and additionally, higher secondary margins.\nTotal operating earnings were $37 million compared to earnings of $33 million, which excludes a $36 million onetime charge due to the litigation accrual in the prior year. Final earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and a decrease in cost per transaction as the team continues to focus on using technology to increase productivity. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our Homebuilding and Financial Services teams. They truly operate under the banner of 1 Lennar.\nSo now turning to the balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market to deliver as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The [ jumpy ] also continued with our determination to preserve cash to increase asset efficiency. The end result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash and had no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total liquidity of $6.5 million and great -- sorry, and great financial flexibility for the future.\nAs a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we made significant progress on our goal of becoming land lighter. At quarter end, our home sites control increased to 73% from 69% in the prior year, and our [ years owned ] improved to 1.5 years from 2.2 years in the prior year, our highest controlled percentage and our lowest years owned in our history. Jon mentioned, we spent approximately $1.5 billion on land purchases this quarter. However, about 85% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin.\nAt quarter end, we owned 107,000 homesites and controlled 284,000 homesites, for a total of 391,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. During the quarter, we started about 18,700 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 43,600 total homes in inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,000 models, and [indiscernible] include a 1,400 homes that were completed unsold as we successfully managed the finished inventory -- acquisition inventory level.\nIn our continued effort to further strengthen and derisk our balance sheet by reducing our debt balances, we retired $425 million aggregate principal of our [ 5 and 7 senior notes ] due in November 2024 and repurchased about $50 million of [indiscernible] notes also due in fiscal 2024 or -- at or below par. We've repaid about $6.1 billion of senior notes over the last 2 years, which equates to more than $330 million of annual interest savings. As a result of our debt reduction initiatives, we ended the quarter with a total senior note balance just under $3 billion, which was less than our cash balance of almost $4 billion. The net senior note maturity of $378 million is due in December 2023.\nCombined with strong earnings, our Homebuilding debt to total capital was 11.5% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 15% in the prior year. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 3 million of our shares totaling $366 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 7 million shares totaling $763 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $107 million during the quarter. So in total, we returned almost $1 billion to all our investors this quarter, our equity holders and our debt holders.\nJust a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to almost 26 billion. Our [ book ] value per share increased to just over $90. Our return on inventory was 26%, and our return on equity was 16%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we come to the end of 2023 and head into 2024.\nSo with that brief over to you, let's turn to guidance. Starting with new orders. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 16,200 to 17,200 homes as we match sales with production. And as Jon mentioned, we expect our Q4 ending inventory count to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range year-over-year. We anticipate our Q4 deliveries to be in the range of 21,500 to 22,500 homes. This would bring our annual delivery to be in the range of 70,800 to 71,800, which is an increase of 7% to 8% year-over-year. Our Q4 average sales price will be approximately flat in Q3 as we continue to price to market and offer incentives to match affordability.\nWe expect gross margins to be in the range of 24.4% to 24.6%, and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.9% as we continue to focus on maintaining sales and production paces. And for the combined Homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $25 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q4 to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million, and we expect a loss of about $20 million for our Multifamily business and a loss of approximately $25 million for the Lennar Other category. The Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark to market adjustments to our public technology investments, as that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter.\nWe expect our Q4 quarter G&A to be about 1.1% of total revenues, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count should be approximately 281 million shares. So when you pull all that together, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.40 to $4.75 per share for the fourth quarter.\nAnd finally, as Stuart mentioned, as we think about 2024, our initial growth expectation is currently 10%. And so therefore, we look forward to another very successful year. So with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Sorry about the delay. We have a lot of people joining, wanted to make sure people had an opportunity to get in.\nI'm in Dallas today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President. And we're joined remotely from Miami by Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEO and Co-President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. As I said, they are all in Miami, so there will be a bit of coordination here.\nAs usual, I'm going to go ahead and give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to walk through our markets around the country, comment on our land position. Then John is going to update supply chain, cycle time and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlights, along with some limited guidance for the third quarter to assist in forward thinking and some guidance for the year. And then we'll answer questions as many as we can. [Operator Instructions]\nSo let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are quite pleased to report that the Lennar team has remained focused on production and pace, cash flow, inventory turns and return on capital, and we have again produced strong and consistent results for the quarter. Our second quarter results are consistent with the stabilization we have seen in the current economic environment as well as consistent adherence to our core operating strategies that we've discussed on prior quarterly conference calls.\nAs it relates to homebuilding, the economic environment has stabilized as customers have adjusted to and accepted higher-for-longer interest rates. The supply chain chaos has normalized. Inventories have remained low, and the supply of housing across the country is in very limited supply.\nThis environment seems to represent a new normal that is formed in the wake of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes starting last year. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in orderly fashion. The strong demand for housing that had been curtailed by sticker shock and affordability challenges has returned, while the housing market adjusted prices, incentives, including rate buydowns and production costs in order to enable customers to afford needed shelter.\nAnd even while interest rates and affordability were primary headwinds to demand, the well-documented chronic housing supply shortage has kept inventory levels very low, which has continued to propel customers to stretch their finances for needed housing, as incentives and price reductions combined to spark sales activity.\nThe net price of homes has moderated through price reductions, together with the use of interest rate buydowns and other incentives. And the net average sales price has stabilized and not gone higher, nor lower for that matter, even as demand has returned. We have seen in our numbers that net average sales prices on home closings have dropped approximately 10% or 11% on home sales from the peak of approximately $500,000 in 2022 to approximately $450,000 now, and we expect that, that pricing is going to remain constant throughout the year.\nI would note additionally that through our Multifamily Apartment division, we are also seeing that rental rates have moderated. Given our extensive experience in the Multifamily Apartment market, along with our for sale and for rent housing business, we see that there is general downward pressure on rents as many markets have become somewhat overbuilt, and there is additional inventory being completed and coming online. This inventory will complete over the next 1.5 years. While rents won't likely drop significantly, they are not likely to grow very much either, and remember that rentals and rent equivalents make up a significant part of the CPI calculation.\nOverall, we believe that the housing market has leveled. And while net average sales prices are lower, cancellations have been normalizing and margins have bottomed and are recovering as cost reductions and value engineering provide an offset to the price reductions.\nLooking ahead, we continue to believe that the market and the economy will remain constructive for homebuilders as pent-up demand continues to come to market and consume affordable offerings. Additionally, we believe that the supply constraint will continue to limit available inventory and maintain supply-demand balance. The core elements of the supply shortage will not resolve in the near term as the almost 15-year production deficit will take years to resolve.\nAnd note that even when existing homes with low interest mortgages that are not currently trading do come to the market and add to supply, the sellers will also need a place to move. And that creates a net 0 to overall dwellings, in addition to supply and in addition to demand and, therefore, still a housing shortage. Bottom line, supply is short, demand is returning to affordable offerings and builders will need to produce more homes to fill the void.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Lennar team has remained consistent in our commitment to strategies that we articulated as rates began to climb over a year ago. Let me do a quick review as these strategies explain both what we have accomplished as well as what we expect to accomplish throughout the remainder of the year.\nFirst, we said then, as we say now, that we maintained volume and production as our constant and margin as our shock absorber, and we manage our business with certainty through volatility staying focused on production, inventory turn, cash flow and return on assets. Accordingly, we maintained volume, keeping our production machine working efficiently while rationalizing costs.\nIn the second quarter, our sales team engaged our digital marketing platform in conjunction with our dynamic pricing model to continue to drive sales volume at market pricing in order to maintain consistent production levels and improve our inventory turn. We affectionately call this configuration, the Lennar machine, and it is designed to produce consistent sales pace at pricing that enables consistency as the market adjusts. Although it is not perfect yet, the Lennar machine drove new order volume to 17,885 new orders, exceeding last year's volume by 1%, and this enabled our production group to operate with predictability and consistency.\nAdditionally, we efficiently backfilled cancellations in the quarter, which have now dropped to some 13.5%, enabling our deliveries to exceed expectation at 17,074 deliveries, and that was up 3% over last year. If by chance, by the way, any of you happen to be in Miami, come on by and ask to see the Lennar machine in action. I think you'll get a better sense of our strategy, and you just might start to imagine where the often talked-about AI might find its way into the sometime-stodgy homebuilding industry and improve productivity.\nAnd to this end, we have a new and exciting Chief Technology Officer at Lennar named Scott Spradley. Welcome aboard, Scott. Let's get to work. We've continued to focus on selling homes at market-clearing prices, reducing margin when conditions weaken and improving margin as conditions level and improve. Accordingly, our margins bottomed in the first quarter at 21.2%. Then, as the market leveled this past quarter, we saw margin improvement to 22.5%, and we're expecting further improvement next quarter to 23.5% to 24% and further improvement beyond that, of course, depending on market conditions.\nThrough all phases of the market cycle, we are consistently producing strong cash flow. The elements of execution are working extremely well and improving with the Lennar machine, and we've gained confidence in our ability to now guide to increased volume for the year of 68,000 to 70,000 deliveries with strong margins and strong cash flow.\nOur second strategy has been to work with our trade partners to rightsize our cost structure to the current sales price environment while we continue to drive our cycle time to pre-supply chain crisis levels. John will cover this strategy in more detail shortly, but John and Rick have been focused across our platform with our production and our purchasing teams as well as our trade partners. Considerable results are reflected both on the margin improvement and in the number of homes that we that were construction-ready and available for delivery.\nOn the margin front, since Lennar led the way with the reduction in margin, while maintaining volume and increasing market share as the market corrected in the wake of an industry-wide reduction in starts, we engaged our trade partners to work side-by-side with us to help find efficiencies in production to rightsize their margins as well and to work side-by-side in driving efficiencies on the site. As margin expanded in the best of times, they benefited. As margins have now contracted in the more difficult times, we all understand the benefits of predictability and consistency that derives from consistent volume and scale.\nCycle time continues to be a work in progress. While we continue to make improvement, we improved from 219 days last quarter to 215 this quarter, this is truly like fixing a plane that is in flight as progress is slow and difficult to measure as products change. Nevertheless, we're making slow-but-steady progress as improvement will help reduce inventory turn, which now stands at 1.2 versus 1.1 last year.\nOur third strategy is to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions as well as on land and land bank strategy. While Rick will give additional detail on land, this has been a specific concentrated focus by all 3 of us, myself, Rick and John, across the platform working connected and together to refine our approach to reducing land exposure and becoming increasingly asset-light. We've made significant progress in reducing land held on our balance sheet with now 70% of our land controlled and only 30% owned.\nAs with our trade partners, our land partners or sellers have become strategic partners in maintaining volume and increasing market share while helping to rationalize cost.\nOur fourth playbook strategy was to manage our operating cost or our SG&A so that even at lower gross margin, we will drive a strong net margin. While we've been driving our SG&A down over the past years quarter-by-quarter to new record lows, and many of those changes, although not all, are hardwired into permanent inefficiencies in operations, there are some components that have grown as we've had to address more difficult market conditions. Examples, of course, are realtor costs and marketing expenses, which have had to expand as customer acquisition has become more challenging. Nevertheless, we were able to achieve a respectable 6.7% SG&A this quarter, which resulted in a strong net margin of 15.8% at the net.\nWe know that in more difficult times, there is, and should be, upward pressure on sales and marketing costs in order to drive and find purchasers and drive new sales. We believe, however, if we continue to drive volume, we'll be able to constrain increases and manage to a very attractive cost level and net margin.\nOur fifth playbook strategy was to maintain tight inventory control. And the Lennar machine of digital marketing, sales management and dynamic pricing has materially improved inventory control by enabling a focus on selling homes and inventory, focusing maximum attention on underperforming communities and bringing attention to product plans that are simply just not selling. Clearing the homes that are complete and closable rather than selling homes that are many quarters in the future is exactly what drives cash flow, and we're focused on this part of our business every day.\nBoth land and home inventory control is mission central for our overall business. And in our second quarter numbers, you can see in our continuing quarterly improvement in our now 13.3% debt-to-total capital -- capitalization ratio, down from 14.2% last quarter, and our $4 billion cash position, that our inventory and our balance sheet is being carefully managed to provide excellent liquidity and flexibility for our future.\nThese elements of the business continue to be managed through every other day management meetings where numbers are reviewed at the regional and divisional levels by the entire management team. Starts, sales and closings are maintained in a controlled balance with the end result of volume with defined expectations.\nThe sixth playbook strategy was to continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. If we reflect on our second quarter results, we not only accomplished excellent cash flow and bottom line results, but we repurchased $208 million of stock and we also repurchased approximately $158 million of senior debt due in fiscal 2024. We expect to continue to generate considerable earnings and cash flow. And accordingly, we'll continue to retire debt and purchase stock opportunistically.\nLet me say in conclusion that our second quarter of 2023 has been an excellent quarter for Lennar. We saw market conditions level and stabilize, at least for now, and we executed on our core strategies. We are extremely well positioned to navigate the uncertainties of the current market. We engaged the difficulties of the past year with a consistent strategy that promoted certainty of execution throughout the company. When market conditions were difficult and uncertain, Lennar's associates knew their mission. Similarly, as the market has leveled, Lennar associates know mission and exactly how to execute.\nOur strategy is well known and understood through our division offices, and we have a plan that -- we have a plan as the inevitable cycles of our industry ebb and flow. We focus on maintaining volume while we price our homes to drive a consistent pace. We work with our trade base to manage cost and inefficiencies -- and efficiencies. We manage both our land and our production inventories to drive cash flow and returns on investment. We focus our asset-light model in order to drive balance sheet efficiency and drive return on investment. Finally, we fortify our balance sheet to have liquidity for strength and flexibility.\nKnowing what to do and executing per plan has driven this quarter's success and continues to guide us into the next quarter and beyond. We are confident that we will continue to perform and drive Lennar to new levels of performance. Thank you. And now let me turn over to Rick.\n\nRichard Beckwitt\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director\n\nThanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market has continued to normalize and recover as buyers have become more comfortable with higher mortgage rates. Site inventory levels in the resale and new home market propelled demand for available new homes, and we offered a combination of attractive pricing and compelling mortgage rate programs to capture that demand.\nWhile many of our markets are performing well, in all of our markets, we are regularly adjusting base prices and incentives to maintain our targeted sales base. Our strategy has been to maintain our targeted start phase, continue to sell homes and adjust our pricing to reflect market conditions. The [ next ] sales with starts, we have viewed dynamic pricing model, and the Lennar machine Stuart just previewed to continuously find the market clearing price of each of our homes on a community-by-community basis as quickly as possible. We fundamentally believe that our price-to-market strategy reflects our balance sheet for its focus so we can maximize starts and sales, increase market share, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going. To this end, Jon will discuss the operational and cost benefits of maintaining our start base.\nOur second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our price-to-market strategy. During the quarter, our new sales orders increased 1% from the prior year and 26% from the first quarter, with the first and second quarter seasonal change exceeding our historical average over the last 3 years.\nNew orders increased sequentially in each month during the quarter. Our sales pace per community averaged 4.8% in the second quarter, down 4% from the prior year, but up 23% from the first quarter. Our second quarter new sales price decreased 11% from the prior year and was up a slight 1% from the first quarter. Our cancellation rate during the quarter totaled 13.5%, which was a significant improvement from our first quarter. All of these operating comparisons reflected stabilization and normalization across our markets and Lennar's continued focus on using price and incentives to achieve our targeted sales base per community. These results compare very favorably to national reported results and highlight the increase in our market share across our footprint, driven by a carefully crafted starts and sales program. Our sales activity and cancellation rates in the first few weeks of June have been consistent with our second quarter results.\nI'd now like to give you an update on our markets across the country. In prior quarters, I described 3 categories: one, markets that are performing well; two, markets that are performing but require slightly higher pricing adjustments and incentives to maintain our targeted sales. And three, markets that require more aggressive pricing adjustments, incentives and repositioning to regain momentum. In the second quarter, we did not have any of the category 3 markets.\nDuring the second quarter and so far, in June, we've had 14 markets that are performing well. These include Southwest Florida; Southeast Florida; Tampa; Palm Atlantic; New Jersey; Facility Metro Area; Charlotte, Raleigh and Coastal Carolinas; Indianapolis; Dallas and Houston; Phoenix and San Diego. These markets are benefiting from low inventory, and many are benefiting from a strong local economy, employment growth or in migration. New sales in these markets reflect more normalized incentives, which may include closing costs assistance, higher mortgage rate buydown in order to maintain sales momentum.\nIn the second quarter, we had 26 Category 2 markets. While many of these markets have improved relative to the first quarter and are meeting our sales targets, they still require higher pricing adjustments and incentives in our Category 1 markets.\nOur Category 2 markets include Jacksonville, Ocala, Orlando, Gulf Coast, Northern Alabama, Atlanta, Virginia and Maryland, Chicago and Minneapolis, Nashville, Austin, San Antonio, Colorado, Tucson, Las Vegas, Cal Coastal, the Inland Empire, the Bay Area, Central Valley, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Utah, Reno and Boise. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we plan to offer mortgage rate items, base price reductions, closing costs and other incentives to maintain momentum. The size of the adjustment will vary on a community-by-community basis, and that's often been limited to specific homes each week. We've been very proactive and work closely with Lennar mortgage to create highly attractive, cost-efficient and timely financing packages that have enabled us to offer attractive purchase prices for our customers. This hands-on coordination between our sales and mortgage teams has enabled us to sell our homes quickly and avoid building up finished inventory.\nBefore I turn it over to Jon, I'd like to discuss our land-like strategy and community count. Much of our balance sheet and inventory management progress was driven by the execution of our land strategy while simultaneously driving sales, delivery and managing production. Quarter after quarter, we have worked with our strategic land partners and land banks to develop relationships for them to purchase land on our behalf and deliver just-in-time finished home sites to our homebuilding machine on a monthly and quarterly basis.\nIn the second quarter, about 90% of our $1.2 billion land acquisition with finished homesites purchased from various land structures. We continue to make significant progress on our landline strategy. This was evidenced by our second quarter ending years' owned supply of homesites improving to 1.7 years from 2.4 years prior year and our controlled home site percentage increasing to 70% from 60% for the same time period.\nI would like to conclude by discussing community count. Our community count at the end of the second quarter was 1,263 communities, which is up 3% from the prior year period, and we expect to increase our community count in the high single digits by the end of fiscal 2023 from the end of fiscal 2022. As I mentioned last quarter, the bulk of these communities will come online in the fourth quarter.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nPresident & Director, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Rick. As Stuart, Rick discussed, Lennar's operations have continued the steady execution of maintaining our starts and sales pace. Our strategy is to price homes to market so our construction machine can operate smoothly without the disruptions of stopping and restarting. This strategy enabled us to reduce our direct construction cost as expected, delivering gross margin improvement in the quarter. While we achieved some gross margin benefit in Q2 from cost reductions, a greater amount of cost reductions will impact margins equally in Q3 and Q4 based on the timing of when homes were started.\nAs noted, our quarterly starts in sales pace were 5.3 homes and 4.8 homes per community, respectively. Utilizing the Lennar machine, we focus on the orderly selling of homes at the right pace. So homes are sold prior to their completion. This process allowed us to not build up excess finished inventory as we ended the second quarter with approximately 1 inventory home per community, consistent with our Q1 ending inventory level.\nOur strategy of maintaining starts also plays a major role in gaining access to the labor we need and is the foundation for our previously stated objectives of lowering construction cost, reducing cycle time and achieving even flow production. While Lennar's starts were down year-over-year for the first half of '23, industry-wide start levels were down 100% more than Lennar's. We've heard from our trade partners how important it is to them that we have maintained starts in all of our communities in all markets.\nOur production-first strategy has had a dramatic effect on Lennar being the builder of choice for trades. At many of our trade partners, Lennar represents over 70% of their business. These trade partners saw little to no decrease in their work, while at the same time, the industry start levels were contracting by 30%. Looking forward, we will continue to increase our starts and expect Q3 and Q4 starts to both be above 2022 levels.\nLooking at our second quarter. As expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q1 by about 3%. While our Q2 costs were up about 8% on a year-over-year basis, this was down significantly from the 13% year-over-year increase we had in Q1. Again, this is the trajectory of cost reductions we guided to last quarter.\nIn addition to our trade partners stepping up with cost reductions, we also took our value engineering focus to a new level. While we have always value-engineered our plans, we created a dedicated team as part of our national supply chain group to focus on this area. This team works hand-in-hand with our divisions, both in the field and the office to drive cost and constructability efficiencies. Going forward, this team will focus on our core plan strategy.\nRick and I were in Houston last week, attending our Internal Annual National Supply Chain meeting led by Kemp Gillas. There, we saw firsthand how this team has shifted from fighting the battle of supply chain disruptions to achieving the needed cost reductions to offset our sales price reductions. Now this team is looking ahead and is fully engaged in initiatives that will impact our results in 2024 and beyond. This includes programs to structurally offset future cost increase pressures and to implement new technologies to both make the field process more efficient than ever and transform the way we manage information for the bidding process. We can report that there is a great intensity in this team and more focused on innovation than ever before.\nWith respect to the supply chain, the second quarter had the least supply chain disruption since 2020. This was due to the combination of a steep decline in industry-wide starts, along with manufacturers operating at much higher capacities for an extended period, augmented by Lennar's supply chain strategies and communication. The lack of supply chain disruptions helped our continued reduction in supply -- in cycle time. We saw a modest improvement in our second quarter and expect to see a more meaningful improvement in the back half of the year.\nFor the quarter, cycle time decreased by 4 days sequentially from Q1. As we move into our third and fourth quarters, we will benefit from greater cycle time reductions that are the primary driver for our increased guidance and deliveries for 2023. Additionally, we will start about 3,500 homes in Q3 that will -- with reduced cycle time, will allow us to have the appropriate inventory levels to achieve our delivery guidance. The reduction in cycle time in the back half of the year will also free up cash that is otherwise tied in our inventory, further strengthening our balance sheet.\nIn the second quarter, we made meaningful progress in evolving from the production challenges of the supply chain disruptions toward even flow production. While there is still meaningful progress to be made in obtaining even flow production from start to finish, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank all of our construction and purchasing associates for delivering one of the smoothest quarters of closings. All of us at Lennar are focused every single day on lowering cost, reducing cycle time achieving even flow production, enabling improved margins, SG&A efficiencies, a stronger balance sheet and to deliver of high-quality affordable homes.\nI would now like to turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, as usual, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of Financial Services and reemphasize some of our balance sheet accomplishments and then provide some high-level thoughts for Q3.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the second quarter, our Financial Services team had operating earnings of $112 million. Looking at the details of the mortgage and total operations, mortgage operating earnings were $82 million compared to $74 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by a higher profit per loss loans due to higher secondary margins, which was partially offset by lower lost volume.\nTotal operating earnings were $33 million compared to $30 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased, primarily as a result of higher volume and a decrease in cost per transaction as the team continues to focus on gaining efficiencies through technology. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our Homebuilding and Financial Services team as they successfully executed together through this evolving market. They truly operate under the banner of One Lennar.\nSo now turning to the balance sheet. There is a constant drumbeat at Lennar to be laser-focused on returns on invested capital and cash flow. This quarter, we were unwavering in our determination to churn our inventory and generate cash by increasing production as we priced homes to market to deliver as many homes as possible. The drumbeat continued with our determination to preserve cash and increase asset efficiency with a judicious eye towards land spend.\nAs we noted, we spent approximately $1.2 billion on land purchases this quarter, of which approximately 90% were finished homesites, where a vertical construction will soon begin. The results of these strategies is that we ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $6.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity.\nGiven our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we enhanced our goal of becoming land lighter. As we noted, our years owned improved to 1.7 years from 2.4 years in the prior year, and our homesites controls increased to 70% from 68% in the prior year. At quarter end, we owned 117,000 homesites and controls 270,000 homesites, for a total of 387,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio of homesites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way.\nDuring the quarter, we started about 19,700 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 37,300 total homes in inventory, of which about 1,300 were completed unsold as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels.\nConsistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 2 million shares totaling 208 million, [indiscernible] we paid dividends totaling $110 million. As our -- in our continued effort to further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our debt balances, as we noted, we repurchased $158 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in fiscal 2024 at prices below par. We've repaid about $5.6 billion of senior notes over the last several years, which equates to approximately $300 million of interest savings. Combined with strong earnings, our homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio was 13.3% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 17.7% in the prior year.\nAnd then just a few final points on our balance sheet. We remain committed to increasing returns. Our shareholders' equity increased to $25 billion, our book value per share increased to $87, our return on inventory was 28%, and our return on equity was 18%. So in summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through 2023.\nSo with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to our thoughts for the third quarter and provide some ranges of each of the components of earnings as well as a few data points for fiscal 2023.\nStarting with new orders, we expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 18,000 to 19,000 homes as we remain focused on achieving our production goals. We expect our Q3 ending community count to be flat with Q2 ending count. Though, as Rick indicated, we expect to see high single-digit growth year-over-year by the end of our fiscal year on November 30. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 17,750 to 18,250, and we're raising our delivery expectations for the full year to 68,000 to 70,000 homes, which is an increase from the previous guidance of 62,000 to 66,000.\nOur Q3 average sales price should be consistent with Q2 as we continue to be focused on delivering affordable homes. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% as we see continued impact of our cost savings initiatives with some offset for higher land costs as we continue to purchase a greater number of finished homesites.\nI'll note that as is historically the case, we expect our Q4 gross margin to be sequentially higher than Q3, though it is difficult to provide more direction at this time. We expect our Q3 SG&A to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $25 million.\nWe anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. We expect a loss of about $10 million from our Multifamily business and a loss of approximately $20 million for the Lennar Other category. Remember that the Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments as our technology investments -- on our technology to that adjustment will be determined by this stock prices at the end of our quarter.\nWe expect that our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% to 1.5% of total revenue, and our charitable foundation contributions will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.7%, and the weighted average share count should be approximately 284 million shares. So when you pull all that together, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.35 to $3.50 per share for the third quarter.\nAnd with that, let's turn it over to the operator for questions."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm here in Miami and joined by Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEO and Co-President; Jon Jaffe, Co-CEO and Co-President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. There are other executives here with us as well.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to walk through our markets around the country and comment on our land strategy, and then Jon is going to update construction cost, supply chain and cycle time. As usual, Diane will give additional financial highlights and we'll give some rough boundaries, not guidance, just foundries, given volatility in the market for the second quarter to assist in forward thinking and modeling. And then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up, so that we can include as many as possible.\nSo let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're pleased to report that the Lennar team has produced strong and consistent results for the first quarter of what is shaping up to be a complicated and volatile 2023. The quarter started in December with traffic and sales stalled, moving only with incentives and price adjustments. We entered January with interest rates declining and energized customer and improving margins, and then closed out February with rates again rising and challenging consumer confidence, although sales remained relatively strong as adjusted prices, traffic was slowing.\nOf course, the quarter ended and the past couple of weeks have added new issues and questions that are reflective of a market that is looking for a bottom and looking for stability. With the Federal Reserve and Federal Government trying to reconcile the unintended consequences from aggressive interest rate hikes in order to curb the inflation, there is simply no way to see around corners and anticipate with certainty what comes next.\nThis is exactly the kind of volatility that our core operating strategy of maintaining volume using incentives and sales price has been built to endure. With volume and production as are constant and margin as our shock absorber, we manage with certainty through volatility and stay focused on our mission. If market conditions deteriorate, we compromise margin through price and/or incentives, but we generate strong cash flow. If conditions improve, we improved margins and bottom line while also generating strong cash flow. Our primary focus is on cash flow.\nWe maintain our volume to move through the limited legacy land that we have, which is at legacy prices, while keeping our production machine working efficiently and rationalizing costs. And the fact that we are projecting a flattish number of deliveries in 2023 versus 2022 displays the strength of our strategy. Interest rates have continued to be the primary headwind to sales activity as inflation concerns have dominated the Federal Reserve's actions to date.\nAt the same time, the housing supply shortage, especially workforce housing, discussed by every mayor and every governor across the country continues to drive customers to stretch their wallet as incentives and price reductions have worked to meet purchasers half way. Additionally, interest rates have also sidelined the professional or institutional purchasers. Higher capital costs, together with higher capitalization rates, have made the purchase of single-family for rent homes less financially attractive as well.\nWith that said, we still believe that the housing market is beginning to find a point of stabilization and customers, both primary and institutional are coming to grips with the new normal of hire, but acceptable interest rates. The sudden thicker shot of rapidly rising interest rates in 2022 has mellowed. And while net prices are lower, incentives are moderating, cancellations have been normalizing lower and margins have been bottoming as cost reductions are beginning to provide an offset.\nAs I have said many times in the past, the overall housing shortage remains a dominant theme and is defined by a decade-long production deficit in the country after the great recession. This deficit will be exacerbated by a growing reduction in housing starts of both single-family and multifamily homes brought on by the current housing recession. This shortage should be a stabilizing factor for the housing market over time.\nAgainst this backdrop, we've remained steadfast in our adherence to the strategies we adopted as the Fed began its tightening program approximately 1 year ago. As noted, we've continued to focus on selling homes at market clearing prices while building a consistent pace to meet the needs of a supply-constrained housing market. Whether for purchase or for rent, housing shortages are a major concern across the country, as I said, particularly at state and local levels. In spite of higher interest rates driving affordability concerns, more dwellings are needed and our mission is to meet that need.\nIn the first quarter, we saw our margins fall to 21.2%, reflecting sales from prior quarters and adjustments to backlog. While margins fell 360 basis points over the prior quarter and 570 basis points year-over-year, they reflected the use of price reductions and incentives that is closing cost payments and interest rate buy-downs to offset volatile interest rate and market shifts. We used these tools both to sell homes as well as to protect our backlog by adjusting pricing and incentives to ensure closings.\nOur first quarter cancellation rate improved to 21.5%, while this is higher than the 10.2% last year, it is decidedly lower than the 26% last quarter and has been falling in each consecutive month. While our new orders were down some 10% year-over-year, that result has compared favorably to reported market conditions and enabled us to maintain a strong store base that enables us to increase our expected closings for the year to a range of 62,000 to 66,000 homes delivered.\nOn a positive note, very limited new home inventory exists, limited existing home supply exists as existing homeowners hold on to extremely low mortgage rates and very limited multifamily production combined with the chronic housing production shortfall over the past decade and leads the industry in the middle of what we believe will be a fairly short duration correction without an inventory overhang to resolve. These factors will also extend the runway for longer-term housing growth as the correction develops.\nWe derive growing confidence in our ability to achieve sales at the best possible prices from our significant investment in digital marketing, which is more relevant than ever before. We have used our dynamic pricing model in conjunction with our formidable and improving digital marketing platform to continue to drive sales volume at marquee clearing prices in order to maintain consistent production levels.\nOur proprietary digits platform, which we built on a Microsoft backbone provides digital marketing insights and analytics that guide us to better execution while maximizing pricing using our dynamic pricing model. Our digital marketing team and our dynamic pricing team are getting better and better each quarter and they enable us to refine and improve our execution and effectiveness as we accumulate more data and more experience.\nOur second strategy was to work with our trade partners to rightsize our construction -- our cost structure to current market conditions, while we reestablish cycle time at pre supply chain crisis levels. Jon will cover this in great detail shortly, but at a high level, we continue to make meaningful progress with our trade partners as they appreciate our long-term strategy of maintaining consistent production.\nRelative to construction costs, Lennar led the way with reducing -- with a reduction in margin while maintaining volume and increasing market share as the market has corrected. As our margins have now contracted, we are driving cost reduction participation from our trade partners. Our trade partners are working side-by-side with us to reduce costs and to keep the production machine working.\nWhile there continues to be a lag in those reductions coming through our reported numbers, in the back half of the year, cost reductions will improve lagging margins. Cycle time reductions will also come through in the back half of the year. While cycle time has increased slightly this quarter from 211 days to 219 days last quarter, this timing reflects homes that have been in production for almost 8 months.\nWhile we've reviewed the front end of construction for homes that have started more recently, we are seeing a 2-week reduction already coming through, and we know that will improve over the next quarters. Improved cycle time will improve our inventory turn, which now stands at [1.2] and will help reduce inventory as we'll be able to carry less inventory to hit our deliveries and accordingly, we will improve our return on inventory as well.\nOur third articulated strategy was to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions. While Rick will give detail on our land strategy, this has been a specific concentrated area of focus for all 3 of us, myself, Rick and Jon across the platform. We recognized early that land would be expensive relative to reduced prices, and we therefore stopped the bleeding early.\nWhile we reconsidered every land deal in our pipeline, we have walked from deposits or renegotiated terms and price, and we have been relentless in focusing on protecting cash and only purchasing the next strong margin at today's market pricing. We purchased very little land this quarter as we await better pricing that is more in line with current home sale prices. New land purchases in time will improve lagging margins.\nFortunately, we are well positioned with well-structured contracts and shorter-term deal structures that enable our capital allocation to be managed constructively. As with our trade partners, our land partners or sellers understand that we are maintaining volume and increasing market share while taking the first hit to our own margin. They will need to work together with us in cost reduction given lower home sales prices, where we'll just have to move on.\nOur fourth playbook strategy was to manage our operating costs, our SG&A, so that even at lower gross margins, we will drive a strong net margin. We've been driving our SG&A down over the past years quarter-by-quarter to new record lows and many of those changes, though not all, are hardwired into permanent efficiencies in operations.\nIn our first quarter, we were able to marginally improve SG&A to 7.4% from 7.5% last year. And we believe if we continue to drive volume, we'll be able to limit increases and manage to advantageous cost levels. Nevertheless, as average sales prices come down, the percentages won't hold without corresponding additional cuts. We also know that in more difficult times, there will be upward pressure on some of our sales and marketing and realtor costs in order to drive and find purchasers and drive new sales. In this regard, the earlier discussion of our intense focus on our digital marketing platform is critically important in offsetting many of these potential cost increases.\nOur fifth playbook strategy is to maintain tight inventory control. This is exactly what drives cash flow and our cash flow machine, and we're focusing on this part of our business every day. Both land and home inventory control are a core focus of our overall business and leadership team. And in our first quarter numbers, you can see our focus on these elements in our 14.2% debt-to-total capitalization rate, which is down 410 basis points from last year's 18.3%, and our $4.1 billion cash position, together with our $2.6 billion undrawn revolver, which together provides excellent liquidity and flexibility.\nTight control of land and completed home inventory has enabled cash flow, so that our net debt to total capital is actually negative at this point. Inventory management is most carefully reviewed and as the most carefully reviewed and managed part of our business, it enables us to maintain an extremely low inventory of completed not sold homes, which are consistently -- which have been -- consistently been at or under 1 home per community for the past years. And right now, we have approximately 13,00 unsold and completed homes.\nWe are well aware that inventory has remained flat as opposed to lower year-over-year as one might expect, because of expanded cycle time due to the supply chain disruption. We also know that this inefficiency will correct over the next few quarters and will return approximately $1.5 billion of inventory and turn it into additional cash. Additionally, a pause in growth this year will reduce inventory and generate additional cash over the next year as well.\nThe sixth strategy is to continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. With our balance sheet strong, we are able to complement our strong operational execution with stock repurchases and debt reductions that improve total shareholder returns and return on equity. As we continue to execute our strategies, we will continue to drive strong cash flow and bottom line profitability. And even though bottom line profitability will be compressed year-over-year as prices and margins are impacted in a correcting market, our balance sheet and our cash position will continue to improve. This improvement enables the flexibility to be opportunistic as market conditions stabilize.\nFinally, we have added an additional strategy, an additional core strategy since last quarter end. This is a strategy of continuous improvement focus throughout the company. Although it seems obvious and perhaps a little trite, we have created a central focus on continuous improvement metrics for every leader in our company with a direct tie to performance measurement and bonus structure.\nLast year, we recruited a new CHRO with specific expertise in this area, and we've developed a determined and constructive program of engagement and measurement across our platform. Welcome aboard, Drew Holler. Now that he has been with us for about 6 months, I wanted to formally welcome Drew to the company on our earnings call and let him know formally that we, meaning me, Rick, Jon and all of our shareholders expect really exciting improvements that will help Lennar continue to reach higher and drive harder to be the best version of ourselves.\nSo in conclusion, it seems that the homebuilding industry has been skating on a very thin edge between some very strong headwinds and some equally strong tailwinds that have required careful navigation and refined adjustment along the way. The headwinds have been defined by federal reserve-driven interest rate increases driven by stubbornly high inflation. The consumer has attempted to adjust. The tailwinds have been defined by housing shortages across the country as well as production deficits over the past decade. And while the consumer remains challenged by affordability concerns, they are adjusting to the new normal of higher interest rates and opting to purchase their home.\nIn these extraordinarily difficult and volatile market conditions, the Lennar team has focused on strategy, and we have executed with precision. We ended the first quarter with stronger-than-expected revenues and closings, strong profitability and cash flow, a fortified balance sheet and strong liquidity. We have a plan of execution to continue to navigate the uncertainties of 2023 with a focus on maintaining volume, maximizing margin, managing inventories, driving cash flow, managing land and land spend and further enhancing our balance sheet in spite of the challenging market conditions.\nAccordingly, we are not guiding, but giving some broad boundaries for our second quarter closing to between 15,000 and 16,000 homes with a gross margin we expect between 21% and 21.5%. Additionally, we are targeting delivery volume for the full year to be between 62,000 and 66,000 homes as we drive volume and pick up market share and build margins back up through reconciliation of construction and land costs while carefully managing SG&A. While we're prepared for volatility and adversity along the way, we will stick to our focus on our core operating strategies in order to perform as expected. Simply put, that's what we expect of ourselves and we hope in the process, we will continue to earn your trust and respect. Thank you.\nAnd with that, let me turn over to Rick, who's going to walk through a review of our market conditions across the platform.\n\nRichard Beckwitt\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the overall housing market has continued to be impacted by higher mortgage rates, which has impacted affordability and homebuyer confidence. While some of our markets are performing well, in most of our markets, we've had to adjust base prices, increased incentives and/or provide mortgage by rate buydowns, maintain or regain our targeted sales base. Our strategy has been to maintain our targeted sales base, continue to sell homes and adjust our pricing to reflect market conditions.\nWith this strategy, we have sacrificed gross margins to generate sales. Mass sales of starts, we've used our dynamic pricing model to continuously find the market clearing price for each of our homes on a community by community basis as quickly as possible. We fundamentally believe that our price to market strategy, reflects our balance sheet first focus where we can maintain starts and sales, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going. To this end, Jon will discuss the operational and cost benefits of maintaining our start base.\nOur first quarter reflects first quarter results reflect the successful execution of our price to market strategy. During the first quarter, our new sales orders declined 10% from the prior year. These results, as Stuart mentioned, compare very favorably to competitor and nationally reported results. We did see improvement during the first quarter as new sales orders increased sequentially from the fourth quarter and in each month of the first quarter with our February 2023 sales pace per community totaling 4.7 sales, just 0.1 sales lower than our sales pace in February 2022.\nOur cancellation rate also declined from 26% in the fourth quarter to 21% in the first quarter with sequential improvement in each month of the quarter. In fact, our cancellation rate in February was 14%, much below our normalized cancellation rate. Our cancellation rates have benefited from the flawless execution of our financial services group in both finding the right mortgage product and locking mortgages with our home buyers. Our new order sales price in the first quarter totaled 452,000, up 8% from the fourth quarter with mix primarily pushing our average sales price higher.\nSequentially, we saw a slight improvement and a reduction in our incentives, which was partially offset by lower base prices. We've been able to achieve small sequential monthly reductions in incentives during our first quarter without impacting sales pace. This trend has continued into the first 2 weeks of March. Notwithstanding the spike in interest rates in late February and continuing into the first 2 weeks of March, our sales and cancellation rates have maintained and we feel we have established market pricing and sales pace stability across our footprint.\nNow I'd like to give you an update on our markets across the country. In prior quarters, I had 3 categories: one, markets that are performing well; two, markets where we've adjusted pricing and incentives found the market price and have successfully regained sales momentum, and three, markets that require additional pricing adjustments incentives and focus to regain our targeted absorption phase. While our strategy has resulted in lower gross margins across the platform, the good news is that for now, we have no Category 3 markets.\nDuring the first quarter and so far in March, we had 10 markets that are performing well, either Southeast Florida, Southwest Florida, Tampa, Palm Atlantic, New Jersey, Filling Metro, Charlotte, Coastal Carolinas, Indi and San Diego. These markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory and many are benefiting from strong local economy, employment growth and migration. While these markets have continued to perform well, we have had to selectively offer mortgage buydown programs and normalized sales incentives. Some communities in these markets have required targeted price adjustments, but those are in a rare case.\nOur Category 2 markets, which reflect markets where we've made more significant adjustments and have successfully regained sales momentum include 29 markets. These include Jacksonville Ocala, Orlando, Gulf Coast, Northern Alabama, Atlanta, Raleigh, Virginia and Maryland, Chicago, Minnesota and Nashville, all the markets in Texas, including Austin, Colorado, Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas and the rest of California, Pacific Northwest, including Portland and Seattle, Utah, Reno and Boise. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we have had to offer more aggressive financing programs, base price reductions and/or increased incentives to regain sales momentum.\nSize of the adjustments is varied on a community-to-community basis and has often been limited to specific homes each week. In some cases, to avoid cancellations, we've adjusted pricing on our homes and backlog. We've been very proactive with our pricing and not reactive. This has allowed us to sell homes and avoid building up finished inventory. In all of our Category 2 markets, we have seen base prices stabilize. In a handful of our category 2 markets, we've been able to increase our net sales price primarily by reducing incentives and to a lesser extent, by raising base prices.\nMarkets remain very fluid, and we're making proactive strategic decisions and adjustments every day. As Stuart said, we're committed as a management team to address any future market changes quickly. As we said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine going, maintain our sales and start pace and price our homes to market. This is our balance sheet first focus.\nBefore I turn it over to Jon, I'd like to discuss our land-light strategy and community count. Much of our balance sheet and inventory management progress was driven by the execution of our land strategy while simultaneously driving sales, delivery and managing production. Quarter after quarter, we've worked with our strategic land partners and land banks to develop relationships for them to purchase land on our behalf and deliver just-in-time finished homesites to our homebuilding machine on a monthly and quarterly basis.\nIn the first quarter, about 90% of our 12,000 home sites were purchased for finished homesites from our various land structure. We have continued to make significant progress on our land-light strategy. This was evidenced at the end of our first quarter, our year supply of owned homesites improving to 1.9 years from 2.7 years. And our controlled home site percentage increasing to 68% from 63% year-over-year.\nWe've also focused on increasing our community count to drive future growth. Our community count increased 1% to 12,017 communities at the end of the first quarter from the year ago period, and we expect to increase our community count in the high single digits from the first quarter by the end of the fiscal year. Given our development time lines, the bulk of these communities will come on in our fourth quarter.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThank you, Rick. You've heard from Stuart and Rick how we remain focused on finding market community by community to maintain sales pace. Accordingly, this does enable Lennar to keep our production machine moving forward with starts. We continue with our stated construction strategy of being a production-first homebuilder, keeping starts consistent and then matching the sales pace to establish start space to effectively manage inventory. This resulted in ending our first quarter with only about 1 inventory home per community.\nTo remind you, our construction playbook has 3 primary areas of focus: lowering construction costs, reducing cycle time and achieving even flow production. By executing this playbook, we believe we can maximize financial results in all market conditions. Let me address each area.\nAs we noted last quarter, the speed of change in market conditions has caused a sharp reduction in industry-wide starts and permits. This is evidenced in the nationally reported starts and permit activity over the last 3 months, with November, December and January starts down year-over-year at 34%, 27% and 27%, while permits were down 30%, 35% and 40%, respectively, in the same year-over-year period. Declining starts and the drop in permits, which are a proxy for a further drop in future starts as already and will continue to free up the availability of labor and material.\nLooking at our first quarter. As expected, construction costs fell sequentially from Q4 by about 1%. This was driven primarily by the reduction in lumber costs from last summer, flowing through our deliveries, partially offset by the increases in cost in most other categories. Year-over-year construction costs rose by almost 13%, reflecting the elevated cost environment for home constructions -- for homes started in 2022 versus 2021. Importantly, in our first quarter, we continue to make progress working with our trade partners to reduce the cost of labor and materials. Additionally, we have now evaluated all of our product lines for appropriate specification changes and we maintain an ongoing value engineering review process across all of our divisions.\nAs I have already noted, there's been a significant slowdown in starts and permits in the industry, and our trade partners feel this firsthand. We continuously meet with them to communicate our strategy of maintaining our start space, which they greatly appreciate. They also understand the steps we have taken in sacrifice the margin in order to keep our sales pace and to support our volume.\nIn churn, they have partnered with us to lower our construction costs as they know we are helping to keep them in their businesses financially stable. They understand the mission, they're on board to help us make it happen. We expect to start seeing these savings begin to flow through our second quarter closings, which are factored into our margin guidance.\nLast quarter, I communicated we had identified about $14,000 per home and construction cost savings which will flow through our closings in the back half of the year. We have now contracted these cost savings and continue to make progress on identifying additional savings, while at the same time managing through an environment where certain material costs are impacted by inflationary pressures. Potential future headwind to cost savings is lumber.\nAs the combination of reduced supply from the mills and minimal inventory quantities throughout the distribution channels sets up for the potential for a small price rally in lumber over the next few months. At this time, we are comfortable in reaffirming at least $14,000 per home in savings, which will serve us well should loan prices come under further pressure again.\nSecond time is the second area of focus for our construction strategy. As Stuart noted, our closings in the first quarter saw extended cycle times as those homes were impacted by the supply chain challenges in the second half of 2022. For the quarter, cycling time increased 14 days and 8 days year-over-year and sequentially, respectively. As we move into the second quarter and beyond, we will continue to close more of the home started last year, which were heavily impacted by supply chain disruptions, eliminating those longer duration of homes from our inventory. Our second time will also benefit from the greater availability of material and labor due to the significant reduction in housing starts.\nAs we've previously discussed, our overall cycle time increased about 2 months from pre pandemic conditions. The bulk of this affected the front end of construction as there are fewer opportunities to build out a sequence at the front end as compared to the back end. For example, we can't put on the roof without the wall, but we can install sorters throughout the windows. There has been significant improvement in recapturing on time at the front end.\nBy the end of our first quarter, we have reduced front-end cycle time by over 2 weeks from (inaudible). Currently, we are on a pace of improving cycle time by a few days each week. We will have to wait and see how long this trend can be maintained or potentially even approve the fund. This will depend on some lingering supply chain issues such as transformers, labor remaining in the workforce as start decline and appropriate staffing levels at municipalities. Reducing our cycle time over the next few quarters will free up a significant amount of cash that is tied up in our inventory, further strengthening our balance sheet.\nThe third area of focus is even flow production. Prior to the pandemic and its related supply chain disruptions, even flow production was a core focus for us. Even flow properly executed with consistent completions throughout the month and quarter. Consistent starts and completions allowed both Lennar and our trade partners to be staffed for the average versus the peaks and avoiding efficiencies at the valleys. This drives fuel and G&A efficiencies for both the trade and Lennar.\nWhile we are not there yet, as we look forward at our planned deliveries for each month of the second quarter, we can start to see a return to even flow. These strategies are an intense focus, everyday focus of the entire company. Everyone at Lennar involved in operations and purchasing are focused on every single day on lowering cost, reducing cycle times and achieving even flow production.\nI would now like to turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVP, CFO & Treasurer, Lennar Corporation\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services and Lennar Other segments in our balance sheet and then provide high-level boundaries for Q2 2023.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the first quarter, our financial services team produced operating earnings of $78 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $59 million compared to $67 million in the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower loss volume, primarily as a result of the decline in the average sales price of our homes.\nTitle operating earnings were $23 million compared to $21 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and the decrease in cost per transaction as the team continues to achieve efficiencies through technology. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our homebuilding and financial services teams as they successfully executed together through this challenging market.\nSo then looking at our Lennar Other Segment. For the first quarter, this segment had an operating loss of $41 million. The loss was primarily the result of noncash mark-to-market losses on our publicly traded technology investments, which totaled $24 million.\nAnd then turning to our balance sheet. There is a constant drumbeat at Lennar to be laser-focused on returns and on cash flow. This quarter, we were unwavering with our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by pricing homes to market to deliver as many homes as possible. The drumbeat continued with our determination to preserve cash and increase asset efficiency by continuing to be judicious about land purchases, acquiring primarily finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin.\nThe results of these steadfast strategies was that we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, as we've noted. This provided a total of approximately $6.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity.\nGiven our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we enhanced our goal of becoming land lighter. At quarter end, we owned 125,000 homesites and controls 264,000 homesites for a total of 389,000 homesites. Our years own improved to 1.9 years from 2.7 years in the prior year, and our homesites controlled increased to 68% from 63% in the prior year. We believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way.\nDuring the quarter, we started about 13,300 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 36,500 total homes in inventory, of which about 1,300 were completed unsold as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 2 million shares totaling about $189 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $108 million.\nAnd then looking at our debt maturity profile, our next senior note maturity is $400 million, which is due in fiscal 2024. We continue to benefit from our paydown of debt. You may recall that we've repaid about $5.4 billion of senior notes, which equates to about $300 million in interest savings. Combined with strong earnings, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 14.2% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which was an improvement from 18.3% in the prior year.\nAnd just a few final points on our balance sheet. We remain committed to increasing shareholder returns. Our stockholders' equity increased to $24 billion. Our book value per share increased to over $84, our return on inventory was approximately 31% and our return on equity was approximately 21%.\nIn summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence in financial flexibility as we move through 2023. And with that brief overview, I'd like to turn our thoughts to Q2. It continues to be difficult to issue the targeted guidance that we have historically provided given the volatility in market conditions. So as Stuart mentioned, and as we did last quarter, we're providing very broad ranges to give some boundaries for each of the components of our second quarter.\nSo let's start with new orders. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 17,000 homes and expect our Q2 ending community count to be flat to slightly up year-over-year. We anticipate our Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 15,000 to 16,000 homes, and our Q2 average sales price should be in the range of $435,000 to $445,000 as we continue to price to market. We expect gross margins to be in the range of 21% to 21.5% and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 7.2% and 7.4%.\nAnd for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $10 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings for Q2 to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million, and we expect a loss of about $20 million for each of our multifamily business and the Lennar Other category, the Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter.\nExpect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.6% to 1.7% of total revenues, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 286 million shares. And so when you pull all that together, these estimates should produce an EPS range between $2.10 to $2.55 per share for the second quarter.\nFinally, once again, given market volatility, we're providing boundaries for deliveries only first full year 2023 as we did last quarter, as Stuart mentioned, this delivery range should be 62,000 to 66,000, which is an increase of our previous range of 60,000 to 65,000. We look forward to giving you another update on our next earnings call.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the briefing of the forward-looking statement.\n\nAlexandra Lumpkin\n\nAssociate General Counsel, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\nOperator\n\nI would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, I'm here in Miami, joined by Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from. Jon Jaffe and Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEOs and Co-Presidents, are on the line also, but they will be participating remotely for the Q&A.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro overview and strategic Lennar plan. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about our markets around the country. Jon will update on supply chain, construction costs, land strategy. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight. And we'll give some rough boundaries for the fourth quarter to assist in go-forward thinking and modeling. And then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit to one question and one followup.\nSo let me begin and start by saying that once again, the Lennar team has turned in an excellent third quarter results, which continues to enhance our positioning for the evolving market conditions. Throughout our third quarter, we continue to manage the still constrained supply chain and workforce and delivered over 17,200 homes with a gross margin of 29.2% and a net margin of 23.5%.\nThese deliveries continue to drive very strong cash flow and bottom line earnings as we continue to refine our already efficient operations with SG&A of 5.8% or a 120 basis point improvement over last year. With strong bottom line earnings of $1.47 billion or $5.03 per diluted share driving strong cash flow, we've continued to fortify our balance sheet. After paying down $575 million of maturing senior debt without replacement, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, nothing drawn on our revolver and a 15% debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to 21.2% last year.\nAs a matter of careful capital allocation this quarter, given current market conditions, we chose not to repurchase stock in favor of early retirement of debt. As we've continued to drive strong closings and performance, we are well prepared to handle the current market conditions. In addition to the well-documented supply chain constraints and limited workforce slowing production, housing has now been considerably impacted by the more than doubling of mortgage rates over the past months and therefore, the doubling of monthly payment costs and reduction of housing affordability.\nThe housing market has continued to weaken as expected in response to the Fed's too late but now very rapid and aggressive reaction to inflation. Homebuilding finds itself once again at the forefront of all that is happening in the economy, and the Fed's use of its interest rate tool to curtail inflation is certainly having the desired effect on the for-sale housing market.\nThe market is now adjusting. The interest rate movements were very sudden and adjusted very quickly, and that suddenness has always led to a pullback in housing demand. Part of the pullback is driven by simple affordability, and part of the pullback is driven by the psychology of the sudden and aggressive interest rate hike causing either monthly payments figure shock or a sense of having missed the boat.\nThe Fed Chair's additional increase of 75 basis points of the Fed funds rate yesterday, together with an articulated determination to do more, suggests that even more challenges lie ahead. While demand has cooled at once high price -- at once high pricing level, demand for shelter still exists where price intersects with current interest rates to produce an affordable monthly payment.\nThere is still a housing shortage across the country, especially workforce housing, and household formation has continued to rise. There's still very limited inventory, and there's very little exposure to traditional inventory overhangs like foreclosures and speculators.\nAdditionally, buyers are still seeking shelter from inflationary pressures on rentals as scarce rentals and increased demand from those who would otherwise purchase drive and keep rents higher. As we bring prices down and incentives up, demand is still there. And these fundamentals give us assurance that while there is short- and medium-term reconciliation, the long-term prospects for housing continue to be strong.\nDemand remains reasonably strong at adjusted prices as buyers still have jobs as well as down payments and have attractive credit scores and can qualify. With higher rates, prices must be adjusted downward in incentives used to find the market or sales just drop off.\nAccordingly, we have carefully managed sales price and/or pace through the third quarter exactly as we said we would last quarter. Although our sales are down 12% from last year's levels, we have focused our management's attention on finding pricing levels that attract demand.\nEach market is different. In as much as it is an art and not a science, our efforts have slightly lagged our goal of matching our sales pace with our start pace, but we feel certain that we will find pricing and accelerate that pace in the near future.\nIn a few minutes, Rick is going to give a more detailed overall market review that will give a more comprehensive snapshot of what we've seen in our markets across the country. Along with bringing home sales price down, we are also laser-focused on bringing down production costs as well. We are working with our vast network of trade partners to recognize that the world has changed, and we all have to work together to keep the machine working.\nIn fact, last night, I returned from a 2-day extraordinary supply chain conference that was hosted by our purchasing leadership group, led by Kemp Gillis. Trade partners and Lennar division leaders convened to work together to attack costs, find efficiencies and adjust to current market conditions. Rick and Jon will drive continued and focused attention on this critical initiative.\nAnd as the market recalibrates, land costs will have to adjust as well. Accordingly, we are reviewing and re-underwriting every land deal in our pipeline to the current market conditions. In time, new land deals will have different pricing that will be properly sized to the home sales prices.\nOverall, these are the trends as we see them. And while we can choose to fight against the trends, the reality is that the market has been changing, and we are getting ahead of it by making all necessary adjustments.\nLast quarter, we laid out our simple strategy playbook going forward. Let me review and add a few items. We're going to keep it simple and focused and adhere to this core strategy.\nFirst, as I said last quarter, we're going to continue to sell homes, adjust pricing to market conditions and maintain reasonable volume. We have discussed over the past years that we have a strong -- that we have a housing shortage across the country. We will continue to build even as prices adjust in order to fill that shortfall and provide much-needed workforce housing.\nAs we have noted many times in the past, whether the market is improving or declining, we employ our dynamic pricing model week by week to price product to current market conditions in order to maximize pricing and margin while we maintain a very carefully and limited inventory level. As the market moves, that is how we will continue to be responsive.\nSecond, we are going to work with our trade partners, as I've said, to rightsize our cost structure to current market conditions as well.\nThird, we will and have sharpened our attention on land acquisitions. We are being extremely selective on new land acquisitions and new communities. We have rereviewed and re-underwritten every land deal in our pipeline, and we are re-underwriting to current market conditions.\nCapital allocation is being micromanaged as every dollar invested in land must compete against repurchasing our own stock as we seek to maximize total shareholder value and return. In sync with selling homes, we will continue to improve our cost of doing business by focusing on and reducing SG&A. We have seen quarter-over-quarter improvement in our SG&A over the past years. And we expect to drive efficiencies through technology and process improvement to offset market adjustments where possible while we leverage our extraordinary management team across the country.\nNext, we will maintain tight inventory control. We are aware that our inventory levels are up 20% year-over-year. This increase is mostly a function of growth, supply chain dysfunction and expanded cycle time. As our growth rate is reduced to 0 and our cycle times revert to normal, our inventory should shrink and should generate sizable cash flow in the future. Our commitment to sales pace will ensure that we will not create standing inventory in its place.\nNext, we'll continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. And finally, we will conclude our long-planned and awaited spin-off by year-end. Recent back-and-forth questions with the SEC could push the final date by a month or so, but Quarterra will be listed very soon. Of course, prior to the spin, we will have a comprehensive company overview and conference call to introduce the new management team and to further detail the financial elements of the company. Stay tuned.\nAs we have continued to refine and finalize the 3 verticals of our spin company, we will spin a mature asset management company into the public market along with billions of dollars of assets under management that we previously held on Lennar's books. Lennar will be a pure-play homebuilding company with a simple mandate to build and sell homes that delight our customers while we drive and maximize shareholder value.\nThe final spin of our new company, Quarterra, will trade under the stock symbol Q, and we'll have, as noted before, it will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. We are very excited about the prospects for Quarterra as this is our second spin in our history, and we have great confidence for its prospects for the future.\nSo let me conclude by saying that while the market is shifting and adjusting to a new higher interest rate environment, we at Lennar are prepared. We have been here before, and we have navigated adversity.\nWe have a seasoned team that knows exactly what to do and how to do it. Every member of the Lennar management team is fully aligned and working in a coordinated way. We are extremely well positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and to succeed in these conditions.\nWe recognize that interest rates are rising, inflation continues to be a legitimate threat and important parts of the economy are slowing. We know that the Fed is determined to curtail inflation, and this will take some time. But we also know how to adjust to the market -- to these market changes, and we are making those adjustments.\nAs we look to the remainder of 2022, we recognize there are challenges in the market that we must carefully regard, expect that we will meet the challenges and that we will continue to adjust to maximize opportunity and drive Lennar into an ever better future.\nWith that, let me turn over to Rick.\n\nRichard Beckwitt\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the overall housing market has been reacting to significant increases in mortgage rates, continued inflation and a volatile stock market, all of which has impacted affordability and homebuyer confidence. While we continue to have some strong markets, in our more challenging areas, we've had to adjust prices and increase incentives to regain sales momentum.\nOur sales strategy has been to find the market clearing price for each of our homes on a community-by-community basis as quickly as possible and price our homes accordingly. This has required a detailed understanding of traffic trends, inventory levels, community and product-specific pricing, financing programs and buyer sentiment.\nDuring the third quarter, our new sales orders declined by 12% from the prior year on a 1% lower year-over-year community count. While our cancellation rate and sales incentives picked up during the quarter, our sales orders and sales pace per community increased sequentially each month as we successfully executed our pricing strategy in more and more markets.\nTo put some color on this, our sales pace per community in June, July and August was 3.7, 3.9 and 4.5, respectively for the quarter. To achieve this, we lowered our base new order sales price and increased sales incentives in many communities.\nOn a company-wide basis, new sales order incentives increased during the quarter from 2.3% in June to 6% in August and varied significantly by market and community. Based on these combined adjustments, our new net order sales price declined 9% sequentially from the second quarter but was up 1% from the prior year.\nThis pricing strategy produced enough new gross sales to offset cancellations company-wide as our third quarter cancellation rate was 21%, which is slightly above our historical average. Our pricing strategy has continued to work successfully in September. It gives us confidence in our new sales orders guidance for the fourth quarter.\nWe fundamentally believe that this price to market strategy reflects our balance sheet first of focus, where we can maintain starts in sales, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going.\nI'd now like to give you an update on our markets across the country. It really fall into 3 categories: one, markets that have continued to perform well; two, markets where we have adjusted pricing and incentives, found the market price and have successfully regained sales momentum; and three, markets that may require some additional pricing adjustments to regain our targeted absorption base.\nDuring the third quarter and so far in September, we have had 9 markets that continue to perform well. These are Southwest Florida, Southeast Florida, Palm Atlantic, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Charlotte, Indianapolis and San Diego.\nThese markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory. And many are benefiting from a strong local economy, employment growth and in-migration. While these markets have continued to be strong, we have had to offer mortgage buydown programs and normalize incentives to maintain sales momentum. Some communities in these markets have required targeted price adjustments on a limited basis.\nOur category 2 markets, which reflect markets where we have made more significant adjustments to regain sales momentum, include 22 markets. These are Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, Coastal Carolinas, Atlanta, Chicago and Nashville, Raleigh, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, Colorado, Coastal California, Coastal Carolinas, Inland Empire, Bay Area, the Central Valley, Sacramento, Seattle and Portland.\nEach of these markets' traffic has slowed, and we saw a pickup in cancellations. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we've had to offer more aggressive financing programs, base price reductions and/or increased incentives to regain sales momentum.\nSize of the adjustments has varied on a community-by-community basis and has often been limited to specific homes each week -- in each community each week. In some cases, to avoid cancellations, we have adjusted pricing on our homes in backlog. We believe we are being very proactive with our pricing and not reactive. This has allowed us to sell homes and avoid building finished inventory. We are outselling the competition and are increasing our market share.\nCategory 3 markets, which reflect more significant market softening and correction, include 7 markets. These are the Philly Metro area, Minnesota, Pensacola, Austin, Reno, Boise and Utah. While the drivers and individual dynamics of these markets are varied somewhat, traffic has slowed significantly.\nBuyers are taking more time to make a purchase decision, and many need to be convinced that now is the time to buy. There is fear that sales prices have not hit bottom, which has led to an elevated level of cancellations.\nIn these markets, we are focused on establishing pricing that generates new gross sales to offset cancellations. This has required us to work in many cases with backlog to prevent cancellations. It has also required a mix of significant base price adjustments, sales incentives and aggressive mortgage buydowns.\nWhile we've made progress in these markets, we still need to make some adjustments on a community-by-community basis. There's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Everything needs to be fine-tuned to the specifics of the market and community.\nI'm confident that we'll make progress in each of these markets in the fourth quarter. We're fortunate to have solid gross margins and limited completed unsold inventory, so we should be able to get these markets on track shortly.\nI hope this gives you a better picture of our markets across the country and what we're doing to keep our sales activity going. Markets remain very fluid, and we are making proactive strategic decisions and adjustments every day.\nWe are committed as a management team to address any future market changes quickly. As we've said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine going, maintain our starts pace and price our homes to market. This is our balance sheet focus.\nBefore I turn it over to Jon, I'd like to thank all of our trade partners and associates for their hard work and endless dedication during these rapidly changing times to successfully execute our operating strategies. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick. This morning, I will discuss our sales and inventory management focus, our land strategy and give an update on the status of the supply chain. I'd like to start by laying out a few additional thoughts on the detail that Rick just walked you through.\nAs discussed, this quarter was all about the daily process of adjusting home prices to find market clearing values in each individual community. As noted, our starts and sales pace for the quarter were 4.4 homes and 4.0 homes, respectively. This gap between starts pace and sales pace comes from the time it takes to make the pricing adjustments necessary to be perceived as value by the consumer finding that value proposition is a process that takes several weeks and is ongoing.\nIn other words, once market pricing is found through discovery, the market often experiences further adjustments, and a new value proposition must be discovered.\nAs we went through the process of finding clearing prices in communities, this informed our decision-making, which enabled broader pricing adjustments, leading to our improved sales pace across our entire platform for the month of August.\nAs Stuart noted, our operators use our dynamic pricing model to help them understand the timing of inventory as it moves through the construction process. This tool gives us visibility into sales pace and associated pricing by community and even by plan, allowing us to maintain our starts pace without building up excess inventory. Our inventory position at the end of the quarter was just over 500 completed unsold homes or 0.4 homes per community.\nNext, I want to discuss our land focus in the third quarter. As expected, we focused a lot of attention on reassessing every land deal in our pipeline along with updating our underwriting. Based on our intense review, we move forward only on those deals with starts in 2023 and where we were also confident in the updated financial underwriting.\nMost of the land deals we closed on in the quarter came from our strong land relationships with existing structured quarterly takedowns. These takedowns are deals where we would be starting the homes quickly and still projected healthy margins. All other deals based on the updated underwriting either had its timing delayed, was restructured or we did not proceed.\nOur intensified focus on our land-light strategy was evidenced by our controlled home site percentage increasing to 63% at the end of the third quarter, up from 53% last year. We also further reduced the years of owned home sites to 2.9 years at the end of the third quarter, down from 3.3 years last year. And we reduced the number of home sites purchased in the third quarter to about 13,100, down 21% and 25% year-over-year and sequentially, respectively.\nOur extreme focus on a deal-by-deal review and adherence to our disciplined land lighter model drove the significant improvement in the strength of Lennar's balance sheet, as Stuart discussed.\nNow I'd like to turn to the current state of the supply chain. Our third quarter continued presenting some favorable cycle time results while still dealing with ongoing disruptions from certain material shortages. Although it was minor, it's still significant that we achieved a 3-day reduction in cycle time in Q3 from Q2.\nAdditionally, over 50% of our markets experienced cycle time reductions in the third quarter compared to 25% in the second quarter. The primary material disruption in the third quarter was related to the delivery of electrical equipment such as switchgear, multimeter boxes and pad-mounted transformers.\nConstruction labor remains very tight as industry-wide high levels of volume for second half deliveries moves through the various stages of construction. We expect to start seeing some easing in labor as the overall industry reduces the level of construction starts. This easing should start to first occur in the fourth quarter with front-end trades and in the first quarter with finished trades.\nAs expected, cost increased in our third quarter as increases from lumber that spiked in Q1 flowed through our third quarter closings. We also saw increases in other material costs and labor in Q3 closings, resulting in a total direct construction cost increase of 6% and 21% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively. As a reminder, the drop in lumber prices we saw earlier in the year materially benefited the cost of our starts in the third quarter and will flow through deliveries in the first half of 2023.\nThank you, and I'll now turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVP, CFO & Treasurer, Lennar Corporation\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments in our balance sheet and then turn to Q4 guidance.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our Financial Services team produced operating earnings of $99 million, excluding the recording of a onetime litigation pool.\nAnd then looking at the details, our mortgage operating earnings was $64 million compared to $80 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market continues to be extraordinarily competitive for purchase business. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. This decrease in earnings was partially offset by an increase in interest rate lock commitments.\nTotal operating earnings were $33 million compared to $26 million in the prior year. Final earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volumes and an increase in revenue per transaction. Our Financial Services team continues to rise to the occasion each and every quarter to assist our homebuilder divisions and properly service our customers.\nAnd then turning to the Lennar Other segment. For the third quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $118 million. This loss was primarily the result of a noncash mark-to-market loss on our publicly traded technology investments, which totaled $86 million.\nAs we've mentioned before, we are required to mark to market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, we believe these technology partnerships provide significant operational efficiencies for both our Homebuilding and Financial Services platform and greatly improve our customers' experience.\nAnd then looking at our balance sheet quickly. As you've heard all of us mention this quarter, we were laser-focused on managing our balance sheet. We focused on generating cash by pricing to market, and we focused on preserving cash by monitoring our stock space and carefully reviewing potential land purchases.\nThe end result, as you've heard us say, is that we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity.\nDuring the quarter, we continued our progress of becoming land lighter. At quarter end, we owned 184,000 home sites and controlled 307,000 home sites for a total of 491,000 home sites. This translates into 2.9 years of home sites owned, an improvement from 3.3 years in the prior year and 63% home sites controlled, an improvement from 53% in the prior year.\nMost important, though, we believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow our market share. Additionally, we continue to delever our balance sheet as we repaid $575 million of senior notes that were due in November of this year, and we have no additional maturities in fiscal 2023.\nIn the last several years, we have repaid $5.4 billion of senior notes with an associated annual interest savings of almost $300 million. A continued paydown of senior notes and continued strong generation of earnings brought our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio down to 15% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 21.2% in the prior year.\nOur stockholders' equity increased to $23 billion. Our book value per share increased to almost $79. Our return on inventory was 32.7%, and our return on equity was 21%.\nFinally, we received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter. Our credit rating was increased from Baa3 to Baa2. We greatly appreciate Moody's confidence in our company and continue to be very pleased to have an investment-grade rating from all 3 agencies.\nIn summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant confidence and financial flexibility to navigate this uncertain market.\nWith that brief overview, I'd like to turn to guidance. As Stuart mentioned, it continues to be difficult to provide the targeted guidance that we have historically provided, given the uncertainty in market conditions. So as we did last quarter, we are providing very broad ranges to give some boundaries for each of the components.\nSo let's start with new orders. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 14,000 to 15,500, and we expect our Q4 ending community count to increase about 5% from Q3. We anticipate our Q4 deliveries will be in the range of 20,000 to 21,000 homes. Our average sales price should be in the range of $475,000 to $480,000.\nOur gross margin is in the range of 26% to 27%, and our SG&A between 5.7% and 5.9% as we continue to price to market, turn our inventory and generate cash. For the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, including noncontrolling interest, we expect a loss of approximately $15 million.\nWe anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q4 will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million as market competition for purchased business continues to increase. We expect earnings of $15 million to $20 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss of about $20 million.\nThis guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.2% of total revenue, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery.\nWe expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 288 million shares. And so when you follow this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.65 to $5.30 per share for the fourth quarter.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.\n\nAlexandra Lumpkin\n\nAssociate General Counsel, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nVery good. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm here in Miami, and I'm joined by Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, CEO of our Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from.\nAs usual, I will give a macro and strategic overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about our markets around the country. Jon will update our land program, and supply chain and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight. And as noted in our press release, give some very limited boundaries to assist in go-forward thinking and modeling. And then, of course, we'll answer as many questions as we can. (Operator Instructions)\nSo let me begin and start by saying that we're very pleased to announce another hard fought and well-executed quarterly performance by the associates of Lennar. Throughout our second quarter, we continue to sell homes and still offset higher land, labor and material costs. Our gross margin, as reported, was 29.5%, net margin was 23.4%. They continue to drive very strong cash flow and bottom line results as we continue to refine our business model for durability with a very efficient SG&A of 6.1%, which is a 150 basis point improvement over last year and a record for third quarter.\nWith this strong performance and cash flow, we have continued to fortify our balance sheet with $1.3 billion of cash, nothing drawn on our revolver and a 17.7% debt to total cap rate ratio as compared to 23.1% last year. Accordingly, we're very well positioned to pay down another $575 million of debt later this year as it comes due and further strengthen our balance sheet.\nWe also managed our sales price and pace through the second quarter and increased new orders by 4% year-over-year, even though we began to see signs of weakening in the overall market. This weakening has continued into the third quarter. The housing market has cooled, as expected, in response to the Fed's aggressive and rapid reaction to inflation. The resulting very rapid, almost doubling of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate in 6 months has had the desired effect of slowing price appreciation and moderating demand by increasing monthly payment costs and reducing affordability.\nWhile the market has cooled, it has clearly not stopped. Demand remains reasonably strong as buyers still have down payments and have attractive credit scores and can qualify. Household formation has continued to rise. And although we have adjusted some prices in many markets, those prices remain higher on a year-over-year basis. Buyers are seeking shelter from inflationary pressures as scarce rentals drive rents higher.\nSupply remains limited across the country and the need for affordable workforce housing continues to be at crisis levels. Clearly, production must catch up to the growing household numbers as production of dwellings over the past decade has lagged prior decades by as many as 5 million homes. Nevertheless, the rapid increase in interest rates, together with price appreciation have created at least sticker shock and perhaps a more structural cooling of demand.\nIn a few minutes, Rick is going to give a more detailed overview market-by-market review that will give a more comprehensive snapshot as to what we have seen to date. Although these preliminary reflections of market conditions are not as positive of the state of the market, indicators have been building since the Fed's tightening began. And given the Fed's expressed conviction to combat inflation by the definitive statements made recently, it seems that these trends will harden as the Fed continues to tighten until inflation subsides. While we can choose to fight against the trend, the reality is that the market has been changing, and we are getting ahead of it by making all necessary adjustments.\nSo what is the playbook going forward? We're going to keep it simple, and we're going to adhere to our core strategies. To begin, we are going to sell homes adjusting pricing to market conditions and maintaining reasonable volume. We have discussed over the past years that we have had a housing shortage across the country. We will continue to build as prices moderate and adjust in order to fill that shortfall and provide much-needed workforce housing across markets. As we have noted many times in the past, whether the market is improving or declining, we deploy our dynamic pricing model week by week to price products to current market conditions in order to maximize pricing and margin -- pricing and margin while we maintain a carefully limited inventory level. As the market moves, we will continue to be responsive.\nIn sync with selling homes, we will continue to leverage our extraordinary management team across the country and improve our cost of doing business. We have seen quarter-over-quarter improvements in our SG&A over the past years, and we expect to drive efficiencies through technology and process improvement to offset market adjustments wherever possible.\nNext, we will continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line to protect and enhance our extraordinary balance sheet. Our great success over the past years to rise from the successes around careful land management and inventory controls, which have driven cash flows, enables us to reduce our debt, repurchase shares of stock, and drive shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we repurchased another 4.1 million shares of stock for approximately $320 million and drove our return on equity to 21.4%, a 260 basis point improvement over last year.\nFinally, we will conclude our long planned spin-off by year-end. As we have continued to refine the 3 verticals of our spin company, we will spin a mature asset management company into the public markets along with billions of dollars of assets under management that we previously held on Lennar's books.\nThe final spin of our new company, which we will call Quarterra, will trade under the stock symbol Q. And as we have noted before, will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. By finalizing the spin, we will further reduce Lennar's asset base by another estimated $2.5 billion, which will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base and will not result in a material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share. We're very excited about the future prospects for Quarterra as this will be the second spun company in our history, and we have great confidence in the prospects for its future.\nSo let me conclude by saying that while the market might be shifting and adjusting to a new higher interest rate environment, we, at Lennar, are prepared. We are extremely well positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and to succeed in this evolving housing market. We recognize that interest rates are rising and inflation continues to be a legitimate threat. We know that the Fed is determined to curtail inflation, and this will take some time. but we also know that we can adjust as the market changes, and we will.\nWe also know the difficulties in the supply chain continue to persist, and we know that land and labor remain in short supply. And we know that cash flow matters and that a strong balance sheet enables us to operate from a position of strength.\nAs we look to the remainder of 2022, we recognize that there are challenges in the market that we must carefully regard, expect that we will meet the challenges and that we will continue to adjust to maximize opportunity and drive Lennar into an ever better future.\nWith that, let me turn over to Rick.\n\nRichard Beckwitt\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market has been reacting to a significant increase in mortgage rates, increased sales prices, continued inflation and the impact of a declining stock market. These changes accelerated during the quarter with many marking the most pronounced impacts. With this in mind, I would like to focus my comments today on the monthly changes during our quarter, current sales environment in our markets and our strategic and operating focus as a company.\nDuring the second quarter, our new sales orders increased 4% from the prior year on flat year-over-year community count. Sales pace per community increased from 4.8 to 5 sales per month. We continue to sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize prices and offset potential cost increases.\nDuring the quarter, we saw year-over-year increases in new sales orders in each month of the quarter, with a variance of less than 125 sales orders between each monthly total. Our sales incentives on new orders during the second quarter were down 10 basis points year-over-year. However, the percentage did increase sequentially each month during the quarter, with many new sales order incentives totaling 1.6% of the gross sales price of the home.\nWhile the sales percentage in May marked the high point during the quarter, it was still relatively low from a historical perspective. In fact, sales order incentives in May were slightly lower than the average new sales ordering incentive for the latest 12 months.\nOur cancellation rate during the quarter totaled 11.8%, which increased sequentially during the quarter, but was significantly below our long-term historical average. We ended the quarter with only approximately 250 completed homes that were installed across our national footprint, putting us in a great position in a soft new sales environment. So far in June, new orders, traffic, sales incentives and cancellations have worsened in many of our markets due to a rapid spike in mortgage rates and headwinds from negative economic headlines. Many markets have also slowed as we've entered a seasonably slower part of the year.\nI'd now like to give you some color on our markets across the country. They really fall into 3 categories: one, markets reflecting no and minimal impacts; two, markets reflecting modest impacts; and three, markets reflecting more significant impacts.\nDuring the second quarter and so far in June, we had 19 markets that continue to perform well. These include our 6 Florida markets, New Jersey, Maryland, Charlotte, Indianapolis, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County and the Inland Empire. All of these markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory, and many are benefiting from strong local economy, employment growth and in migration.\nWhile these markets have continued to be strong, our sales pace and pricing power has started to flatten or has flattened in each of these markets. To maintain sales momentum, we have offered mortgage buydown programs and normalized market incentives.\nOur Category 2 market, which reflects a modest softening in pricing and a slowdown in the markets includes 10 markets. These include Atlanta, Colorado, Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Nashville, Philadelphia, Virginia, the Bay Area, Reno and Salt Lake City. In each of these markets, traffic has slowed, and we've seen an uptick in cancellation rates. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we've had to offer more aggressive financing programs and targeted price reductions to reduce our sales base -- to keep our sales base in line with our production schedule.\nSelectively reducing the sales price to solve for a mortgage payment that works for our buyers has worked well in these markets. Notwithstanding these price increases, net pricing remains higher than year ago periods.\nOur Category 3 markets, which reflect the more significant market softening and correction includes 7 markets. These include Raleigh, Minnesota, Austin, Los Angeles, the Central Valley, Sacramento and Seattle. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing these markets and what we're doing strategically from a sales point.\nRaleigh was an extremely strong market in the second quarter but softened significantly at the beginning of June. This stems from a combination of higher mortgage rates, steep price increases over the last 2 years, and some job concerns in the Texas. We believe pricing pressure will continue until the market resets and we've been reducing pricing and offering aggressive mortgage buydown program. Our pricing adjustments have started to take hold and sales activity has begun to stabilized. On a positive note, cancellation rates had not been a problem, inventory is limited and our net new order pricing is still up on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we have room for any needed future pricing adjustments.\nThe Minnesota market has been very challenging. Buyers have always been conservative in this market. And as rates have increased, there has been a strong push back against current pricing. There is very little in migration in Minnesota, which makes pricing much more challenging because we have a limited pool of only local buyers. We have reacted with strong price reductions, competitive mortgage programs and we're solving to a mortgage statement that works, which is starting to rebuild sales.\nAustin has been the most impacted market in Texas, following back-to-back years of 40% plus appreciation and bidding wars on available inventory. Higher rates in June and headlines on stock market declines and the distressed national economy has sidelined many buyers who are waiting for a reset in home values.\nWhile inventory is limited, cancellation rates have increased and we've reduced prices in many communities on a home-by-home basis and have offered extremely competitive mortgage programs. These pricing adjustments are starting to generate increased sales activity. Fundamentally, Austin is positioned for long-term growth with low unemployment, higher [rent] occupancy, [low to mid] home inventory and strong projected job growth. Our communities in Los Angeles, Central Valley and Sacramento have experienced a significant slowdown with traffic dropping off considerably in late May and into June.\nWith the spike in interest rates, buyers in these markets have been extremely credit challenged and cancellation rates have increased with adjusted prices are using financing incentives and in some cases, have included non-leased [solar] systems as part of our home package to rebuild sales. Net new order prices remained higher than the year ago period and completed inventory for the most part has not been a problem. The issue continues to be a reset in pricing to solve to a mortgage statement that works in these markets. This is consistent with what Stuart said in his opening remarks.\nSeattle was one of the strongest markets in the country over the last 2 years. The market saw strong integration, solid job growth and sales prices that grew approximately 20% annually in each of the last few years. While market fundamentals with limited land supply and low inventory remains extremely strong, buyers have pushed back for a reset in pricing. The higher priced and highly sought after locations around Seattle have seen a significant pullback in sales in May and early June. This pullback is a result of both continued price appreciation in the first quarter, causing concern over home values being overpriced and stock market corrections, which have had a direct impact on employee stock compensation plans.\nWe've adjusted prices in some communities to Q4 pricing and has seen a sales uptick with this correction, which demonstrates the underlying strength of the market. Once again, in this market, we are at prices that are still significantly higher than the year ago period.\nI hope this gives you a better picture of our markets across the country and what we're doing to keep sales activity going. The markets remain very fluid, and we are making strategic decisions and adjustments every day. As we've said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine going, maintain our start pace and price our homes to market.\nI'd like to now turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick. This morning, I'll discuss our land position and give an update on the status of the supply chain. I will be brief, as I know that sales and interest rates dominate the interest of our investors. We are pleased with the excellent progress we continue to make on our land-light strategy as evidenced by our controlled homesite percentage increasing to 62% at the end of the second quarter from 50% last year. We also continue to make progress by reducing the years of supply of owned homesites to 3.1 years at the end of the second quarter, down from 3.3 years last year.\nTo date, we have worked with our land strategies group, which will become a vertical of Quarterra to continue to reduce our years of land owned even lower. Using this strategy, we have cycled some $10 billion of land and land development from owned to controlled as we refine the supply of just-in-time homesites to our homebuilding machine.\nOur extreme focus on the land-lighter model saved us a significant amount of cash spend on land acquisitions during the quarter. We ended the quarter as noted with $1.3 billion in cash, no borrowings on a $2.6 billion revolver and homebuilding debt to capital of 17.7%. As Stuart noted, we are very well positioned to manage through the changing interest rate environment with our excellent asset-light position and very strong balance sheet as the foundation for that position.\nTurning to the supply chain and it's well-documented challenges for the industry. Our second quarter started presenting some favorable news. There were still intermittent disruptions and an increase in construction costs. But for the first time since the disruptions began, we saw a flattening in cycle time. Over the past 4 months, cycle time has expanded by only 5 days, which we believe signals a peak. Additionally, about 25% of our markets experienced cycle time reductions in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. There are still challenges that occur, but we are managing them effectively as evidenced not only by this flattening of cycle time, but also by being above the high end of our guidance for second quarter closings.\nOur direct introduction costs in the second quarter were up 1.6% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, both lower than the comparable increases for the same period in the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2021. Rise in labor costs accounted for all of the increase in the second quarter. Material costs were lower due to the lower priced lumber from starts in the second half of last year. We expect costs will rise again in the back half of 2022, as increases in lumber that spiked in Q1 will flow through those closings.\nThe current drop in lumber prices that we're experiencing, which started near the end of our second quarter will lower the cost of our starts in the second half of this year and related to deliveries in the first half of 2023.\nThank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVP, CFO & Treasurer, Lennar Corporation\n\nThank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet, and then review our thoughts for Q3.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the second quarter, our Financial Services team produced $104 million of operating earnings, slightly above the high end of our guidance. Then when you look at the details between mortgage and title, mortgage operating earnings were $74 million compared to $92 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, and as has been greatly documented in the media, the mortgage market has become extraordinarily competitive for purchase business as refinance volumes have all but halted and resale inventories have declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. This was the primary driver for our lower second quarter earnings.\nTitle operating earnings were $30 million compared to $24 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher premiums driven by an increase in average sales price per transaction. And then turning to our Lennar Other segment. For the second quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $108 million. The loss was primarily the result of noncash mark-to-market losses on our public company technology investments which totaled $78 million. The remaining loss was primarily related to other strategic investments in this segment.\nAs we have mentioned before, we are required to mark to market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to believe that these technology partnerships provide significant operational efficiencies for both our homebuilding and Financial Services platform and greatly improve our homebuyers' experience.\nAnd then turning to the balance sheet. As we've mentioned, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility for a total of $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity.\nAnd one note regarding our credit facility. Last month, we successfully amended and extended this facility. We now have almost $2.6 billion of commitment, $350 million matures in 2024 and $2.2 billion matures in 2027. We were pleased with the execution, which was greatly enhanced by our investment-grade rating.\nDuring the quarter, we -- as Jon mentioned, we continue to focus on becoming land lighter. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we owned 193,000 homesites and controlled 319,000 homesites for a total of 512,000 homesites. This portfolio of homesites provides us with a strong competitive position for continued market share expansion. Our homesites controlled increased to 62% from 50% in the prior year, and our years owned improved to 3.1 years from 3.3 years in the prior year.\nPlanned transactions may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but progress is made year-over-year. We are still on track to reach our goal of 2.75 years owned and 65% homesites controlled by year-end. And we remain committed to our focus on increasing shareholder returns. As we mentioned during the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares totaling $321 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $111 million during the quarter. Our next senior note maturity is $575 million, which is due in November of this year, and we have no debt maturities due in fiscal 2023.\nThe result of all these transactions was the homebuilding debt to total capital of 17.7%, which improved from 23.1% in the prior year. And then just a few more points on our balance sheet in return, our stockholders' equity increased to $22 billion. Our book value per share increased to 74.12%. Our return on inventory was 30.5%, and our return on equity was 21.4%. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and positions us well for the future.\nAnd so with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to our thoughts for Q3. As we mentioned in our press release, it is difficult to provide the more targeted guidance that we typically offer given the uncertainty in market conditions. So alternatively, we thought it would be more appropriate to provide very broad ranges to give some boundaries to each of the components of our third quarter. So starting with new orders, we expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 18,000 homes. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 17,000 to 18,500. Our Q3 average sales price should be slightly higher than our Q2 average sales price, which as a reminder, was $483,000. We expect gross margins to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%. And we expect our SG&A to be between 6% and 6.5%.\nFor the combined homebuilding, joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a loss of about $10 million. And then as we anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $70 million to $75 million as market competition for purchased business continues to increase. We expect earnings of about $20 million for our Multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss of about $20 million. This guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments since those adjustments will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues. Our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 288 million shares. So when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.55 to $5.45 per share for the third quarter.\nAnd then turning to the full year. As we mentioned, we are maintaining our previous deliveries guidance of approximately 68,000 homes for the year. However, at this time, recognizing that market conditions are fluid, we will not be providing updated guidance for the other components of earnings. We do look forward to updating our thoughts for Q4 on our next earnings call.\nWith that, let me turn it back to the operator."

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.\n\nAlexandra Lumpkin\n\nAssociate General Counsel, Lennar Corp.\n\nThank you, and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\nOperator\n\nI would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart A. Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman, Lennar Corp.\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thank you. and thank you all for joining this morning. I'm here in Miami joined by Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from; and we also have Rick Beckwitt, Co-CEO and President on the line with us, and he's joining us from Colorado.\nAs usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick's going to talk about market strength and land and community count. John will update on supply chain, production and construction costs. And then as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlights and additional guidance, and then we'll answer as many questions as we can, and we'll limit to one question and one follow-up, please.\nSo let me begin and start by saying that we're quite pleased to announce another hard fought and well-executed quarterly performance by the associates of Lennar. Our operating results reflect both the extraordinary focus and determination of Lennar's management and operating teams, as well as the general strength in the housing market. As questions abound given geopolitical turmoil, inflationary pressures building both around the globe and domestically, and interest rates are rising, the housing market remains very strong in all of our major markets.\nDemand trends remain strong, as family formation continues to rise. As our team from around the country reviewed our weekly sales starts and closings on Monday for our regions and our divisions, the unanimous view was that our sales pace range in each market from strong to very strong. Buyers are seeking shelter and they are seeking shelter from inflationary pressures as scarce rentals see rents escalating and escalating housing costs can be controlled with an owned home with a fixed rate mortgage. While wages are going up, so too our housing costs. So with employment strong and home prices rising, it is best to fix these costs. Additionally, the home is ever more the control center or hub of our customers' lives and frankly, geopolitical stress makes the security of home all that much more comforting.\nWhile demand is strong, supply is short and constrained, the ability to actually build and deliver homes has been slowed by the supply chain that is all but broken, by the workforce that is short in supply and the intense competition for scarce and titled land assets. Therefore, the supply of homes has remained quite limited and is not prone to overbuilding. Accordingly, we're pleased to report operating performance that reflects the general strength in the housing market. Setting aside for the moment, our noncash mark-to-market gains last year and losses this year, our operating performance is consistent and very strong. While deliveries increased 2% year-over-year to 12,538 homes, our gross margin improved 190 basis points to 26.9% and our SG&A improved 90 basis points to 7.5%, which drove net margin to 19.4% and drove net earnings from operations to just over $800 million and almost 20% bottom line improvement from operations.\nAlthough deliveries have been constrained by the supply chain disruption, efficiency in our operations continues to drive strong bottom line improvement and very strong cash flow. Additionally, our financial services group continues to perform exceptionally for the company, adding $90 million of earnings, while supporting the closings of every possible home and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current, very difficult environment.\nOur strong cash flow has been constructively deployed, as our operations have been our primary focus. First, with the lengthening of our cycle times by 6 to 8 weeks over the past year driven by supply chain disruption, we have more capital invested in our inventory, as we are increasing starts and taking longer to deliver homes even as we are significantly reducing the amount of land held on our books. We are deploying more cash into shorter-term assets, while generating cash from longer-term assets.\nNext, we're continuing to pay down debt as it comes due, with the next tranche available for paydown in August, and that's $575 million that we expect to pay down from cash flow. And of course, we have continued to repurchase stock, with another 5.3 million shares purchased in the past quarter and another $2 billion authorized by our board just yesterday. With strong performance and cash flow, we have fortified our balance sheet with $1.4 billion of cash on book, nothing drawn on our revolver and an 18.3% debt-to-total cap ratio as compared to 24% last year. We expect our results to continue to strengthen throughout the year, as our already increased start pace results in more deliveries and as we use our size and scale and our builder of choice relationships to alleviate and resolve some of the supply chain friction.\nTo that end, last quarter, I noted that John and Rick, our co-CEOs have not chosen to sit idly in difficult times, but instead, they went to the problem and visited each of our 38 divisions over a 6-week period. Well, that was last quarter. Monitoring my John and Rick cam this quarter, I noted that on top of regular in-the-field operations reviews at division offices, they have jointly with Kent Gilles, our esteemed Head of Alfen Supply Chain, gone to the problem and visited approximately 10 of our most strategic manufacturers at their offices to engage directly the problem-solving process. This is just the beginning, as many more trips are planned, and the supply chain problem will find its way to becoming a supply chain opportunity. I'm betting on them time, focus and attention, problems are being solved and that is simply the Lennar way, leadership matters.\nSo let me quickly turn back to the [mark-to-market] volatility that I mentioned earlier. Our total first quarter earnings in the first quarter were $503.6 million or $1.69 per diluted share compared to first quarter 2021 earnings of $1 billion or $3.20 per diluted share. These numbers include our mark-to-market loss this quarter and gain last year at this time. Let's avoid confusion. We have made significant strategic investments in various new technology companies that are working to reshape various parts of our company and our industry. Some are disruptors and some are enhancers. All of them are core to the future of, as well as the presence of our core operating platform. They have informed change in the core that have reduced SG&A and production costs. These cost reductions have made the investment in the company and the Lennox strategy extremely valuable in creating long-term shareholder value. These investments are also the tip of the spear in identifying and engaging our substantial industry-leading sustainability initiatives from solar on the rooftop to microgrid technology across the community, from water conservation to sustainable cement, our Lennox strategy is setting the course from Lennar's sustainable future.\nA number of our Lennox investments have matured and become public companies and their short-term market price movements are volatile. And that volatility runs through our earnings. On the one hand, this causes some confusion on both the upside and the downside. For example, in Q1 '21, we reported a $470 million mark-to-market profit, and in Q1 of '22, this quarter, we reported $395 million mark-to-market loss.\nOn the other hand, these investments have been stepping stones to our higher gross margins, as well as our never been lower SG&A at 7.5% in the first quarter, which is now the lowest we have ever seen in the first quarter. These are nonmonetary and nonoperational profits and losses, and they really do not reflect the state of the housing market or the operating performance of the company within that market.\nWith that said, we choose not to sell the ownership in these companies just because they go public. Instead, we are strategically engaged in the businesses because -- in the businesses of these companies and because we are very enthusiastic about the future of these businesses and our Lennox strategy. And of course, you can expect to hear a lot more about this part of our business in the future.\nNow, finally, let me talk briefly and update our progress on SpinCo and are focused on becoming a pure-play homebuilding company. As noted last quarter, we filed our private letter ruling with the IRS. Since then, we've taken the next step with SpinCo and filed our confidential Form 10 filing in February so we can control the timing of the spin. We have received, since then, our first round of comments from the SEC. We have also initiated the process with the NYSE to have the shares of SpinCo listed. Nevertheless, given the choppiness of the capital markets and the work that is still being completed, we're pushing our expectations for the actual execution to the third or fourth quarter of this year.\nWe have noted before that the Spin company will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. Many of the assets targeted for SpinCo will be either part of the limited balance sheet of SpinCo or are currently being monetized in the form of assets under management that will be housed within the private equity verticals of SpinCo or they're being resolved and monetized in other ways. Additionally, while we are taking more time to execute the spin, we continue to migrate assets from the Lennar balance sheet into the assets under management that will comprise SpinCo. Therefore, we are growing the management fees and returns that will define the value of the spun company. This monetization has been and will be completed over the next year or so and the cash proceeds will be deployed in Lennar to fortify the balance sheet and/or to continue to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis.\nAs a reminder, our 3 core verticals of SpinCo have been identified in business plan and are already growing AUM and fee generation. They are multifamily, single-family for rent and land strategies. Each of these verticals already have raised and are continuing to grow third-party capital and our active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform, had almost $10 billion of AUM at the end of 2021. And as of the end of our first quarter, had approximately $10.7 billion of gross capital under management and is very close to our first closing for our third fund.\nLSFR, our single-family for rent platform, has grown from approximately $1.2 billion of assets deployed at the end of '21 to approximately $1.9 billion deployed as of the end of our first quarter. And our land strategies platform, which is still being refined for SpinCo expects to have $4 billion to $5 billion of assets under management at the time of the spin. As I've noted in the past, the remaining Lennar Corporation will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base and the spin will not result in a material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share.\nSo let me wrap up and conclude by saying that we're extremely well positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. As I said earlier, we expect our results to strengthen throughout 2022. We are picking up steam, and we are picking up confidence. We recognize that interest rates arising and inflation is a legitimate threat. We also know the difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar and for the industry and that land and labor are in short supply. But we also recognize that the economy remains strong, with wages rising and housing is in short supply across the country.\nStrategically, we remain focused on orderly targeted growth, with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A and therefore, maximizing our net margins. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued strength in the market and double-digit growth for the company. As noted in our press release, we are projecting 16,000 to 16,300 deliveries in the second quarter at a 28% to 28.25% margin, and we are now projecting 68,000 deliveries for year-end at a 27.25% to 28% margin for the year. At this pace, we will have a very strong bottom line and a very strong cash flow, with a projected spin-off in the second half of the year, and Lennar will have another record year.\nSo with that, let me turn over to Rick.\n\nRichard Beckwitt\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong, our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine, where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. We have continued to strategically sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize sales prices and offset potential cost increases.\nTo that end, we have slowed sales. Rather than writing sales contracts when customers visit our website or welcome home centers, we are putting people on a waiting list to contact them later when we release the homes for sale. This shift in the sales process is driving higher sales prices and stronger margins.\nOur first quarter results prove out the success of this strategy, as we achieved gross margin increases of 190 basis points year-over-year. During the first quarter, we started 4.7 homes per community, sold 4.3 homes per community and we ended the quarter with less than 180 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. This production, margin-driven and sales-focused program will continue to improve margin and lead to increased deliveries and profits in fiscal 2022.\nIn the first quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were solid in each of our operating regions. We continue to achieve price increases and saw strength in all product categories, from entry level to move up and in our active adult communities.\nLet me give you some color on our markets. As Stuart said in his opening remarks, all of our markets are strong right now. But here's some color. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand, as well as in migration from the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited. The state is experiencing tremendous job growth, with employment exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The hottest markets in Florida are Naples in Sarasota and the Southwest, Miami, Dayton Broward in the Southeast in Tampa, Orlando is also a robust market benefiting from a significant rebound in tourism. All of these markets -- In all of these markets, we are the leading builder with the best land positions.\nAtlanta continues to see strong and steady growth, driven by limited inventory, relative affordability and strong job creation. During the first quarter, we entered the Huntsville, Alabama and Florida, Alabama coast markets. Both markets are experiencing strong demand, driven by limited inventory and quality of life. Huntsville is especially thriving due to significant employment growth fueled by an influx of many diverse industries attracted by a world-class airport, a supply of educated workers and a relatively affordable home price. The Gulf Coast is also experiencing outsized employment growth, while providing a healthy outdoor lifestyle of favorable weather and the beauty of the Gulf of Mexico. In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets. Inventory is very limited, and the combination of core local demand and in-migration continues to push both sales pace and price. We are the top builder in all of these markets.\nTexas continues to be the strongest state in the country, with in-migration from the East and West. The state's pro business, employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and exceptional job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from a surge in oil and gas prices.\nThe strongest market in the country continues to be Austin. The Colorado market continues to gain momentum, benefiting from strong in-migration and solid job growth. Inventory is very limited, and we are seeing great pricing power.\nPhoenix and Las Vegas continue to be 2 of the hottest markets in the country. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and immigration from California.\nNevada continues to lead the nation in new jobs, with employment significantly exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Phoenix is driving due to real affordability, inventory is extremely limited and demand continues to accelerate. The Pacific Northwest continues to be a strong market, as significant land use and development restrictions limit production to meet growing demand. Notwithstanding these restrictions, we have an excellent land position with great growth opportunities.\nPortland and Seattle are experiencing outstanding job growth, with both markets ranking in the top 10 in the country. With strong demand and limited supply, we continue to see strong price increases. The California markets remains very strong, driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there was more demand than supply even with much of the out migration from the state. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and East Bay Area have remained some of the strongest markets, with homebuyers looking for affordability.\nDuring the quarter, we also saw a resurgence in the core markets of the Bay Area, as employees are returning to work. As such, both our core and inland markets are firing on all cylinders. As I said, as Stuart said, these are some of the strongest markets, but there is broad strength across the country.\nNow, I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth in community count. During the first quarter, our community count increased 4% year-over-year as we focused on growth in our existing and new markets. We expect our community count to build throughout the year, and are still projecting to end 2022 with a low double-digit increase in community count year-over-year. While supply chain issues and inspection delays are impacting the timing of some of our community openings, we are in an excellent position for strong growth in 2022 and 2023.\nOur land pipeline remains robust, with plenty of land in the queue to meet our growth goals over the next several years. We continue to see great buying opportunities in all of our markets and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years, as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned or controlled.\nWe are also pleased with the excellent progress we are making on our land-light strategy, as evidenced by our controlled home site percentage increasing to 58% at the end of the first quarter from 45% last year. We believe we can increase this to 65% by the end of the fiscal year. Our extreme focus on a land liner model saved us a significant amount of cash spend on land acquisitions during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolver and a homebuilding debt to capital of 18.3%. As Stuart said, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $526 million. These repurchases, combined with our significant earnings contributed to a return on equity of 19.5%, which was a 180 basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year.\nNow, I'd like to turn it over to John.\n\nJonathan M. Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO, Co-President & Director, Lennar Corporation\n\nThanks, Rick. This morning, I'll discuss how our first quarter was impacted due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary impacts on construction costs and on cycle time increases, as well as our team's ability to manage through these challenges. At Lennar, we continue to deal with our fair share of disruptions. Some of the supply chain disruptions were like the ones we faced in our fourth quarter, where we experienced intermittent disruptions affecting different trades, at different times and in different geographies. The first quarter was also different and that the Omicron spike in January dramatically impacted everything. A significant amount of labor at manufacturers, suppliers, local trade partners and our own associates was out from work. This was most severe in January and then ease rapidly in February.\nAt times, in January, it seemed as though as much as 1/2 of the workforce across the industry was quarantined at home. This challenged our management, purchasing and construction teams to be extremely nimble in finding workaround solutions to the unique challenges that the Omicron spike created. Labor returned in February to the manufacturing plants and at our communities, as manufacturers and trades are now hard at work to make up for lost time. Many manufacturers have stabilized their lead times, and there are currently fewer situations of late deliveries. However, some manufacturers still have meaningful challenges ahead.\nThe following categories are continuing to deal with significant constraints. These are electrical equipment, garage doors, HVAC condensers, flex duct and cabinets. In response to the ongoing disruptions and future unknown risk of new disruptions, our divisions are more closely managing the inventory of local trades and adding additional labor by onboarding new trade partners, while our regional and national teams stay in constant communication with manufacturers and suppliers in support of our divisions.\nThe supply chain challenges in the first quarter resulted in an increase in cycle time and contributed to an increase in direct construction costs. Our average cycle time increased approximately 2 weeks sequentially over Q4 and about 2 months year-over-year. Given the severity of the challenges created by the sudden Omicron spike, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our associates for their leadership, creativity and tenacity in overcoming this situation. Their extraordinary efforts enable Lennar to deliver over [12,500] homes to eagerly awaiting homeowners in our first quarter.\nAs we look at the balance of the year and our guidance to deliver 68,000 homes, we are strategically focused on accelerating starts to give us more inventory under construction. This will provide a cushion against expanding cycle times, allowing our management teams more opportunities to complete homes in line with our plans.\nTurning to cost now. Our direct construction costs were up 3% sequentially from Q4 and 23% year-over-year. Lumber was relatively flat sequentially, but accounted for about 60% of the year-over-year increase. As you are aware, lumber dramatically increased again, up almost 100% since December 1 to $1,400 per thousand board feet. This increase in lumber will cause about a $5 per square foot increase by August of this year. Further increases are anticipated as lumber futures indicate short-term inflation through the spring cycle or into early summer. Then based on our analysis and on feedback from key lumber industry participants, we believe the deflation of lumber prices will follow.\nThis pattern looks to mirror what took place last year with dramatic -- with lumber's dramatic rise and fall. Despite operating in this cost inflationary environment, our first quarter direct construction costs as a percent of revenue were stable at 43%, which is basically flat compared to 42% both sequentially and year-over-year. Simply put, our pricing power is offsetting these cost increases. As Rick noted, we are achieving this through the disciplined matching of sales pace to construction pace. Our divisions have been and remain laser-focused on being a production-first operation. Our execution is an ongoing refinement and improvement of our dynamic pricing and FIFO sales approach, allowing effective control of which homes are released for sale and at what price.\nIn conclusion, it bears repeating that we remain disciplined and focused about our everything's included strategy and on being the builder of choice for our trade partners, a program, which is now entering its seventh year. This program has successfully created close-knit relationships with our strategic building partners, allowing both parties to make adjustments in these unprecedented times. These strategic relationships enable us to be better at solving problems in 2022 than we previously were. Additionally, as Stuart aptly noted, (inaudible), Rick and I are currently traveling the country, meeting with senior management of key supply chain relationships to explore how to solve issues that need immediate attention and how to think differently about the supply chain going forward. We have meaningful exchanges of thoughts and ideas on how to alter the current configuration of the supply chain to reduce and remove future disruptions. We believe these -- the results of these efforts will provide for the fastest path to stabilization of the supply chain for Lennar. We also expect to achieve meaningfully improved efficiencies and throughout the supply chain, providing for better control of both costs and cycle times.\nThank you, and I'll turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane J. Bessette\n\nVP, CFO & Treasurer, Lennar Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and John have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then provide detailed guidance for Q2 '22 and updated high-level guidance for fiscal year '22.\nSo starting with Financial Services. For the first quarter, our Financial Services team produced $91 million of operating earnings, slightly above the high end of our guidance. And then when you look at the details between mortgage and title, our mortgage operating earnings were $67 million compared to $100 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become increasingly competitive for purchase business, as refinance volumes and resale inventory has declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. This was the primary driver of our first quarter, lower secondary margins as compared to the prior year.\nTitle operating earnings were $21 million compared to $30 million in the prior year. The prior year included a onetime $11 million gain related to the early paydown of the note receivable. Excluding this gain, earnings increased this year primarily as a result of higher premiums driven by an increase in average sales products per transaction. And then looking at our Lennar Other segment, as Stuart indicated, for the first quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $403 million. This loss was primarily the result of our noncash mark-to-market losses in our strategic technology investments which, as we indicated, totaled $395 million. As we've mentioned before, we are required to mark-to-market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.\nAnd then turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, for a total of $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity. During the quarter, we continued to focus on becoming land lighter. As a result, at quarter end, we owned 202,000 homesites and controlled 279,000 homesites for a total of 481,000 homesites. This portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position for continued growth.\nAs Rick mentioned, our homesites controlled increased to 58% from 45% in the prior year, while our years owned stayed flat from the prior year at 3.4 years. Land transactions may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but progress is made year-over-year. And so we are still on track to reach our goal of 2.75 years owned and the 65% homesites controlled by year-end.\nAnd we remain committed to our focus on increasing shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares, totaling $526 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $110 million during the quarter, which was the result of a 50% increase of our annual dividend to $1.50 per share that took place in January of this year. Our next senior note maturity is $575 million, which we will pay in August of this year, and we have no maturities due in fiscal 2023. The result of all these transactions with homebuilding debt to total capital of 8.3%, which improved from 24% in the prior year.\nAnd then just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to $21 billion. Our book value per share increased to $69.98 and our return on inventory was 27.5%. In summary, we have a solid balance sheet that positions us well for the future.\nAnd so with that brief overview, I'd like to provide some guidance details. As we look forward to the second quarter, we're assuming that market conditions remain similar to what we see today, strong demand and limited inventory driven by continued supply chain challenges. So with that backdrop, we expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 17,800 to 18,200 homes, as we continue to moderate sales pace to match production cycle changing.\nCommunity count is always challenging to estimate as it's difficult to precisely predict when communities will open and when they will close out. However, we do expect our Q2 ending community count to be slightly up as compared to Q2 of last year. Taking into consideration the continued supply chain challenges, we anticipate our Q2 deliveries will be in the range of 16,000 to 16,300, and our Q2 average sales price should be about 470,000. We expect to continue to produce strong gross margins in the range of 28% to 28.25%, and we expect our SG&A to be between 6.8% and 7%, as we continue to focus on simplification, efficiencies and leveraging our overhead.\nAnd for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a loss of about $10 million. And then looking at our other businesses, we anticipate that Financial Services earnings for Q2 will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million, as market competition for purchased business continues to increase. We expect a loss of about $10 million to $15 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss of about $10 million. This guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments. That adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter.\nWe expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenue and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. And we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. The weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 292 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $3.80 to $4 per share for the second quarter.\nAnd then turning to full year guidance. We are increasing (inaudible) as we mentioned our guidance for the year. We now expect to deliver approximately 68,000 homes more or less, which is an increase from our previous guidance of 67,000 homes. We believe our average sales price for the year will be in the range of $470,000 to $475,000. This would result in about $32 billion of homebuilding revenue, which would be an increase of more than 25% from fiscal '21.\nWe are also increasing our gross margin guidance for the year, as we mentioned. We now expect our margins to be in the range of 27.25% to 28%, which is an increase from our previous guidance of 27% to 27.5%. We've provided somewhat of a wide range to take into consideration some of the potential uncertainties as we look ahead. And with our continued focus on technology and efficiency and an increase in volume, we expect our full year SG&A to be in the range of 6.6% to 6.8%.\nAnd for Financial Services, we're affirming our annual guidance of $440 million to $450 million. And finally, our tax rate should be approximately 25%. And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are in an excellent position to have a strong fiscal year 2022.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for the reading of the forward-looking statement.\n\nDavid Collins\n\nController and VP, Lennar\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Lennar's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call, and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results, and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, including those under the captioned risk factors contained in Lennar's annual report on Form 10-K, most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and Co-CEO. Sir, you may begin.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nVery good. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining today. I'm in Miami today , together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President, Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer, David Collins, who you just heard from and our Controller and Vice President, and Katherine Lee Martin. Don't want to forget the Lee, our new Chief Legal Officer,I guess you're not new anymore, Katherine, and Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services, along with a few others as well. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction costs, cycle time, and some of our other metrics. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for Q1 2026 and for the year.\nOf course, we'll have a question-and-answer period. As usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many as possible. Before we begin however, let me note, as I'm sure you're all aware by now, that this will be Jon's last earnings call as he has decided to retire and will officially step down on 1 January, which is now right around the corner. Jon has been a partner and a leader at our company for well over 40 years. We stopped counting here after 40 years, and his leadership will certainly be missed. Affectionately, Jon has been known as our company's plow horse, and as such, Jon has driven Lennar's operations with relentless dedication and commitment.\nHe joined the company just one year after I started full-time, and together we've learned every facet of this business, continually adapting and evolving. Over the years, we have tried new things. Some have been successful, others, not so much. We've navigated both the best and the most challenging of times. Through it all, Jon's partnership has been a joy and a privilege. Jon, I hope you find plenty of time to improve that ugly golf game of yours, and perhaps you'll find some time to work on that singing voice as well. With that, let's get started. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to present Lennar's fourth quarter and year-end 2025 results, against the backdrop of what is still a stubbornly difficult housing market.\nWhile our margin is under pressure as we focus on bringing affordable housing to an affordability-constrained consumer base, we can see that underlying demand is still strong while supply is short. During the past three years of difficult market conditions, we have maintained volume, we've grown market share, and we've re-engineered our operating platform for a better and more efficient future when the market bottoms and normalizes. We're extremely well positioned, with very strong market share in strategic markets, and our margin is leveraged to the upside. As you may recall, last quarter I noted that declining interest rates could signal the start of a market recovery. Unfortunately, that turnaround has not yet materialized. As rates slowly moderated in September, eased more in October, and remained flat in November, the customer response remained fairly tepid, suggesting that a combination of affordability and consumer confidence issues were continuing to limit demand.\nOf course, the coincident threat of government shutdown in September and the actual shutdown from 1 October through mid-November, further eroded already weak consumer confidence. While traffic was consistent, customers were both hesitant and limited by what they could afford to purchase. With that said, our Q4 results reflect the continued softening of market conditions and affordability. Sales volume has been difficult to maintain, and required additional incentives to achieve our expected pace and to avoid an unintended buildup of excess inventory. While we exceeded our delivery goal for the quarter and while we sold in line with the low-end guidance during the quarter, these accomplishments came at the expense of further deterioration of margin, which came down to 17%, even though we eased back the pressure on sales and pulled back our delivery goals for 2025.\nAs we look ahead to next quarter, we know that margin will remain under pressure and sales and closings will be seasonally light. Nevertheless, we're very well positioned to provide the affordable supply that the market needs, when demand is ultimately activated by either lower interest rates or government-sponsored programs to enable affordability. We are situated with a lower-cost structure, efficient product offerings, and strong market positions to accommodate pent-up demand, as rates moderate and confidence ultimately returns. We believe that we have gotten ahead of current market realities, and we've built what we believe is a stronger long-term margin-driving platform. We know the market has remained weaker for longer, but we also know our strategy has helped build a healthier housing market and has positioned Lennar for strong cash flow, higher returns on equity and capital, and stronger bottom-line growth in the future.\nAccordingly, we will remain focused on volume and even-flow production. We will maintain responsible volume to maintain an affordable cost structure, and we will find our floor and rebuild our margin, as the overall housing market continues to remain short on supply. Let me turn to a quick macro view of the housing market. Consistent with our third quarter, the macro economy remained challenging through our fourth quarter. While mortgage rates drifted marginally lower in the fourth quarter, consumer confidence became even more challenged by economic uncertainties, and of course became even more challenged still by the government shutdown. Clearly, inflation-driven affordability concerns rose to the center of the national conversation, shaping headlines and policy debates across the country. Cost inflation has clearly had a significant impact on the lifestyle of the average American family.\nAt the same time, concerns about job security have become increasingly prominent, as advancements in modern technology and artificial intelligence raise important questions about the future of employment for the American workforce. The current housing market is entrenched in an affordability crisis, leaving many average American families feeling excluded from the traditional promise of upward mobility and homeownership. Against this backdrop, some advocate for what many call sweeping and sometimes \"socialist solutions,\" offering broad promises of free and readily accessible resources, as an appealing answer to the affordability dilemma. This narrative gains traction, especially when there's a lack of clear, actionable alternatives that address the challenges facing American families today. The \"capitalist framework\" has yet to speak and present tangible, practical strategies that effectively confront these realities and restore affordability, and access to homeownership for the broader population.\nAs I've noted on prior calls, mayors and governors across the country, both Republican and Democrat, understand this and continue to list the housing shortage as a priority concern and they point to affordability or attainability as a real crisis. They also understand that this has been a difficult cycle, as low supply has fueled high prices and high prices, especially with higher-for-longer interest rates, have locked out many buyers. Inflation and short supply have kept home prices higher. Supply remains constrained in most markets, driven by years of underproduction. Additionally, new construction has slowed recently, exacerbating the chronic supply shortage, as builders have pulled back on production due to slow sales and affordability concerns. Short supply can't be fixed by simply adding supply. It is important to recognize the downside of artificially lowering home prices or boosting inventory solely to drive prices down.\nSuch actions could negatively affect the 85 million Americans who already own homes by diminishing their property values, which in turn could further weaken overall consumer confidence. Moreover, if builders are unable to achieve sufficient returns, they may be forced to slow or halt construction, disrupting the production levels needed to address ongoing supply shortages in the housing market. On a positive note, the federal government has intensified its focus on the national housing crisis, with a strong likelihood of taking decisive action to enhance affordability. In a constructive move, federal officials have initiated discussions with builders and industry associations, among others, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and work towards practical solutions. Although the specifics of potential programs remain to be seen, it is clear that significant attention is being paid to developing impactful initiatives, while thoughtfully considering possible unintended negative consequences.\nDespite the public scrutiny and debate surrounding various proposed programs, it is encouraging to see that many bold ideas are being carefully elevated with the goal of improving affordability. Increasing affordability has the potential to spark new demand in the housing market, which can in turn drive an increase in construction activity and help address ongoing supply shortages. Although the specific outcomes and programs remain uncertain at this time, it is significant that for the first time in decades, the federal government is actively recognizing the vital role that housing plays not only in the broader national economy, but also in the well-being of American families. I am confident that housing will emerge as a central element in addressing the affordability crisis, and providing meaningful solutions for the future. Now let me turn to our results.\nAs we noted in our press release in our Q4, we started 18,443 homes, we delivered 23,034 homes, and sold just over 20,000 homes. While we were just above the low end of sales expectations and exceeded our delivery expectations, and we were able to grow our community count to 1,708 communities, or 18% over last year, positioning us for a better next year. As mortgage interest rates moderated and consumer confidence declined, we continued to drive volume with our starts, though at a slower pace, while we incentivized sales to enable affordability and limit undesired inventory buildup. As we approached the beginning of the year, we intentionally focused on building inventory above our two completed unsold homes per community level, to almost three per community to provide ready supply for the new year.\nDuring Q1, sales incentives remained relatively flat at 14%, but reducing our gross margin to 17%, which was slightly lower than expected on an average sales price of $386,000. Our SG&A came in at 7.9%, which produced a net margin of 9.1%. As we look ahead to Q1 2026, we expect our margins will be lower, as is expected in Q1, between 15% and 16%, of course depending on market conditions. We expect to sell between 18,000 and 19,000 homes, and deliver between 17,000 and 18,000 homes. We expect our average sales price to be between $365,000 and 375,000. As I noted earlier, we expect to deliver approximately 85,000 homes in 2026. We expect our overhead in Q1 to be approximately 9.1%, as we continue to invest in and evolve our various Lennar technology solutions that will define our future.\nThese initiatives have been and will continue to add to SG&A, as well as corporate G&A for some time, as they represent a significant investment in our differentiated future. As I think about our results in the fourth quarter, two additional components really stand out. First, we have now rebuilt our entire company with an asset-lighter inventory structure. Currently, less than 5% of our land is on our balance sheet. Accordingly, our overall inventory has been reduced from just under $20 billion one year ago to just under $12 billion today. With our now greater focus as a manufacturing company, we have also consistently reduced our vertical construction cost to build over the past two years, from 2023 to 2025 by approximately 10%. While costs generally have been going up, we have been bringing ours down.\nAdditionally, we have reduced our cycle time from 138 days a year ago to 127 days today, for detached single-family homes. This has enabled us to improve our inventory turn to 2.2 times from 1.6 times last year. These measures tell us that we are now built for materially improved efficiency in the way that we execute our business, and we have a lot of room for additional improvement in each of these areas as well. We have certainly positioned Lennar for the time when market conditions normalize and our margins improve, and they will improve dramatically. We always keep in mind that incentives in normalized market conditions run in the 4% to 6% range, as opposed to the 14% incentives today. That gap defines our opportunity as market conditions change. The second item is that we have now officially completed the Millrose transaction.\nThis quarter, Lennar launched and completed the split-off exchange offer to swap our remaining 20% stake in Millrose, approximately 33.3 million shares for outstanding Lennar shares tendered by our stockholders. While this transaction resulted in a $156 million one-time paper loss, this paper result was simply a function of the book value of the shares on Lennar's books on the day of the trade versus the stock price of the trade. More consequentially, this transaction resulted in an approximately 8 million share cashless repurchase of Lennar shares. Finally, and before I conclude, let me briefly talk about our operating team as Jon retires. As you all know, here at Lennar, we have a deep bench of experienced professionals who have been here at the company for many years. Of course, Jon has been an important part of the execution and culture at Lennar.\nThat means that many of our leaders have worked together and together with Jon, and are very prepared to pick up where Jon leaves off. Specifically, Jim Parker and David Grove, both tenured regional presidents, will each oversee operations for about one half of the country, and they have and will continue to work cooperatively. Additionally, Greg McGuff will move from his regional president position to a new leadership role, taking on strategic corporate functions. Greg will begin by working on our land banking programs, by refining the execution around that very strategic part of our business. All three of these leaders, Jim, David, and Greg are very enthusiastic about their new opportunities to perform and in their new positions, and they are anxious to get started. That doesn't mean they're kicking me out, Jon.\n\nJon Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO and President, Lennar\n\nIt's good to know.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nWe will not be hiring a replacement for Jon, because the experienced leadership from within the company is part of the Lennar culture, and are all three capable and qualified to carry the company forward without missing a step. Let me conclude by saying that while this has been another difficult quarter in the housing market, it's another very constructive quarter for Lennar. While the short-term road ahead might seem choppy still, we are very optimistic about our future. We are well aware that our numbers aren't where we'd like them to be, but neither are market conditions. We are very well-positione,d with a strong, growing national footprint, growing community count, and growing volume. We have continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we all know persists across our markets.\nAs we have driven growth, production, and volume, we have positioned our company to evolve and create efficiencies, and technologies that will make us a better company and built for the future. We have materially reduced our inventory, our construction costs, and our cycle times and we have and will continue to increase our inventory turn. We are determined to build more with less capital deployed, so that as margin begins to grow, our returns on capital and equity will grow even faster.\nIn that regard, we will focus on and refine our manufacturing model, and continue to use our land partnerships to grow with a focus on cash flow and high returns on capital and equity. Additionally, our strong balance sheet and strong land banking relations afford us flexibility and advantage opportunity to consider, and execute on strategic growth for our future as well. Lennar is extremely well-positioned for the future, and we look forward to keeping you up to date on our progress. With that, let me turn over to Jon.\n\nJon Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO and President, Lennar\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you, Stuart for a very special partnership into Lennar team for what's been an amazing journey. As Stuart described, we remain steadfast in executing our strategy. Every day, we work on driving home building efficiencies in our operations. This execution is reflected in achieving our targeted sales pace, record low cycle times, overall cost reductions and increased inventory turns. Starting with our sales and marketing machine, in Q4, we achieved a sales pace of four homes per community per month, meeting our sales plan. This starts with attracting qualified leads to our digital funnel, followed by rapid, high-quality customer engagement.\nOur average response time for customers submitted RFIs, which we view as a critical metric, dropped to 42 seconds in the fourth quarter, a 12.5% improvement over the third quarter. This responsiveness now extends after hours, with digital agents available to assist customers at any time, even at 2:00AM, if that's when a customer is online looking for their new home. We analyze customer interactions and our RFI responses to drive improvement in the quality of engagement. Improving our speed in responding and the quality of those responses drove a 15% year-over-year increase in appointments in the fourth quarter. Our pricing strategy focuses on continuous evaluation of demand patterns, inventory levels, and price discovery data designed to set the price and incentives for each community to maintain the targeted sales pace. This maximizes sales efficiency and maintains our inventory at appropriate levels.\nAs Stuart noted, we ended the quarter with an average of just under three unsold completed homes per community. This process and the easing of pressure on our sales targets resulted in new order incentives decreasing by 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Next, I'll discuss our volume-oriented production first strategy to drive efficiencies, resulting in reduced construction costs. In the quarter, we maintained a consistent start pace of 3.7 homes per community per month, in line with our expectations. We continue to work throughout our supply chain, using this consistent volume to lower costs quarter after quarter. We continued our focus on plan and SKU optimization, along with a new national bidding software tool that streamlines management of thousands of SKUs in real time. This has enabled faster and more effective decision-making across the company, achieving further cost reductions.\nDirect construction costs in the fourth quarter decreased by approximately 2% from Q3, and over 5% year-over-year. This downward trend will continue as we move into the first quarter of 2026. The average cycle time for single-family detached homes was 127 calendar days, matching our record low from Q3. This represents an 8% year-over-year reduction. With improved quality control and communications with our trade partners, we have reduced cycle times, minimized travel for trades, lowered warranty spend, and improved the customer experience. We saw tangible results with fewer work orders and a 45% year-over-year reduction in warranty spend. This was accomplished while maintaining consistent high-quality home deliveries for our customers, resulting in a highly regarded MPS score of 79 for 2025. Turning to land and our asset-light strategy.\nQ4, we continued to carefully structure land acquisitions for just-in-time land closings, leveraging land bank and land developer relationships to minimize carry cost and deliver just-in-time finished home sites. Our asset-light strategy delivered improved metrics. Supply of owned home sites decreased year-over-year to 0.1 years from 1.1 years, and controlled home sites increased to 98% from 82%. These operational improvements increased our inventory churn 38% from the prior year. In conclusion, our team is united and focused on executing strategies that drive improving customer acquisition results, reduce costs, and enhance operational efficiencies, all while improving the customer experience. These efforts are delivering measurable results, and positioning us for future success. Now I'll turn it over to Diane.\n\nDiane Bessette\n\nChief Financial Officer, Lennar\n\nThank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone. Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our home building operations. Therefore, I'm going to provide a quick summary of our financial services operations, summarize our balance sheet highlights, and then provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Starting with financial services. For the fourth quarter, our financial services team produced operating earnings of $133 million within our guidance range of $130 to 135 million and for the year, generated $610 million.\nOnce again, our financial services team contributed great profitability and most important, worked in partnership with our home building teams to provide a great customer experience for each home buyer. Now let's turn to our balance sheet. This quarter once again we continued to generate cash by pricing homes to market conditions. The result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and total liquidity of $6.5 billion.\nOur year's supply of owned home sites was 0.1 years, and our home sites controlled percentage was 98%. We ended the quarter owning just under 10,000 home sites, and controlling 496,000 home sites for a total count of 506,000 home sites. We believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position, to continue to grow market share and scale in a capital-efficient way. During the quarter, we started about 18,400 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 38,000 homes in inventory. This includes just under 5,000 completed unsold homes, which as we've mentioned, is just under three per community. Our inventory churn increased to 2.2 times, and our return on inventory was approximately 20%. As we turn to our debt position, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion outstanding under our term loan facility and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOur home building debt to total capital was 15.7%. We had no redemptions or repurchases of senior notes this quarter. Our next debt maturity of $400 million is in June 2026. As Stuart mentioned, we successfully completed the divestiture of our Millrose investment by exchanging Millrose shares for Lennar shares. The result was a non-cash repurchase of 8 million Lennar shares. Note that during the exchange period, we were subject to a tender offer rule, which includes an exchange offer that prohibited us from using cash to purchase our shares. However, during the year, we did use $1.7 billion of cash to repurchase 14 million Lennar shares. Thus, in total for the year, we repurchased 22 million shares, valued at $2.7 billion. Additionally, we paid total dividends this quarter of $170 million for a total of $521 million for the year.\nIn the aggregate for fiscal 2025, we returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. Our stockholders' equity was just under $22 billion, and our book value per share was about $89. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with confidence, and financial flexibility as we progress into fiscal 2026. With that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q1 2026 and provide some guidance estimates. Some of these that we've noted, but to start at the top. Starting with new orders, we expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 18,000 to 19,000 homes, as we match production with sales pace. We anticipate our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 17,000 to 18,000 homes, with a continued focus on turning inventory into cash. Our Q1 average sales price on those deliveries should be between $365,000 to 375,000.\nGross margins should be in the range of 15% to 16%. As a reminder, we expense rather than capitalize field expenses. The first quarter is historically the lightest. Since the first quarter is historically the lightest delivery quarter of the year and therefore light on revenues, we lose field leverage. Typically, Q4 gross margins to Q1 gross margins in the following year decrease 100 basis points to 150 basis points, because of this loss of leverage. As it stands now, we believe Q1 gross margins will be the low point of the year. Our SG&A percentage should be around 9.5%, but all of these metrics of course are dependent on market conditions. For the combined home building, joint venture, and land sales and other categories, we expect a loss of approximately $10 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings to be approximately $105 to 110 million.\nFor our multifamily business, we expect earnings of about $20 million, as we continue to strategically monetize assets to generate higher returns. Turning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of about $20 million, excluding the impact of any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments. Our corporate G&A should be about 2.2% of total revenues, and our foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 25.25%, and the weighted average share count should be approximately 245 million shares. On a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $0.80 to $1.10 per share for the first quarter. With that, let me turn it over to the operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. We ask that you limit your questions to one question, and one follow-up question until all questions have been answered. If you would like to ask a question, please unmute your phone, press star one, and record your name clearly when prompted. If you need to withdraw your question at anytime, you may use star two. Again, that is star one to ask a question. Our first question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\n\nAlan Ratner\n\nManaging Director, Zelman & Associates\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details so far.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nGood morning.\n\nAlan Ratner\n\nManaging Director, Zelman & Associates\n\nI think gross margin is obviously on the top of everybody's mind, and you obviously walked through a lot of the moving pieces there. It's encouraging to hear that incentives actually tick lower in the quarter. I know you also gave some encouraging data on your cost reduction. Can you just walk through exactly what's contributing to the continued pressure on margin?\nI know there's the seasonality in Q1, but this quarter's results came in a bit below guidance. I know in the past you've kind of talked about margins maybe stabilizing. I'm just curious if you could walk through exactly what's contributing to the downside, given the improvement or the reduction in incentives. The follow-on to that, I guess more broadly is, if we don't see any material improvement in demand, given your growth expectations for 2026 at 3%, a little bit below your target range you'd given previously, is that an environment where you think you can potentially dial back those incentives further? Thank you.\n\nJon Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO and President, Lennar\n\nYeah. It's Jon. I'll begin. During the quarter, we faced some unexpected headwinds, particularly with the government shutdown, that definitely had an impact on consumer confidence, which is primary to our customer. That definitely challenged our ability to, particularly in some markets, stabilize pricing. We saw some impact in terms of what we accomplished versus what we expected, because of what was happening in real time in the marketplace and it's not consistent. It varies across the country. If you're asking which markets are strongest or weakest? It really ebbs and flows across our markets with just an overall overhang of what's going on in the economy, with the government, and that general customer confidence erosion.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nI think as we started the quarter, the expectation was that with interest rates moving down a little bit, even with consumer confidence somewhat negative, the thinking was, from our divisions, that the incentive structures would come down through the quarter. I think that, it's our feeling that the government shutdown had a material effect on the consumer psychology going through the quarter and reacting real time. Now, does that come back?Aas we look through our numbers, as we go through next year, I think that there's a general view that incentives will be coming down. Layer on top of that, it does seem that the federal government is very focused on coming up with programming that activates affordability. What that's going to look like, I just don't know.\nIt does seem like there's a lot of activity around focusing on this very important part of the economy, so we think that incentives will come down through the year. As we went through this quarter, we definitely hit a headwind across the country. It's pretty consistent, that really brought our incentive expectation to be lower than what we actually ended up with.\n\nAlan Ratner\n\nManaging Director, Zelman & Associates\n\nGot it. I appreciate the detail there. Stuart, you obviously spoke a lot about the administration efforts, and recognizing maybe there's nothing ready to bring public at this point. I'm just curious, do you feel like this is something that will be announced in 2026 and whatever the government does have in mind? Is there anything that can be implemented fairly quickly? Obviously, the midterms are coming up, or is this something that is more of a multi-year view in your mind? Thank you.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nLook, I think the crystal ball around government activity is really complicated, but I can tell you that a number of home builders have gone in to see critical officials within the government. We have received a lot of attention. There's a lot of thought process going on. We've seen trial balloons put out around various types of programs. What's interesting is that the government has been very tuned in to the industry, to make sure that they're not walking into unintended consequences. Whatever is done, that it be constructed properly is important.\nTo your question, do I think that something will come out in 2026? I'd be surprised if something isn't done. I think affordability is very much on the table. It's a political issue right now. I think across the country, you're hearing the drumbeat of that being a primary focal point. Politically, it's important that someone pick up the mantle and do something to address it, rather than just throw money at it. It'll be interesting, and we'll all have to sit back and wait and see what comes out.\n\nAlan Ratner\n\nManaging Director, Zelman & Associates\n\nAppreciate the thoughts. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nNext will go to John Lovallo from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Lovallo\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. The first one, Stuart, is given your strategy of maintaining volume and really focusing intently on cost and efficiency, I'm curious how you envision the upside in your ability to recapture margin as the market improves, particularly considering all the hard work and the changes that have been made over the past few years.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nYeah. Look, that's really at the heart of what we've been doing, is if you buy into the notion that there is a supply shortage, and I think that's pretty well documented, we certainly believe that there is a significant supply shortage. If you believe that there is a pent-up demand that is not able to activate itself because of affordability, and we definitely believe that and see that in our traffic and in the field, then as we maintain volume over time, we're going to figure out and push our large enterprise to re-rationalize its cost structure. That's what we're doing. We've detailed this in prior earnings calls. We're focused on using modern technologies. We're focused on building efficiencies in everything that we do. You see this in every element of our business, how we're re-rationalizing our overhead expense, our vertical construction costs, horizontal construction costs.\nWe think that embedded in our program at 82,500 homes, growing to 85,000 homes, we are going to be an efficient structure as market conditions rethink themselves. At the end of the day, I lay out that there's a pretty clear path to margin improvement. There will be at some point, a reconciliation of incentives that migrates from what is today our 14% down to a traditional kind of 4% to 6%.\nThat's a lot of margin improvement, and we think there's still a lot of efficiency that we're going to bring to our operations as we go forward. It's just a time game, and going to patiently keep pursuing the focus. The core reason that we're focused on building inventory is because the country has such a significant shortage. We're going to continue to be that machine that keeps pushing forward, recognizing the shortage and believing that there's going to be a moment where we're able to activate the buying public, to purchase at prices with lower incentives.\n\nJon Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO and President, Lennar\n\nI'll just add one thought, and that is, as you hear us talk about our operational efficiencies, we think about it as structural, not episodic. As the market does stabilize, does recover, we have really retooled ourselves to maintain these efficiencies that we've worked so hard on achieving.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nYeah. Jon's a good example of that. I mean, we have built efficiencies and effectiveness in our operating group. As Jon retires, we're not going to replace him because we're going to lower the vertical nature of our hierarchy. We're going to take costs out, but we're using modern technologies and homegrown talent to be able to do that.\nFred retired a couple of months ago, same thing there. We have a talent base that can fill that gap, and we don't have to build replacements. A lot of that has to do with the technologies that we've incorporated, that enable us to transmit information more efficiently and effectively to a shallower operational structure.\n\nJohn Lovallo\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThat's helpful color. Thank you, and then embedded in the fiscal year 2026.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\n[inaudible] the bus. Sorry about that. Go ahead.\n\nJohn Lovallo\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nEmbedded in the fiscal year 2026 delivery outlook of 85,000, it's up about 3% year-over-year. How should we think about community account growth versus absorption, and your performance versus the market?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nWe're continuing to focus on community account growth. You've seen our community account grow year over year, at a higher rate than we're going to continue to grow it. If you look at our volume growth, if we look at last year to this year, at 82,500-ish, it's about 3%. We're expecting about a 3% growth rate next year. A lot of that will come from additional community account, and strategic markets across the platform.\nI think that you're going to see a consistent model of execution, if you look backwards, projected forward and that's very much the strategy. The strategy is, let's build the volume that the country and the consumers need. Let's make it affordable at this time where affordability is so strained, and let's find ways to make ourselves more efficient. Let's expect that something's going to come through the governmental ranks to support that affordability, and enable the market to enter the housing market. The reduction in incentives is going to flow through to our margin.\n\nJohn Lovallo\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nNext.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Steven Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Kim\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks very much, guys. Yeah, Stuart had taken the risk of paraphrasing what you're saying, because I know that it's obviously a bit complex. I don't want to oversimplify it, but am I hearing you right that you anticipate that there's the makings for government actions to improve the affordability in some way, shape, or form? If we assume that, which I don't necessarily disagree, Lennar has over the last year or so, really emphasized volume, while others in your peers have back volume?\nAre you saying that in 2026, your expectation is that you've got the volume, you've got therefore the platform to be able to harness margin improvement from lower incentives, without necessarily needing to increase your volume? That you can do that even if others in a somewhat better environment do have to increase their volume, so that you might actually give up a little bit in terms of share, if you will, but your margin will more than make up for that, is that essentially what you're laying out for us in 2026?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nA, that is what we're laying out. That's what we've been laying out. The reality is, we don't have to restart the machine. The machine is actually just running and running very efficiently. We don't have to run out and buy new community account. We're already doing that. We don't have to retool and increase the volumes. We just have to accept a lower incentive structure in order for margin to grow, and that's why I say in my comments that we're just levered to the upside in terms of margin growth.\n\nStephen Kim\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYes, okay. That's really helpful. Very interesting and important. I did also want to follow up on the machine. I think that, when obviously you've been at the vanguard of developing technology and AI-driven tools, so that you can more dynamically respond to market conditions. Obviously, that's been something that's been a big focus.\nIf I listen to the way you talk about the elevation of Jim, David, and Greg into somewhat new roles, but not replacing Jon or Fred, is it right to think that these investments and developments of the, for lack of a better phrase, the Lennar machine, have now reached a point where you can have those systems play a more direct role in managing the business, and that not replacing the co-CEO and COO positions is a function of, or an indication of just how far that machine has come in actually being able to have tangible effects on your business? Is that the right way to think about it? Is essentially the question.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nYeah. I'm going to tread in an area that I promised our friend Rick Beckwitt that I wouldn't tread into, and that is technology, because I feel like you've all gotten worn out with our discussion about technology. We are massively enthusiastic about our technology initiatives, in large part because of the things you've daylighted. If you listen to Jon's comment in the middle of the night, we're at a point where we can engage a customer on their terms at their time, when it's convenient to them with digital technology that gives them an experience that is getting very close to an interpersonal experience. We're going to be able to be faster and better, higher quality in the way that we engage with our customers. I think that we're making this progress.\nIt's not fast, because we don't have the engineering teams that some of these high-tech technology companies have, but we're building them and we're going to get better, faster, and stronger because of the technologies that we incorporate. It's not just in the machine that is marketing and sales machine. It's in our overall customer experience, all the way through to warranty. It is in our land acquisition component. It is in our financial reporting component.\nIt is in our financial services group. Every part of our company has its own unique strategy relative to modern technologies, to not just modernize and be a better interface with our customers, but to be a better interface internally to breed efficiencies and effectiveness that we've not seen before. I think that you're going to see over the next year, two years, you're going to see a lot of those advancements really reveal themselves.\n\nStephen Kim\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nWonderful. We'll be watching. Appreciate that color.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nOkay, goodt.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Rehaut\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nHi, Mike.\n\nMike Rehaut\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase\n\nHi, Stuart. How are you?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nGood, thanks.\n\nMike Rehaut\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase\n\nFirst, I wanted to dive in a little bit towards your approach. Last quarter, your approach to the market, and I know you stressed even on this call, prioritizing supply and making sure that you have the product out there when things turn. Last quarter, you maybe dialed back slightly around that approach, and said you wanted to ease back on your delivery expectations to help establish a floor on margin.\nI don't know if this is exactly the right way to interpret today's results or fourth-quarter results, but your margin did come in a little less than expected despite maybe some of those efforts. There's been a lot of focus on prioritizing supply today. Where are you in that journey of perhaps trying to establish that floor on margin? It seems like if you exclude the seasonality, maybe you're still looking at a slight further erosion in gross margin in Q1 versus Q4. Just trying to triangulate, how committed are you to just pushing through that supply versus if demand remains weak, maybe you would even further continue to ease back on some of your delivery aspirations?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nMike, I think we're pretty committed to the volume and maintaining the volume. I think your assessment is correct, that we had an expectation of finding a little bit more of a floor. I've said consistently in every one of our earnings calls, that the numbers and expectations that we're giving to you are dependent on market conditions. Market conditions are fluid, and they evolve day by day.\nInterest rates have been going up a little bit, down a little bit, down farther a little bit, and then back. It's not just the interest rates. It is the inflation impact, from the spike of inflation that we had a few years ago that is still rippling through the consumer's wallet. It's built up in debt. It's general consumer confidence. I don't want to overstate it because it seems like I'm blaming a hurricane or blaming a weather condition. The government shutdown was relevant.\nThere were a lot of people that were affected there, so that comes about in the middle of a quarter where we made an expectation that lower interest rates would help bring consumer confidence up a little bit. There was an offset to that. Hopefully, the government and its shutdown will then step up, and find a counterbalance and say, \"Okay, we're going to do something to activate consumer confidence and affordability.\"\nWe're ebbing and flowing relative to a dynamic marketplace with an understanding that behind us, there is a supply shortage. There is a demand for the housing. There is a need for affordability. Government action is going to matter here, so we'll see what happens. We are focused on the volume, because it's with the volume that we're able to build the efficiencies that are going to build us into a company for the future.\n\nJon Jaffe\n\nCo-CEO and President, Lennar\n\nMike, I would just add, to state the obvious, we don't control the economy and its impact on our consumer. We've been very laser-focused on becoming a manufacturer of homes. With that, we can really leverage volume technologies to be the most efficient manufacturer that one can be. That's what we remain laser-focused on.\n\nMike Rehaut\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase\n\nAll right. No, I appreciate that. Secondly, you highlighted in your prepared remarks, obviously the ongoing focus of returning cash to shareholders, either through a combination of repurchase and dividends. On the repurchase side, I think you finished up the year around $2.7. How should we think about 2026, now that your balance sheet is significantly repositioned and the much more aggressive move via Millrose to asset-light? Just trying to get any boundaries on numerically, should it be similar to 25 at this point? Should we be modeling something maybe a little higher than that? Just your thoughts, given the fact that you've already outlined a closings number, and you're hoping that the gross margin number will in Q1 be the low point of the year.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nYeah. I'm pretty enthusiastic about looking and seeing what happens in 2026. If you think about the transition that we've made as a company to an asset-lighter model, if you think about the dynamic of all the changes that we've made as we have maintained volume, it's pretty extensive. When I said in my comments that it is noteworthy that we have now completed the Millrose transaction, this has been a few years in the making. It's now behind us.\nA number of other things are behind us, whether it's essential housing and the land banking program that we started with them. It extended to Millrose, and we have a number of other land banks. Less than 5% of our land is on book today. That migration took time, energy, money, focus, and that's behind it. We are now focused on a much more pure manufacturing model, with a lot less energy spent on other things that are the transitional things that got us to where we are. I'm enthusiastic to see how our operations evolve over this next year. We have very high expectations, and we're pretty enthusiastic about it.\nOf course, everything is going to happen in the context of what's happening to the economy, what's happening to consumer confidence, and what's happening to affordability. The government's going to play a role in that. I can't predict what's going to happen there, and so there's variability. For us, as we think about the way that we run our business, it is an everyday hands-on approach to, how do we be the best manufacturing model that we can be?\nIngrained in some of the transitions and evolutions we've gone through, there are still wonderful efficiencies to be reached from the focus and attention on the details that surround those programs. I laid out Greg McGuff's new role. He's starting off with our land banking programs. We've put these things together pretty quickly. There's a lot of efficiency and execution that we can bring to that. These are the kinds of things that 2026 is going to engender. We'll see how it plays out. It's all going to be modified, amplified, or changed by the macroeconomy that we end up playing into. Oh, boy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we'll go to Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Can you hear me?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nAll right. Why don't we take this as the last one?\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Okay. Our last question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Maklari\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Thank you, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nGood morning.\n\nSusan Maklari\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning or good afternoon now, I guess. My first question is thinking about the efficiencies that we've talked a lot about. How do you think of where you can get inventory turns over the next several quarters, given the environment that we are in? Can you hit that three-times number in this condition? Just generally speaking, how does the core product fit into that strategy?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nIt's a great question, because there's a part of me that almost pinches myself when I see our inventory turn at 2.2. There was a time where we didn't think we'd be able to get there. The interesting thing is, given the way that we've reconfigured the company, we think that there's a lot of improvement that can come on top of where we are. A lot of it derives from, number one, cycle time. We are improving our cycle time, and all of this derives back to our core product.\nOur core product offerings are getting more and more efficient, more and more effective in terms of the way that not only, how does the cost structure come in, but more importantly, how do we build and how efficiently do we build product that is very familiar out in the field? Our focus on core has accelerated, and we're still fairly early stages in that regard. I don't want to go through it, but I will tell you that a lot of the ways that we're getting to greater adoption and engagement with our core product is technology-based. It's the technology of how we're looking at land, and how we're adapting to an environment where each piece of land is looked at through the lens of core product.\nWith a diffuse environment, getting that to happen in 50 different divisions, technology is a big part of the assistance, so all of this ties together. We think there's a lot of upside in bringing our inventory turn from where we are to where we think it can be. A lot of it does surround our core product.\n\nSusan Maklari\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, okay. Thank you for that color. Maybe building on Mike's question on uses of cash, as you do think about all the efficiencies that are coming through and that you will realize, how does that play into the cash that you think you need to hold on the balance sheet for the business? Does it change that at all? What are you watching to determine what the appropriate levels are there in terms of the cash?\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nWe think that our model becomes ever more cash flow efficient. We know that over time, we're going to be using cash to buy back stock and to return to shareholders. That's going to be a more programmatic part of our business. One of the things that we've all, I don't know how to say this, but that we've all heard from the government, the government certainly wants to see that we as home builders and as the machine for supplying the homes that are needed in the country, that we're focused on our growth model and focused on how we bring affordability to market. We're going to knit all of this together as we go forward.\nWe're going to see how things evolve. I'm not going to speak to use of cash right now, but that's going to be an evolving picture as we go forward. The bottom line of what I'd say is, as you get to an inventory turn that is higher, as we're producing more volume, and as our margin starts to come back, our cash flow is going to be very, very solid.\n\nDiane Bessette\n\nChief Financial Officer, Lennar\n\nSusan, I would just add relative to your question, on how much do we hold on the balance sheet? It really depends on market conditions, right? You see us have a little bit more cash on our balance sheet when there's uncertainty, and less cash when that uncertainty adds into a more positive direction. Additionally, we look at, what are our upcoming maturities? I would say generally, as conditions stabilize and uncertainty becomes less of a focus, you'll see us holding less on our balance sheet at each quarter end. Hard to determine amounts and don't want to give a goal of a specific amount. It really does depend on market conditions and other things because we have a lot of readily available liquidity. It's just what type of market conditions are we in?\n\nSusan Maklari\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nSure, yeah. All right. Thank you all.\n\nStuart Miller\n\nExecutive Chairman and Co-CEO, Lennar\n\nCongratulations, Jon. You made it through your last earnings call. Congratulations. I want to say to everybody, thanks for joining us today. We're really pretty enthusiastic about our business and our business model. We're proud to be supplying homes to a difficult market, but we think that we are, as I said, levered to the upside in terms of margin improvement and we'll see where the market takes us. Thanks, and we'll see you at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes Lennar's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect your line, and please enjoy the rest of your day."

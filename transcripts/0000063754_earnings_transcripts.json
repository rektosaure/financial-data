This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's third quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, Chairman, President and CEO; and Marcos Gabriel, Executive Vice President and CFO. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides.\nIn our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statement on Slide 2 for more information.\nI'll now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Third quarter top line performance was strong and marked our fifth consecutive quarter of volume-led growth, reflecting our differentiation and the benefit of continued investments in our brands, expanded distribution and innovation. Due to the dynamic global trade environment, our gross margin was further pressured by rising costs. However, our effective execution on efficiency initiatives drove continued operating profit growth. We are executing with discipline on the actions within our control while adapting quickly to the dynamics in the external environment and at the same time, positioning McCormick for sustained long-term growth.\nThis morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our third quarter results, focusing mostly on top line drivers. Next, I will review how McCormick is positioned relative to an evolving consumer landscape for the remainder of this year and into 2026. Then I will highlight some areas of success and the areas we continue to work on as well as our growth plans. Marcos will then go into more depth and review our 2025 outlook, including an update on our tariff exposure and mitigation plans. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments.\nTurning now to our results on Slide 4. In the third quarter, total organic sales increased by 2%, driven by volume growth, primarily in the Consumer segment, in line with our expectations. In Global Consumer, organic sales growth was volume-led and demonstrated continued momentum across key markets and core categories in the Americas and EMEA. In Asia Pacific, our China retail business continued to deliver growth. However, our foodservice business, which is reported within China consumer, faced softer demand due to slower consumption in certain channels such as high-end dining. Despite this unforeseen headwind, we remain confident in a gradual full year recovery in China Consumer for 2025.\nIn Global Flavor Solutions, despite soft industry trends, we grew underlying volumes as we lapped favorable growth related to the timing of customer activities in the prior year in the Americas. Softness in large CPG and branded foodservice customers' volumes was also more than offset by QSR growth in both Americas and Asia Pacific. Also, we are increasingly benefiting from continued momentum in health and wellness categories, driven by both high-growth innovators and private label customers. Lastly, in EMEA, QSR trends began to stabilize, marking an improvement relative to recent periods.\nLet me now share our current view on the state of the Consumer and considerations for 2026. The environment remains challenging across our key markets with market dynamics pointing to continued pressure into 2026. Consumers, especially low to middle income households are adapting to the economic environment by adjusting how they shop, making more frequent trips with fewer items per basket, choosing larger pack sizes to maximize value and stretching meals across a number of occasions. In addition, they continue to cook at home more often and shop the perimeter for fresh foods to help lower overall meal costs. These behaviors reinforce the demand for flavor, particularly in our core categories with Herbs and Spices continuing to lead center of store unit consumption.\nHealth and wellness trends continue to gain momentum. Consumers are preparing healthier, more affordable meals at home while exploring new flavors and culinary creativity. High protein and healthy claims are driving purchase trends across retail and foodservice, alongside growth in functional foods that deliver great taste with added benefits such as protein, fiber, hydration, energy and better sleep. Convenience, paired with flavor exploration remains an area where consumers are willing to pay more and e-commerce growth continues to accelerate across our core categories. These trends are fundamental, long-lasting and support the continued demand for flavor, benefiting both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. With our broad global reach, strong local brands, ongoing innovation and strategic pricing, we're well positioned to meet the needs of consumers and continue to deliver value through flavor.\nAs we address immediate priorities in today's rising cost environment, it's important to reiterate that our strategy remains consistent. We remain committed to delivering volume growth and investing in our brands, technology and digital transformation as we continue to reinforce the structural advantages that will drive our future success. We are balancing volume and profitability. And this year, we expect to offset rising commodity costs and tariffs as much as we can. Our global manufacturing location strategy, resilient supply chain, global sourcing capabilities and collaborative efforts across the organization continue to be competitive advantages, enabling us to mitigate the impact of tariff and tariff-related costs and maintain business momentum. We are absorbing some incremental costs this year, which has a near-term impact on our profitability. This approach enables us to maintain our volume momentum and sustain investment in our growth initiatives while still delivering operating profit growth for the year. As a result, we reaffirmed our volume-led sales growth and expect to deliver at least the midpoint of the range. In addition, we revised our profitability outlook to the low end of the range provided in January. This reflects the updated net impact of rising commodity costs and tariffs since our second quarter call. As we look ahead to 2026 and beyond, we will remain consumer-centric, committed to delivering value, flavor and quality while maintaining our volumes and protecting our profitability.\nLet's move to Slide 5, and let me highlight for the quarter, some of the key areas of success. Across the Global Consumer segment, we continue to successfully execute on our plans. We have held steady or improved share across many core categories in key markets for the last 5 quarters. McCormick branded unit consumption growth continues to outpace the broader edible category in the U.S. In EMEA, unit and dollar consumption are outpacing branded and private label fast-moving consumer goods or FMCG Food.\nLet me provide some additional color. Starting with Spices and Seasonings, we drove strong volume growth across all regions. In the U.S., volume growth continued to outpace private label for the fifth consecutive quarter. In Canada, we continue to grow overall share. In France and Poland, share gains in Spices and Seasonings are contributing meaningfully to EMEA's gains. This quarter, the strong performance in our growing portfolio was supported by the rollout of our new consumer preferred packaging for [indiscernible] as well as increased Frank's RedHot promotions and innovation.\nIn Mustard, we are pleased to see that our plans are continuing to drive great results. For the third quarter in a row, we drove dollar unit volume share gains in the Americas. In EMEA, we drove unit and dollar share gains in Mustard for the last 2 quarters.\nIn Hot Sauce, we continue to achieve good results. In the U.S., we continue to drive unit share gains fueled by expanded distribution as well as investments in differentiated brand marketing and innovation. In the U.K., we accelerated unit consumption, leading to dollar share gains.\nWe continue to make progress on total distribution points or TDPs. In the Americas, we expanded TDPs across Spices and Seasonings, Recipe Mixes, Hot Sauce and Mustard. In the Americas and EMEA, we continue to gain distribution in high-growth channels like e-commerce.\nIn Flavor Solutions, we continue to see strength in our technically insulated high-margin product category, Flavors. In Flavors, in the Americas, we continue to diversify our customer base by winning new customers and gaining share, increasingly benefiting from both high-growth innovators and private label customers. In addition, we are seeing an increase in reformulation projects, particularly with larger customers.\nLastly, we outperformed the industry across many end categories, including Nutrition Bars, Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Beverages, and we continue to win business across Snack Seasonings and Better-for-you categories.\nQSR performance remained strong in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, and volumes have stabilized in EMEA relative to recent trends. In the Americas, performance was driven by innovation, customer growth and continued share gains. In China and Southeast Asia, our customers' new products and promotions continue to drive strong volume growth.\nLet me now touch on some areas where we are seeing some pressure. Starting with Global Consumer. In Recipe Mixes, we continue to demonstrate underlying strength in our [ base business ] and strong consumer loyalty. We saw growth across many product lines. However, total growth was pressured by increased competition in the U.S., particularly within the Mexican Flavor category. We expect these trends to improve as we launch new innovation, gain distribution, leverage our authentic Mexican brands like Cholula and invest behind our brand marketing initiatives. In Asia Pacific Consumer, as I mentioned, the foodservice business faced softer demand in certain channels. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we continue to diversify into high-growth channels and expand our distribution. As a result, we remain confident in a gradual full year recovery in China consumer for 2025.\nMoving to Flavor Solutions. In the Americas and in EMEA, within Flavors, some of our large CPG customers continue to experience softness in volumes within their own businesses. We continue to work on offsetting these trends through innovation and collaboration and by winning new customers. In branded foodservice, foot traffic remains soft, which continues to impact our customers' volumes. We are seeing sequential improvement in our underlying business performance, driven by noncommercial customers. This includes places of employment, hospitals and colleges and universities.\nAs outlined on Slide 6, our growth levers remain consistent to drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. These levers are supported and enhanced through data and analytics as we continue to accelerate our digital transformation. The strength of our base business continues across major markets and core categories. And we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to support our performance for the fourth quarter. I am excited about the growth opportunities ahead.\nIn the Consumer segment, our investments to drive volume growth remain in place, including increased brand marketing, innovation and revenue management initiatives. They have driven strong and differentiated performance over the last 6 quarters. We continue to see strong consumption trends and expect continued volume growth for the fourth quarter. We expect distribution growth, accelerated innovation and renovation across the portfolio, and brand marketing investments to drive increased purchase interest and velocity and support volume performance.\nLet me provide a couple of examples. We are seeing great early results from the relaunch of our McCormick Gourmet line with countertop worthy new packaging, including a [ fiber ] gold cap that seals in freshness, provides a modern look and highlights that we only use the best raw materials. In addition, we secured incremental distribution, which will support strong growth in the fourth quarter.\nIn terms of new products, the Cholula line of [indiscernible] and cooking sauces in addition to our new McCormick [ Finishing Sugars ] that were launched for the holiday season are also yielding great results.\nShifting to EMEA, [ Schwartz Air Fryer ] Seasonings continue to be successful, addressing consumers' increased appetite for air fryer focused seasonings. In addition, our new All-purpose Seasonings are performing well with younger consumers, meeting demand for enhanced flavor without being specific to 1 type of meal.\nLastly, we are excited about the holiday season and are well positioned with our promotion and innovation plans. We are increasing our merchandising levels, supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns and are expecting a strong holiday season.\nMoving now to the Flavor Solutions segment. Starting with branded foodservice. We are leveraging our iconic brands in the Food Away-from-home channel. For example, driving strong growth in Cholula Hot Sauce in the [ front of the house ]and increasingly [ in back the house ], leading to share gains. French's Mustard continues to perform well, with share gains across regional and national chains for the last 4 quarters. Furthermore, we are fueling growth with operator relevant non-trend innovation with products like McCormick [ Black End ] and Korean Barbecue Seasonings, and our flavor of the year, [ Ahamorillo ], as well as Cattlemen's [ Meta Sweet Barbecue Dip ]. Lastly, we are expanding distribution in growing channels, including cash & carry, noncommercial and e-commerce, where we are seeing good momentum.\nShifting to Flavors. We are leveraging our culinary heritage, regulatory, research and innovation and product development expertise to support customers in navigating evolving regulatory environment and meeting consumer needs for health and wellness with innovation. We are seeing an increase in reformulation projects, particularly with large CPG customers. Momentum is building and the execution and impact are expected to materialize over time. This is due to extended validation and launch time lines of these projects.\nIn terms of innovation, we are collaborating with large and emerging brands to flavor energy, hydration, protein-based beverages, protein or fiber snacks and zero sugar drinks. We are increasingly benefiting from growth in Health and Wellness categories, driven by high-growth innovator customers with emerging brands and private label customers. In addition, we are leveraging our expertise in functional ingredients and our technologies to help customers mask off notes or enhance flavors as they add protein across categories, like protein-based snacks. Our win rate in health and wellness-related briefs is strong across our regions, and we continue to dedicate resources to where we have the right to win.\nTo wrap up our growth plans and specifically our view for the remainder of the year, we remain confident in the long-term health of our business, our fundamentals and in delivering on our plans to continue to drive industry-leading differentiated performance.\nNow over to Marcos.\n\nMarcos Mendes Gabriel\n\nDirector\n\nThank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 8. Total organic sales grew 2% for the quarter, driven by volume and mix. This reflects total volume-led growth for the last 5 quarters and underscores our differentiation and ability to drive growth even in a consumer backdrop that remains challenging overall.\nMoving to our Consumer segment on Slide 9. Organic sales increased 3%, driven primarily by volume and mix with minimal benefit from pricing. Consumer organic sales in the Americas grew 3%, with 3% volume growth and flat pricing. Volume growth was strong across our core categories and was driven by our investments in brand marketing, innovation and category management. In EMEA, we grew Consumer organic sales 4%, driven by a 1% increase in volume and 3% increase in price related to targeted actions taken as a result of increased commodity costs. We're pleased with the sustained volume growth in EMEA despite price increases. Consumer organic sales in the Asia Pacific region decreased by 1%. This decline was driven primarily by softness in the foodservice business in China that Brendan mentioned earlier.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 10. Third quarter organic sales were up 1%, driven by price contributions of 1% and flat volume and mix. Volumes for the quarter were impacted by unfavorable comparisons related to the timing of customers' activities in the prior year. Underlying volume was positive for the quarter. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 1%, reflecting a 2% price contribution, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. Our results include the unfavorable comparison I mentioned earlier and reflect a strong performance with faster growing Flavor customers and continued QSR growth, partially offset by softness in CPG customers volumes. The price contribution is primarily related to currency in Latin America.\nIn EMEA, organic sales decreased by 3%, including a 2% decline from price and a 1% impact of lower volume, reflecting soft CPG customers volumes. We're pleased to see that volumes have stabilized in EMEA relative to recent trends. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 6%, with volume growth of 9%, driven by QSR customer promotions and limited time offers, partially offset by price up 3%.\nMoving to Slide 11. Adjusted gross profit margin was down 120 basis points in the third quarter due to higher commodity costs, tariffs and costs to support increased capacity for future growth, partially offset by savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program or CCI. Overall gross margins came in below our expectations as we're seeing incremental cost pressures due to the global trade environment. In the fourth quarter, more of our mitigation efforts will come through, leading to gross margin improvement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A decreased 100 basis points relative to the third quarter of last year, driven by lower employee-related benefits expenses as well as CCI savings, including our SG&A streamlining initiatives, partially offset by continued investments in brand marketing and technology. For the quarter, adjusted operating income increased by 2% with minimal impact from currency. This increase was driven by improved SG&A, partially offset by gross margin and increased investments to drive growth.\nOur third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 16%, and comparable with the year ago period rate of 17%. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete tax items. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter decreased 6% as the strong operational performance from our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, was more than offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso.\nTurning to segment operational results on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment increased 4% or 3% in constant currency. The increase was driven by sales growth and improved SG&A, partially offset by increased tariffs and commodity costs. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income declined by 2%, with minimal impact from currency as we lapped a strong quarter in the prior year and faced increased tariff and commodity costs. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing and improved SG&A. Year-to-date, Flavor Solutions adjusted operating income increased by 10% or 12% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress in expanding our Flavor Solutions operating margin and expect our total adjusted operating margin expansion for the year to be led by this segment.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 13, third quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85, an increase of 2% compared to the year ago period, driven primarily by increased adjusted operating income.\nOn Slide 14, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations through the third quarter of 2025 was $420 million compared to $463 million in 2024. The decrease was driven by higher cash use due to the timing of working capital. We returned $362 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $138 million for capital expenditure. The timing of capital expenditure depends on the phasing of initiatives, including projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, [ advance of digital ] transformation and optimize our cost structure.\nOur priority remains to have a balanced use of cash. This means funding investments [indiscernible] growth, returning a significant portion of cash to shareholders through dividends and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow in 2025, driven by profit and working capital initiatives.\nBefore turning to our outlook, let me provide an update on our tariff exposure and mitigation plans on Slide 15. Since our last earnings call, new and higher tariff rates have been introduced. As the situation remains fluid, it's important to call out [ there are reviews ] reflect tariffs as they currently stand. As you can see on the slide, our current gross tariff costs for 2025 are now expected to be approximately $70 million compared to the $50 million we provided on our last call. Our total gross annualized tariff exposure is now approximately $140 million compared to $90 million we provided previously. For 2025, we continue to expect to offset most of the tariff impact. But it's worth noting that not all of our mitigation efforts are permanent, and this will need to be addressed next year.\nAs we look ahead to 2026, we plan to offset as much of the incremental impact as we can with productivity savings across the P&L, alternative sourcing, supply chain initiatives and, of course, leverage our revenue management capabilities, including pricing. As you know, this is an evolving situation, and we'll continue to monitor how policies impact rates and therefore, our costs. We expect to provide more color on this when we report our fourth quarter results in January and share our outlook for 2026.\nIt's worth noting that we have begun implementing targeted tariff pricing, and we'll be monitoring elasticities to help -- our plans for 2026. As we said, we're taking a very surgical approach to pricing and leveraging robust analytics and planning tools to ensure we maintain volume growth and continue to meet consumers and customers' needs for both value and flavor. [ We stay in agile ] with mitigation plans across all lines of the P&L to protect our profitability.\nIn summary, we see tariffs as a discrete headwind to work through. However, we remain committed to our strategic priorities to continue to drive a healthy top line, invest in the business and maximize our profitability.\nNow let's turn to our updated 2025 financial outlook on Slide 16. We're maintaining our net sales and revising adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year to reflect our updated estimates on the impact of higher commodity costs and tariffs. Overall, in terms of currency, assumptions remain above the same. At the top line, we continue to expect organic net sales growth to range between 1% and 3% and expect to achieve at least the midpoint of our guidance range. Growth remains volume -- and primarily driven by our consumer segment, with Flavor Solutions continuing to be flat for the year. In terms of price, we continue to expect a contribution primarily through the Flavor Solutions segment and tariff-related pricing will mostly come through in the fourth quarter.\nFor China, our outlook continues to assume a gradual recovery and we expect China Consumer sales to improve slightly year-over-year. We saw this come through in the year-to-date period, and we expect it to continue for the rest of the year. In terms of inflation, excluding the impact of tariffs, our estimate has changed for the year to low to mid-single digits compared to low single digits in our prior outlook. Our 2025 gross margin is now projected to be flat for the year compared to our prior guidance of flat to 50 basis points. This reflects elevated costs of commodities and tariffs coming in higher than we had planned. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect gross margins to improve as more of our mitigation efforts will be in place.\nOn SG&A, we expect CCI savings inclusive of our streamlining initiatives to be offset by investments in technology as well as brand marketing to drive volume growth. We continue to invest in brand marketing in line with our guidance, and we're driving more efficiencies through the use of technology as well as our CCI program. Adjusted operating income growth is now expected to be 3% to 5% in constant currency compared to a prior range of 4% to 6%. The decrease of 1 point represents the incremental increase in tariff and commodity costs. It's worth noting that our revised range brackets, the low end of our prior guidance, which was set back in January of this year, prior to the changes in the global trade environment. In addition, we want to maintain a balanced outlook that gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while growing adjusted operating income.\nIn terms of tax, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year compared to 20.5% in 2024 where we benefit from a number of discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat in 2025. Our income from unconsolidated operations is expected to decline in the high single-digit range in 2025, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, which is impacting the strong results of our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. The business continues to perform well and is contributing to our net income and operating cash flow results. We continue to expect to close the McCormick de Mexico transaction early in 2026. In the meantime, we're developing plans to support our integration efforts, and we look forward to providing an update on our fourth quarter call.\nIn summary, our 2025 adjusted earnings per share projection is now $3 to $3.05 compared to a prior guidance of $3.03 to $3.08 on a reported dollar basis, reflecting the impact of our updated adjusted operating income outlook. Year-over-year, adjusted EPS growth is impacted by currency headwinds and increased tax rate compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 6% compared to prior guidance of 5% to 7%.\nIn closing, we remain on track to deliver volume-led constant currency top line growth. Despite higher costs, we're investing in strategically, executing with discipline and driving efficiencies, enabling us to deliver operating profit growth and sustain our differentiation. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our updated 2025 outlook and long-term objectives.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Marcos. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaways on Slide 17. We expect to continue to execute our proven strategies in alignment with consumer trends and with speed and agility. The long-term trends that fuel our attractive categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands are enduring trends. We continue to drive differentiated volume-led top line growth and share gains across our core categories. Our results demonstrate that we are investing in the areas that drive the most value, and we expect to maintain this momentum.\nSimilar to many of our peers, we are facing rising costs due to the global trade environment, and we are leveraging our competitive advantages and cost savings initiatives to lessen the impact of these costs, maintain our volume momentum, fuel our investments and drive profitable growth. Importantly, we view tariffs as a discrete headwind to work through. However, we remain committed to our strategic priorities: sustaining a healthy top line, investing in the business and maximizing profitability. Ultimately, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership.\nFinally, I want to recognize all McCormick employees for their dedication and contributions, and reiterate my confidence that together, we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value.\nNow for your questions."

Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our second quarter performance and the progress we made year-to-date to continue to advance our leadership and differentiation. By focusing on the levers within our control, we are delivering profitable volume-led growth by investing in our brands, expanding distribution, driving innovation and increasing operational efficiencies. McCormick remains a growth-oriented company with robust plans that leverage the demand for flavor and the strength of our brands. As consumer preferences evolve, we continue to execute on our proven strategies in alignment with consumer trends and with speed and agility to capture the demand for flavor and value across all occasions and channels.\nOur results continue to demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments in the areas that we believe will continue to drive the most value and sustain our momentum for the remainder of 2025 and beyond. This morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our second quarter results, focusing mostly on top line drivers. Next, I will review how McCormick is positioned relative to an evolving consumer landscape, including our view on tariffs. Then I will highlight some areas of success and the areas we continue to work on as well as our growth plans.\nMarcos will then go into more depth on the second quarter results as well as review our 2025 outlook, including a discussion of our tariff exposure and mitigation plans. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments.\nTurning now to our results on Slide 4. In the second quarter, total organic sales increased by 2%, primarily driven by volume growth, in line with our expectations. Volume growth of more than 3% in the Consumer segment was partially offset by declines in Flavor Solutions as expected. This was primarily driven by overall softness in customer volumes in packaged food and EMEA quick service restaurants, or QSRs. Although customer demand in parts of our flavor solutions business remains pressured, we are performing better than the trends as we continue to benefit from pockets of growth, from emerging brands and health-driven categories, which are expected to continue to moderate these declines.\nIn Global Consumer, organic sales growth was volume led across all 3 regions demonstrating continued momentum across key markets. This sustained volume growth is supported by investments across our core categories, including innovative brand marketing, accelerated innovation aligned with consumer trends, expanded distribution and robust category management initiatives. In the Americas, we drove volume growth and share gains across core categories.\nIn EMEA, our results reflect select pricing actions to cover rising commodity costs and continued solid volume momentum. In Asia Pacific, our business in China continues to gradually recover in line with our expectations. Let me now share our current view on the state of the consumer and provide our perspective on where tariffs currently stand. Although the environment remains challenged, consumers continue to show resilience across our key markets. They are adapting to economic pressures by adjusting how they shop, making more frequent trips with fewer units per basket, choosing larger pack sizes to stretch their budgets and increasingly using leftovers.\nImportantly, they continue to spend and not compromise on flavor. What's most notable is the continued conversions of 2 enduring trends, value-seeking behavior and a heightened focus on health and wellness. Consumers are cooking at home more. 86% of meal occasions are sourced at home, which remains above prepandemic levels. This shift supports demand for flavorful, fresh and healthy meals that offer both value and health benefits. This is where McCormick plays a critical role. We're not competing for calories. We're flavoring them.\nOur portfolio helps consumers bring creativity and enjoyment to the meals they're already preparing and aligned with how people are eating today, whether it's spices and seasonings, sauces or condiments we enable better, more flavorful meals without adding complexity or cost. With our broad global reach, strong local brands, ongoing innovation and strategic pricing, we're confident that we are well positioned to meet the needs of consumers and continue to deliver value through flavor.\nBefore I discuss highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide a high-level perspective on the current global trade environment and the actions we're taking to manage our business. The global trade environment is increasing the cost of agricultural ingredients we source from outside the United States, which is impacting our cost of sales. We have numerous levers to manage this impact, which is enabling us to maintain our voting led top line growth and operating profit outlook for 2025, inclusive of tariffs.\nFirst, it's important to recognize that we have a global manufacturing footprint designed so that products sold within a region are made locally within that region. Therefore, our tariff exposure is primarily through importing agricultural raw materials, many of which can't be grown or are not commercially available in the United States.\nOur competitors are facing similar challenges. Earlier this year, we formed a cross-functional team dedicated to monitoring trade policy developments and implementing mitigating actions that position us well for both the short term and long term. As a result, we are executing on plans to offset these costs through sourcing plans supported by advanced analytics including alternative sourcing locations for certain raw materials and cost savings and operational efficiencies across the P&L.\nAdditionally, we are collaborating with our customers to implement surgical and strategic pricing while also maintaining our volume momentum. Overall, our manufacturing location strategy, resilient supply chain, global sourcing capabilities collaborative efforts across the organization and the strength of our brands continue to be a competitive advantage, enabling us to mitigate our costs and maintain our business momentum.\nLet's move to Slide 5, and let me highlight for the quarter, some of the key areas of success. Across our Global Consumer segment, we continue to successfully execute on our plans and have driven share gains across our core categories in key markets for the last 3 quarters. Globally, McCormick branded unit consumption continues to outpace edible categories, center store and [indiscernible] growth in the U.S. as well as fast-moving consumer goods growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Let me provide some color on the categories globally. Starting with spices and seasonings, we drove strong volume growth across all regions, leading to volume share across the Americas and EMEA.\nIn the U.S., volume growth continues to outpace private label for the fourth consecutive quarter. In Canada, we continue to grow overall share. And in Poland, share gains in spices and seasonings are contributing meaningfully to EMEA's gains. In recipe mixes, we continue to drive unit volume and dollar growth in the Americas. In Canada, with the strength of our local brands and continued investments, we drove dollar unit and volume share gains. We have plans in place to continue to drive category growth across all of our regions, most notably in the U.K. as we continue to expand distribution.\nIn Mustard, we are pleased to see that our plans are continuing to drive great results. In the second quarter, similar to the first quarter, we drove dollar unit and volume share gains in the Americas. In EMEA, we drove unit and dollar share gains in Mustard. In hot sauce, we are achieving strong results. In the U.S., we drove unit and volume share gains, reflecting significant progress. Continued distribution gains as well as investments in differentiated brand marketing and innovation continue to fuel our performance.\nOutside of the U.S., we are building distribution in new markets within EMEA. We continue to make progress on total distribution points or TDPs. In the Americas, we significantly expanded TDPs across spices and seasonings, recipe mixes and hot sauce. In EMEA, we are gaining distribution in high-growth channels like e-commerce. In Asia Pacific, our business in China is recovering gradually relative to the prior year as expected. We delivered strong performance growth in our categories, including spices and seasoning and condiments continues to outpace the market.\nMoving to Flavor Solutions. We continue to see strength in our technically insulated high-margin product category, flavors. In Flavors, in the Americas, we remain focused on being the partner of choice across 4 taste competencies: Savory, heat, naturally sweet and citrus and fruit. As a result of this continued focus, we are winning new customers and gaining share. We outperformed the industry across many end categories, including alcoholic beverages as well as salty snacks and bars.\nWe continue to win business across beverage flavors and snack seasonings, and we are working through product reformulations with some of our customers to meet regulatory and consumer needs. QSR performance remains strong in both the Americas and Asia Pacific. In the Americas, performance was driven by innovation, customer growth and continued share gains. In China and Southeast Asia, our customers' new products and promotions continue to drive strong volume growth. Let me now touch on some areas where we are seeing pressure.\nIn the Americas and in EMEA within flavors, some of our large CPG customers continue to experience softness in volumes within their own businesses. We continue to work on offsetting these trends through innovation and collaboration with our customers and by winning new customers. While our food away-from-home performance continues to outpace the industry, we are seeing flat performance in branded foodservice in the Americas as some of our customers are seeing softness in their volumes due to continued slowdown in foot traffic.\nQSR traffic remains soft in EMEA. We have seen this pressure impact our results for several quarters, and it is difficult to predict QSR traffic, particularly as some of our customers were impacted by geopolitical boy cuts related to the conflict in the Middle East. We continue to collaborate with customers as they focus on improving their volumes through innovation and value and align with consumer trends.\nAs outlined on Slide 6, our growth plans remain consistent to drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. Our growth levers are supported and enhanced through data and analytics as we continue to accelerate our digital transformation. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories. And we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to support our differentiated performance for the second half of the year.\nIn the consumer segment, our investments to drive volume growth remain in place, including increased brand marketing, innovation and revenue management initiatives. They have driven our strong and differentiated performance over the last 5 quarters. While we are starting to lap this performance, we continue to see strong consumption trends and expect continued volume growth.\nIn the back half of the year, we expect our distribution growth, accelerated innovation and renovation across the portfolio to drive increased purchase interest and velocity and support our strong volume performance. Let me provide a couple of examples. This quarter, we started to roll out our preferred consumer packaging across our drilling portfolio in time for the grilling season. We are energized for the grilling season and expect our newly launched flavor is calling marketing campaign to drive incremental consumer demand.\nLater this fiscal year, in alignment with consumer preferences, we are relaunching the gourmet line with countertop worthy new packaging including a vibrant gold calf that seals in freshness provides a modern look and highlights that we only use the best raw materials. In terms of new products, we are expanding our [indiscernible] line into [indiscernible] and cooking sauces. We are launching new limited time offer finishing salts this summer and new finishing sugars for the holiday season, which build on last year's successful finishing sugars offer.\nIn EMEA, we are expanding across multiple markets with our air fryer seasonings, which continue to be successful in the U.K. by addressing consumers' increased appetite for air fryer focused seasonings. In addition, in EMEA, we are launching our new all rounder seasonings. This innovation addresses the desire from younger consumers for enhanced flavor without being specific to one type of meal.\nMoving now to our Flavor Solutions segment. Starting with branded foodservice, where we leverage the equity of our iconic brands that consumers love in the away-from-home channel. We continue to fuel growth with operator relevant and on trend innovation. For example, we are beginning to see on menus, the 2025 flavor of the year, [indiscernible] seasoning. In addition, we continue to focus on reaching consumers and operators through increased branded menu placements and with our new online shop called McCormick For Chefs, which launched early this quarter.\nShifting to flavors. We are leveraging our culinary heritage and deep expertise in natural flavors and ingredients to support innovation with existing customers to ensure their products meet regulatory changes and preferences of health-conscious consumers. And we are winning new high-growth customers, which will help offset the softness we are seeing from center store CPG customers. We are collaborating with large and emerging brands to flavor energy, hydration, protein-based beverages and 0 sugar drinks.\nIn addition, we are leveraging our expertise in functional ingredients and our technologies to help our customers mask off notes or enhance flavors as they add protein across categories, like protein-based snacks. Our win rate with health and wellness-related briefs is strong across our regions, and we continue to dedicate resources to where we have the right to win. To wrap up our growth plans and specifically our view on the second half, we remain confident in the long-term health of our business, our fundamentals and delivering on our plans to continue to drive industry-leading differentiated performance.\nNow over to Marcos.\n\nMarcos Mendes Gabriel\n\nDirector\n\nThank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 8. Total organic sales grew 2% for the quarter, driven by volume and mix. This reflects total volume-led growth for the last 4 quarters and underscores our differentiation.\nMoving to our consumer segment on Slide 9. Organic sales increased 3%, driven by volume and mix. Consumer organic sales in the Americas grew 3% with 4% volume growth, partially offset by a 1% decrease in price related to targeted incremental promotions. The volume growth was strong across our core categories and was driving our investments in brand marketing, innovation and category management. In EMEA, we grew consumer organic sales 3%, driven by a 2% increase in volume and a 1% increase in price, related to targeted actions taken as a result of increased commodity costs.\nWe're pleased with the strong sustained volume growth in EMEA. Consumer organic sales in the Asia Pacific region increased by 4% driven by volume. This growth reflects the gradual recovery we expected in China. We're pleased with our performance and expect these trends to continue in the second half of 2025. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 10. Second quarter organic sales were flat with a 1% contribution from price, offset by 1% decline in volume and mix. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 1%, reflecting a 2% price contribution, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume.\nOur results reflect a strong performance with faster growing flavor customers and continued QSR growth, offset by softness in CPG customers volumes. The price contribution is primarily related to currency in Latin America. In EMEA, organic sales decreased by 7% including a 5% impact of lower volume and a 2% decline from price, reflecting the impact of soft CPG and QSR customers volumes, which were impacted by geopolitical boycotts related to the Middle East concept.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 3% with volume growth of 5%, driven by QSR customer promotions and limited time offers, partially offset by price of 2%.\nMoving to Slide 11. Gross profit margin was flat in the second quarter versus the year ago period, driven by costs to support increased capacity for future growth and higher commodity costs, partially offset by savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program, or CCI. While we would have expected gross margins to improve relative to the prior year, we're seeing increased cost pressure caused primarily by the global trade uncertainty.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A decreased relative to the second quarter of last year driven by the shift in timing of our stock-based compensation expense as well as savings from CCI, including our SG&A streamlining initiatives. For the quarter, adjusted operating income increased by 10%. Excluding the impact of currency, adjusted operating income increased by 11%. This increase was driven by CCI savings, including our SG&A streamlining initiatives, partially offset by gross margin and increased investments to drive growth, most notably in digital as well as our sustained investments in brand marketing.\nOur second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 24% compared to 14% in the year ago period. Our tax rate in the prior year benefited from a higher level of favorable discrete tax items relative to the current year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the second quarter increased 17%, primarily due to strong operational performance from our largest joint venture, McCormick [indiscernible], partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso.\nTurning to our segment operational results on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment increased 10% with minimal impact from currency. The increase was primarily driven by improved SG&A expenses. In Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 10% or 13% in constant currency, driven by product mix, pricing and improved SG&A expenses. We continue to make progress in expanding our operating margins in line with our objectives. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 13, second quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 and comparable with the year ago period.\nThe benefits from operating profit and unconsolidated income growth were offset by lower gross margin and a less favorable tax rate relative to the prior year. On Slide 14, we'll summarize highlights for cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations through the second quarter of 2025 was $161 million compared to $302 million in 2024. The decrease was driven by higher cash used due to the timing of working capital. We returned $242 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $85 million for capital expenditures.\nNote that the timing of capital expenditures fluctuates on a quarterly basis dependent on the phasing of initiatives, including projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash. This means funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion of cash to shareholders through dividends, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow in 2025 and driven by profit and working capital initiatives.\nBefore turning to our outlook, let me provide some details on our tariff exposure and mitigation plans on Slide 15. First, it's important to reiterate their views reflect tariffs as they currently stand. It is also worth calling out that we purchased over 17,000 unique materials from over 90 countries and no single commodity has a disproportional material impact on our cost of goods sold. Importantly, we have also focused over the last number of years on decreasing our reliance on any one geography.\nAcross the U.S., Canada, China and our largest markets in Europe, more than 85% of what we sell in those countries is made in those countries, specifically in the U.S., it's more than 90%. As you can see on the slide, we expect to fully offset the impact of current tariff costs for 2025. In addition, our plants will not have a significant impact on our sales volume outlook for the year. Our total gross annualized tariff exposure is approximately $90 million. And in terms of 2025, in-year exposure, it's about $50 million. We are offsetting a significant portion of this impact with sourcing plans, supported by advanced analytics and CCI savings. The remainder will be offset through revenue management initiatives.\nAs we said, we're taking a very targeted and surgical approach to pricing and leveraging robust analytics and planning tools to ensure we maintain volume momentum and continue to meet consumers and customers' needs for both value and flavor. In addition to the direct costs from tariffs, we're seeing elevated pressure on cost of certain commodities due to the global trade environment. We have seen this impact our second quarter, and we expect it to continue for the remainder of the year. We plan to mitigate this impact primarily through SG&A savings.\nNow let's turn to our 2025 financial outlook on Slide 16. We are maintaining our net sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends, and drive long-term profitable growth while appreciating the current level of uncertainty in the consumer and macro environment.\nOverall, in terms of currency, our assumptions remain the same. At the top line, we continue to expect organic net sales growth to range between 1% and 3% and for our growth to be volume-led and primarily driven by our consumer segment. Flavor Solutions volumes are now expected to be flat for the year. In terms of price, we expect a slightly higher contribution primarily through the Flavor Solutions segment and some tariff-related pricing will come through in the fourth quarter. For China, our outlook continues to assume a gradual recovery, and we expect China's consumer sales to improve slightly year-over-year.\nWe saw this come through in the past 2 quarters and we expect it to continue for the rest of the year. Our 2025 gross margin is now projected to range between flat to up 50 basis points for the year compared to prior guidance of 50 to 100 basis points. This reflects elevated cost of certain commodities coming higher than we had planned, as I mentioned earlier.\nAs we look ahead to the second half, we expect year-over-year gross margin expansion to be weighted towards the fourth quarter, driven by the timing of certain mitigation efforts. On SG&A, we expect CCI savings, inclusive of our streamline initiatives to be partially offset by investments in technology as well as brand marketing to drive volume growth. We continue to invest in brand marketing and we're driving more efficiencies through the use of technology as well as our CCI program. As a result, our adjusted operating income growth expectations remains 4% to 6% in constant currency.\nYear-to-date, our adjusted operating income grew 4% on a constant currency basis, in line with our expectations and implies higher level of growth for the second half compared to the first half. We want to maintain a balanced outlook that gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while expanding margins. In terms of tax, we expect our tax rate to be between 22% and 23% for the year. compared to 20.5% in 2024, where we benefited from a number of discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat in 2025.\nOur tax rate is slightly higher than our prior guide due to changes in the benefit from discrete tax items. We expect our income from unconsolidated operations to decline in the high single-digit range in 2025, reflecting the strengthening of the dollar against the Mexican peso, which is impacting the strong operational results of our largest joint venture, McCormick [indiscernible]. The business continues to perform well, and is contributing to our net income and operating cash flow results.\nIn summary, our 2025 adjusted earnings per share projection of $3.03 to $3.08 on a reported dollar basis reflects currency headwinds and impact of the increased tax rate relative to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS is still expected to grow between 5% and 7%. In closing, the strength of our performance underscores that our plans are yielding results and sustaining our differentiation. We're pleased that we're maintaining our volume-led momentum and expanding operating margins in 2025. They certainly work ahead for 2026 to offset the continued headwinds and sustain our strong business momentum. We believe we have the right plans and capabilities in place and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and in delivering on our 2025 financial outlook and long-term objectives.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Markus. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaways on Slide 17. We expect to continue to execute on our proven strategies in alignment with consumer trends and with speed and agility. The long-term trends that fuel our attractive categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands are enduring trends. We continue to drive differentiated volume-led top line growth and driving share gains across our core categories. Our results demonstrate that we are investing in the areas that drive the most value, and we expect to maintain this momentum. .\nAdditionally, we are well positioned with our robust CCI and cost savings plans to mitigate tariff-related costs in 2025, fuel growth investments and expand operating margins. Our performance historically and over the last few quarters, coupled with our growth plans give us confidence in achieving our near- and long-term objectives. Ultimately, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership.\nFinally, I want to recognize all McCormick employees for their dedication and contributions and reiterate my confidence that together, we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value. Now for your questions."

This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's first quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, Chairman, President and CEO; and Marcos Gabriel, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nToday's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other matters. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nI'll now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to start the year with solid first quarter results that are in line with our expectations. Our performance continues to demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments in the areas that we believe will continue to drive the most value and sustain our momentum for the remainder of 2025 and beyond.\nMcCormick remains a growth-oriented company with robust plans that leverage the demand for flavor and the strength of our brands. Our strategies have proven to be effective by driving growth and compounding that growth over the years. With our strategies and best-in-class leadership, we are well positioned to continue on our trajectory and deliver on our near-term and long-term objectives with industry-leading performance.\nThis morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our first quarter results, focusing mostly on top line drivers. Next, I will review how McCormick is positioned relative to an evolving consumer landscape. Then, I will highlight some areas of success and the areas we continue to work on as well as our growth plans. Marcos will then go into more depth on the first quarter results and review our 2025 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments.\nTurning now to our results on Slide 4. In the first quarter, total organic sales increased by 2%, primarily driven by volume and product mix growth, and partially offset by pricing in line with our expectations. In Global Consumer, organic sales growth was volume-led, demonstrating continued momentum across key markets.\nWe delivered robust volume growth in all 3 regions. This sustained growth is supported by investments across our core categories, including innovative brand marketing, accelerated innovation aligned with consumer trends, expanded distribution and robust category management initiatives.\nAs expected, volume growth was partially offset by price. In the Americas, price declined due to price gap management plans that were implemented in the second quarter of 2024, and a targeted incremental promotion related to seasonal recipe mixes. In EMEA, we took selective pricing actions to cover rising commodity costs and still maintained volume momentum. For the year to go, we expect price in our Global Consumer segment to be flat.\nNow to the Global Flavor Solutions segment, where organic sales growth was also volume led. We delivered sequential volume improvement relative to the fourth quarter and are pleased with our results. Volume growth was driven by continued execution of our strategic priorities in flavors amid a challenging customer environment. Faster growing customers partially offset larger CPG customer softness.\nIn addition, QSR customer performance improved in Asia Pacific and the Americas, led by innovation. Furthermore, across Asia Pacific, including China, we delivered strong volume growth as we partnered with QSR customers on new products and limited time offers.\nConsistent with prior years, we expect Flavor Solutions volume growth to fluctuate quarterly due to timing of customer activities. However, on a full year basis, we continue to expect to deliver positive volume growth.\nFrom a profitability perspective, we delivered results in line with our expectations, as the first quarter was impacted by increased investments in marketing and technology as well as the timing of stock-based compensation expense that shifted relative to the prior year. As we look to the year-to-go period, we remain confident in our operating income and earnings growth outlook on a constant currency basis.\nMoving down to the macro environment, including the current state of the consumer. There is increasing consumer uncertainty and concern over returning to more inflation, and this has impacted consumer sentiment, particularly in the last month. This prolongs the consumer context of 2024, where consumers, especially lower income consumers, are more cautious, exhibiting more value-seeking behavior and tightening their budgets. As many are worried about the future, job security and rising costs, we are seeing this not just in the U.S. but across our key markets.\nAt the same time, we are all witnessing shifts in consumer preferences. They are becoming more health conscious, and this trend has continued to gain momentum. They are cooking at home more often and increasingly shopping the perimeter for protein and produce. As we look at growth in edible categories, unit growth is primarily driven by these perimeter categories.\nHealthier and better-for-you trends as well as the desire to stretch budgets are fueling a continued interest in cooking from scratch, reinforcing the demand for flavor and for McCormick's categories. Spices and Seasonings remain the top growing center store category. As a result, consumption trends in our business remain strong. Ultimately, we expect the Global Consumer segment to continue to benefit from these secular trends, and we have the plans and advantaged portfolio to capitalize on them.\nAnd in our Flavor Solutions segment, we continue to partner with customers to launch new products or reformulate existing ones to fit healthier lifestyles. Furthermore, our exposure to faster-growing customers allows us to win in several high-growth categories, many of which are benefiting from the trends towards healthier eating.\nIn the context of this environment, McCormick's trends remained strong. Our volume-driven first quarter results and continued strength in consumption trends demonstrate our ability to continue to successfully meet our objectives for the year.\nWe continue to monitor consumer trends. Our focus remains on meeting consumers and customers where they are, delivering value, expanding our presence in growing channels, including -- and e-commerce, and aligning them with flavor as well as helping customers innovate to meet consumers' changing dietary needs.\nWe believe we have the right plans in place, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on secular trends and continue to drive differentiated long-term growth across both of our segments.\nLet's move to Slide 5, and let me highlight for the quarter, some of the key areas of success. Across our Global Consumer segment, we successfully executed on our plans with increased investment and competitive focus towards driving growth. We improved unit and volume share gains across our core categories in key markets. In the U.S., the vast majority of our categories are growing unit share.\nLet me provide some color on the categories globally. Starting with Spices and Seasonings. In Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, including China, we delivered strong volume growth. In the U.S., we drove unit and volume share growth, outpacing private label for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, we drove market share in Canada and China.\nIn recipe mixes, we continue to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas and drove unit and volume share gains in the first quarter. In the U.S., McCormick gravy and chili recipe mixes were a significant growth driver as they deliver on the value and convenience consumers are seeking. In addition, we are outpacing the total category in total new buyers as well as dollars per buyer. In Canada, we drove dollar unit and volume share gains.\nIn mustard, we made great progress globally over the last 4 quarters and are pleased to see that our plans are driving great results. In the first quarter, we drove dollar, unit and volume share gains in the Americas. In Poland, one of the top mustard consuming countries, our mustard consumption continues to grow, and we are also realizing dollar share gains. In addition, we are gaining dollar share in the U.K.\nIn hot sauce, our plans continue to yield great results. In the U.S., we drove positive unit share gains reflecting significant progress. Distribution gains as well as investments in differentiated brand marketing, including a strong bow activation,and innovation, continue to fuel our performance. Outside of the U.S., we are gaining market share in France, the U.K. and Australia.\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress on total distribution points. In the Americas, we significantly expanded TDPs of our Spices and Seasonings, recipe mixes and hot sauce in the Americas. In EMEA, we are seeing broad-based distribution gains in Spices and Seasonings and hot sauce. We are also gaining distribution in high-growth channels like discounters and e-commerce.\nIn Asia Pacific, our business in China is recovering gradually relative to the prior year, as expected. We delivered strong performance amid a continually challenged environment. Growth in our categories, including spices and seasonings and condiments outpaced the market, which included the Chinese New Year holiday.\nMoving to Flavor Solutions. We saw strength in our technically insulated high-margin product category, Flavors. In Flavors, in the Americas, we remain focused on being the partner of choice across our 4 taste competencies: savory, heat, naturally sweet and citrus and fruit. As a result of this continued focus, we are winning new customers and gaining share.\nWe outperformed the industry across many end categories, including alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages as well as snacking bars. Partially offsetting this is the softness we continue to see in larger CPG customer volumes.\nQSR trends improved in the Americas and in Asia Pacific. In the Americas, we are continuing to drive innovation with our customers, driving volume growth amid soft book traffic. In China and Australia, our customers new products and promotions are driving strong volume growth. In Southeast Asia, volume growth benefited from our customers lapping the impact of geopolitical boycotts in the prior year.\nLet me now touch on some areas where we are seeing some pressure. The areas of pressure are primarily in our Flavor Solutions business. In the Americas and in EMEA, some of our CPG customers continue to experience softness in volumes within their own businesses. We continue to work on offsetting these trends through innovation and collaboration with customers and by winning new customers.\nThe foodservice environment remains challenged. While our food away-from-home performance continues to outpace the industry, we are seeing flat performance in branded foodservice in the Americas, as well as some of our customers are seeing softness in their volumes due to a slowdown in foot traffic.\nQSR traffic remained soft in EMEA. We have seen this pressure impact our results for several quarters. It's difficult to predict QSR traffic. However, we are collaborating with our customers as they focus on improving their volumes through innovation and value and align with consumer trends.\nAs outlined on Slide 6, our growth plans remain consistent to drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, our proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. Our growth levers are supported and enhanced through data and analytics as we continue to accelerate our digital transformation. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories. And we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation.\nLet me focus on brand marketing as our plans across all categories are supported by our global brand marketing initiatives. We are prioritizing investments to connect with consumers and fuel growth. Our differentiated brand marketing is driven by a combination of factors.\nIn addition to maintaining a high share of voice, we are committed to having the best content in our categories, content that inspires and educates consumers and reaches them at the right points on their path to purchase and on their flavor or diet journey, from flavor exploration to menu planning, to shopping and cooking and even to eating and sharing the experience online.\nIn the first quarter, brand marketing spend increased against the high spend in the prior year as expected. This increase was broad-based and a key driver in supporting volume growth for this quarter as well as for maintaining our volume momentum for 2025. Through our efforts across multiple channels and by leveraging our digital capabilities, we are driving further household penetration and increasing buy rates across our core categories.\nOur holiday campaigns across our regions proved successful. Our marketing campaigns in the Americas highlight our everyday value, innovation and point of difference to consumers, and are supporting our volume growth and driving share gains. Our Frank's Super Bowl activation campaign with Paris Hilton was very successful. We gained new buyers, and media and consumer sentiment was incredibly positive.\nTo wrap up our growth plans, although we are navigating in a difficult environment, we remain confident in the long-term health of our business and in our fundamentals, and in delivering our 2025 financial outlook on both near-term and long-term objectives. We remain focused on investing behind our growth levers to continue to drive differentiated performance.\nNow over to Marcos.\n\nMarcos Mendes Gabriel\n\nDirector\n\nThank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 8. Our total organic payers grew 2% for the quarter. This increase was volume led, with more than 2% volume and product mix growth, partially offset by pricing.\nMoving to our Consumer segment on Slide 9. Organic sales increased 1% as volume growth of 3% was partially offset by a 2% impact of pricing investments. Consumer organic sales in Americas was flat, 3% volume growth was offset by price investments. Volume growth was strong across our core categories and was driven by our investments in brand marketing, innovation and category management.\nIn terms of pricing, the decline primarily reflects the price gap management investments that were mostly in place in the second quarter of 2024, as well as incremental and targeted promotional activities.\nIn EMEA, we grew consumer organic sales 4%, driven by a 2% increase in volume and 2% increase in price. The volume goes broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We're pleased with the strong sustained volume growth in EMEA. As Brendan mentioned, we took selected pricing actions in EMEA to offset commodity costs.\nConsumer organic sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 3% driven by a 2% increase in volume and 1% contribution from price. This growth reflects the gradual recovery we expect in China. We're pleased with our performance and expect these trends to continue through 2025.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 10. First quarter organic sales increased 3%, driven by volume growth of 2% and a 1% contribution from price. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 4%, reflecting 3% price contribution and 1% volume growth. Our results reflect a strong performance with faster growing flavor customers and improved QSR growth, which were partially offset by soft CPG customer volumes. The price contribution is primarily related to currency in Latin America.\nIn EMEA, organic sales decreased by 4%, including a 2% decline from price and a 2% impact of lower volume and product mix, reflecting the impact of soft CPG and QSR customer volumes. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 15%, with volume growth of 16%, driven by QSR customer promotions, limited time offers as well as new products, partially offset by pricing.\nMoving to Slide 11. As expected, gross profit margin expanded by 20 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by the benefits from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, or CCI. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by a shift in timing of our stock-based compensation expense from the second quarter into the first quarter, as well as increased investments in technology and marketing as expected.\nFor the quarter, adjusted operating income declined by 5%. Excluding impact of currency, adjusted operating income decreased by 3%. This decline was driven by the increased SG&A expenses I just mentioned. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22%, compared to 26% a year ago period. Our tax rate this past quarter benefited from discrete tax items.\nOur income from unconsolidated operations in the first quarter declined 18% and primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso.\nTurning to our segment operational results on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment decreased 17% or 16% in constant currency. The decrease was primarily due to pricing and increased SG&A costs, including brand marketing and technology investments, partially offset by cost savings generated by our CCI program. Looking ahead, we expect Consumer adjusted operating income margin expansion to normalize in the year-to-go period.\nIn Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 28%, and or 33% in constant currency, driven by product mix, pricing and CCI cost savings, partially offset by increased SG&A costs. We continue to make progress in expanding our operating margins in line with our objectives.\nThe bottom line, as shown on Slide 13, first quarter 2025 adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 as compared to $0.63 for the year ago period. This decrease was primarily due to the SG&A increase I mentioned earlier, as well as the increasing impact of currency on our operating profit and unconsolidated results, partially offset by a more favorable tax rate. The impact of currency on adjusted earnings per share is about $0.03 per share.\nOn Slide 14, we show the highlights for cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2025 was $116 million compared to $138 million in 2024. The decrease was driven primarily by higher cash used for working capital, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nWe returned $121 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used $37 million for capital expenditures. Note that the timing of capital expenditures would fluctuate on a quarterly basis, depending on the phasing of initiatives equaling projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure.\nOur priority remains to have a balanced use of cash. This means funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion of cash to shareholders through dividends and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow in 2025 driven by profit and working capital initiatives.\nNow turning to our 2025 financial outlook on Slide 15. We are maintaining our guidance for the year. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term profitable growth, while appreciating the current level of uncertainty in the consumer and macro environment.\nFirst, let me address tariffs. As you know, the situation remains fluid. At this time, we plan to offset costs related to U.S. import tariffs on China with our CCI savings and some very targeted price adjustments. Our focus remains on safeguarding the health and competitiveness of our brands, sustaining the growth moment in our business and maintaining transparency with our customers.\nWe don't believe our current planned actions will be material to the total business or will have a significant impact on our volume mix outlook for the year. That said, due to continued uncertainty on this topic, our outlook does not include any additional impacts from tariffs that could potentially be implemented this year. As things evolve, we will provide updates on our outlook within our typical reporting basis.\nTurning now to the details of our outlook. Currency rates are still expected to have a 1 point negative impact on both net sales and adjusted operating income and 2 points on adjusted earnings per share. At the top line, we continue to expect organic net sales growth to range between 1% and 3%, and for growth to be volume led. In the year-to-go, we expect to deliver total volume growth across both segments, and for total pricing to be flat to slightly positive, primarily driven by Flavor Solutions.\nFor China, our outlook assumes a gradual recovery, and we expect China consumer sales to improve slightly year-over-year. We saw this come through this past quarter, and we expect it to continue for the rest of the year.\nOur 2025 gross margin is still projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2024. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from product mix and cost savings from our CCI program, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation. Consistent with historical trends, we expect our gross margin expansion to build throughout the year.\nIn addition to our gross margin expansion, we expect SG&A benefits from cost savings to be partially offset by investments in technology as well as brand marketing to drive volume growth. For the year, we expect our brand marketing spend to increase in the high single digits, reflecting a double-digit increase, partially offset by anticipated CCI savings.\nAs a result, our adjusted operating income is expected to grow 4% to 6% in constant currency. Similar to our gross margin trends, we expect growth in our operating income to build throughout the year. This remains a balanced outlook that gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business, while expanding margins in line with our 2028 objectives.\nIn terms of tax, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year compared to 20.5% in 2024, where we benefited from a number of discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat in 2025. We expect our income from unconsolidated operations to decline in the mid-teens range in 2025, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, which is impacting the results of our largest joint venture, McCormick and the Mexico.\nTo summarize, our 2025 adjusted earnings per share projection of $3.03 to $3.08 on a reported dollar basis reflects current steel headwinds and the impact of increased tax rate relative to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, our adjusted EPS is still expected to grow between 5% and 7%.\nTo wrap up, our continued volume growth underscores that our plants are yielding results and sustaining this differentiated performance. Looking ahead, our cost savings programs will continue to fuel our investments and drive margin expansion. And we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and in delivering on our 2025 financial outlook, near-term and long-term objectives.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Marcos. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaways on Slide 16. While the environment has gotten more challenging and consumer sentiment has been impacted, we have managed 3 units in the past and we expect to navigate through this successfully as we continue to refine and align our plans.\nThe long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, key flavor exploration and trusted brands, continue to be strong. And importantly, consumer interest in cooking is growing. We continue to execute on our strategic road map with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer trends. Further capitalizing on our attractive categories across segments and driving category leadership, our results demonstrate that we are investing in the areas that drive the most value, and we expect to maintain this momentum.\nWe also expect to continue to expand margins and manage our costs as we are investing in the business. These improvements are led by our favorable product mix and cost savings programs. Our performance, historically and over the last few quarters, coupled with our growth plans, give us confidence in achieving our near- and long-term objectives. Ultimately, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership.\nFinally, I want to recognize all McCormick employees for their dedication and contributions and reiterate my confidence that, together, we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value.\nNow for your questions."

This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's fourth quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we've posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com.\nWith me this morning are Brendan Foley, Chairman, President and CEO; and Marcos Gabriel, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nToday's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nLastly, I'd like to call out that we made changes to our release and slides to streamline and enhance our communication and these changes are in alignment with investor and analyst feedback. In terms of metrics, to simplify, we are adopting the organic sales measure, which is defined as the impact of volume and mix plus price and excludes the impact of FX and any divestitures or acquisitions. As a reminder, the reconciliation of our sales measures can be found in the appendix of our slides and in our press release. I will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report on our strong performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, an important year for McCormick in which we built momentum and strengthened our leadership and differentiation returning to quality volume-led growth. We invested in our core categories, drove improved unit and volume share trends while also expanding our margins and delivering strong earnings growth. .\nOur results demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments in the areas that we believe will drive the most value and set us up to continue to drive momentum for 2025 and beyond. McCormick remains a growth company. We have robust plans that leverage the demand for flavor and the strength of our brands. Our strategies have proven to be effective in driving growth and compounding that growth over the years, and I remain confident that we have the right leadership team in place and engaged employees globally to deliver on our near-term and long-term objectives with industry-leading performance.\nThis morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our fourth quarter, focusing primarily on top line drivers. Next, I will highlight some areas of success and the areas that we continue to work on. Then, I will briefly reflect on our full year performance and share our plans at a high level to continue to drive momentum in 2025. Next, I will review how McCormick is positioned relative to an evolving consumer landscape. Marcus will then go over to more depth in the fourth quarter as well as 2024 fiscal year financial results and review our 2025 outlook.\nAnd finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, total organic sales increased by 2%, reflecting volume and product mix growth of more than 2%, partially offset by pricing. Total volume improved sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter despite a challenging environment. And this improvement in the fourth quarter was driven by our consumer segment, where volume and product mix increased approximately 4% compared to the prior year.\nIn Americas consumer, we delivered meaningful sequential volume improvement, leading to more than 5% volume growth year-over-year. This growth reflects continued focus on our core categories, investing in brand marketing, accelerating innovation and alignment with consumer trends, expanding distribution and price gap management plans.\nIn EMEA, we continue to drive positive volume growth across our major markets and core categories. We realized benefits from new product innovation as well as expanded distribution. In Asia Pacific, our results were impacted by China as the environment in this market remains challenged. Looking forward, we expect a slight and gradual recovery in 2025 relative to the prior year. Marcus will discuss this when he covers our outlook for 2025.\nMoving to Flavor Solutions. Volumes were flat for the Global segment. Volume performance was primarily impacted by volume softness in our CPG and QSR customers' volumes. Sequentially, relative to third quarter volume growth, our results were impacted by the timing of customer activities.\nLet's move to Slide 5, and let me highlight for the quarter, some of the key areas of success. In our Global Consumer segment, we successfully executed on our plans with increased investment and competitive focus towards driving growth across our core categories. In the Americas, across all categories, we drove unit, volume and dollar consumption growth. Notably, our unit and volume consumption outpaced both branded food peers and private label in the fourth quarter. In Global Spices & Seasonings, we drove solid unit volume and dollar consumption growth across key markets in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific.\nIn the U.S., we continue to improve on our competitiveness. Our volume consumption outpaced both branded competitors and private label for the quarter. Overall holiday performance was terrific. We saw high demand and sellout on our displays that feature core holiday items as well as new innovation. We had strong performance across the portfolio and our holiday limited time offer finishing sugars contributed to our share momentum and were incremental to the category.\nIn recipe mixes, we continue to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas and EMEA driving overall share. In the U.S., our Talula line remains a significant growth driver. We are innovating with Talula recipe mixes, bringing new consumers to the category, particularly with millennials and younger families. In the U.K., our new short seasonings and recipe mixes, specifically designed for air fryers are performing well and driving strong consumption.\nIn Mustard, we made great progress globally over the last 3 quarters and are pleased to see that our plans are driving great results. In the fourth quarter, we drove unit volume and dollar share gains in the Americas. In Poland, one of the top muster consuming countries, our muster consumption continues to grow, and we are also realizing unit and dollar share gains.\nIn hospitals, we continue to have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. We drove positive unit volume and dollar growth in the fourth quarter, demonstrating that our plans are working. Sequentially, we drove significant improvement in dollar and unit share trends. This improvement was driven by distribution gains, increased brand marketing and innovation. We continue to make progress on total distribution points. We expanded TDPs across spices and seasonings, recipe mixes, muster and hot sauce in the Americas.\nIn EMEA, we are also seeing distribution growth across markets in spices and seasonings and condiments and sauces. We are also gaining distribution in growing channels like discounters and e-commerce. Finally, in the Americas and EMEA, we drove double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, outpacing the market. E-commerce was a significant driver of our unit consumption growth for the quarter as consumers continue to seek convenience. In flavor solutions, we saw strength in our technically insulated high-margin product category, flavors and in branded foodservice. In flavors in the Americas, we remain focused on being the partner of choice across 4 taste competencies: savory, heat, naturally sweet and [indiscernible] fruit.\nThese are areas of deep expertise and strength and where we are recognized as leaders within the flavor industry. As a result of this continued focus, our performance with our high-growth innovator customers remain strong, and we outperformed the industry across most end categories. In Americas branded foodservice business, we drove volume growth and expanded distribution across spices and seasonings and condiments, outperforming the industry. In addition, we are winning in hot sauce tabletop unit share and with innovation, new distribution, packaging and promotion.\nLet me now touch on some areas where we are seeing some pressure. As I mentioned earlier, in our Asia Pacific consumer business, the environment in China remains challenging. Consumer sentiment remains low, and October and November, distributor inventory buildup was below prior years due to the expected softer consumption. In flavor solutions, in both Americas and EMEA, some of our CPG customers experienced continued softness in volumes within their own businesses. And in EMEA, some of these customers were impacted by geopolitical boycotts in the region related to the Middle East conflict. This geopolitical impact may continue into 2025.\nIn addition, QSR traffic remains soft in the EMEA and in the Americas. We have seen this pressure impact our results for several quarters. It's difficult to predict QSR traffic. However, we are collaborating with our customers as they focus on improving their volumes through innovation and value and align with consumer trends.\nNow, I would like to reflect on our performance for the fiscal year on Slide 6. We successfully delivered on the goals we set and shared with you for 2024. We demonstrated our dedication to improving volumes. We refined our plans and prioritized our investments to drive impactful results and returned to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth, that kind of growth that investors expect from McCormick.\nI am very proud of what we achieved, and you should expect continued momentum in 2025. Our team remains focused on returning to our long-term growth algorithm, strengthening our profitability, continuing our strong cash flow, paying down our debt and reducing our leverage ratio, all have put McCormick in a position of strength to invest further with a sustained focus on growth.\nA few highlights for the year. On the top line, sales growth came in close to the high end of our guidance range as we expected. Importantly, we drove total positive volume growth for the year, with the consumer business delivering 1% volume growth for 2024. We continue to invest in our business as well as drive margin expansion, in line with our guidance. Importantly, we made significant progress in advancing our Flavor Solutions operating margins. Our growth for 2024 on the top line and the bottom line reinforces our confidence in achieving the 2028 targets we set out at our Investor Day as well as our long-term objectives.\nOur results demonstrate that our foundation is strong. We have proven and powerful brands and the results we are seeing from our refined and strengthened plans provide confidence in the effectiveness of our strategies and investments. We made significant progress this past year, and we have plans to continue that momentum in 2025 and beyond.\nLet me now share our perspectives on consumer trends. Our portfolio's breadth and reach in consumer and flavor solutions and our shared insights give us a strong understanding of consumers, flavor needs, preferences, behaviors and trends. We are continuously monitoring these trends across the globe and adapting our strategies accordingly. Demand for flavor remains the foundation of our growth. Our business is differentiated. We do not compete for calories, we flavor them.\nImportantly, our opportunity continues to grow no matter where calories are shifting, and the demand for flavor continues to have a long runway. Our products in the consumer segment help flavor home cook meals and in the Flavor Solutions segment, we are collaborating with many of our customers through reformulations and flavoring to meet the evolving consumer needs for healthy products, including snacks and beverages.\nOverall trends continue to evolve. Consumers remain challenged, particularly lower income consumers. While everyone continues to watch their spending, there appears to be some easing with mid- and higher-income cohorts, yet also remain focused on maximizing value without compromising flavor. Demand for larger sizes remains elevated as they are seeking value. At the same time, there is increased demand for small or trial sizes, highlighting that flavor exploration remains important.\nFurthermore, consumers continue to cook at home and are increasingly shopping the perimeter for protein and produce. Healthier and better-for-you trends as well as the desire to stretch budgets are fueling this continued interest in cooking from scratch, reinforcing demand for flavor and for McCormick's categories. Spices and extracts remains the #1 center store growth category.\nLastly, our consumer-centric mindset remains at the heart of everything that we do. And we believe we have the right plans that are continually informed by what matters most to consumers and customers. As outlined on Slide 7, our growth plans remain consistent to drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, our proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement. Our growth levers are supported and enhanced through data and analytics as we continue to accelerate our digital transformation.\nOur base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories and we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation. Let me highlight a few areas that support and enable these growth plans. First, our decisions to optimize our portfolio over the years allows us to concentrate our focus on 4 global categories. Spices and seasonings, condiments and sauces, branded foodservice and flavors. We are intentionally focused on these categories as they are critical to driving our profitable sales growth and strengthening our flavor leadership. They drive the greatest value for McCormick and we are excited about our plans to continue to drive growth in each of them.\nFurthermore, consumer demand for hot and spicy is strong and remains a significant tailwind to our growth. We are uniquely positioned to [indiscernible] with our global iconic brands, deep consumer insights, meaningful scale, technology and expertise that we have been building for decades. [indiscernible] is a growth enabler in both of our segments and yet another reason to believe in our long-term objectives.\nLastly, underpinning our long-term growth objectives is a unique system of advantages that work together to drive our industry-leading growth. These advantages include the breadth and reach of our focused global portfolio, powerful leading brands, our [indiscernible] platform, unique consumer insights, global sourcing capabilities and our disciplined approach to acquisitions and integrations. Importantly, our power of people culture is at the foundation of it all. These advantages, together with the execution of our strategies are critical to ensuring we deliver on our growth potential.\nNow, over to Marcos.\n\nMarcos Mendes Gabriel\n\nDirector\n\nThank you, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be reporting on strong results for both the quarter and the year. Starting on Slide 9, our total organic sales grew 2% for the quarter. This increase was volume led with more than 2% volume and product mix growth partially offset by pricing. We drove strong sequential volume improvement, as you can see on the slide.\nMoving our Consumer segment on Slide 10. Organic sales increased 3% as volume growth of 4% was partially offset by 1% impact of pricing investments. Consumer organic sales in the Americas increased by 4%. This increase reflects 5% volume growth, partially offset by price investments of 1%. Volume growth was focused in our core categories and was driven by investments in brand marketing, innovation and expanded distribution. Our investments are yielding positive results, as seen improved consumption, and we expect the momentum to continue into 2025.\nIn EMEA, we grew consumer organic sales 3%, driven by a 5% increase from volume, partially offset by promotional pricing up 2%. Volume growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We're pleased with the strong sustained volume led growth momentum in EMEA in 2024. Consumer organic sales in APAC region declined 10%, driven by an 11% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 1% contribution from price. This volume decline was primarily attributable to the macro environment in China.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 11. Fourth quarter organic sales increased 1%, driven by pricing. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 1%, reflecting a 2% contribution from price partially offset by a 1% decrease in volume, driven by softness in our CPG and QSR customers volumes. This was partially offset by volume growth in flavors with high-growth innovator customers as well as growth in the branded foodservice business.\nIn EMEA, organic sales decreased by 4%, including a 2% decline from price and a 2% impact of lower volume and product mix, reflecting the impact of soft CPG and QSR customers volumes. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions organic sales increased 6% and with volume growth of 7% driven by QSR, customer promotions, limited time offers as well as new products, partially offset by pricing of 1%.\n[indiscernible] on Slide 12, gross profit margin expanded by 20 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by the benefit from our comprehensive continuous improvement program, or CCI. For the year, gross margin expanded 90 basis points with incremental benefits from product mix and pricing. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A increased relative to the fourth quarter of last year, driven primarily by increased technology costs that shifted from the third quarter as we expected.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 80 basis points. For the fiscal year, SG&A increased 40 basis points relative to 2023, primarily due to increased brand marketing as planned. For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income declined by 1% with minimal impact from currency. This decline was driven by the increased SG&A, as expected. For the total company, we grew fiscal year adjusted operating income 4.5% with minimal impacts on currency and drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points with gross margin expansion more than offsetting the increase in SG&A expenses, including our planned increased investments in brand marketing.\nOur performance in 2024 reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments to fuel top line growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.4% compared to 22.3% in the year-ago period as expected. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 20.5%, a decrease of 150 basis points from 2023, driven by a greater level of discrete tax benefits than in the prior year.\nOur income from unconsolidated operations in the fourth quarter declined 3%. As we mentioned on the last call, our results were impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, which more than offset the strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick [indiscernible]. The U.S. to Mexican base exchange rate was around 17 in the prior year compared to more than 20 in the fourth quarter, reflecting approximately an 18% fluctuation that impacted our reported results. For the fiscal year, unconsolidated income increased 32%, reflecting strong performance in [indiscernible]. We remain the market leader with our McCormick branded [indiscernible], Marmalade and [indiscernible] product lines in Mexico, and the underlying business continues to perform well and has contributed meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results this past year.\nTurning to our segment operational results on Slide 13. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment decreased 3% with minimal impact from currency. The decrease was primarily due to pricing and increased SG&A costs, partially offset by cost savings generated by our CCI program. 2024 was a year of investments. And as such, adjusted operating income in the consumer segment rose 1%, while adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points as we invested to drive top line volume led growth. We are well positioned to continue this volume led growth trajectory with strong margins.\nIn Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 5% or 7% in constant currency, driven by product mix, pricing and cost savings, partially offset by increased SG&A costs. For the fiscal year, our Flavor Solutions operating income grew 14% and operating margin expanded 140 basis points reflecting our continued focus on storing Flavor Solutions profitability. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 14, fourth quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 as compared to $0.85 for the year ago period. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable tax rate as well as the increase in SG&A that I mentioned earlier.\nFor the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which represents a 9% increase over 2023 and above the high end of our guidance range. On Slide 15, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations in 2024 was $922 million compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. The benefit from the increase in earnings year-over-year was more than offset by the impact of cash used for working capital, primarily inventories driven by strategic buying decisions. increased incentive compensation payments and timing of cash tax payments.\nWe returned $451 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $275 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash. This means funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nWe remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. With another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives, we successfully reduced our leverage ratio to below 3x in 2024 and improved our cash conversion cycle by 10% as compared to the prior year. In 2025, we expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. Overall, our results for 2024 were consistent and in line with our guidance and reflect the success of our strategies and focusing investments in the areas that drive the greatest value.\nNow turning to our 2025 financial outlook on Slide 16. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term profitable growth while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer and macro environment. In addition, this outlook is in line with the expectations we laid out at our Investor Day in October and reinforces our confidence in our 2028 targets as well as our long-term objectives. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to have a 1 point negative impact on both net sales and adjusted operating income and 2 points on adjusted earnings per share.\nAt the top line, we expect organic net sales growth to range between 1% and 3% and our growth to be [indiscernible] with minimal pricing. In China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in the APAC consumer, continues to be impacted by slower demand. As a result, our outlook assumes a gradual recovery, and we expect China consumer sales to improve slightly year-over-year. While we recognize there has been weak demand, we continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunity of the China business.\nOur 2025 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2024. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from product mix and cost savings from our CCI program, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation. In addition to our gross margin expansion, we expect SG&A benefits from cost savings to be partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing.\nFor the year, we expect our brand marketing spend to increase in the high single digits, reflecting a double-digit increase, partially offset by anticipated CCI savings. As a result, our adjusted operating income is expected to grow 4% to 6% in constant currency, a balanced outlook that gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business while expanding margins in line with our 2028 objectives.\nIn terms of tax, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year compared to 20.5% in 2024, where we benefited from a number of discrete tax items that are not expected to repeat in 2025. We expect our income from unconsolidated operations to decline in the mid-teens range in 2025, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso which is impacting the results of our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. Excluding this currency headwind, McCormick de Mexico continues to deliver a strong performance.\nTo summarize, our 2025 adjusted earnings per share projection of $3.03 to $3.08 on a reported dollar basis reflects currency headwinds and the impact of the increased tax rate relative to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS is expected to grow between 5% and 7%. As we head into 2025, let me summarize some of the puts and takes to consider related to our performance. We expect to continue to deliver total volume growth across both segments. Gross margin expansion for the first quarter is expected to be modest relative to the prior year, primarily due to price gap management investments that were mostly in place since the second quarter of 2024.\nWe expect gross margin to build over the year, consistent with historical trends. We anticipate our SG&A will be impacted by a consistent increase in brand marketing every quarter, in line with our full year guidance. In addition, our stock-based compensation expense will shift from the second quarter to the first quarter, impacting comparisons to the prior year. Our adjusted operating profit will be impacted by this shift in timing causing the first quarter to be flat or slightly down relative to the prior year. However, this will be more than offset by operating profit growth in the second quarter, and we expect our profitability to build throughout the year.\nAs Brendan noted, we continue to prioritize our investments to drive impactful results. Our continuation of volume [indiscernible] growth underscores that we are moving in the right direction, and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on our 2025 financial outlook, near-term and long-term objectives.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Marcos. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaways on Slide 17. The long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, heat, [indiscernible] exploration and trusted brands continue to be strong. And importantly, consumer interest in cooking remains elevated. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and for the year. These results demonstrate that we are investing in the areas that drive the most value and reinforces our confidence in our plans and long-term objectives.\nWe continue to execute on our strategic road map with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer trends, further capitalizing on our attractive categories across segments and driving category leadership. Our plans are yielding strong results, and we expect the momentum to continue into 2025. We also continue to expand margins and manage our costs as we are investing in the business. These improvements are led by our favorable product mix and cost savings programs. Our performance, coupled with our growth plans, gives us confidence in achieving our near- and long-term objectives.\nWe believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Finally, I want to recognize all McCormick employees for their dedication and contributions, particularly as we navigate this complex environment. and reiterate my confidence that together, we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value. Now for your questions."

Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our second quarter performance, particularly as we continue to navigate a changing and complex consumer landscape. Our differentiated results demonstrate the success of our prioritized investments to accelerate volume trends and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories.\nMcCormick remains a growth company. and 2024 continues to be an important investment year as planned, as we have activated many of our initiatives, and we are starting to see results that support our confidence in delivering on our long-term objectives. This morning, I will begin my remarks with an overview of our second quarter results, focusing on the top line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some areas of success as well as areas we continue to work on and review our growth plans with a focus on innovation.\nMike will then go into more depth on the second quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments. Turning now to our results on Slide 4. In the second quarter, sales declined by 1% in constant currency, reflecting flat pricing and 1% decline in volume and product mix. Volume growth in our consumer segment was offset by declines in flavor solutions related to softness in some of our quick-serve restaurant or QSR and packaged food customers volumes as well as the timing of customer activities as expected.\nAlthough certain parts of our flavor solutions business are pressured, given our collaboration and strong innovation pipeline with our customers, we expect volume trends to improve during the second half of the year.\nIn our Consumer segment, volumes improved substantially from the first quarter across our major markets and delivered volume growth. In the Americas, we delivered solid sequential volume improvement for 3 consecutive quarters, and our pricing in the second quarter reflects the activation of our price gap management plans to support improved volumes in the second half as planned.\nIn EMEA, we drove positive volume growth across our major markets and core categories for the second consecutive quarter. We expanded distribution in the grocery, discounter and e-commerce channels. and realized benefits from new product innovation. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we delivered strong volume-led sales growth as we executed the rollout of our new consumer preferred packaging for our core spices and seasonings portfolio, and realized distribution gains.\nThis performance was tempered by China, as expected, although sequentially, volume trends improved in China. Results in our consumer business reflects continued focus on increased brand marketing investments, accelerating innovation in alignment with consumer trends and expanding distribution.\nLet me now share our current view on the state of the consumer. Consumers continue to exhibit value-seeking behavior. Financial anxiety remains elevated, particularly in the United States and especially with mid- to low-income households due to the compounding impact of inflation. In addition, inflation in the foodservice channel is leading to softness in food away-from-home consumption and impacting restaurant traffic, particularly with QSRs across many of our regions.\nVolumes on the retail side, particularly in the center of store, remained soft. Consumers continue to buy just for what they need and make more frequent trips to the store. On the other hand, they are increasingly shopping the perimeter and continuing to cook at home. Certain categories such as spices and seasonings as well as condiments and sauces are seeing a benefit amid these trends. As consumers are looking to stretch their budgets, our categories represent a fraction of the cost relative to proteins, [indiscernible] and carbs and drive the majority of the flavor.\nIn fact, in the second quarter, Spices & seasonings was the top category in center store growth across measured channels, and McCormick is the leading branded player and driving category unit growth. What continues to differentiate McCormick is that we operate in great categories across all channels. We offer products at every price point from premium to lower price points. We have a broad and diversified portfolio to meet evolving consumer demands. We are part of the solution for consumers. Importantly, we believe that we have the right plans in place that are continually informed by what matters most to our consumers and customers.\nMoving to Slide 5. Let me highlight for the quarter, some of the key areas of our success. For our Global Consumer segment, including the Americas, our core categories delivered solid volume growth. In spices and seasonings, we delivered volume growth across all of our major markets. In the U.S., our share performance improved, resulting in positive gains in unit share for the quarter. In addition, we drove dollar share gains in France and Eastern Europe. In recipe mixes, we continue to strengthen consumption trends in the Americas, particularly in our Mexican product lines through our price gap management investments as well as distribution growth.\nIn addition, in EMEA, recipe mixes were a significant driver of U.K. volume growth, and we realized dollar market share gains for 2 consecutive quarters. In Mustard, we are driving improved unit consumption and unit market share trends across our regions. In the Americas, we expanded distribution and actioned our pricing investments. In addition, innovation is yielding results, our Creamy Dill Pickle Mustard performance is exceeding our expectations.\nIn Poland, mustard consumption continues to grow, and we are realizing dollar market share gains, which strengthened from the first quarter. In Flavor Solutions, we had pockets of strength this quarter. In our Americas branded foodservice business, despite softness in the overall market, we grew volumes. In our Americas Flavors business, our performance with high-growth innovator customers remained strong. We grew in nonalcoholic beverages and saw continued strength in Performance Nutrition.\nIn Asia Pacific, including China, we drove strong volume growth as we benefited from new customer products and promotions. Let me now touch on some areas where we are seeing some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like Frozen and Asian, and Americas consumer. Importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio, and the volume growth in our core categories is beginning to fully offset these declines.\nIn hot sauce, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty and we continue to invest in our market-leading brands. In the Americas, consumption and share trends improved in the second quarter on top of our first quarter improvement. A couple of short-term items continue to impact our share. First, it is a peer that is lapping their own supply chain disruptions; and second, new price pack architecture in the form of trial sizes, which have been incremental to the category.\nAs we realize the benefit of our increased innovation, including Frank's new [indiscernible] and squeeze bottles as well as many trial sizes, A&P investments and distribution expansion, we expect to drive improved hot sauce consumption trends in the second half of 2024. In Flavor Solutions, our volumes were impacted by slower QSR traffic in both EMEA and the Americas. We expect to improve these volume trends as we continue to execute on our growth plans in the second half of the year.\nFinally, some of our consumer packaged food customers experienced additional softness in volumes within their own business in both the Americas and EMEA. We are collaborating with our customers to support their innovation plans, and we are continuing to diversify our customer base over time. Before moving to our growth plans, I'd like to note that our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by [indiscernible] data and combined with unmeasured channels outpaced our sales growth this quarter as our brand investments drove improved consumption, and we are lapping the increased shipments that came in ahead of the 2023 pricing actions of the prior year.\nThis is a function of timing from quarter-to-quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on Slide 6, which are supporting our second quarter performance and will continue to drive our success in 2024 and into 2025. Our base business is strengthening across major markets and core categories, and we have a number of initiatives in flight that will continue to drive this performance and differentiation. And I look forward to sharing more details on these plans at our upcoming Investor Day in October.\nBrand marketing, new products and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies and customer engagement continue to be the levers that drive our growth. For today, I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight one of these levers. Innovation on Slide 7 and 8. First, it's important to recognize that we are one of the few, if not the only company that operates in end-to-end flavor with both our consumer and flavor solutions segments.\nWe are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach. Our shared insights give us a strong understanding of consumers' flavor needs, preferences and trends. And we have the ability to translate this into innovation, making McCormick a global leader in flavor trends and flavor innovation. Innovation is a priority for us. It drives 1/3 of our long-term algorithm. It meaningfully contributed to our results for the first half of 2024, and we expect it to drive strong performance in the second half.\nAs a management team, we discussed the latest trends and insights and how those might translate into innovation in both segments. We are continuously leading the pursuit of what's next in flavor. In our company, everyone is engaged in innovation. In the first half of the year, our results benefited from new products and packaging and the performance of these launches continues to improve. Importantly, our pipeline for the remainder of the year remains robust.\nIn our consumer segment, our renovated U.S. everyday urban spice portfolio is fully shipped, and roughly 2/3 of our new packaging is currently on shelf, driving double-digit velocity gains and contributing to our strong volume improvement in spices and seasonings. New products within our spices and seasonings portfolio, including [indiscernible] new seasoning blends, flavor maker blends and our exciting drilling portfolio of Stubb’s [indiscernible] and new Grill Mates seasoning blends in partnership with Max the Meat Guy, fuel first half results and are expected to accelerate our performance in the second half.\nIn fact, in 2024, we are launching nearly 4x more drilling rubs and seasonings compared to 2023. Importantly, our [indiscernible] season, which kicked off at the end of the second quarter is off to a great start. In addition to our grilling blends and rubs, we are excited about early results from Frank's RedHot, different sauces and popular flavors in the squeeze bottle format that we launched this year. We are energized for the grilling season and expect our flame and flavor marketing campaign that launched in the second quarter to drive incremental consumer demand.\nOur Cholula salsas and recipe mixes that launched in 2023 are driving new buyers to the category and continue to exceed our expectations since launch. Talula Salsa are driving strong incremental category growth with their high repeat buy rates in our Cholula recipe mixes, our top recipe mix brand after just 1 year in the market. They are driving the second highest unit growth within the category. We continue to build U.S. distribution, and we are launching both formats in Canada this year.\nIn EMEA, growth from new product sales is accelerating, and we expect it to drive significant growth in the second half of the year. In the U.K., across recipe mixes and seasonings, our [indiscernible] range with Mathiasen, restaurant-branded partnerships and a range of classic American recipe mixes with Frank's, Bay and French's are driving our innovation performance and expanding household penetration with younger consumers.\nIn France, we are collaborating with [indiscernible], a celebrity Colombian French Chef to drive engagement with younger households. And recently, we partnered with them to launch a range of unique and delicious [indiscernible] barbecue seasonings in time for the summer barbecue season.\nMoving now to our Flavor Solutions segment. We continue to leverage our proprietary technologies to support our innovation in flavors to win new customers, diversify our customer base and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our high-growth innovator and consumer products customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. As we look to our innovation pipeline that we support for our customers, we expect to pick up in the back half of the year. We are collaborating with many customers to heat up their products for snacking to beverages to Performance Nutrition. Our win rate with heat briefs are strong across our regions, and we continue to dedicate resources to where we have the right to win.\nIn branded foodservice, our 2023 launches, including Frank's Mild Wings sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot are delivering strong results in the first half of the year.\nOur early 2024 launches are also contributing to our growth and include a number of new products like Grill Mates Fiery Habanero and Cholula Chile Lime. Looking ahead to the second half, we expect new products to meaningfully drive our top line. And importantly, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching Frank Scarlet Buffalo and Mango Habanero in the Americas as well as Frank's RedHot Mayo in the U.K. and France, and we are further extending McCormick Mayonesa which has had great performance in our Consumer segment into the foodservice channel.\nOverall, we are very excited about our innovation plans for 2024. We expect new product performance to be in line with our long-term objectives and to drive a meaningful portion of our volume growth. In addition, in the second half of the year, sales from new products are expected to nearly double compared to the first half. And a meaningful portion of this innovation is in heat. Heat infused products span our portfolio, across both segments, we expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for Total McCormick. We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands, deep consumer insights and our meaningful scale, technology and expertise that we have been building for decades.\nAs we look ahead, we are maintaining our outlook for 2024. Mike will share more of the details. At a high level, we continue to expect our top line to be at the mid- to high end of our guidance range given the momentum we saw in the first half of the year, particularly in our Consumer segment. We are confident in our initiatives, and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also remain prudent and continue to reflect the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024.\nTo wrap up, let me reiterate 3 key points: long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands continues to be very strong. And importantly, consumer interest and cooking remains strong. We remain dedicated to accelerating our volume trends. We refine and adapt our plans as needed and are prioritizing investments to drive impactful results and return to sustainable volume-led growth. And you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond.\nWe believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will continue to differentiate and strengthen our leadership. Now before Mike's remarks, I'd like to speak to the management transition. As you likely know, last night, we announced Mike's decision to retire at the end of February. Mike has been an exceptional leader at McCormick for more than 3 decades. His strategic leadership and focus on value creation have been instrumental in driving top-tier organic growth as well as our successful acquisition agenda.\nHis deep knowledge of McCormick and effective execution of our CCI initiatives helped fuel our growth investments to deliver profitable growth. Mike is the embodiment of McCormick values and teamwork. He helped build a world-class global finance team. He will be missed by me and employees throughout the organization. Mike, congratulations on your successful career and your upcoming retirement.\nIn the same announcement, Marcus Gabriel was named Executive Vice President and CFO effective December 1. Marcus will serve on our management committee and lead the company's finance organization and global business services team. Marcos is a proving global leader with over 25 years of experience in the consumer products industry. His expertise across major multinational companies in several geographies will be instrumental as we continue to execute our growth plans.\nI have worked with Marcos over the last 7 years. He has served in key senior leadership roles at McCormick contributing meaningfully to our profitable growth and improved productivity. Marcos, congratulations on this promotion, and I look forward to working with you in this new role.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Brendan. I'm honored to serve as [indiscernible] of McCormick and excited to continue to partner with the entire team to deliver long-term profitable growth and drive shareholder value. It has been great to work closely with Mike and the management committee for the past year to transition into this new role. Mike, I want to thank you for our mentorship and offer my congratulations on your retirement.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThanks very much for those remarks, Marcos and Brendon. Joining McCormick more than 30 years ago was one of the best decisions I've ever made. This is a great company and it continues to get better. I am proud of the progress we have made over the years. We significantly grew our top line, generated fuel for growth through improved productivity and continue to deliver solid results despite the complexity and uncertainty we experienced in the last few years. I am so proud of and grateful for our entire team here at McCormick and appreciate all of their contributions and efforts.\nMy decision to retire in February is based important on Marcso' readiness to move into the role. I've had the privilege of working with him for several years and win us his strong financial leadership and ability to drive results. I'm confident that Marcos in partnership with Brendan and the rest of our leadership team, have the capabilities and vision to continue to advance our leadership and differentiation and capture all the great opportunities that are ahead for McCormick.\nLastly, I look forward to partnering with Brendan and Marcos to ensure a smooth transition over the next few months. Now moving to our results for the second quarter. Starting on Slide 11. Our top line constant currency sales declined 1% compared to the second quarter of last year, including the impact of the [indiscernible] divestiture and reflects flat pricing, offset by a 1% volume and product mix decline. As expected, volume declines were primarily driven by lower customer demand and the timing of customer activities in the Flavor Solutions segment.\nIn our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 1%, driven by pricing investments. Volumes were slightly positive and reflect a substantial sequential improvement from the first quarter. On Slide 12, consumer sales in the Americas declined to 2% versus the second quarter of last year. This decline reflects pricing investments of 1% and flat volumes. Volume growth in the spices and seasonings was offset by volume declines in prepared food categories, including frozen and Asian.\nIn terms of pricing, we continue to take a surgical and data-driven approach to managing price gaps, and our investments are still expected to impact about 15% of our Americas consumer segment. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 4%, driven entirely by volume. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and and expect the momentum to continue through 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were down 1%, driven by a 2% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China.\nOutside of China, we delivered volume-led growth in the mid-teens that was broad-based across categories and markets. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 15. Second quarter constant currency sales declined 1%, and reflecting a 1% contribution from price, offset by a 2% decline in volume and the impact of the divestiture of the canning business. In the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales declined 1%, reflecting a 1% contribution from price, offset by a 2% decrease in volume driven by the timing of customer activities as well as the softness in quick service restaurant and packaged through customer volumes. This was partially offset by volume growth in our branded foodservice business, as Brendan mentioned.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 8%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the canning business, lower volume and product mix of 4%, reflecting the impact of QSR packaged food customers' volumes and the timing of some customer activities. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 10% in constant currency. Volume grew 9%, driven by customers' promotions, limited time offers and new products, while pricing contributed 1%\nAs seen on Slide 19, gross profit margin expanded by 60 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period, driven primarily by the benefit of our comprehensive continuous improvement program, or CCI. As we look ahead, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year.\nNow moving to Slide 20. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A increased versus the second quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing investments, which were partially offset by CCI cost savings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 40 basis points. As expected, brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results, and we anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts.\nAdjusted operating income was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023, with minimal impact from currency as gross margin expansion was offset by higher SG&A expenses. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined 3% or 2% in constant currency. While in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 6% with minimal impact from currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability. And in the second quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus prior year in this segment.\n[indiscernible] performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top line growth. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 21. Our interest expense was up slightly versus the prior year. The reduction in average debt was more than offset by higher short-term interest rates. And touching on tax. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 22.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant benefit this year.\nOur second quarter adjusted rate benefited from a discrete tax item primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to an international legal entity reorganization. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the second quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We remain the market leader with our McCormick de Manas, [indiscernible] product lines in Mexico and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 23, second quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69, and as compared to $0.60 for the year ago period. The increase was primarily due to the discrete tax benefit and higher income from unconsolidated operations I just mentioned.\nOn Slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow in the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the first half of 2024, our cash flow from operations was $302 million compared to $394 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by increased incentive compensation payments and the timing of cash tax payments. We returned $226 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $130 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure.\nOur priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. Importantly, we remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives.\nNow turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 25. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. Turning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%.\nGiven the momentum in our first half, we expect to be at the mid- to high end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we expect the favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions realized primarily in the first quarter to be partially offset by our price gap management investments that will drive volume growth. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect total pricing to be flat relative to the prior year, and segment trends are expected to be similar to the second quarter.\nWe expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. As we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we continue to expect to return to total volume growth during the second half of the year as than any new macroeconomic headwinds.\nWe expect to continue to prune lower-margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio, the impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales. In China, our Food Away from Home business, which is included in APAC consumer, was impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect China consumer sales to be flat to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of the China business.\nFinally, the divestiture of the Giotti Kandy business will impact us through the third quarter. Our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low single-digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments.\nAdditionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new flavor solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year. Moving to adjusted operating income. We expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings and we continue to expect our increased investment in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year.\nOur 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in discrete items. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As Brendan noted, we continue to prioritize our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth. We are moving in the right direction, and we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on our 2024 financial outlook and long-term objectives over time.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on Slide 26. The First half results and volume performance in the Consumer segment demonstrate that we are making the right investments to drive long-term sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing our proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and in alignment with consumer behavior and capitalizing on our advantaged categories across segments. .\nWe're able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our cost saving programs to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion. Our performance for the first half, coupled with our growth plans, give us confidence in achieving the mid- to high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their dedication and their contributions and reiterate my confidence that together, we will continue to drive differentiated results and shareholder value.\nNow for your questions."

This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's first quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As many of you have probably seen on the news this morning, the Francis Scott Key bridge collapsed in Baltimore. Our thoughts go out to everyone impacted by this terrible tragedy. We have activated the team and are monitoring the situation.\nWe are pleased to start the year with a strong first quarter. Our performance reflects the early success of our prioritized investments to improve volume trends and drive profitable growth. I will begin my remarks this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, focusing on top line drivers. Next, I will provide perspective on industry trends, highlight some early signposts of success as well as areas we continue to work on and review our growth plans. Mike will then go into more depth on the first quarter financial results and review our 2024 outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will have some closing comments.\nTurning now to our results on Slide 4. In the first quarter, sales grew 2% in constant currency, reflecting a 3% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume and product mix, primarily driven by the pruning of low-margin business and our canning business divestiture. Underlying volume was flat compared to the prior year.\nSequentially from the fourth quarter, volume trends improved in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. We believe this improvement is an indication of continued progress as we remain focused on driving quality top line growth throughout our portfolio. In Consumer, volumes improved substantially from the fourth quarter in the Americas. In EMEA, we drove positive volume growth while continuing to benefit from pricing actions.\nIn Asia Pacific, volume performance was impacted by the macro environment in China, as we expected. We continue to expect full year 2024 China consumer sales to be comparable to 2023. Outside of China, we delivered strong sales growth driven by both price and volume.\nIn Flavor Solutions, our results were solid and growth was driven by price and underlying volume growth, partially offset by the impact of our canning divestiture. We are pleased with our performance recognizing many of our customers, including consumer product companies or CPGs, and quick-serve restaurant or QSRs, continue to experience volume softness in their businesses. We are continuing to collaborate with our customers to navigate this challenging environment, and we remain optimistic about our growth for the year.\nIt's worth noting that volume trends in Flavor Solutions typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter, largely attributable to customer activity, including new product launches, limited time offers and their other promotional activity.\nAs we said at the CAGNY conference, McCormick is a growth company, and 2024 is an important investment year to return to our long-term objectives. Our results demonstrate the early impact of investments we have made to fuel our top line and further capitalize on the underlying growth of our categories. We have a robust set of initiatives and continue to expect share gains in units to lead our trends and our results will build throughout 2024.\nLet me share some of our perspectives on industry trends. We are in a unique position with our portfolio's breadth and reach in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions. Our shared insights give us a very strong understanding of consumers' flavor needs, preferences, behaviors and trends. Consumers remain challenged. 2 years of steep inflation has had an impact, and many are exhibiting value-seeking behavior. While food inflation is slowing, its compounded impact is still being felt by consumers. Budgets are stretched, resulting in choiceful spending decisions, a trend that is continuing from the fourth quarter.\nIn the first quarter, with higher inflation in the food service channel and slowing retail food prices, we broadly saw a shift from food away from home to food at home consumption in our major markets. We are also seeing improvement in center store categories and some softness in restaurant traffic across all regions.\nAs we said, the current state of the consumer is not defined by any one trend, it remains dynamic. And we are responding with speed and agility. I am encouraged by the early success of our key initiatives. We have the right plans in place that are continually influenced by what matters most to our consumers and customers and fit within our strategic priorities.\nMoving to Slide 5. Let me highlight for the quarter some of the key signposts of our success that demonstrate we have the right plans in place, starting with spices and seasonings. In Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China, we grew volumes. In the U.S., our unit share performance continues to improve, and we drove dollar share gains in Eastern Europe.\nIn recipe mixes, we strengthened our performance with volume growth in the Americas, reversing the trends from the fourth quarter. Recipe mixes were a significant driver of U.K. volume growth, and homemade desserts were also a substantial driver of France's volume growth. In both, we realized both unit and dollar market share gains.\nVolume growth in our Flavors business is strong across key categories, including outpacing the category in alcoholic beverages and Performance Nutrition. Finally, we grew volume in branded foodservice and realized market share gains in spices and seasonings and on tabletop and hot sauces.\nBefore I get into our growth plans, let me touch on some areas where there is some pressure. We continue to experience volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like Frozen and Asian. In Americas consumer, importantly, these items represent a small part of our portfolio and the improved volume trends in our core categories is beginning to offset these declines.\nFor Mustard in Americas consumer, as we discussed in our last earnings call, we continue to experience extremely low price points for private label, which is impacting our consumption and driving down category dollars. While performance in Mustard improved relative to the fourth quarter, we still have work ahead of us. We plan to drive further volume improvement by narrowing price gaps and increasing promotions, new products, including Cremy Dill Pickle, and importantly, through recent distribution wins.\nMoving to Hot Sauce. In Americas consumer of consumption, volume trends improved from the fourth quarter, particularly coinciding with our successful Super Bowl activation campaign. Reflecting in our first quarter performance, it highlights 2 dynamics.\nFirst, we have underlying strength in our base business and strong consumer loyalty. Our growth plans remain consistent, fueling growth through increasing both Cholula and Frank's RedHot brand marketing, with Frank's activated year-round for the first time, as well as exciting innovation aligned with consumer trends and expanding distribution.\nSecond, recently, we have seen a surge in $1 price point trial sizes from new and existing small players, which is incremental to the category and is pressuring our share performance. We remain the leader in this attractive, fragmented and growing category. New buyers present a great opportunity to win new households using our growth levers as well as our scale and capabilities.\nIn Flavors, our growth with quick-serve restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower QSR traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Finally, some of our consumer packaged food customers continued to experience softness in volumes within their own business in both Americas and EMEA. We are focused on working with our customers to support their innovation plans and continue to diversify our customer base over time.\nBefore I talk to our growth plans in detail, let me touch on Spices and Seasonings. At a global level, we are pleased with the growth and consumption we delivered in the quarter. Specifically looking at U.S. spices and seasonings, we are driving significant improvements. Our new packaging continues to increase velocity on shelf, and we are recapturing distribution points, and our sequential improvement led to positive unit share gains at the end of the quarter.\nIn addition, our growth is supported by our increased brand marketing and new products. Lastly, we expect to start seeing the impact of our actions in our results during the second half of the year, following most of our customers' shelf resets at the end of the second quarter. Let's now move to our growth plans on Slide 6, which are leading our strong first quarter performance and continue to drive our success in 2024 and beyond.\nBrand marketing, new products and packaging innovation, category management, proprietary technologies and customer engagement continue to be the initiatives behind our growth levers.\nStarting with brand marketing. Our plans across all categories are supported by our global brand marketing initiatives. We are prioritizing investments to connect with consumers and fuel growth. Our differentiated brand marketing is driven by a combination of factors. In addition to maintaining a high share of voice, we are committed to having the best content in our categories, content that inspires and educates consumers and reaches them at the right points on their path to purchase and their flavor journey, from flavor exploration and menu playing, to shopping and cooking and even to eating and sharing the experience online. In Q1, brand marketing spend was up significantly compared to the prior year, as expected. This increase was broad-based across all regions and was an important driver in improving volumes.\nThrough our efforts across multiple channels, particularly in retail media, we are driving further household penetration and increasing buy rates across spices and seasonings, recipe mixes and condiments. Our holiday campaigns across our regions proved successful. Our marketing campaigns in the Americas highlight our everyday value and point of difference to consumers and are supporting our improved volume trends and share improvement.\nOur Frank's Super Bowl activation campaign with Jason Kelsey, now a retired NFL player, was very successful. We gained new buyers and media and consumer sentiment as well as engagement from other big brands was incredibly positive. We continue to benefit from new products and packaging. It is one of the primary drivers of our growth. And as we said at CAGNY, the performance of our launches continues to improve.\nWe are continuing to realize growth from our 2023 launches. For example, our Cholula salsas and recipe mixes are driving new buyers to the category and are exceeding our expectation since launch. And we continue to build U.S. distribution and are also launching both formats in Canada this year.\nThe rollout of our U.S. everyday urban spice portfolio is on plan and expected to be fully shipped by the end of the second quarter. Our [indiscernible] same range of short seasonings and recipe mixes continued to drive our innovation performance and expand household penetration with younger consumers.\nAs we look ahead to the rest of the year, with our renovated recipe mixes, we have opportunities to win more dinner occasions with new global cuisine seasonings in both Americas and EMEA and reshaping the portfolio by shifting offerings to meet consumers' growing preference for non-red meat proteins.\nIn seasoning blends, a exciting growth opportunity we mentioned at CAGNY, we are launching new Lawry's seasoning blends in large sizes, which offer a value price point to consumers. And we are really excited about the Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format we just launched and are looking forward to another campaign featuring Jason Kelsey.\nIn Flavor Solutions, we are leveraging our proprietary technologies to support our innovation and flavors to win new customers, diversifying our customer base and drive share gains across our portfolio. Our momentum with our Flavors customers continues to be strong and fuel our new product pipeline. We are collaborating with many of our customers to heat up their products from snacking to beverages.\nOur heat brief win rates are strong across our regions. We continue to dedicate resources where we have the right to win. In Branded Foodservice, we have a strong innovation agenda, including launching a Cattlemen's Hawaiian barbeque flavor, expanding our seasonings portfolio with Ducros line extensions and extending McCormick Mayonesa, which has had great performance in our Consumer segment into this channel.\nLet's turn to category management, where I'd like to review our revenue management efforts and expanding distribution. First, revenue management remains a capability, and we have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. We continue to take a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors. Our price investments are primarily focused in Americas consumer, where they impact about 15% of our portfolio in that segment.\nRevenue management will continue to be an important tool for driving growth and we will consistently leverage real-time analytics and insights to refine our plans. In terms of expanding distribution, we continue to make progress on restoring a majority of the distribution that was lost due to supply issues. We have secured wins and new distribution.\nTo further strengthen our value proposition, in EMEA, we have grown distribution in a fast-growing discount channel. And in the U.S., our Lawry's opening price point is expanding across the stores of a leading discounter. And in China, we are expanding in small format stores, which have grown rapidly in recent years, as well as into third and fourth tier cities.\nWe are meeting the consumer with a live and shop. Let me briefly mention our heat platform. As you heard in my remarks, heat infused products span our portfolio and are driving growth. We expect heat to continue to be a long-term growth accelerator globally for McCormick. Consumers, particularly younger generations, continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. We are uniquely positioned to win in heat with our global iconic brands and our meaningful scale and expertise that we have been building for decades.\nTo wrap up, we believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership. As we look ahead to 2024, we are maintaining our outlook. Mike will share more of the details.\nAt a high level, we expect our top line to be at the mid- to high end of our guidance range given the momentum we saw in the first quarter. We are confident in our initiatives, and we have provided proof points of where they are working. That said, we also continue to reflect on the uncertainty in the consumer environment in our outlook for 2024.\nBefore I pass the call to Mike, let me reiterate a few points. We are deliberately focused on attractive high-growth categories across both segments, resulting in a significant long-term tailwind to drive profitable growth. That said, it's crucial that we continue to capitalize on this position of strength.\nThe long-term trends that fuel our categories, consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, flavor exploration and trusted brands continue to be very strong. And importantly, consumer enjoyment and cooking is growing. We remain dedicated to improving volumes. We continue to refine our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth, and you should continue to expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond. Over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 8. Our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the first quarter of last year, reflecting 3% of pricing benefit, offset by a 1% volume and mix decline. As expected, volumes were impacted by our strategic decision to exit DSD, direct store delivery of our bagged Hispanic spices in the Americas, the exit of a private label product line and the divestiture of a small canning business in EMEA. Underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, reflecting a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 3%.\nIn our Consumer segment, constant currency sales growth of 1% reflects a 3% increase of pricing actions, offset by a 2% volume decline, which is due to a 1% impact from the DSD business exit I just mentioned, lower volume and product mix in the Americas, specifically in prepared food categories, including Frozen and Asian consistent with our expectations, and the impact of the macro environment in China.\nOn Slide 9, Consumer sales in the Americas were comparable to last year. Contribution from price was offset by a volume and mix decline of 3%. This decline was fully attributable to the DSD exit and lower volume and product mix in the prepared food categories I just mentioned.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 8% with a 5% increase from pricing actions and 3% volume growth. Sales growth was broad-based across product categories in our major markets. We are pleased with the volume growth we delivered in EMEA and expect the momentum to continue through 2024.\nConstant currency consumer sales in the APAC region were down 5%, driven by a 6% volume decrease, primarily due to the macro environment in China. Outside of China, we drove high single-digit sales growth with price and volume contributing equally and the growth was broad-based across categories and markets.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 12. We grew first quarter constant currency sales by 2%, with pricing contributing 2% and volume contributing 1%, partially offset by a 1% decline due to the divestiture of the canning business and the exit of a private label product line in EMEA.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales rose 3%, reflecting a 2% contribution from price and 1% growth in volume and product mix. Sales growth was by flavor, most notably in Performance Nutrition and Branded Foodservice.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales decreased by 1%, including a 3% impact from the divestiture of the Kenny business. Pricing actions of 4% were partially offset by lower volume and product mix of 2%, primarily attributable to the exit of the private label product line I mentioned earlier.\nIn the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency, with a 4% contribution from pricing and 1% volume growth. Outside of China, sales remained negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts some of our quick service restaurant customers are experiencing in Southeast Asia.\nAs seen on Slide 16, gross profit margin expanded by 140 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix, the benefit of our comprehensive continuous improvement program, or CCI, and our global operating effectiveness program, or GOE, as well as effective price realization.\nAs we look to the second quarter, we expect gross margins to modestly expand compared to the year ago period as we realized our highest level of pricing and cost recovery in the second quarter of 2023. This trend may differ from our historical cadence. Our gross margin increased sequentially every quarter throughout the year. However, we continue to expect higher margins in the second half compared to the first half of the year.\nNow moving to Slide 17, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the first quarter of last year, driven by brand marketing and research and development investments, which were partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points. Brand marketing increased significantly compared to the prior year. Our investments are yielding results, and we anticipate continuing to invest behind these efforts.\nSales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in an increase in adjusted operating income to 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and 4% in constant currency. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment was up 2% with minimal impact from currency.\nIn Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased 15% and included a 1% currency impact. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability. And in the first quarter, as expected, we drove margin expansion versus the prior year in this segment.\nOur performance this quarter reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make continued investments in 2024 to fuel top line growth.\nTurning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 18. Our interest expense was comparable to the prior year. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5% compared to 21.8% in the year ago period. Our tax rate in the prior year benefited from discrete tax items. We expect these benefits to occur later in the year for us in 2024.\nAs a result, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% for the year. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the first quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We're the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 20, first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.59 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by sales growth and gross margin expansion, as well as the results from McCormick de Mexico joint venture, partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate.\nOn Slide 21, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in the first quarter, $138 million compared to $103 million in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements.\nWe returned $130 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures. As a reminder, capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure. Our priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.\nImportantly, we remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and continue to expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives.\nNow turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 22. Our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment.\nTurning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. At the top line, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%.\nGiven the momentum in the first quarter, we expect to be closer to the midpoint to high end of our guidance range. In terms of pricing, we continue to expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price gap management investments that will drive volume growth. We expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making.\nAs we noted, our initiatives will take time to materialize. And we continue to expect to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, absent any new macroeconomic wins. Starting in the second quarter, we will have lapped the impact of the DSD and private label product line business exits. The divestiture of the Giotti candy business will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business throughout the year as we optimize our portfolio, the impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales.\nAnd finally, in China, our food away from Home business, which is included in APAC consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year. And as such, we expect China consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of the China business.\nOur 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing product mix and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of low single-digit increases in cost inflation and our increased investments.\nAdditionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new Flavor Solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. We expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from our CCI and DOE programs, partially offset by investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing.\nWe expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partly offset by CCI savings. And we continue to expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year.\nOur 2024 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in discrete impacts. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico.\nTo summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023. As we head into the second quarter, let me summarize some of the puts and takes. We expect to drive volume improvement with some pressure expected in Flavor Solutions due to the trends Brendan mentioned earlier, fully lapped the impact of pricing actions we took in the prior year and activated a significant portion of our price gap management efforts and continue our investments in brand marketing as our programs are working and driving growth.\nAs a result, our operating profit will likely be less robust for the second quarter. However, we continue to anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth.\nWe remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to close with our key takeaway on Slide 23. First quarter results and our volume trajectory demonstrate that we are making right investments to drive long-term, sustainable organic growth and reinforces our confidence. We are executing on proven strategies and investing behind our business with speed and agility and an alignment to consumer behavior, and capitalizing on our advantaged categories across segments. We are able to do this and continue to make great progress on managing costs, led by our GOE and CCI programs, to support our increased investments in the business and drive margin expansion.\nOur performance for the quarter, coupled with our growth plans, give us confidence in achieving the mid- to high end of our projected constant currency sales growth for 2024. Finally, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions and reiterate my confidence that together, we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook. Now for your questions."

This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's fourth quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides on our IR website, ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kasey Jenkins, Chief Growth Officer.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nToday's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by sharing what we will cover in this morning's call. I will begin with an overview of our fourth quarter year-over-year results, focusing on top line drivers. Next, I will briefly reflect on our full year 2023 performance and share our plans and building blocks to improve volume in 2024. Mike will then go into more depth on the fourth quarter financial results and the details of our 2024 financial outlook. And finally, before your questions, I will share some closing comments, including our key priorities as I begin my first full year as CEO.\nWe -- turning now to our results on Slide 4. I want to start by acknowledging that our top line results for the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations as volume trends decelerated relative to the third quarter. There was greater-than-expected pressure on the consumer that drove changes in their behavior, which impacted our growth. We did, however, see sequential improvement in several key areas within our portfolio. underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working, as I will highlight in a moment.\nThat said, we do recognize that consumers are exhibiting even more value-seeking behavior, they are increasing shopping trips, reducing basket size and making just-in-time purchases, creating further uncertainty in the consumer environment. I want to be clear that we are dedicated to improving volumes. We have refined our plans and are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results, and return to differentiated and sustainable volume-led growth, and you should expect improvement over the coming year and into 2025 and beyond.\nNow let's go to our fourth quarter performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 5. In our fourth quarter, sales increased 3%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2%, reflecting a 5% contribution from pricing, which was partially offset by a 3% decline in volume and product mix. As expected, the benefit from the China recovery was fully offset by the impact of our strategic decisions to exit DSD, direct store delivery, of our bag Hispanic spices in the Americas, and the exit of a private label product line and the divestiture of a small gaming business, which was part of our Giotti Flavor Solutions operations in EMEA.\nStarting with where results differed from expectations. In Americas Consumer, we expected volume declines in the prepared food categories that we participate in, like frozen and Asian. But the decline was greater than we anticipated due to the more challenging macro trends and was broadly consistent with the performance of these categories. For mustard in the Americas, extremely low price points in private label impacted our consumption and is driving down category dollars. We plan to improve our volume trends in 2024 by narrowing price gaps, increasing promotions and, importantly, through distribution wins.\nRecipe mixes in the Americas showed increased stress from crossing key price points due to previous pricing actions. We have a plan to address these to return to volume growth. In our Flavors product category, some of our consumer packaged food group customers experienced greater softness in volumes within their own business, more than we expected in both the Americas and EMEA.\nFinally, our growth of quick service restaurants and Flavor Solutions was impacted by slower-than-expected restaurant traffic in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Within Asia Pacific, some of our customers are experiencing boycotts in Southeast Asia related to geopolitical events. We are monitoring this situation and anticipate continued softness in these customer's volume to continue into 2024.\nTurning to what met our expectations in the quarter. We drove volume growth for our second quarter in a row in America spices and seasonings. In branded food service, our growth was strong across the portfolio driven by volume. In Asia Consumer, our recovery from COVID-related disruptions in China was in line with the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. Outside of China, for the quarter, our volume growth was strong across all categories. In EMEA Consumer, consistent with the third quarter, pricing actions contributed to double-digit growth, which pressured volumes.\nNow I'd like to further build on some of the initiatives within our growth levers, notably increased brand marketing, targeted price gap management, new products and packaging renovation, which have already proven to strengthen our volume trends in key areas. We have intentionally chosen our investments in these areas as we believe they will generate the most significant returns. We are confident our investments will continue to drive improved results in '24, and we expect to invest more, positioning us further for success in 2025 and going forward.\nFirst, spices and seasonings is a priority investment area for us, given our category leadership and its profitable growth potential for both McCormick and our customers. Our initiatives are driving U.S. branded sales volume growth, with strength during the fourth quarter in holiday performance. And looking at consumption, we continue to sequentially improve share trends again in the fourth quarter, both in terms of dollars and units. We continue to activate initiatives of price gap management, innovation, packaging and a meaningful step-up in brand marketing support for America's spices and seasonings. And the results have begun to materialize, demonstrating that we have the right plans and are taking the right actions to grow in this attractive category.\nThe renovation of our U.S. core everyday herb and spice portfolio, which began in the second quarter of 2023, continues to roll out according to plan. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had shifted about 75% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have fully transitioned on shelf experienced stronger velocity. We are pleased with our results to date, which increased our confidence that this renovation will be a strong contribution to our growth in 2024 as our customers' shelves continue to transition.\nWe are making progress on restoring distribution that was lost due to past supply issues. We have secured wins and new distribution. We expect to largely start seeing the impact of our actions in our results mid-2024, coinciding with most of our customers' shelf resets. Overall, we have a robust set of initiatives in flight and anticipate making progress throughout the year. I would expect growth in share gains in units and volume to lead our trends.\nSpending a moment on spices and seasonings and other key markets. Similar initiatives as in the U.S. are driving volume growth and share gains in Canada, France and Australia. We also renovated our spice and herb portfolio in Southeast Asia, with the same innovative packaging as the U.S. and EMEA, and began shipping the new products in the fourth quarter. We are supporting this transition with increased marketing spend in the first quarter.\nNext, in branded foodservice, we achieved strong volume growth across all customer segments. Our foodservice operators continue to expand their value menu options, and they are turning to our products to deliver great taste for a fraction of their costs. We drove share gains in spices and seasonings as well as our hot sauce share of tabletop, with expanded distribution, new products, customer wins and increased menu penetration, as well as our expertise in heat.\nHeat continues to be a growth accelerator globally for total McCormick, outpacing the rest of the portfolio as customers and consumers alike continue to drive demand in this flavor profile. New products contributed to fourth quarter growth. For instance, in the U.S., our Cholula salsas in the Mexican aisle are building distribution and bringing new consumers to the category. And our branded food service items, Frank's Mild Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot continue to perform at.\nIn the U.K., Australia, we are driving hot sauce category growth with Cholula gaining momentum on shelf. In the U.S., we secured new hot sauce distribution during the quarter. And in the first quarter, we are launching new Frank's RedHot dips and popular flavors in a squeeze bottle format, as well as our national launch of Frank's Dill Pickle. We are well positioned going into our Super Bowl merchandising period. In summary, our investments in the key areas I just highlighted favorably impacted both our volume and margin performance for the quarter.\nMoving to gross margin. We are pleased with our performance, which continued to improve as the year progressed. Our results reflect effective price realization, the optimization of our cost structure and favorable product mix, driven by our portfolio optimization and focus in key areas. While confident in our ability to return to our historical margin profile in the near term, we will use improvements in our profitability to fuel continued investments in our business to drive our top line.\nWe are in a strong position to benefit from the virtuous flywheel of margin expansion given the work that's been done throughout the business. And we are able to intentionally focus our investments on areas that we expect will have the greatest impact on improving volume performance and driving sustainable profit growth.\nReflecting on our full year 2023 performance, I am proud of the progress we made in advancing our business in the right direction and our team is focused on returning to our long-term growth algorithm, strengthening our margins, significantly improving our cash flow, paying down our debt and reducing our leverage ratio. All have put McCormick in a position of strength to further invest with a focus on growth.\nOur foundation is strong. We have proven and powerful brands, and the results we are seeing from our refined and strengthened plans provide confidence in the effectiveness of our strategies and investments. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we expect volume trends to improve throughout the year and volume growth during the second half, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds. The pace of margin recovery to historical levels will take time as our focus is on investing to drive sustainable sales growth to generate quality earnings for years to come.\nI also want to highlight on share performance, that we are approaching our plans differently with an even greater competitive posture and more intentionality towards driving growth in our key categories. Now let me highlight some ways in which we will drive growth through category management, brand marketing, new products, our proprietary technologies and our differentiated customer engagement.\nStarting in our Consumer segment with category management, where a key capability is revenue management, we have been building our discipline in revenue management for several years and have a history of optimizing pricing on shelf to benefit both McCormick and the retailer. As you would expect, this has become even more important in recent years. In the current environment, we are taking a surgical approach to managing our price gaps to private label and branded competitors, accelerating our efforts across various products and are seeing results.\nIn our spices and seasonings category, we selected individual items we believe would be the most responsive based on the elasticities we were experiencing. For instance, in our iconic Black Pepper and Vanilla product lines, our actions proved to be effective. We are recapturing buyers, increasing household penetration and are driving profitable volume growth that is outpacing the category volume growth in these product lines.\nAs I mentioned earlier, across key price points in America's recipe mixes and are also leaning into our revenue management execution in this category. For example, in the fourth quarter, we focused on gravy as a key holiday item, which drove results, contributing to our successful holiday season. We expect to see further results from our actions as we work through the portfolio.\nAcross all markets, our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. These investments we make in price gap management result in greater volumes and improved margins over time. Importantly, customers that are adopting our recommendations are seeing better category performance, and McCormick is driving volume and share growth in their respective businesses.\nWe are prioritizing brand marketing, connecting with consumers and fueling growth with our increased investments. We have a history of investing behind our brands and did so again in 2023. We plan for a strong start to 2024, with aggressive first quarter brand marketing investments which are well underway. We expect a significant increase for the year, concentrated to the first half. We will continue to invest across various channels. We plan to further drive household penetration and increase buy rates with additional focus in retail media.\nOur first quarter plans include an increased Christmas holiday campaigns in all regions, increasing our value-focused messaging for our everyday spices and seasonings and recipe mix in the U.S. Also supporting our packaging renovations that I mentioned earlier in both the U.S. and Southeast Asia, and promoting our new products in EMEA.\nTurning to new products, which are a key growth driver in both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. In the Consumer segment, our 2023 launches are expected to substantially contribute to growth in 2024. For instance, in EMEA, we are thrilled with the early results from our range of Schwartz seasonings and recipe mixes that we launched with Nadia Hussain, a British celebrity chef as we entered the fourth quarter.\nWe are expanding our household penetration, bringing in new and younger households into the brand. The recipe mixes in this range contributed along with other new products and expanded distribution to our fourth quarter growth in U.K. recipe mixes, which was double the category rate.\nIn Flavor Solutions, collaborating with our customers on innovation continues to be a key driver of success. Across the portfolio, our customers continue to focus on innovation to meet consumers' needs. We are winning in flavors with better-for-you products and on-trend flavors; and, in branded foodservice, with our heat platform and value-oriented products for foodservice operators. We are pleased with our 2023 performance from new products, which contributed to our sales growth and accelerate compared to the prior year, as we expected.\nImportantly, we have a strong lineup of new products spanning heat, freshness, value, convenience and flavor exploration in our Consumer segment for 2024, which we will share more about at CAGNY in February. And in Flavor Solutions, we are also carrying a robust pipeline of new products into 2024, positioning McCormick and our customers for success.\nWe are leveraging our proprietary technologies and flavor solutions to support our innovation to win share in attractive high-growth categories and to attract new customers. In addition, with our differentiated customer engagement approach, we are intentionally targeting a mid-market customer base who are category leaders and high-growth innovators as well as diversifying our customer base to drive share gains across our portfolio and profitable growth.\nOur actions are yielding results. For instance, in the fourth quarter, our volume growth in performance nutrition significantly outpaced the market. And in the beverage category, we drove sales growth even though the category decelerated, partially by targeting high-value and high-growth segments within [indiscernible]. With our flavor leadership and continued investments, we are fully committed to fuel category growth with our differentiated portfolio.\nWe have confidence in our plans, which we'll build throughout the year and yield volume growth during the back half of the year. We are dedicating more resources to categories where we have the right to continue to win. We are seeing our actions drive momentum and solid results in areas where we have focused. We believe that the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, our categories and McCormick, which will differentiate and strengthen our leadership.\nNow before I turn it over to Mike to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial performance and 2024 outlook, I would like to comment on recent changes in our Board of Directors. Freeman Hrabowski, who has served as a director for 27 years, will be retiring from the Board as of the end of March. I am grateful for his service and contributions, which has significantly benefited McCormick, and we will miss him.\nI also want to welcome Terry Thomas, who has joined our Board. Terry brings extensive global consumer product industry expertise through his current role as Chief Growth Officer for Flowers Foods,and his experience at Unilever prior to that. I look forward to working with Terry and the contributions he will make to McCormick.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 10. Our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting 5% of pricing benefit, offset by a 3% volume mix decline. As Brendan mentioned, our volume performance was impacted by changes in consumers' behavior. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales were flat, reflecting a 4% increase from pricing actions, offset by a 4% volume decline. The benefit from our recovery in China and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins netted to no overall impact for the total Consumer segment.\nOn Slide 11, consumer sales in the Americas decreased 4% in constant currency, with the DSD exit I just mentioned driving 2% of that decline. The remaining sales decline was due to lower volume and product mix in several areas of the portfolio, including, as Brendan mentioned, prepared foods, mustard and recipe mixes, which was partially offset by volume growth in spices and seasonings, which was driven by our investments.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Sales growth was broad-based across markets and categories. We remain at an elevated pricing environment in EMEA, and we expect volumes to improve as pricing wins in 2024. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region increased 31%, driven by a 26% volume increase, primarily due to the expected recovery in China. Outside of China, we also drove double-digit sales growth with strong volume and broad-based growth across all categories and markets.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 14. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 5%, reflecting a 7% increase from pricing, offset by a 2% decrease from volume and product mix. Our growth momentum in this segment was exceptional through the third quarter. And even with a deceleration in the fourth quarter, our sales growth for the year was strong.\nIn the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales rose 6% driven by pricing, as volume and product mix was comparable to the prior year. Sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio and led by branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 2%, with pricing actions contributing 14%, partially offset by a 3% impact from the divestiture of the Giotti canning business, a 9% decline in all other volume due to softness in some of our customers' volumes within their own businesses and a 1% impact from exiting a private label product line.\nIn the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency with a 6% contribution from pricing, offset by a 1% volume decline. Our business in China delivered strong growth. Outside of China, sales were negatively impacted by geopolitical boycotts in some of our quick service restaurant customers, as Brendan mentioned.\nAs seen on Slide 18, gross profit margin expanded 320 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. Drivers in the quarter included favorable product mix in both segments and our CCI and GOE programs, as well as effective price realization. Additionally, we lapped elevated costs related to some discrete issues and flavor solutions operations. Overall, we ended 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and the year.\nNow moving to Slide 19. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the fourth quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses were partially offset by CCI and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and we expect to invest further in 2024 to support our brands. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 190 basis points.\nSales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment was flat. And in Flavor Solutions, adjusted operating income increased $0.73 in constant currency. We remain committed to restoring Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in the fourth quarter, as expected, we drove significant margin expansion versus prior year in this segment.\nFor the total company, we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points in the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the year, which reflects our commitment to increase our profit realization and positions us well to make investments early in 2024 to fuel top line growth.\nTurning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 20. Our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 23.1% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact this year.\nOur income from unconsolidated operations in the fourth quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with our McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalade and mustard product lines in Mexico and the business contributed meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 22, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.85 as compared to $0.73 for the year ago period. The increase was attributable to higher operating income driven by gross margin expansion and the results from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture I just mentioned.\nOn Slide 23, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was strong in 2023, $2.2 billion, nearly double our cash flow of $652 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $419 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used [ $264 million ] for capital expenditures in 2023. Our capital expenditures include projects to increase capacity and capabilities to meet growing demand, advance our digital transformation and optimize our cost structure.\nOur priority remains to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. We expect 2024 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. We are well positioned to continue paying down debt and coupled with ending 2023 and with a leverage ratio slightly above our 2024 year-end target of 3x. We are pleased to be deleveraging faster than expected.\nNow turning to our 2024 financial outlook on Slide 24. Our 2024 outlook reflects our prioritized investments in key categories to strengthen volume trends and drive long-term sustainable growth, while appreciating the uncertainty of the consumer environment. We are well positioned with our cost savings programs to fuel investments for volume growth as well as generate operating margin expansion. The balancing of margin expansion and investments to drive growth is critical to our success, not only in 2024, but also into 2025 and beyond as we remain committed and confident in our long-term algorithm.\nTurning to the details. First, currency rates are expected to unfavorably impact sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%. On the top line, we expect constant currency net sales to range between a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We expect a favorable impact related to the wrap of last year's pricing actions, most significantly in the first half, partially offset by our price cap management investments that will drive volume growth.\nWe expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year. First, we expect to drive improved volume trends as the year progresses through the strength of our brands and the intentional and targeted investments we are making. Our initiatives will take time to materialize, and we are expecting to return to volume growth during the second half of the year, notwithstanding any new macroeconomic headwinds.\nWe have made strategic decisions to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth that will also impact volumes during the year. We decided to exit DSD of our bag Hispanic spices in Americas consumer and to exit a private label product line in EMEA Flavor Solutions, both will impact the first quarter. And we divested the Giotti canning business, which will impact us through the third quarter. We expect to continue to prune lower-margin business through the year as we optimize our portfolio, the impact of which will be reflected within the natural fluctuation of sales.\nAnd finally, in China, our food away-from-home business, which is included in APAC Consumer, is expected to be impacted by slower demand in the first half of the year, and as such, we expect China Consumer sales to be comparable to 2023 for the full year. While we recognize there has been volatility in demand in China, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our China business.\nMoving to gross margin. our 2024 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2023. This gross margin expansion reflects favorable impacts from pricing, product mix and the cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low single-digit increase in cost inflation and our increased investments. Additionally, we expect to begin reducing our dual running costs related to our transition to the new flavor solutions facility in the U.K. in the back half of the year.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. We expect 4% to 6% constant currency growth. This growth is projected to be driven by our gross margin expansion as well as SG&A cost savings from CCI and GOE programs, partially offset by our investments to drive volume growth, including brand marketing. We expect our brand marketing spend to increase high single digits in 2024, reflecting a double-digit increase in investments, partially offset by CCI savings. And we expect our increased investments in brand marketing to be concentrated in the first half of the year and weighted more to the first quarter.\nOverall, based on the flow-through of our volume expectations and the timing of our investments, we expect our profit to be less robust in the first half and anticipate strong profit growth in the second half of the year. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22% is based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring discrete items. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half of the year. We expect a mid-teens increase in our income from unconsolidated operations, reflecting the strong performance we anticipate in McCormick de Mexico.\nTo summarize, our 2024 adjusted earnings per share projection of $2.80 to $2.85 reflects a 4% to 6% increase compared to 2023, or 5% to 7% in constant currency. As Brendan noted, we are dedicated to improving volumes. We are prioritizing our investments to drive impactful results and return to differentiated sustainable volume-led growth. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 financial outlook.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments on Slide 25. Our business is moving in the right direction, we strengthened our margins, significantly improved our cash flow and are deleveraging ahead of expectations. From a top line perspective, volume trends improved sequentially through the third quarter, but fourth quarter performance was disappointing.\nParts of our portfolio grew underscoring that our strategies and initiatives are working. In areas that were challenged, we know the drivers and are addressing those that we control. And combined with the initiatives we have in place, we fully expect we will drive improved trends and build to volume growth during the second half of 2024. We are committed to recovering our margins in both segments to historical levels, while making investments to drive sustainable top line growth.\nThe fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place, and we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in 2024 and beyond. I am excited for the year ahead, which will be my first full year as CEO. I plan to drive an ambitious agenda with greater competitive posture and more intentionality that capitalize on our strong business fundamentals as well as the value of our brands and capabilities and have driven our past success.\nMcCormick is a growth company, a global leader in flavor, with a long-term orientation and a strong culture. I am committed to advance our leadership and our differentiation. Our strategic pillars: growth, performance and people, remain consistent. I am energized to further incorporate my mark on our growth plans.\nIn a fast-changing global environment, we need to build on our competitive strengths and opportunities to remain a differentiated market leader. As such, I would like to share the 5 priorities that the entire McCormick organization is rallying behind as we enter 2024.\nFirst, strengthen our global leadership in core categories. That means growing volume and market share in herbs, spices and seasonings and condiments, strengthening our leadership in heat and increasing the global scale of our flavors business and expanding our branded foodservice business. Second, drive profitable growth and higher returns on investments. We want to restore the operating margin we have lost the last several years. But importantly, do so in a measured way, using our cost savings and operating leverage to fuel top line growth in the near term that will drive sustainable profits for years to come.\nThird, accelerate our digital transformation to enhance how we serve consumers and customers to work faster and more efficiently, and to strengthen decision-making by further leveraging data and insights. Fourth, continue to elevate our power of people culture and build the next generation of leaders and capabilities that will drive McCormick's success well into future years. And finally, all these contribute to our fifth priority, which is to strengthen and expand stem competitive advantages to make McCormick even more effective in the marketplace. Our advantages are critical to ensuring we deliver on our growth potential.\nSimply put, I am committed to harnessing the collective expertise of our talented McCormick team with a renewed sense of urgency and speed to deliver on these priorities, resulting in long-term, sustainable profitable growth that will be industry-leading. While 2024 is an important year of investments, we are confident in our capabilities and enthusiastic about some early signposts of success. And we are committed to returning to the type of growth that investors expect from McCormick. The foundation has been laid and building blocks are in place, and I look forward to sharing more about them at CAGNY in February.\nAs I said, I am excited for the year ahead and delivering on our long-term objectives. Finally, before turning to your questions, I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2023, and the momentum they are carrying into 2024, and reiterate my confidence that, together, we will drive the profitable growth reflected in our 2024 outlook.\nNow for your questions."

This is Faten Freiha, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's third quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides on our IR website.\nWith me this morning are Brendan Foley, President and CEO; Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kasey Jenkins, Chief Growth Officer. During this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides.\nIn our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information. Today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation, update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statement slide for more information.\nI'll now turn the discussion over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying how pleased I am to join you today for my first earnings call as President and CEO. Just over 1 month into my new role, I am energized by our underlying business trends, which reinforce our competitive advantages and differentiation.\nLet's turn to our results. We drove another quarter of strong performance, reflecting sustained demand and effective execution of our growth strategies across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Our results were in line with our expectations across our business, notwithstanding challenges for our Consumer segment in Asia Pacific, or APAC, where the pace of China's economic recovery has been slower than previously anticipated.\nLet me start with the highlights for the third quarter. We delivered solid constant currency sales growth. We continue to realize effective price realization, and importantly, volume performance, excluding China, has improved each quarter throughout the year. We continue to see top line momentum in our business positioning McCormick for sustained growth. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Year-to-date cash flow from operations more than doubled relative to the prior year due to higher operating income and working capital improvements. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our business fundamentals and the effective execution of our proven strategies while leveraging the sustained demand for flavor.\nTurning to Slide 5. In the third quarter, we drove 6% sales growth in constant currency, demonstrating the strength of our broad global portfolio. Our constant currency growth reflected strong business performance, with an 8% contribution from pricing and a 2% decline in volume and product mix. This decline in volume was driven by 2 factors: a 1% volume decline attributable to the impact of a slower-than-expected economic recovery in China; and a 1% decline related to the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our consumer business in Russia and the pruning of low-margin business to optimize our portfolio. All other underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 1%.\nI would like to now share a few highlights on gross margin and operating income for the quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail. We drove strong gross margin improvement year-over-year, reflecting continued recovery of the cost inflation, our pricing lagged last year and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. We remain focused on improving our margins over the long term and believe that our recovery will be a continuous build. And we expect to return to historical levels and believe there is a runway beyond that, recognizing it will take some time. Higher gross profit for the quarter was partially offset by lower-than-expected performance in China as well as higher SG&A. As planned, we continue to build back incentive compensation and increased brand marketing investments. The net impact was a 5% increase in adjusted operating income versus the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results year-to-date. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our focused approach to optimizing our cost structure reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory during the fourth quarter and beyond.\nMoving into the fourth quarter, we can continue to expect top line momentum across our portfolio, including growth in China as we lap the COVID-related disruptions. China's growth, however, is expected to be less than originally anticipated, which when combined with its year-to-date performance, has led to a lower full year 2023 benefit than we originally expected. Despite this impact, however, we are reaffirming our sales outlook, and now anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range. We are reaffirming our operating income outlook, which highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our business, excluding China. Demand is strong. We are driving improvement in our margin profile and are optimizing our cost structure effectively.\nNow for our performance by segment. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 7. We saw solid results across the Americas and EMEA, which were tempered by our APAC region due to China, as I mentioned earlier. Notwithstanding China, we are pleased with our underlying performance.\nNow for some highlights by regions. First, in the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew approximately 4%, excluding the year-over-year impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of DSD, direct store delivery of our bagged Hispanic spices. There is a minor difference between our sales and consumption, which is attributable to listing fees for a significant increase in new distribution and new products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubb's items and Tabitha Brown line extensions. Importantly, our categories remain advantaged in terms of growth relative to overall macro trends, and we are well positioned to drive future growth.\nThe fundamental strength of the spices and seasonings category is evident as cooking at home has remained elevated since pre-COVID and consumers have an increasing demand for flavor. U.S. spices and seasonings growth is continuing to outpace the total edible category in units and dollars. We have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions to grow market share in this very attractive and competitive category. We have made progress and shown improvement relative to the beginning of the year. We continue to restore distribution, which was lost because of supply issues.\nAs we look at our performance and our trends, we are happy to total distribution point growth in the third quarter. We also continue to be pleased that our assortment on shelf is more productive than pre-COVID. In addition, we have significant new distribution and innovation that is starting to come online as customers reset their shelves. As we said before, restoration will take some time, and we expect to drive growth as we continue to progress. In addition to driving distribution gains, we have a continued focus on supporting our brands and optimizing pricing. As you would expect, this has become a more important part of our category management efforts in recent years. Our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns as well as user innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. Our efforts are yielding results.\nThe renovation of our U.S. core Everyday Spice Ranch portfolio is rolling out according to plan. At the end of the third quarter, we have shipped about 40% of our renovated SKUs, and notably, products that have transitioned on shelf have seen high teens improvement in velocity, and our significant brand marketing campaign featuring the benefits of the new packaging ramped up at the end of the third quarter leading into the holiday season.\nOur larger-sized Super Deal herbs and spices continues to gain share. We saw strong performance in the third quarter driven by pricing and higher unit volume. Expanded distribution has been a major driver for our performance as well as consumers that are seeking value and trading up to larger sizes. We have the right assortment in this environment. Our household penetration on larger sizes is greater than pre-COVID. We are confident this product line will continue to drive growth as we expand distribution further and launch new line extensions.\nOur grilling performance was strong this quarter, supported by our Fire Up campaign as well as contribution from new product launches that we discussed on our earnings call in June. Frank's RedHot sauces, French's mustard and Stubb's barbecue sauce grubs as well as Laurie's marinades all delivered significant growth in the third quarter relative to the prior year. We drove double-digit sales growth with contributions from pricing and volume across our total growing portfolio. And we drove market share gains in mustard, barbecue sauce and marinades in the third quarter.\nOur expansion into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with new Cholula Taco recipe mixes and salsas is continuing to build distribution and performance to date is outperforming our expectations. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products.\nTurning to EMEA, where we delivered a great quarter, our strongest quarterly sales performance in more than 2 years with double-digit sales growth. Notably, in the U.K. and France, we drove volume growth as pricing remained elevated. In both countries, we delivered significant growth in the discount channel, driven by expanded distribution with new and existing customers. In other parts of the region, we are also making meaningful progress in this fast-growing channel. We grew our business in the discount channel by over 30% across EMEA in the third quarter. Our grilling activations with key retailers in France and our promotional activities in the U.K., along with brand marketing support, drove strong third quarter growth across the growing portfolio. E-commerce also contributed meaningfully to our growth in both countries. Consumption data continues to indicate that the consumer is holding up well in our categories with consumption trends continues to accelerate across the region. We grew share in herbs, spices and seasonings for our total EMEA business, with the U.K., Eastern Europe, Italy and France all contributing. France grew share for the first time in 2 years. And U.K. recipe mixes, we extended our leading share position during the third quarter. New products and effective in-store promotions drove share gains. We also continue to drive hot sauce category growth in the U.K. with Cholula leading to growth in the third quarter. And we are also building distribution of Cholula in France.\nIn our APAC region, while the pace of recovery in this business has been slower than expected, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Notwithstanding the slower recovery in China, in all regions in our Consumer segment, our investments in brand marketing, category management initiatives and new products are proving to be effective and driving strong growth across our categories. We are making sequential improvement on volume, advancing our heat platform and are pleased with our performance. We continue to fuel our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. We are also forming strategic partnerships to reach and enhance brand awareness with loyal built-in audiences. Building on the success we have with our Tabitha Brown partnership in light of new products in the U.S., where growth continues to accelerate, we are partnering with Nadia Hussein, a celebrity British chef, who won the sixth series of BDCs, The Great British Bake-off in EMEA. We are launching a delicious range of short seasonings, recipe mixes and meal kits with Nadia, and are helping build the confidence of U.K. consumers in the kitchen with cook-alone videos and recipe ideas. We are thrilled to partner with Nadia, and preliminary results are very positive. We are looking forward to working with her on various future initiatives across the region to expand our brand awareness and accelerate new product growth.\nOur brand marketing efforts continue to drive awareness and strengthen our brands. As you may have seen in July, we partnered with Mars and launched a limited edition, French's mustard flavor schedules. The objective of the campaign was to create top-of-mind awareness for French's through a buzzworthy moment to further strengthen the power of our brand. And of course, you can always have fun with muster. We are thrilled that this was our most successful earned campaign to date with a record 5 billion impressions It is also a perfect example of how we leverage our strengths across both segments, underscoring their complementary nature. Our Flavor Solutions team created the mustard flavor for this limited edition product which builds awareness for both our consumer and foodservice businesses. Our segments are working together to further bolster French's success. I am passionate about how our 2 segments: Consumer and Flavor Solutions complement each other, reinforcing what differentiates McCormick and enabling us to drive sustainable growth.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season and our related brand marketing plans across all regions. Importantly, with our supply issues resolved, we are better positioned than we were last year entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels to one, similar to pre-COVID, and are supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns across all regions. We are expecting a strong holiday season.\nWrapping up the consumer update. Our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past. The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved, and we are using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers -- customers, our categories and McCormick, which differentiates us even more and strengthening our leadership in our core categories.\nNow turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our growth momentum in this segment continues to be exceptional. The third quarter marks our tenth consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all 3 regions. We are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last 2 years. We remain committed to restoring our Flavor Solutions profitability. And in the third quarter, we again drove significant margin expansion versus prior year and expect continued progress toward our objective to build back our margin in this segment.\nLet me turn to our highlights by region. Our Americas third quarter strong sales growth was led by pricing with an increase in volume contributing as well. Both the flavors and branded foodservice product categories grew by double digits. With Flavors, our seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products. We are helping our customers grow with the strength of our brands. Our continued success with providing the seasonings for co-branded items included new ones with Frank's RedHot and Stubb's this quarter contributed to our growth. Strength in our customers' iconic products also contributed to our seasoning growth, particularly related to our heat platform. We also have strong momentum in flavors for Performance Nutrition beverages and health end market applications. Our growth is outpacing the market, fueled by the advantages of our proprietary technologies. Importantly, we are winning with new products for existing and new customers, largely across our mid-market customer base who are category leaders in specific markets or high-growth innovators and whose growth is outpacing larger customers. We continue to have a robust pipeline of new products and our conversion rate is strong. We are creating preferred flavors, enabling our customers to continue to win in the marketplace.\nIn branded foodservice, we gained share in spices and seasonings this quarter. Additionally, our recent new products, Frank's Mild Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot Seasoning are performing very well and are exceeding our expectations. They have both been well received by our customers, reinforcing that the demand for heat is growing at both the mild and hot end of the spectrum. We are excited for continued growth in these items as well as the overall breadth of opportunity in heat.\nMoving to EMEA. We continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, with strong growth in both our quick service restaurant and packaged food and beverage customers. Pricing drove the growth as some of our customers in both channels continue to experience softness in the volume within their own businesses. As we continue to prune low-margin business in our Flavor Solutions segment, while it did not impact the third quarter, I want to mention that we divested a small canning business, which was part of our [indiscernible] operations in Italy. This divestiture allows us to focus our resources on our core flavors product category and drive further growth. Mike will have more in the future impact of this divestiture on the EMEA region in a few minutes.\nAnd in APAC, while the economic recovery in China was not as strong as anticipated, China contributed to the regional pricing and volume growth. Across the region, we benefited from our QSR customers increase in promotional activity. The strength of our flavor solutions portfolio and capabilities including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary inspired innovation are driving outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum. Our flavors product category, our 100% focus on flavor, our breadth and reach, our unrivaled consumer insights and our proprietary technology platform gives us an advantage and positions us well to continue to win in the technically insulated and value-added part of our portfolio, driving growth and advancing our flavor leadership and in branded foodservice, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, culinary partnerships and our expertise in heat to drive continued growth. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions and effective execution of our proven strategies bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and driving our Flavor Solutions leadership as well as margin restoration.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top line constant currency sales growth grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting 8% from pricing, partially offset with a 2% volume and mix decline. As Brendan already mentioned, there were impacts to volume related to the slower-than-expected recovery in the China consumer business, the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our consumer business in Russia and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the portfolio -- profitability of our portfolio. As a result, at the total company level, excluding these items, underlying volume performance was flat for the quarter and improved sequentially from the second quarter.\nIn our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased by 1%, reflecting a 5% increase in pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are a 2% decline due to a lower-than-expected recovery in China, and a 2% decline attributable to the Kitchen Basics divestiture, our business exit in Russia and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins.\nOn Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency and included a 4% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 2% volume decline due to the Kitchen Basics divestiture and DSD items I just mentioned. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 10% with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline primarily from exiting Russia. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all markets and categories. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region decreased 11% driven by a 5% volume decrease, primarily due to a slower-than-expected recovery in China. Also contributing to the decline was the impact of lapping strong China demand in the prior year following significant extended lockdowns during the second quarter of last year.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 11%, reflecting a 10% increase from pricing and a 1% increase from volume and product mix. Our volume growth was partially offset by the pruning of low-margin business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 10%, reflecting a 9% increase in pricing and a 1% volume and product mix growth. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio, with strength in flavors, including seasonings and specialty flavors as well as branded foodservice.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 1% impact from exiting the private label product line mentioned earlier. Outside of this product discontinuation, volumes declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses.\nRegarding the divestiture of the Giotti business, Brendan mentioned earlier, we expect this divestiture to impact EMEA Flavor Solutions by approximately 3% starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. For the total Flavor Solutions segment, we expect an approximately 1% impact, and for the total company, less than 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 13% in constant currency with a 7% contribution pricing and 6% volume growth, driven by our customers' promotional activities and limited time offers across the region.\nAs seen on Slide 21, gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period, reflecting our steadfast focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs and the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged over the past few years. We expect to finish 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter. Historically, our quarter gross margin has been higher than the second quarter. This year, however, they were comparable at approximately 37% because we realized our highest level of both pricing and cost rate from prior years in the second quarter.\nWe expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year, and as evidenced by our full year outlook and year-to-date results, we expect a higher gross margin in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year as well as expansion from the fourth quarter of 2022.\nNow moving to Slide 22. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the third quarter of last year. As higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the third quarter of last year, and we continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing for the full year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 160 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs resulted in constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment, which was impacted by the slower China recovery and brand marketing investments declined 5%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income increased 42%.\nTurning to interest expense and the income taxes on Slide 23. Our interest expense increased significantly over the third quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4% compared to 21.2% in the year ago period. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with the McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by lapping a favorable impact primarily related to an optimization of our debt portfolio included in other income in the third quarter of last year. This impact is also a headwind to our full year results.\nOn Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was very strong, $660 million in 2023 compared to $250 million for the same period last year, a 164% increase. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $340 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $187 million of cash for capital expenditures through the third quarter. We expect 2023 to be a very strong year of cash flow as evidenced by our 2023 year-to-date cash flow from operations of $660 million, which is already slightly higher than our full year cash flow in 2022. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. With our improving gross margin and lower inventory, we are well positioned to continue paying down debt, and we now expect to deleverage to approximately 3x earlier in 2024 than we originally expected.\nNow turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization, we expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth. Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also anticipate minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact year-to-date through the third quarter, and project a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our sales and operating profit outlook for 2023 despite a slower recovery in China. We no longer expect a 1% contribution to our sales from lapping last year's COVID disruptions in China. And we are also revising the benefit from a China recovery to our operating income from 300 basis points to 100 basis points.\nAt the top line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, and anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range given the lower-than-expected China recovery. The wrap of last year's pricing actions as well as the impact of new ones in '23 are the primary drivers of growth. Several factors are expected to impact our volume and product mix for the year, including price elasticities which are consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter. The continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. We continue to estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA Flavor Solutions private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter of 2023.\nAnd finally, the divestiture of Giotti's business, which closed on the first day of the fourth quarter, will have a minimal impact on total company sales for the year. We continue to plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 110 to 140 basis points higher than 2022 compared to our prior guidance of 50 to 100 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. It also reflects more than offsetting cost pressures with pricing actions as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last 2 years.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. We continue to expect 10% to 12% constant currency growth though the discrete expected to impact our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, remaining consistent with our prior outlook, we expect our GOE program to have an 800 basis point favorable impact and the Kitchen Basics divestiture to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. Next, I already mentioned the expected 100 basis point benefit related to China, which is lower than the originally anticipated 300 basis points. Finally, we expect a 900 basis point unfavorable impact from building back incentive compensation, slightly ahead of our prior projection of 800 basis points given the increase in earnings expectations since the beginning of the year.\nThe net impact of these discrete items is an unfavorable 100 basis points as compared to a 200 basis point favorable impact in our previous outlook. The reaffirmation of our adjusted operating income outlook despite the unfavorable change in the impact from discrete items, highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our underlying business, which is now expected to be 11% to 13% growth compared to 8% to 10% growth previously. We are reaffirming our low single-digit increases in brand marketing investments, our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million, our interest expense outlook of an estimated range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22%. We are increasing our income from unconsolidated operations projection to a 30% expected increase from 2022 reflecting the strong performance we expect in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico.\nTo summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 14% to 16%, above our prior projection of 10% to 12%. Combining this 14% to 16% underlying growth with a 1% unfavorable impact from the discrete items on adjusted operating profit and the combined interest and tax headwind of 9% resulted in an expected increase of 4% to 6% or projected guidance range of adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.62 to $2.67. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion and strong cash flow. We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 financial outlook.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would like to provide some closing comments. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, trusted brands, increased digital engagement and purpose-minded practices continue to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are end-to-end flavor for our consumers and customers.\nWe remain a different kind of CPG company, one differentiated by our growth platform the results that we have achieved over the last years and our culture. We play in great and fast-growing categories. Our 2 segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions complement each other, reinforcing our differentiation. The scale, insights and technology that we leverage from both segments are meaningful in driving sustainable growth. We continue to leverage the strength of our culture and the power of people to drive success. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide as their energy and excitement for the business is coming through in our results.\nNow to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 30. Our third quarter performance was strong, reflecting sustained demand and the effective execution of our growth strategies and our volume performance, excluding China, continued to improve. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our year-to-date cash flow from operation results was strong, already equal to our full year 2022 results. Our reaffirmed sales and operating products, despite lower-than-expected China recovery highlights the growing strength of the rest of the business. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and execution of our proven strategies bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory over the long term.\nNow for your questions."

Jenkins\n\nVP of IR, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Chief Growth Officer. Thank you for joining today's second quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.\nWith me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman and CEO; Brendan Foley, President and COO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. I would also like to welcome [indiscernible] joining us on this call this morning. Satin joined McCormick earlier this month as Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nToday's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, McCormick & Co., Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. To start, last night, we announced that Brendan Foley will become McCormick's next Chief Executive Officer on September 1, and he is joining the Board of Directors immediately. I could not be more pleased with Brendan as my successor. I will continue to serve McCormick and all of its stakeholders as Executive Chairman of the Board once Brendan becomes CEO. This is a transition that we have been planning internally as part of an orderly multiyear succession plan, and it's exciting to finally share the news with all of you.\nAs many of you know, Brendan is exceptionally well qualified and prepared to lead McCormick. He deeply understands the importance of delivering continued strong growth, while doing the right things for people, communities and the planet. With our advantaged competitive positioning, supported by the growing demand for flavor and with our tremendous depth of talent, I have utmost confidence that McCormick, under Brendan's leadership, will continue to drive differentiated growth and long-term shareholder value. Congratulations, Brendan.\nNow on to our earnings update. First, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan will provide the business segment update, Mike will provide details on our financial results and 2023 outlook, and after your questions, I will have some final comments.\nStarting with our second quarter results. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance, which reflects sustained demand across our business and effective execution of our strategy. We delivered double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our pricing actions are in place and, importantly, our volume performance improved. We continue to see top line momentum in our business, positioning McCormick for sustained growth.\nAdditionally, we drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both segments, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our global operating effectiveness or GOE program, which includes the optimization of our supply chain cost structure, is yielding results. We grew adjusted earnings per share of 25% driven by significant adjusted operating income growth, and despite interest rate and tax headwinds.\nYear-to-date, cash flow from operations more than doubled driven by higher earnings, I just mentioned and working capital improvements. Notably, we're reducing inventory levels as planned. Both segments in all regions contributed with strong growth. Our results benefited from our recovery in China. And while the timing and pace of recovery in our China business was less robust than anticipated, it was still strong, and we are confident in the contribution China will provide to our results as the year progresses. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results during the first half of 2023.\nOur year-to-date results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our growth trajectory as we enter the second half of the year. As such, we are raising our adjusted operating income and earnings per share outlook for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 5. In the second quarter, we drove 8% sales growth or 10% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong business performance, with an 11% contribution from pricing and a 1% decline in volume and product mix. Netted in this volume decline are net 1% volume increase from China recovery, partially offset by our Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and 1% decline attributable to pruning low-margin business.\nAs examples, we exited direct store delivery, DSD, of our bagged Hispanic products in our Americas consumer segment and a private label food service line in EMEA. From a segment lens, both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments delivered strong sales growth in each region. In the Consumer segment, we continue to have strong price realization and we drove a sequential improvement in volume performance. Flavor Solutions, our exceptional performance continued with our ninth consecutive quarter of constant currency double-digit sales growth.\nOur sales performance demonstrates the strength of our broad global portfolio and positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. I'd like to share a few highlights about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in a few moments. We drove significant gross margin improvement, reflecting the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lagged last year. Cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs and the impact of strategic decisions we've made to optimize our portfolio, with a focus on driving margin improvement as we continue to prune low-margin business.\nOur gross margin expansion in the quarter was partially offset by higher SG&A as we build back incentive compensation as planned. Our adjusted operating income increased by 35% versus the second quarter of last year or, in constant currency, 36%. This growth drove an adjusted earnings per share increase of 25%, which also reflected higher interest and effective tax rate.\nWe remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. We are halfway through the year. Our year-to-date results speak for themselves. We expect to continue driving profitable growth for the balance of the year. Demand is strong. We're driving improvements in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively.\nI want to thank McCormick employees worldwide for their collective power is driving our success. I'm proud of the tremendous job that McCormick team has done navigating the dynamic environment over the last few years. I'd like to recognize their energy and excitement for the business, which is coming through in our results.\nNow I'd like to ask Brendan to share the second quarter business updates for our segments.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Lawrence. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 8, our underlying performance was strong, reflecting our price realization and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trends. We continue to see sequential improvement.\nNow for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 7%. The difference between our sales and consumption was attributable to the retail sell-through of discontinued items and listing fees for an increase in the new distribution and products, for example, our new Cholula and Stubb's items and Tabitha Brown line extensions.\nAs anticipated, our alignment between consumption and shipments is normalizing. As usual, we expect some business fluctuations from period to period. In Spices & Seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters, with unit strength in core products such as straight spices and vanilla, as well as our seasoning blends which provide consumers both convenience and favor exploration.\nLaunch-to-date results of our Lawry’s Everyday Spice Ranch continue to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profits to the category. And like the first quarter, over half of the purchases are from new buyers to McCormick and overall incremental to the category. We also continue to see consumers trade up from private label. As our proprietary research indicates, consumers still prefer brands, even when under economic pressure. Our excitement and distribution for this product line continues to build.\nThe renovation of our U.S. core Everyday Spice portfolio is rolling out according to plan and is a seamless transition for our retail partners as it fits into existing shelf spots. At the end of the second quarter, we had about 30% of our SKUs on shelf. We will continue to roll out the product over the course of the year, and our significant brand marketing campaign will be ramping up at the end of the third quarter.\nOur larger-size Super Deal herbs and spices continue to benefit the category and McCormick with 11% consumption growth in the second quarter as consumers continue to cook more at home. Super Deals purchase cycle is similar to that of smaller sizes even though they are 3x the volume, and household penetration remains greater than pre-COVID. We kicked off the grilling season at the end of the second quarter and early results are good. Frank's RedHot and Cholula hot sauces, French's mustard, Lawry’s marinade and McCormick mayonaisa, all delivered double-digit growth in the second quarter with Stubb's Barbecue sauce as well as Grill Mates' seasoning blends and recipe mixes following close with high single-digit growth.\nWe are expecting our new grilling products and strong promotions to heat up share performance. We've launched 3 new Grill Mates on-trend flavors, including Smashburger and Garlic Butter, as well as Grillers Choice marinades, which you can use as 3 different flavors. All have had strong retailer acceptance. We are really excited about our Stubb's real-smoke rubs, which capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor, and Stubb's Jalepano and Honey Barbecue sauce, which combines 2 trending flavor profiles. And the nuance of heat and flavor that our Frank's Smoke & Sweet Barbecue Wing sauce offers.\nWe are fired up for the grilling season and expect the launch of our FireUp-brand marketing campaign in the third quarter to fire up consumer demand as well. Our expansion into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with Cholula Taco recipe mixes and salsas based on authentic Mexican formula is off to a great start, following our Cinco de Mayo execution. During the third quarter, we are increasing our Cholula brand marketing investments to support our expanded portfolio.\nOur third quarter brand marketing will also include increasing our investments for our McCormick Gourmet product line with our Further for Flavor campaign, highlighting our commitment to sustainability from farm to table. With our supply issues of this product line resolved, we are excited to be able to support this premium product offering for the first time in 2 years. And importantly, as we enter the second half of the year, it is historically our most significant period.\nFinally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products, such as our new Frank's Pickle Hot Sauce on our direct-to-consumer platform, which sold out in less than a week. We will start to expand distribution in stores late this year.\nIn EMEA, our second quarter was our strongest quarterly sales performance in 2 years. Our effective pricing accelerated to contribute double-digit growth, and our volume performance improved sequentially. And in fact, we grew volume in the U.K. and Eastern Europe. Consumption data continues to indicate the consumer is holding up well in our categories and our share performance is solid. We are growing herbs, spices and seasonings' share in Eastern Europe and in Italy, and our growth plans in France are also yielding results with improved share performance.\nWe are excited about celebrating the 60th anniversary of our program this year. We are scaling our grilling activation in France and partnering with key retailers to celebrate the brand's anniversary and to spark another reason to celebrate around the grill. In the U.K., we have also kicked off the grilling season and are building out our support in the discount channel, featuring our Schwartz Grill Mates products. In both France and the U.K. we will be increasing our third quarter brand marketing investments to support grilling as well as new products and to continue to emphasize our value messaging.\nAcross the region, we are making meaningful progress in the fast-growing discount channel, expanding distribution and gaining share. Finally, we are gaining share of the U.K. hot sauce category. We continue to drive strong Frank's RedHot performance and are accelerating our Cholula growth, with new distribution and e-commerce multipacks contributing significantly to our hot sauce growth. Overall, our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proven to be effective and are driving growth in EMEA.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter reflected lapping the COVID-related disruptions in China. While our business is recovering and our second quarter growth was robust, it was lower than our expectations, as the pace of reopening is proving to be more gradual and consumer spending was pressured by broad-based economic pressures in the region. We remain optimistic for a more normal operating environment emerging as the year progresses and we enter into 2024, driving sustainable growth as we execute on our strategies.\nOutside of China, new products and brand marketing initiatives drove double-digit growth in other markets, with strength in branded spices and seasonings and Frank's RedHot. Wrapping up the Consumer update, we are fueling our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. The supply issue we experienced last year are resolved, and we are using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth.\nOur year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past, before, during and after the pandemic. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our leadership in core categories.\nNow turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. We are continuing our outstanding sales growth momentum in this segment. As Lawrence already mentioned, the second quarter was our ninth consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. We have previously shared our commitment to restoring profitability in this segment, and the second quarter is marketing an inflection point toward our objective to continuing to build our margin. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all 3 regions. We are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last 2 years. Recovery in the second quarter was even greater than the first.\nNow for regional highlights. Our Americas second quarter strong sales growth was led by our Flavors product category. Within Flavors, seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products which is outpacing last year's new product contribution, as well as our strength in our customers' iconic products. We are winning in seasonings with our heat platform. Flavors for Performance Nutrition beverages,and health end market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue to drive double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new products for existing and new customers.\nIn branded foodservice, we continue to gain share in hot sauce, mustard, spices and seasonings, with strength this quarter in Grill Mates and Lawry’s. Our grilling portfolio is firing up in branded foodservice just like in our consumer segment.\nMoving to EMEA. We continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, led by higher sales to our quick service restaurant customers in the second quarter. Overall, our price realization accelerated again from last quarter. Notably, we grew sales constant currency 15% in the quarter, despite the -- from pruning low-margin business, as Lawrence mentioned earlier, and softness in some of our QSR and packaged food and beverage customers volume within their own business.\nAnd in APZ, we also experienced recovery in China, and are encouraged about the return to normal as growth was also driven by a strong performance of our quick service restaurant customers' promotions. Outside of China, we delivered double-digit growth, with effective price realization, all solid volume growth driven by demand from QSRs.\nThe strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary inspired innovation, are driving our outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum. The power of McCormick and [indiscernible] together continues to create exciting growth opportunities in a technically insulated and value-added part of our portfolio, especially with our recent wins in Health & Nutrition.\nAnd in branded foodservice, we expect new products, increase the menu penetration and culinary partnerships to drive continued growth. Our robust plans and flavor solutions bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and driving our flavor solutions leadership.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 12. Our top line constant currency sales grew 10% compared to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 11% from pricing, partially offset with a 1% volume and mix decline. As Lawrence already mentioned, there were impacts to volume related to the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the profitability of our portfolio. At the total company level, all these impacts netted out.\nIn our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased 7%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline. Including in this volume decline are a net 1% increase from the recovery in China, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and our business exit in Russia; a 1% decline from exiting DSD or direct store delivery business for our Hispanic bag products in the Americas.\nOn Slide 13, consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, with an 8% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 2% volume decline from the Hispanic product DSD exit and 1% underlying volume and mix decline. Our strong underlying sales growth was driven by the products in our grilling portfolio, Brendan mentioned earlier.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 9%, with a 12% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline from exiting Russia, a 1% underlying volume and mix decline. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all categories and markets. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 28%, driven by a 20% volume increase from China recovery and a 6% increase from pricing actions across the entire region, as well as 2% increase in all other volume and product mix.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 16. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 13%, reflecting a 14% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are a net 1% increase from the recovery in China, offset by a 1% decline from discontinuing a private label foodservice product line in EMEA.\nIn the Americas, flavor solutions constant currency sales rose 11%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth in seasonings was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low-margin business.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15% and with pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 2% impact from discontinuing the private label product line I mentioned earlier. EMEA's Flavor Solutions outstanding growth was driven by pricing and was broad-based across this portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. Volume and mix, outside of the product discontinuation, declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses, mainly packaged food and beverage customers as well as QSRs.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 22% in constant currency, with 13% volume benefit in China due to lapping the prior year COVID-related disruption, an 8% increase from pricing actions and a 1% increase in all other volume and mix driven by Australia.\nAs seen on Slide 20, gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period, reflecting our unwavering focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs, the continued recovery of the cost inflation or pricing lag over the last 2 years as we planned and favorable product mix in both segments. We offset current year inflation in the second quarter with our pricing.\nNotably, in Flavor Solutions, while we continue to incur some level of higher cost to meet high demand in certain parts of our business, we continue to make progress on reducing the level these costs. And as we expected, the second quarter's [ dual running ] costs we experienced in the U.K. were comparable to last year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter and expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year.\nNow moving to Slide 21. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, increased relative to the second quarter of last year as higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI-led and GOE savings, brand marketing increase compared to the second quarter of last year and we are expecting an even more significant year-over-year increase in the third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A increased 20 basis points.\nStrong sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 36% compared to the second quarter of 2022. In constant currency, the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income increased 24% and the Flavor Solutions segment grew 66%.\nTurning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 22. Our interest expense increased significantly over the second quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% and compared to 18.6% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 23, second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 as compared to $0.48 for the year ago period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.\nOn Slide 24, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was strong, $394 million in 2023 compared to $154 million for the first half of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory as well as lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $209 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $119 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter.\nWe expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization.\nNow turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on Slide 25. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and, with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers.\nWe expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and project a favorable impact in the second half.\nFor fiscal 2023, we are reaffirming our sales outlook. And as Lawrence mentioned, we are raising adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by our strong year-to-date performance, combined with the robust demand we continue to expect and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure.\nAt the top line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we have taken in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment; a 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility; the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter.\nAnd finally, the continued pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. We estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA Flavor Solutions' private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans.\nOur 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 50 to 100 basis points higher than 2022 compared to our prior guidance of 25 to 75 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lag for the last 2 years.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses.\nNext, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discreet items is a favorable 200 basis points.\nThis favorable impact combined with expected 8% to 10% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 10% to 12% compared to our previous guidance of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million.\nWe continue to anticipate a meaningful step-up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023, spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in the third quarter of 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be an approximately 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth.\nOur 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth.\nTo summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 10% to 12%, and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This resulted in an expected increase of 3% to 5% or projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.60 to $2.65.\nBefore turning it back to Brendan, I would like to recap the key takeaways I've seen on Slide 27. Our second quarter sales growth reflects sustained demand across our business and the effective execution of our strategies. Our pricing actions are in place and our volume performance improved. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both segments, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our cost-savings programs are yielding results in line with our expectations.\nOur year-to-date results combined with continued robust demand expectations and our actions to optimize our cost structure, bolster our confidence in delivering the strong operating performance projected in our enhanced 2023 outlook.\n\nBrendan M. Foley\n\nPresident & COO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I would like to provide some additional comments. First, I would like to say I am truly honored and excited about the opportunity to lead this great company with this rich and very promising future.\nGlobal demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices continues to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal location. We are the global leader in flavor from end to end for our consumers and our customers.\nAs we look ahead to the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. We have compelling growth plans in place, including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident with successful execution of our plans and concrete actions, we will realize the profitable growth reflected in our updated 2023 financial outlook.\nThe strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and execution of our proven strategies further bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory in both segments, particularly as the environment begins to normalize. Remaining relentless with our focus on growth, performance and people, combined with the compounding impact of our continued growth investments and alignment with consumer trends, underscores McCormick's positions to deliver long-term differentiated growth. Our fundamentals remain strong, and we expect to continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace.\nImportantly, I'd like to personally thank Lawrence for his mentorship and continued service to McCormick. On behalf of shareholders and employees, I want to recognize his outstanding leadership as CEO of this great company. Lawrence has been a transformational leader for McCormick, bringing our global flavor platform to life through his entrepreneurial spirit, innovative thinking and growth-oriented vision for the company.\nDuring his time as CEO, we have grown sales over 50% and market capitalization more than doubled creating significant shareholder value. We have prioritized investing to drive future growth, increased our profit realization, improved cash flow from operations and have returned more than $2.5 billion to shareholders. Lawrence is widely credited with embedding purpose-led performance into McCormick's culture by championing the company's industry-leading sustainability efforts, driving a period of tremendous growth, performance and expansion, including acquisitions of iconic brands like Frank's RedHot, French's, Cholula, as well as [indiscernible], and successfully leading McCormick through the unprecedented global pandemic.\nThis is an enviable track record. Congratulations, and we look forward to your continued support as Executive Chairman.\nNow for your questions."

Jenkins\n\nVP of IR, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's first quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we have posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com. With me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman and CEO; Brendan Foley, President and COO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of these non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nToday's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We are pleased with the start of the year. We delivered solid first quarter results that reflect strong demand and early results from our actions to increase our profit realization in 2023. Our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies.\nOur Global Operating Effectiveness, or GOE program, is yielding results, with first quarter cost savings in line with our expectations. The progress we are making on gross margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in our plan and our 2023 full year outlook.\nTurning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we drove 3% sales growth or 5% in constant currency. Our constant currency sales growth reflected strong underlying business performance, with an 11% contribution from pricing, partially offset by a 3% decline in underlying volume and product mix, a planned 1% decline from our Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia and an expected 1% year-over-year volume decline from lower consumption due to COVID-related disruption in China, which we expect to see a return towards normal consumption trends in the coming quarters.\nOur underlying first quarter sales performance positions us well for continued top line growth for the balance of the year. Our growth in the first quarter was led by outstanding performance in our Flavor Solutions segment, with positive momentum continuing in all 3 regions. In our Consumer segment, our underlying sales growth was led by the Americas region.\nMoving to profit. Our adjusted operating income was comparable to the first quarter of last year. In constant currency, it increased 2%. Higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate more than offset our adjusted operating income growth in the quarter, resulting in a 6% decline in adjusted earnings per share.\nI'd like to say a few words about our gross margin performance, which Mike will cover in more detail in his discussion of our adjusted operating income growth drivers in a few moments. We drove considerable improvement in our gross margin performance in the first quarter. Our gross margin reflects the continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the last 2 years as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. As we've said previously, in 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation our pricing previously lagged as well as offset current year inflation through our pricing actions and other levers.\nOur gross margin also reflects the result of our diligence in optimizing our cost through our GOE program. This is progressing as planned and remains a key focus. We expect the impact of our GOE program to scale up as the year progresses, and we remain on track to realize $75 million of cost savings in 2023, which we will take to the bottom line because of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs and to streamline our organization.\nWe remain confident that we have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions. It's still early, but our first quarter results speak for themselves, and we expect to continue driving profitable growth at an accelerated rate for the balance of the year. Demand is strong. We're driving improvement in our margin profile and optimizing our cost structure effectively.\nNow let's move to first quarter business updates for each of our segments as well as discussion of our growth plans. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 6. Our underlying performance was strong, reflecting the effective execution of our pricing actions and continuing positive momentum in our consumption trend, even with lapping the elevated at-home consumption in the first quarter of 2022 due to Omicron in the Americas and the EMEA regions. That performance was partially offset by the impacts related to the sale of Kitchen Basics, our exit of Russia and the COVID-related disruption in China. Beginning in the second quarter, the activation of exciting growth initiatives as well as lapping the impact of last year's COVID-related shutdowns in China and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, which we began to exit in the second quarter of last year, is expected to drive an acceleration of our Consumer segment growth.\nNow for some highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S.-branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 5% in line with our shipments. As we anticipated, the dynamics between consumption and retail inventory levels have begun to normalize as we move beyond the holiday season impact, and we anticipate greater alignment between consumption and shipments going forward. Importantly, our volume performance in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter on higher price realization.\nIn spices and seasonings, both consumption dollars and units accelerated sequentially from the last several quarters, with strength in our seasoning blends, which provide consumers both convenience and flavor exploration. Early results of our Lawry's everyday spice range, our largest innovation launch since prepandemic, continued to be positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category. Over half of the purchases are from new buyers to McCormick and overall incremental to the category.\nHot sauce remains on fire, with double-digit growth of both Cholula and Frank's RedHot in the U.S. and Canada. We continued to build excitement with our hot sauce brand marketing initiatives and reached the younger generation, most recently through gaming. And our big game campaign during the quarter, our flavor-packed version of Fortnite, The Floor is Flava, had players navigating an immersive chicken wing-shaped island and a volcano that spews Frank's RedHot and included, in partnership with TGI Fridays and DoorDash, a free chicken wings offer. This was our best big game campaign, capturing over 1 billion impressions in North America.\nAnd with the resolution of the long-running shortage of French's mustard bottles, we drove over 20% consumption growth for the second consecutive quarter. Our creamy mustard launch last year continues to perform very well, with another flavor launch coming this year.\nFinally, in the Americas, we continued to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings, but we're realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. For instance, McCormick Popcorn Seasonings and Frank's variety packs are both off to a great start following their online introductions earlier this year.\nIn EMEA, we continued to have solid share performance of herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France. We're continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K. and are building momentum with Cholula. We're driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. We're taking meaningful progress across the region and expanding our distribution and gaining share in the fastest -- in the fast-growing discount channel. Our investments in brand marketing, merchandising and new products are proving to be effective in driving growth.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India, which we will have lapped after this quarter, as well as the COVID-related disruptions in China. As we have moved past the Chinese New Year, we are seeing a return to normalization. We continue to expect a benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping the impact of last year's disruptions.\nOutside of the China and India impact, growth in the region was driven by new products and brand marketing initiatives. Frank's RedHot and Cholula performance was strong in Australia, and extending the power of our brands, we have launched OLD BAY into the Australian market and Cholula into Southeast Asia.\nAs always, we continue to fuel our Consumer segment growth with the power of our brands as well as our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. We're excited about the growth plans we're executing and expect they will drive an acceleration of growth for the balance of the year.\nFirst, as we mentioned at CAGNY, we are completely renovating our U.S. core everyday spice and herb portfolio with consumer-preferred packaging as well as through leveraging new FlavorSealed technology. The atmosphere in the bottle is nitrogen-flushed to remove oxygen, which means visibly fresher flavor, brighter color and stronger aroma. The modern new SnapTight trademark lid seals in the aroma and freshness. We're also printing the product names and an easy-to-read best-by date on the top.\nThe new high-quality bottle and label design highlights the transparency and quality of our spices and herbs, and the bottle is made with 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, approximately a 20% carbon footprint reduction from the current package. We are really excited about these changes and so are consumers. Testing has confirmed 40% higher freshness per session, 2x higher preference and a 25% increase in loyalty among current buyers.\nThe products began rolling out last month. The transition on store shelves will happen over the course of the year, supported with our highest-spend brand marketing campaign of the past 5 years. Importantly, the new packaging fits right into the existing shelf spot. This is a seamless transition for our retail partners that we expect to drive category performance. This initiative, coupled with other new product introductions I'll mention in a minute, along with our stabilized service levels, will build total distribution points and market share improvement as we go through the year as we outlined last month at CAGNY.\nWe're also expanding into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with authentic Mexican flavor of Cholula in new formats. We are launching Cholula taco recipe mixes as well as sauces based on authentic Mexican formulas and crafted in Mexico using locally sourced fresh tomatoes and tomatillos.\nRetail acceptance has been strong, and consumers will find these new products and the authenticity they are looking for on U.S. shelves soon. Product began shipping yesterday, ahead of Cinco de Mayo, and the rollout will continue over the course of the second quarter.\nWe're launching new products in the first half of 2023 to inspire consumers' flavor exploration as well as the deliver the convenience consumers are looking for. In the Americas, we are kicking off the grilling season with new flavors, including a Grillers Choice marinade you can use as 3 different flavors. And we're really excited about our new Stubb's master series. Made with technology from our FONA acquisition, these dry seasoning rubs capture real authentic hardwood smoke flavor.\nLeveraging the product successes of 2022, we are extending our Tabitha Brown line into new flavors, formats and channels, and we're also launching a French's creamy roasted garlic mustard. In direct-to-consumer, we continue to grow our platform, with new innovative flavors as a testing ground. And in the club channel, we're launching a world flavors line.\nIn EMEA, we're enabling consumers to discover the authentic taste of America by introducing OLD BAY to the U.K. market as well as introducing a new line of products leveraging the French's brand, including America's -- American favorites recipe kit. In the U.K., we also just launched Schwartz brand gravy, which are beating the top competitor on taste.\nIn APZ, we've recently launched meal bases, a favorite Keene's recipe, and we'll be launching a Gourmet Garden zesty lemon paste, both making consumers' flavor exploration easier. In China, we've introduced new packaging for our chicken bouillon product, a pouch with a resealable port cap that makes it convenient for consumers and extends the opened product shelf life by blocking out moisture.\nWe're continuing to build our heat platform across all regions with the launch of new products, including, in the U.S., grill Mates Nashville Hot chicken seasoning; Frank's RedHot Dill Pickle Hot Sauce; and a Cholula Reserva crafted with 100% agave tequila; and our flavor forecast of the year, Vietnamese cajun-style seasoning. In China, we're introducing iconic Chinese city spicy blends and then the U.K., Frank's RedHot spicy recipe mixes.\nAcross all regions, we're increasing our brand marketing investments in 2023 and expect the most significant year-over-year increase in the second quarter. We will continue to support our brands with messaging on everyday use, value and the superiority of our ingredients and flavors, and more specifically, with mustard supply issues resolved, we've launched a Flavor On! campaign for mustard or elevating our Mother of Sauce Cholula campaign to support the launch of the new format and capitalize on Cinco de Mayo. And of course, with grilling season starting during the quarter, we plan to reach grillers with our Just Flame & Flavor campaign.\nA robust growth plan give us confidence in continuing to drive positive momentum. We believe they will all be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, differentiating us even more and strengthening our flavor leadership in core categories.\nTurning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9. Our sales performance in this segment continues to be outstanding. This was our eighth consecutive quarter with double-digit sales growth. Our first quarter growth was led by pricing actions in all 3 regions, which, as we expected, accelerated versus previous quarters.\nNow for regional highlights. Our Americas' first quarter strong sales growth was led by our flavors product category. Within flavors, snack seasoning growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products and strengthen our customers' iconic products, partially fueled by their marketing as well as our improved ability to service our customers as we began to realize the benefit of the capacity we're bringing online.\nFlavors for performance nutrition and health end-market applications also contributed to our strong performance as we continue driving double-digit sales growth. We are winning with new customers and new products. Volume was tempered in the quarter by the pruning of some low-margin business, the impact of a very cold December on the away-from-home part of our portfolio and lower volume of alcoholic beverage flavors due to what must have been a drier January than last year.\nIn EMEA, we continued to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, which was led by higher sales to our quick-service restaurant customers in the first quarter. Overall, our price realization nearly doubled versus last quarter.\nAnd in APZ, we delivered solid volume growth in the markets outside of China, driven by demand from quick-service restaurants, or QSRs, for our products to heat up their hot and spicy offerings.\nOverall, Flavor Solutions demand has remained strong, particularly in certain parts of our business in our Americas and EMEA regions. As we continue to bring additional capacity online and reduce both supply chain pressure and the extraordinary cost to service our customers, we appreciate their patience and collaboration.\nWe're continuing our positive sales growth momentum in Flavor Solutions, and we're committed to restoring profitability in this segment, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We're confident we will achieve margin recovery.\nIn our January earnings call, we said our price increases had just begun to catch up with the pace of inflation, and we were beginning to recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged in the last 2 years. This is continuing at an even greater rate in the first quarter. And earlier, I discussed optimizing our cost through our GOE program, which will contribute to the Flavor Solutions margin recovery. GOE will have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, we continue to focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio such as the flavor product category volume growth I mentioned a few minutes ago in the Americas region.\nNow I'm excited to share the growth plans we're executing on and expect will continue to drive our growth momentum. We continue to fuel our Flavor Solutions segment growth using our differentiation, including our culinary foundation, our unique and powerful consumer insights advantage, our proprietary technologies and our passion for providing our customers with a differentiated collaborative experience. While we cannot get too specific about product development, following a strong year of innovation in 2022, we carried a robust new product pipeline into 2023.\nAs we mentioned at CAGNY, we are specifically targeting opportunities to grow in high-growth end markets, applications such as savory snacks, alcoholic beverages and performance nutrition, and have outpaced market growth, and as I just shared, our robust growth momentum continued in the first quarter. As we expect it will the balance of the year, the capabilities we built for these categories are creating significant top line opportunities.\nThe power of McCormick and FONA together continues to fuel greater opportunities for growth. This acquisition is exceeding our expectations. We're capitalizing on opportunities to increase our sales to existing customers by cross-selling across our more comprehensive product offering and target new customers. We're leveraging our global footprint and capabilities to drive future growth. We are currently in the process of expanding performance nutrition into Canada as well as localizing confectionery flavors at Giotti for our FONA customer.\nFinally, in branded foodservice, we have a robust 2023 innovation agenda, launching more than double the new items than in 2022, including Frank's RedHot, Nashville Hot, a line of Cholula Street Tacos, McCormick Culinary global blend and a French's Dijon portion-controlled package. Our plans include us continuing to leverage our culinary partnerships, inspire menu ideas with our customers, win placement on away-from-home menus including with quick-service restaurants and drive growth with promotional activities. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions also give us confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and drive our Flavor Solutions leadership.\nNow for summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 11. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we've intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices.\nMcCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion. Through our products and our customers' products and our driving growth, we are end-to-end flavor. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies give us confidence in our growth momentum and ability to continue navigating the dynamic global environment.\nAs we look ahead to the balance of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth. We have robust growth plans in place including building momentum with our new products and heat platform and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident with the successful execution of our planned and concrete actions we will drive profitable growth in 2023.\nI want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. I want to also thank all of our customers, suppliers and investors for their collaboration and patience as we move beyond the unique environment we've been operating in since the onset of the pandemic. The fundamentals that drove our historical financial performance remain intact, and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace.\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 14. Our top line constant currency sales grew 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 2% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the Consumer business in Russia and lower consumption due to the COVID-related disruption in China.\nIn our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased to 1%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline related to the Kitchen Basics Russia and China impacts I just mentioned as well as a 5% decline in all other volume and product mix.\nOn Slide 15, Consumer sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency, including a 2% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. Growth was broad-based across all product categories, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline.\nIn EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales declined 2%. Pricing actions were more than fully offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from the lower sales in Russia. Lapping elevated demand due to Omicron in the first quarter of last year contributed to the volume decline.\nConstant currency Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 8%, driven by a decline in volume, partially offset by pricing actions. The combination of lower volume in China due to COVID-related disruptions and the exit of lower-margin business in India drove an 11% reduction in volume.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 18. We grew first quarter constant currency sales of 12%, reflecting a 13% increase from pricing actions and a 1% decline in volume and mix.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 12%. Pricing actions contributed to higher sales across the customer base, which skews to packaged food and beverage companies as well as branded foodservice customers. Volume and product mix declined in the quarter as strong volume growth in snack seasonings and flavors for performance nutrition and health applications was more than fully offset by the impact of pruning of low-margin businesses and lower volume of away-from-home products as our customers' business was impacted by cold weather.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales increased 17%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions outstanding growth was broad-based across its portfolio, led by higher sales to QSR customers. First quarter volume declined, driven primarily by softness in some of our packaged food and beverage customers' volume within their own businesses.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 5% in constant currency, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined as the impact of scale-backed QSR activities in China due to COVID-related disruptions more than offset QSR volume growth outside of China.\nAs seen on Slide 22, gross profit margin declined 80 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. This is an improvement from our performance last year. While more work needs to be done, we are pleased with our progress and are confident in the actions underway to continue driving further improvement over the balance of the year.\nGross margin in the quarter was impacted by several drivers. First, we're still incurring elevated costs in Flavor Solutions to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful in the short term, we know making these investments to support our customers is the right approach to driving long-term growth. That said, we continue to progress on reducing the level of these costs in the first quarter.\nAlso in Flavor Solutions, we incurred dual running costs related to the transition to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. We expect the balance of the year costs to be comparable to 2022, and a sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments as compared to last year unfavorably impacted gross margin.\nPartially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings as well as the cost savings from our GOE program that Lawrence discussed and which were in line with our expectations.\nFinally, and of note, we offset current year inflation in the first quarter, which we expect will be the highest of the year through our pricing actions. And as Lawrence said, we continued to recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the last 2 years as we planned. While the net of these impacts drives gross profit dollar growth, there is level of dilution that tempers the actual gross margin percentage.\nNow moving to Slide 23. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, were comparable to the first quarter of last year. Higher distribution costs were offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings as well as lower-planned brand marketing and employee benefits expenses in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect both brand marketing and employee benefits expenses to be higher than last year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined 40 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth.\nHigher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, Consumer segment adjusted operating income increased 6%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 11%.\nTurning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 24. Our interest expense increased significantly over the first quarter of 2022, driven by the higher rate environment. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 21.8% compared to 19.7% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.59 as compared to $0.63 for the year ago period. The decrease was due to higher interest expense and a higher first quarter adjusted effective tax rate.\nOn Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $103 million compared to $18 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation payments. We returned $105 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $62 million for capital expenditures this quarter.\nWe expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow, driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization.\nNow turning to our financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and, with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers.\nWe expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be a minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we project an unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and a favorable impact in the second half of the year.\nAt the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the lap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which are consistent with '22 at lower levels than we have historically experienced but in line with the current environment; a 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility; the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter; and finally, the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans.\nOur 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. This adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged the last 2 years.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our GOE program are expected to have an 800-basis-point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300-basis-point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100-basis-point impact. And finally, an even 100-basis-point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation.\nThe net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum, results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a further low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million.\nWe are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense, driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023, spread evenly throughout the year.\nAs a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be approximately an 800-basis-point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth.\nOur 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook is to be a 100-basis-point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth.\nTo summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10% and a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit: the GOE program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the employee benefit cost rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61.\nWe are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with the continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion. While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 29.\nOur first quarter sales growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our underlying business performance was driven by our pricing actions and strong ongoing demand. Our first quarter progress on margin improvement reflects the level of urgency, with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. We are committed to increasing our profit realization, and our actions are yielding results on optimizing our cost structure and recovering the cost inflation our pricing lag last year. We expect our progress to scale up as the year progresses.\nWe have robust growth plans in place, including building momentum with product innovation and renovation, and are driving improvement in our margin profile. We expect to drive profitable sales growth at an accelerated rate in the balance of the year and have bolstered confidence in delivering our outlook for 2023 and building shareholder value. The compounding benefit of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This, coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins, will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth.\nNow for your questions."

Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter concluded a challenging and volatile year that impacted our ability to deliver on our expectations and our financial performance. At the same time, we ended the year with positive momentum with consumer consumption trends and Flavor Solutions demand, stabilized service levels and supply and meaningful progress in starting to reshape our cost structure. While more work remains to be done, our confidence in our outlook for 2023 and beyond is strong. Our organization is focused squarely on executing on the priorities I just mentioned, all of which are important drivers in the successful execution of our strategies and the delivery of stronger results.\nTurning to Slide 5. At our fourth quarter results, our sales declined 2% from the year ago period, including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2% within our implied fourth quarter guidance range, but below our expectations. Greater-than-expected COVID-related disruptions in China unfavorably impacted our expected sales growth for both total McCormick and the Consumer segment by approximately 2%. The fourth quarter sales would have grown in the range of 4% in constant currency, excluding the impact of China on our results.\nWe had anticipated even higher growth with fourth quarter restocking comparisons in the Americas Consumer segment further tempered our growth. As compared to last year, our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 2% reflected a 9% contribution from pricing actions partially offset by a 4% decline in underlying volume and product mix, an expected 2% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of low-margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia and a 1% year-over-year volume decline from the China COVID-related disruption. Despite tempered fourth quarter sales performance, our underlying sales strength positions us well to accelerate sales growth in 2023.\nIn our Consumer segment, excluding China, consumption trends strengthened, particularly in the U.S., where our fourth quarter total branded consumption grew 6%. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our sales growth was outstanding, continued momentum across all regions. Consumers' increasing demand for flavor, whether through our products or our customers' product, is those reflected in this performance and in our most recent proprietary consumer insights research.\nOur alignment with the long-term consumer trends of cooking at home, clean and flavorful eating, and valuing trusted brands continues to deliver results. This alignment, combined with our broad and advantaged portfolio, plus the fundamental strength of our category continues to underscore McCormick's positioning for long-term, differentiated growth in flavor.\nMoving to profit. Our adjusted operating income decline of 10% or 9% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share decline of 13% fell short of our expectations. Let me spend a moment on the differences to our expectations. Unfavorable product mix was a driving factor, particularly in our Consumer segment. This was primarily due to lower U.S. spice and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparison in both 2021 and 2022, which I'll discuss in a moment.\nOur results also reflected lower-than-anticipated sales in China and an unfavorable product mix related to the sales mix between segments. In addition, with 2 COVID-related plant shutdowns in China, we realized lower operating leverage. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress to lower our run rate costs in Flavor Solutions with the reduction of elevated costs that we've been incurring to meet high demand in parts of our business. The impact of that progress was offset in the fourth quarter by unexpected discrete one-time issues. However, we expect to see positive benefits in our results going forward.\nTurning to Slide 7. We are committed to increasing our profit realization in 2023. In our last earnings call, we discussed normalizing our supply chain costs and increasing efficiencies, while also strengthening our ability to service customers. To that end, we have targeted the elimination of $100 million of supply chain costs over the next 2 years. We are also now taking streamlining actions across our entire organization targeting an incremental $25 million of cost savings.\nThe combination of these actions, which is our Global Operating Effectiveness Program is incremental to our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement or CCI savings. Our CCI program has a well-established track record of success, and we are leveraging its proven program discipline to drive results. We expect our Global Operating Effectiveness Program to drive annual cost savings of approximately $125 million, of which we expect to realize $75 million through the P&L in 2023, enabling increased profit realization. We can see the results coming through, and we expect the impact to scale up as the year progresses.\nNow let me share more details on our actions. During last year, we transitioned to our Global Operating model allowing us to more effectively leverage our scale and drive cost reductions. As we further advance that model and streamline our processes, strengthen our collaboration and align our structure to work more efficiently, we are taking corresponding actions to streamline our workforce across the entire organization.\nWe are making considerable progress on the streamlining actions we have underway. A large component of our streamlining actions is a U.S. voluntary retirement program, which is very far along with a targeted separation date of February 1. This will be followed by other actions, some of which will be involuntary. As always, we will care for employees in keeping with our shared value.\nMoving to the supply chain. Our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. And while we expect continued volatility in global supply chain, we have strengthened our resiliency over the past few years to achieve this priority. As we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we incurred additional costs above inflation, service our customers and have seen inefficiencies to develop in our supply chain. Some of these costs for investments and decisions made to support continued growth for both our customers and McCormick, and some are the result of a buildup that can occur in periods of disruption.\nIn 2022, with the service levels of focus, the normalization of our supply chain costs and inventory levels has taken longer than expected. As we stated on our third quarter call, during the fourth quarter, we began to implement initiatives to optimize our cost structure, increase our capacity and reduce inventory levels, while strengthening our supply chain resiliency and ability to service our customers.\nNow for some details on these initiatives. First and foremost, while we continue to resolve some outliers, we have rebuilt and stabilized our service back to strong levels and at a high level of finished goods inventory on hand. Operating from this position enables us to maximize our performance, reduce our labor costs and pare back excessive use of co-packers within our operations.\nStarting with labor, as we expect it to be the most significant driver of our cost reductions. During the fourth quarter, we reinstated more normal shift schedule with most locations now operating on a 24 by 5 pattern. This allows us to eliminate inefficient and unpopular difficult to staff shifts. Additionally, as we move away from the industry-wide labor issues seen during the pandemic, we have stabilized absenteeism and turnover rates in our workforce and return to more standard staffing [by line].\nDuring the quarter, we optimized our leadership structure throughout our facilities and upgraded the talented key roles. Simultaneously, we're increasing the capability levels of our team. We are also accelerating automation, ranging from individual pieces of equipment to a completely automated line for a high-volume packaging format. We expect through these initiatives to reduce 10% of our Americas supply chain workforce. And over the past 3 months, we have already achieved half of the planned reduction.\nNext, turning to our capacity. We're supporting future growth and enabling better customer service by investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in constrained areas. These investments also enable the repatriation of the production we scaled up at co-packers, while continuing to meet the elevated demand.\nIn our Flavor Solutions segment, our flavors volume, including seasonings and flavor encapsulation, has been growing at a mid-single-digit rate for each of the past 3 years and demand remains strong. Our investments in additional seasoning capacity as well as spray-dried capacity with the expansion of bonus footprint are on track to be online during the second quarter.\nMeanwhile, in our Consumer segment, we've been using co-packers for targeted high-demand packaging format, such as some of our large value-sized items. Now given the efficiencies gained and the investments already in flight, we have started to repatriate some of these formats. Overall, we are on track for co-pack spending in 2023 to be the lowest in the past 5 years.\nFrom an inventory perspective, we are executing on initiatives to return to historical safety stock levels, which has been disrupted and raised by the supply chain issues of the last few years. We reduced both raw material and finished good inventory during the fourth quarter. While we're aware we have further progress to make, we're confident and encouraged by the results our initiatives are delivering so far.\nAs we progress to a more normalized environment, we will realize additional benefits from these changes. For example, we expect to see reductions in expedited freight and less-than-truckload shipping costs and will streamline other transportation inefficiencies. With the recent opening of our new Maryland logistics center, we're able to eliminate expensive external warehouse costs before even fully realizing the inventory reduction, accelerating the expense savings. With more efficient manufacturing and lower inventory levels, we expect low material losses.\nWe have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years. I'm confident in our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain while prioritizing meeting our customers' needs. The impact of our actions is expected to normalize our supply chain cost, enhance our efficiency and ability to meet demand, reduce inventory levels and ultimately increase our profit realization as reflected in our 2023 outlook. Our Global Operating Effectiveness Program has considerable momentum, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you after our first quarter of 2023.\nNow moving to fourth quarter business updates for each of our segments. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 8. Sales performance in the quarter was impacted by factors mentioned previously, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, exits of businesses and COVID-related disruptions in China as well as trade inventory dynamics between years. These factors as well as lapping high COVID-related demand early in the year also impacted the full year performance. Importantly, on a 3-year basis, we've grown annual sales at a 5% CAGR, driven by the Americas region, but we are ending the year with positive momentum in our consumption trend.\nNow for some regional highlights on sales and consumption. Starting with the Americas. During the fourth quarter of 2021, because we were restocking, shipments were higher than consumption, and we are lapping that this quarter, which impacts our sales growth. As we enter the holiday season this year and having shipped fairly in line with consumption for the first 3 quarters of the year, customers did not need to replenish their inventory as much despite strong consumer consumption during the holiday season.\nWe estimate our fourth quarter sales growth rate was unfavorably impacted 6% related to these restocking comparisons. We did not fully appreciate the level of fourth quarter restocking in 2021, especially of high-margin holiday herbs and spices, and the resulting impact on our year-over-year growth and, as such, had expected stronger sales growth this year.\nThat said, excluding this impact, our underlying volume performance in the fourth quarter was better than in the second and third quarters. We have confidence that as we move out of the first quarter, the holiday season fluctuations this year between consumption and inventory levels as well as retailer restocking resulting from pandemic-driven dynamics will have normalized, and we have an increased level of confidence in our visibility.\nOur total U.S. branded portfolio consumption growth was 6% this quarter, as indicated by our IRI consumption data combined with unmeasured channel was the strongest of the year. Our investments in brand marketing and stronger holiday merchandising proved to be effective. And with the stabilization of supply disruptions, restoration of our service levels continued, and our fourth quarter service level was the best of the year, just shy of our prepandemic standards.\nOur consumption dollar sales, unit and volume all accelerated sequentially and our total distribution points or TDPs have stabilized. In spices and seasoning, our fourth quarter performance was the strongest of the year. Consumers are responding to our value messaging, trading up to larger sizes and according to our consumer insights are learning to navigate the current environment. We're continuing to build distribution on the [Lawry's] everyday spice range we launched last quarter and early results are positive.\nWe are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category as consumers are trading up to this line for private label. In recipe mixes, we gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter, and with improved packaging supply, we also gained share in hot sauce and mustard during the quarter. Across the portfolio, our trends are continuing to strengthen in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn EMEA, we ended the year with our strongest sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our effective pricing and new product growth accelerated versus the first 3 quarters with our fourth quarter price realization at the highest of the year, and our volume declined the lowest. Our strong consumption momentum continued and accelerated sequentially.\nIn the fourth quarter and for the full year, we gained share versus last year and 2019 in the U.K. and Eastern Europe herbs, spices and seasoning. Those gains were somewhat offset by softer performance in France. In the U.K., we're driving the hot sauce category with Frank's RedHot continuing to gain share again in the quarter and for the full year versus last year as well as compared to 2019. Additionally, in the U.K., we advanced our recipe mix leadership during 2022 to the #1 share position as we entered 2023, we're confident in our continued momentum in the EMEA region.\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India, which we will lap after the first quarter of 2023 as well as the COVID-related disruption in China. Reflected in our outlook, we are expecting continued disruption into the first quarter of 2023, with an expected recovery after the Chinese New Year. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China.\nOur brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives are driving positive momentum with more to come through 2023, and we look forward to sharing this and our growth plans at CAGNY in a few weeks.\nTurning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9. Sales growth reflected pricing actions as well as higher base volume growth in new products. Our sales performance has been outstanding all year, led by double-digit growth every quarter in the Americas and EMEA regions, resulting in 12% growth for the full year. On a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at an 8% CAGR with strong growth in all 3 regions.\nNow for some regional highlights. Our Americas fourth quarter sales growth was the strongest of the year. Growth in flavors, including snack seasonings and flavors for performance nutrition and health end market applications as well as branded foodservice products drove our fourth quarter performance as well as our strong broad-based growth for the year. We continue to realize the benefits from the combined capabilities of FONA and McCormick with new products contributing approximately 30% more growth in Flavors in 2022 than last year.\nDemand continues to strengthen with branded foodservice restaurant and institutional foodservice customers, and we're also expanding distribution and gaining share in both spices and seasonings and hot sauce. In EMEA, our strong fourth quarter performance in all product categories kept an outstanding year of 17% growth, including significant volume growth of 9% as well as pricing. We are winning in all markets and channels.\nGrowth remains strong across our customer base, led by the momentum of our quick service restaurant or QSR customers, partially driven by expanded distribution and their promotional activity. In APZ, we're driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, realizing growth from strong performance of core menu items we flavor. We delivered solid growth in the APZ region for the year despite the COVID-related disruptions in China. Across markets outside of China, we drove double-digit growth with contributions from both volume and pricing.\nOverall, Flavor Solutions demand has remained strong, and for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand, driving extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us and are encouraged by the results our collaboration is already beginning to yield.\nWhile our Flavor Solutions sales growth has been outstanding, we are not delivering profit growth in this segment. We are committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, recovering margin, while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We are confident we will achieve margin recovery through 3 actions. Effective price realization. Our price increases are only now catching up to the pace of inflation, and we're beginning to recover the cost inflation [or pricing like] last year. With the successful execution of the Global Operating Effectiveness Program I just mentioned, in particular, we expect the elimination of supply chain inefficiencies and the investments in capacity to have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment.\nAnd finally, continued focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our customer engagement approach and culinary-inspired innovation, are driving our outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum. We look to sharing more about our growth plan and margin recovery at CAGNY in a few weeks.\nNow some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 10. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices.\nThese long-term trends and the rise in global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, but the younger generation stealing them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor.\nWe remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders, while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the dynamic global environment.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we will focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical financial performance remains strong, and we're confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2022 and the momentum they are driving in 2023.\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India and the customer business in Russia and the 1% impact from China consumption disruption related to COVID restrictions.\nIn our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 4%, with the divestiture of Kitchen Basics contributing 1% to the decline and the combined impact of exiting the businesses in India and Russia as well as the China consumption disruption, contributing 3% to the decline.\nOn Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency, pricing actions in the region were more than offset by a volume decline, including a 2% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as a 6% impact from lapping the restocking and retail inventory in the fourth quarter of last year and a higher level of retail inventories entering this year's holiday season. Additionally, returning to pre-pandemic promotional levels also tempered our sales comparison to the fourth quarter of last year.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 2%. Pricing actions across all markets were partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 22%, including a 23% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low-margin business in India. Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 14% primarily due to pricing actions with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth in all regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13%, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Higher sales of packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings led the growth. Higher demand for branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth.\nIn EMEA, we drove 16% constant currency sales growth with 10% related to pricing actions and 6% behind the mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth was broad-based across this portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and packaged food and beverage company customers. In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers, driven by strength in their core menu items.\nAs seen on Slide 21, adjusted gross margin declined 410 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. I'll spend a moment on the significant drivers, highlighting the ones that drove more compression than we had expected. First, approximately 60% of this decline or 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. Next, product mix was unfavorable as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as well as compared to our expectations for the quarter.\nFirst, in our Consumer segment. As mentioned earlier, lower U.S. spices and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons in both 2021 and 2022 as well as lower sales of higher-margin products in China due to the COVID restrictions negatively impacted mix. The sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The impact of the unfavorable product mix was higher than we expected due to the shortfall in consumer sales from what we had anticipated driven by both lower U.S. and China sales.\nNow for the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margins. In our Consumer segment, we experienced lower operating leverage because of the sales comparisons already discussed. The impact, though, was greater than expected due to the China COVID-related plant shutdowns. In our Flavor Solutions segment, as we transition production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility, we continue to incur dual running costs. We expect the unfavorable year-over-year impact of these costs to continue in the first quarter of 2023. And then for the balance of the year, expect them to be comparable to 2022.\nAdditionally, we are still incurring elevated costs to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful short term, we know these investments to support our customers during periods of disruption are the right approach to drive long-term growth. That said, we did make progress on reducing the level of these costs in the fourth quarter. However, the impact of that progress was offset by the unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates and some discrete issues we experienced in our Flavor Solutions operations during the quarter. While we recovered quickly from these issues, they still contributed significant unexpected costs to the quarter.\nFinally, partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings. And of note, our price increases continue to catch up with cost inflation during the quarter for both segments. This was in line with our expectations and consistent with our performance. In 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation or pricing has lagged over the last 2 years.\nNow moving to Slide 22. Selling, general and administration expenses, or SG&A declined from the fourth quarter of last year with lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A declined 270 basis points. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 9% and compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. In constant currency, the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income declined 5%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 26%.\nTurning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 23. Our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter 2021 as well as over our third quarter of this year, both driven by the higher rate environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 24, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 as compared to $0.84 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with higher interest expense and a higher fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate also contributing to the decrease.\nOn Slide 25, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $652 million, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $397 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $262 million for capital expenditures in 2022. Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe.\nIn 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to 2022 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.\nWe remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With improving our gross margin, through our plan to normalize our supply chain costs and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt and expect to delever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2024.\nNow turning to our 2023 financial outlook on Slide 26. Our 2023 outlook reflects our positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by significantly higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be minimal impact from currency rates.\nAt the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrath of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which we expect to be consistent with 2022 at low levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment, a 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China, although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility, the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter, and finally, the continued pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio.\nAs always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. This adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and Global Operating Effectiveness Programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lag last year.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our Global Operating Effectiveness Program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact. The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation.\nThe net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million.\nBased on the anticipated timing of certain items, we expect our adjusted operating profit growth to be pressured in the first quarter, accelerated in the second quarter and returned to normalized cadence of delivery for the remainder of the year. The impact of cost inflation will be weighted toward the first half of 2023, with peak inflation in the first quarter. Also in the first quarter, we expect continued pressure to sales and profit from COVID-related disruptions in China and then the benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping last year's impact. Additionally, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia will impact the first quarter. As a reminder, we began exiting it during the second quarter of last year.\nFinally, related to profit timing, while we expect a minimal impact from currency rates, we project an unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and expected 3% unfavorable in the first quarter and a favorable impact in the second half of the year. We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023.\nThe net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22%, based on our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2023 earnings growth. We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half.\nTo summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10%, a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the global operating effectiveness program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the incentive compensation rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61.\nWe are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion. While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. Our fourth quarter sales performance, despite challenges from the COVID-related disruptions in China, reflects the underlying strength of our global portfolio and the continued execution of our long-term strategies. With the stabilization of service and our supply chain, in addition to positive momentum and consumption trends, we expect an acceleration in Consumer segment sales dollars and volume in 2023 and continued strong Flavor Solutions performance as the strength of our portfolio is met with outstanding demand across our customer base. We have strong growth programs, and we look forward to sharing them at CAGNY.\nWe are committed to increasing our profit realization. The actions we have underway to normalize our supply chain costs and increase our organizational effectiveness and efficiency are already yielding results. Our global operating effectiveness program is expected to deliver $125 million of cost savings. We expect the benefits of the program to scale up through each quarter of 2023 and continue to be accretive into 2024.\nWhile actively responding to the macroeconomic challenges we are facing, we continue to operate with the same discipline and commitment to execution as we have in any other operating environment. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place, and we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in both 2023 and beyond. The compelling benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This, coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins, will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth.\nBefore turning to your questions, I want to reiterate my confidence in driving the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 outlook. And now for your questions."

Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Third quarter sales increased 3% from the year-ago period as anticipated. In constant currency, sales grew 6%, reflecting 10% growth from pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and 1% decline attributable to the exits of low-margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia and a 2% decline in all other volume and product mix.\nOur underlying third quarter growth reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio as well as the effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Using 2019 as a prepandemic baseline, third quarter sales grew at a constant currency 3-year compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, up 7%, reflecting the sustained momentum in our business across both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments.\nMoving to profit. Adjusted operating income was down 12% or 11% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share was down 14%. During the third quarter, supply chain challenges continued and recovery of certain constrained materials is taking longer than expected. We continue to incur elevated costs to meet high demand in our Flavor Solutions segment. While in our Consumer segment, where demand moderated from elevated consumption trends more quickly than expected, we are experiencing lower than optimal operating leverage.\nAcross the supply chain, we remain focused on managing inventory levels and eliminating inefficiencies, though the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin and profit realization in the current period. Over the coming months, we will be aggressively eliminating supply chain inefficiencies.\nImportantly, as we had expected in the third quarter, our price increases are catching up with the pace of cost inflation in both segments. We began to recover the cost inflation that had been outpacing our pricing actions and other levers most significantly in the Consumer segment. We expect this will continue into the next year as we plan to fully offset inflation over time.\nBefore discussing our third quarter segment performance in more detail, I'd like to comment on our supply chain plan, starting on Slide 5. We have a focused plan in flight that leverages the discipline of our established Comprehensive Continuous Improvement, or CCI, program to ensure that we are able to flexibly support customer demand, both where it has been sustained at higher levels and where it has moderated, while eliminating inefficiencies and normalizing both our cost structure and inventory levels. Our actions are well underway.\nOur top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. There are areas of our business that have sustained high levels of demand for an extended period and our supply chain has been pressured to meet this demand. We have several initiatives in progress that will increase our capacity; strengthen our supply chain resiliency; and importantly, enable us to service our customers so they can grow their business.\nFor example, were investing in additional Flavor Solutions seasoning capacity which will be online in early 2023. We're expanding FONA's footprint to support our flavor growth. We recently opened our new U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility to support our strong growth momentum with quick service restaurants. And just earlier this week, the first pallet was shipped from our new Maryland logistics center.\nAnd from a cost perspective, as we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we have incurred additional costs above inflation to service our customers and have seen inefficiencies develop in our supply chain. These are costs we have absorbed. We have not passed into customers on our pricing actions. We are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs with a significant benefit in 2023. We're moving aggressively to take these costs and inefficiencies out as well as normalized inventory levels that have built up.\nSome of our actions include: Investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in bottleneck areas to enable better customer service and repatriation of production from excessive use of co-packers. We're returning to more normal ship schedules and reducing our spend on expensive surge capacity. We are already seeing the benefit of lower overtime and temporary labor reductions. In this more normalized environment as, well as through customer collaboration, we are already beginning to reduce expedited freight costs and less-than-truckload shipping costs as well as other transportation inefficiencies.\nWe are resolving raw material and packaging supply issues. For example, we are beyond the shortages of glass bottles and certain organic spices which impacted supply of our U.S. gourmet line. A supplier facility closure announced in September drove the discontinuation of a component of our dry recipe mix packaging, and through our quick qualification of alternative supply, we mitigated a major disruption during the fourth quarter. The long-running shortage of French's mustard bottles will be resolved in the first half of 2023 as new molds come online at a second supplier.\nAnd from an inventory perspective, we are also executing on plans to return to historical safety stock levels, which were raised to protect against supply disruption. We expect the impact of our actions to normalize our supply chain costs; increase our efficiency and ability to meet demand; lower our inventory levels; and importantly, increase our profit realization beginning in the first half of 2023.\nWe have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years, with the peak disruption experienced in the third quarter of last year. Since then, there has been steady improvement, building progress and bolstering our confidence in our plan to enhance our operational performance and optimize our cost structure.\nWhile we will always prioritize meeting our customers' needs, I'm encouraged by our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain. We've continued to define and quantify specific actions within our plants since we shared we would be driving the elimination of the supply chain inefficiencies in our preannouncement last month. We look forward to sharing more details and progress with you in January when we provide our 2023 outlook.\nNow moving to third quarter business update for each of our segments. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 6 and the status of our pricing actions. Our third quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all 3 regions, with an acceleration of effective pricing in the quarter versus the first half of the year in line with what we expected.\nWhile broad pressure on consumers' cost of living from inflation, which heightened during our third quarter, has resulted in higher price elasticity than we originally anticipated, our elasticities remain lower than historical levels. In our most recent pricing actions, which in the U.S., took effect as we began our fourth quarter we focused on areas that are less elastic and did not take pricing on some products where we had seen the highest elasticity.\nNow for some further highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 4%, in line with our shipments. And over the last 3 years since 2019, consumption has grown at a 3-year CAGR of 8%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace prepandemic levels.\nIn early August, we divested our Kitchen Basics business. We consistently grew this brand over the years. But as it was the only U.S. brand we had in the stock and broth aisle, our resources were better focused on core categories where we have leading brands.\nDemand has remained high with strong growth in the majority of our categories. Spices and seasonings has been one of our strongest categories in the past 3 years. And as a result, we are lapping all-time highs in consumption. This has created challenging comparisons in some product lines, such as baking-related items, which have returned to a pre-pandemic level, unlike most of our categories. Grilling-related items were impacted versus last year by high meat prices, although grilling is still strong versus prepandemic.\nHealth conditions continue to improve, as seen in our recipe mix share performance, with the fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our spices and seasoning share was pressured by service-related distribution losses, a shortage of certain packaging items as well as certain organic spices, which has largely been resolved and some trading down by consumers who remain under pressure from broad-based inflation. We are using our category and revenue management capabilities to strengthen our spices and seasoning presence on shelf. The strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution which we're beginning to realize now.\nIn EMEA, we continue to have solid share performance at herbs, spices and seasonings in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Italy, somewhat offset by softer performance in France. We are continuing to gain share on Frank's RedHot in the U.K., and we are beginning to build momentum with Cholula as we expand that brand into this market. For the quarter and year-to-date versus last year, as well as since 2019, we are driving the U.K. hot sauce category growth. Our Vahiné brand of homemade dessert products in France, a product line of unique to our EMEA region, has slowed as we have seen baking return to a more pre-pandemic baseline level in EMEA too, again, unlike our other categories.\nTurning to the Asia Pacific region. Last year, the region experienced supply chain challenges, such as ocean freight capacity constraints, and lapping that impact contributed to growth in the third quarter. Additionally, following an extended lockdown in the second quarter, COVID resurgence in Shanghai and some other cities throughout China eased as we began the third quarter, resulting in trade and pantry replenishment contributing to growth. Recently, several cities in Central China, which is the primary market of our Wuhan operations, have experienced new COVID-related lockdowns, and we are continually monitoring the situation. Overall, our China performance is on track with our expectations.\nAcross all regions in our Consumer segment, we are achieving the price realization we expected and we're executing on our proven growth strategies, pivoting action plans as needed based on our consumer insights and the environment.\nWe continue to invest behind our brands. We increased brand marketing investments in the third quarter and have additional investments planned for the fourth quarter. In addition to our highly effective and inspiring holiday messaging, we have pivoted our digital messaging to emphasize value and show consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars without sacrificing flavor.\nWe are focusing our innovation efforts to meet the needs of consumers concerned about their budgets. In the Americas, we have launched the new Lawry's branded opening price point range of [Everyday 10] spices. And our large-size format, Super Deal, is one of the best-performing product lines as consumers are looking for greater value. This format size is approximately a 40% better value per ounce than the smaller sizes. We've also launched large-sized resealable pouches of top-selling items in markets across all regions.\nIn terms of category management, we are collaborating with our customers to ensure the right assortment and price points on shelf to optimize category performance and increase profitability for our customers. And as always, we have a strong merchandising program planned for the holiday season. We are confident in our brand marketing investments, innovation and category management initiatives, which will continue to drive strong growth.\nTurning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 8. Our sales performance for the quarter was strong, with growth led by our pricing actions in all 3 regions with an increase in our effective pricing versus the first half of the year, as we expected.\nNow for some regional highlights. In the Americas, strong growth was driven by snack seasonings, savory flavors and branded foodservice products. Demand continues to strengthen with branded foodservice restaurants and institutional food service customers as mobility and strong summer travel continued to fuel consumption. And importantly, we also are expanding distribution.\nIn EMEA, growth remained strong across our entire customer base. Our third quarter growth was led by strong quick service restaurant, or QSR, momentum in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution and our customers' promotional activities. And we're seeing an acceleration of demand in branded foodservice as customers shift to more economical formats. Our full spectrum of solutions across price points is driving growth.\nWe are winning in both regions with our new product momentum. In Americas, growth from new products contributed approximately 25% more growth in flavors in the third quarter than the year-ago period, driven by beverage, savory snacks and Performance Nutrition flavors. We are continuing to win share in these categories.\nAnd in the EMEA, our third quarter new product launches accelerated versus earlier in the year. And for the full year, we expect new product introductions to outpace 2021. We are fueling future growth.\nIn APZ, we're driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, winning new limited time offers as well as realizing growth from strong performance of their core menu items we flavor. In many cases, we are the heat in their spicy offerings.\nOverall, Flavor Solutions has remained strong, and for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand. And as I said earlier, we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us, and we see light ahead.\nNow some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 9. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great, fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: Healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices.\nThese long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor.\nWe remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. Our solid track record of achieving our long-term objectives highlights the resiliency of our business through a variety of market conditions as well as our focus on sales growth and profit realization. The long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders, while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the global dynamic environment.\nThe compounding benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth, and balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins, realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. The teamwork of our McCormick employees drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement.\nAnd now I will turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 12. Our top line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, including a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia. %In our Consumer segment, we drove constant currency sales growth of 4%, with 10% related to pricing actions, partially offset by a 1% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as lower volume, with the exits of low-margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia contributing a combined 1% impact due to lower volume. On a 3-year basis, our third quarter constant currency sales CAGR was 6%.\nOn Slide 13, consumer sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by a decline in volume as well as a 1% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture. As Lawrence mentioned, the volume decline was impacted not only by elasticities, but also by constrained supply of certain input materials, primarily packaging items. Over the past 3 years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 6%.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 1%, which included a 3% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Growth in other markets were driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume, with the most significant volume impact attributable to lower sales of Vahiné homemade dessert products. Over the past 3 years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 3% CAGR.\nConstant currency Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 10%, including a 7% unfavorable impact from the exit of low-margin business in India. As Lawrence mentioned, growth was driven by higher volume, mainly attributable to trade and pantry replenishments in China following the extended Shanghai lockdown last quarter as well as the region lapping supply chain challenges in the year-ago period. Pricing actions in all markets across the region also contributed to growth. On a 3-year basis, APZ's third quarter constant currency sales grew at a 4% CAGR.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment and Slide 16. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 10%, primarily due to pricing actions with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth. Third quarter constant currency sales for the last 3 years grew at an 8% CAGR.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 10%, driven by pricing. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies, with particular strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. Higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth. Over the past 3 years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 8%.\nIn EMEA, we drove 11% constant currency sales growth with 7% related to price actions and 4% volume and mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to lower sales in Russia, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR, branded foodservice and packaged food and beverage company customers. Over the past 3 years, EMEA's constant currency sales growth was 9% CAGR.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers in part due to the timing of their promotional activities. APZ grew constant currency sales at a 6% CAGR over the past 3 years.\nAs seen on Slide 20, adjusted gross profit margin declined 320 basis points in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Let me spend a moment on the significant drivers. First, almost 80% of this decline, approximately 250 basis points, is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases.\nNext, I'll cover the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margin. In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have continued to incur elevated costs to meet high demand for certain parts of that business. And there has also been an unfavorable impact from the start-up and dual running costs as we transition production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. In our Consumer segment, where demand has moderated more quickly than we expected, we are experiencing lower operating leverage.\nOverall, while the normalization of our supply chain cost is taking longer than expected, pressuring gross margin, we are taking actions to normalize our costs, as Lawrence mentioned, which we are confident will be reflected in our 2023 gross margin. Partially offsetting these impacts I just mentioned were our CCI-led cost savings, where we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year.\nAnd finally of note, in line with our expectations, the impact of our pricing actions in the third quarter began outpacing cost inflation in both segments, more significantly in the Consumer segment. We expect pricing to continue outpacing inflation into next year as we plan to fully offset inflation over time.\nOverall, our cost recovery and gross margin improvement will vary by region and segment with a slower Flavor Solutions recovery. Importantly though, we have now passed the inflection point with significant gross margin improvement since last quarter, driven by our Consumer segment performance, and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter.\nNow moving to Slide 21. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, were comparable to the third quarter of last year with higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments offset by lower employee benefit expenses. As a percent of net sales, SG&A declined 60 basis points.\nThe net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs, of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2021. In the Consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 1% in constant currency. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 34%.\nTurning to income taxes on Slide 22. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.2% compared to 14.1% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 23, third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.80 for the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income. A favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio in the third quarter was fully offset by the impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year.\nOn Slide 24, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and our quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $250 million through the third quarter of 2022, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $298 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $167 million for capital expenditures through the third quarter.\nOur priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. While our fourth quarter has historically generated our highest cash flow from operations, based on our current profit outlook and working capital position, we do not expect to delever to our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal '22.\nWe remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With our improving gross margin, as well as our plan to normalize our supply chain cost and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt.\nNow turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 25. We are projecting strong top line growth with profit impacted by cost inflation and supply chain challenges. We also expect there will be a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales and a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.\nOn the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 3% to 5%. We expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing. While we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by price elasticities, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels given our focused approach led by consumer insights.\nOur volume and product mix will also be impacted by the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business, the demand disruptions experienced in China and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia as well as continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. We plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans.\nWe are projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 350 to 300 basis points lower than 2021, primarily driven by our Flavor Solutions segment. Given the rapidly escalating cost environment this year, cost inflation outpaced pricing in the first half of the year. We expect pricing to outpace inflation in the second half of the year and continue into next year.\nThis adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, higher supply chain costs, lower operating leverage and unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings. As a reminder, we have priced to offset dollar cost increases. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression.\nWe expect our adjusted operating income to decline 11% to 9% in constant currency. In addition to our gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes our CCI-led cost -- total cost savings target of approximately $85 million and a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments compared to 2021. We are projecting our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. This outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%.\nWe are projecting our 2022 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.68 as compared to $3.05 in 2021. This projection includes a $0.02 unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Kitchen Basics business.\nAs we currently progress in our fourth quarter, we are confident in delivering our 2022 outlook, continuing our strong top line growth trajectory, and as our guidance implies, delivering fourth quarter operating margin expansion, while executing on a focused plan to drive improvement in our cost structure. We are targeting to eliminate at least $100 million of these costs or approximately a 150 basis point impact to our operating margin.\nWith our proven track record of delivering CCI-led savings to fuel growth investments and expand our operating margin, we are leveraging the discipline of the CCI program to aggressively eliminate costs and inefficiencies. Overall, we are confident our focus on profit realization will drive margin improvement. And while parts of our plan to optimize our cost structure will take longer than others, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of our actions in the first half of 2023.\nWe look forward to sharing more details on progress with you in January when we provide our 2023 outlook.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on Slide 26.\nOur third quarter sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies against the backdrop of a volatile operating environment. Our sales growth momentum is strong. Though challenges in our supply chain have taken longer to normalize, we have now passed an inflection point. We have begun to recover the cost inflation that has been outpacing our pricing actions while executing on a plan to aggressively eliminate supply chain costs, and we expect 2022 fourth operating margin expansion and continued improvement into 2023.\nOur long-term performance, including through periods of volatility and has been industry-leading, and the long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remain strong. We have a proven track record of execution and are confident we will successfully navigate this dynamic environment for our future sustainable growth and build long-term value for our shareholders.\nNow let's turn to your questions."

Jenkins\n\nVP of IR, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's second quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.\nWith me this morning are Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman and CEO; Brendan Foley, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nToday's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information.\nI will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to start by welcoming Brendan to this morning's call. In addition to his continuing role as President of our Global Consumer business, Brendan now has responsibility for our business worldwide in his newly appointed role as President and COO. At the end of our prepared remarks, I may ask him to weigh in on some of your questions.\nMcCormick's long-term performance, including through the pandemic and other volatility has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our financial objectives. Broadly, our results in the second quarter were in line with our sales and profit expectations despite certain global challenges, including a greater-than-expected level of high cost inflation and supply chain challenges, significant disruption in China from COVID-related lockdowns and the conflict in Ukraine. As our second quarter progressed, the dynamics of these conditions intensified and negatively impacted our sales and profit results.\nBefore discussing our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to comment on each of these, starting on Page 5. Consistent with the rest of the industry, high cost inflation and supply chain are continuing challenges. To partially offset cost pressures, we've taken multiple pricing actions and, as planned, we are raising prices again. Inflation continued to escalate, and we've adjusted our upcoming pricing actions accordingly. We appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment.\nAdditionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and reducing discretionary spend where possible. We expect our pricing actions and other levers to begin to outpace cost pressures late in the third quarter, with higher cost and higher offsetting pricing actions than we expected on our last call, which further weights our 2022 profit to the second half of the year. We plan to fully offset cost pressures over time.\nIn China, during the second quarter, there was significant unanticipated disruption in consumption due to severe COVID-related lockdowns in Shanghai and other cities throughout China. China is our second biggest sales country, with operations in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan. Our Shanghai operation produces approximately 40% of our total China sales, which are distributed throughout the country and supports both of our segments. And as a reminder, our branded food service demand is included in our Consumer segment in China.\nThe lockdowns lasted roughly 75 days, with our Shanghai plant forced to close for 2 weeks at the onset, with employees living in the facility. Once we were able to reopen, we were impacted by lockdown-related labor shortages due to workers being quarantined. During April and May, we incurred significant incremental manufacturing and transportation costs to supply our customers. In addition, as restaurants largely closed and consumers unable to shop for extended periods in our strongest geographies, we experienced significant demand softness as well.\nMarket conditions in China have also allowed very little opportunity to increase prices. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China, but we will not be able to recover the sales and profit impact we experienced in this fiscal year.\nFinally, regarding the conflict in Ukraine, in mid-March, we suspended operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine were paused. These countries account for less than 1% of our overall business. We have recently decided to exit our Consumer business in Russia.\nNow for more detail on our second quarter results, starting with sales on Slide 7. Sales declined 1% from the second quarter of last year, including an unfavorable impact from currency. Our constant currency sales were comparable to last year, with growth from pricing actions offset by a decline in volume and product mix.\nThe volume decline was impacted unfavorably by several discrete items, including a 1% impact from the China consumption disruption and the conflict in Ukraine I just mentioned; a 1% impact from the exit of low-margin business in India; and a 2% impact from lapping the U.S. trade inventory replenishment during last year's second quarter. Excluding these items, our sales performance would have been 4% growth, reflecting the strength of our broad global portfolio and effective execution of our strategies and pricing actions. While growth in both segments was impacted by the discrete items, they were more impactful to our Consumer segment. Notably, our growth in Flavor Solutions was outstanding.\nComparisons to 2021 and 2020 remain difficult due to the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the second quarter of the last 2 years. Using 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline, second quarter sales have grown at a constant currency compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6%.\nMoving to profit. Adjusted operating income was down 33% or 32% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share was down 30%. The adjusted operating income comparison includes 7% unfavorable impact from the disruption to China's consumption and the conflict in Ukraine.\nAlthough we anticipated the profit driven by sales growth in the second quarter would be more than offset by higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, the impact was greater than expected due to continuing cost escalation. While this pressured second quarter profit, we expect to mitigate this impact later this year.\nNow moving to second quarter business updates for each of our segments. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 9, our second quarter sales reflect the impact of our pricing actions in all 3 regions. In the Americas, our first wave of pricing was phased in during our fourth quarter of last year, the second wave during the second quarter in April and the third wave will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. With the first wave, we saw a very low level of elasticity. With the second wave, we are seeing more price elasticity, although still below historical levels.\nWhile consumer spending has remained strong, consumers are now under significant pressure for broad-based inflation, notably fuel prices and other macro factors. As we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels.\nOverall, our pricing actions in EMEA and APZ are on track and our elasticity impacts are similar to the Americas. In EMEA and APZ, pricing timing varies by market within each region. In some markets, particularly in EMEA, there are regulatory guidelines on when we take pricing, which generally creates a lag in the timing of pricing compared to the Americas. In this unprecedented environment, however, we are taking additional actions in markets across EMEA.\nNow for some further highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%. And over the last 3 years, since 2019, and consumption has grown at a 3-year CAGR of 7%, which highlights how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products and outpace pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the Americas, a sales decline in the second quarter included an impact of lapping a 4% overshipment of consumption to replenish retailer inventories in the second quarter of last year. Our second quarter shipments this year were in line with our consumption change.\nDemand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. However, some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions continue to improve, as seen in our recipe mix share performance of another quarter of share gain. Our spices and seasoning share was pressured during the quarter by the shortage of certain packaging materials as well as certain organic spices. Some of these have been resolved and some will remain ongoing.\nWe continue to use our category and revenue management capability to strengthen our spices and seasoning portfolio and optimize the category performance for both McCormick and our retailers. The strength of our brands and our category leadership has recently won us new distribution which we will begin to realize later this year.\nIn EMEA, we continue to have strong share performance in most categories and markets. During the second quarter, we lapped strong year-ago consumption, partially due to last year's COVID-related restrictions throughout EMEA, where restrictions extended longer than other regions. Our Vahiné brand of homemade dessert products in France, a product line unique to our EMEA region, was most impacted as recently as we've seen baking returned to a more pre-pandemic baseline level. In other categories in the region, we believe there has been a step-up in consumption.\nAnd in the Asia Pacific region, in addition to the consumption disruption in China, second quarter growth was impacted by the exit of low-margin business in India. At the end of last year, we decided to exit our rice business, the Kohinoor brand, to enable the region to focus on our higher-margin core category.\nTurning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our sales performance for the quarter was outstanding, with both pricing and volume growth contributing. We drove double-digit growth in both the at-home and away-from-home parts of our portfolio. Looking at our Flavor Solutions growth over the past 3 years, since the COVID-19 restrictions caused dramatic second quarter comparisons in '20 and '21, our sales CAGR is 8%, largely driven by volumes.\nOur pricing actions increased sales in all 3 regions. Broadly, pricing actions in the branded foodservice part of our portfolio followed the same cadence as those in each region in Consumer business. In the rest of our Flavor Solutions business, pricing is based on contractual windows, with automatic price adjusters in many contracts, and the timing is going to vary based on those windows. In this dynamic environment though, with costs escalating so quickly, we are having discussions outside of those windows and passing costs through faster than usual.\nHigher volumes also contributed to growth in the Americas and EMEA region. Demand has remained strong for certain parts of our business in these regions. Our supply chain is being pressured to meet this demand and we are still taking on some extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us through this pressure.\nIn the Americas, where our customer base is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers, our at-home customers, strong growth was driven by flavors for savory snacks as well as performance nutrition and health applications with these customers. In EMEA, our customer base is more skewed to quick service restaurants, or QSRs, and our strong QSR momentum contributed to growth in all markets, partially driven by expanded distribution.\nBranded foodservice growth was strong in both the Americas and EMEA regions, driven by restaurant and institutional food service customers. Demand continues to strengthen in this channel, particularly as travel accelerates and restaurants benefit from consumers shifting to takeaway and delivery. Overall, our Flavor Solutions sales demand and growth momentum continues to be strong.\nNow let me expand on our growth platform and positioning in the current environment. Turning to Slide 11, global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance.\nWe are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic: healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, but the younger generation is fueling them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste. With the breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio, we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products. We are end-to-end flavor.\nWe continue to make investments to sustainably meet the growing demand and to fuel further growth. In our global supply chain, we increased our capacity with our recently opened U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility and have begun our expansion of FONA's footprint to support future flavor growth. We are also increasing our capacity in the fast-growing hot sauce category and investing in seasoning capacity to support increased demand and strengthen resiliency.\nAs we've said, with the sustained level of high consumer demand, we're benefiting from the manufacturing capacity we've added. While we still experienced disruptions in the supply chain, they are much more specific mainly from a transportation and packaging supply standpoint. We experienced the peak disruption in the third quarter of last year. And with every month, the supply chain continues to get better. We feel good about the progress we're making.\nWe are strategically investing behind our brands to drive growth, including in brand marketing, as we did throughout the pandemic with our 3-year brand marketing CAGR approximating our consumer segment sales CAGR for the same period. We're pivoting our messaging to emphasize to consumers how our products help them stretch their grocery dollars. For instance, we're launching a digital messaging highlighting the value of our product by making a great flavorful meal economically. We add flavor for only pennies per serving, and recipes like our 30-minute taco casserole are family- and budget-friendly answers to what's for dinner.\nWe continue to invest in new products. In our Consumer segment, we are responding to new consumer behaviors, like increased at-home lunches. For instance, our new patent-pending French's Creamy Mustard is off to a great start. We're sensitive to the needs of price-conscious consumers, not just in these challenging economic times, but every day. Our portfolio includes branded items to accommodate consumers' needs and provide solutions for everyone at every price point as well as private label products. Our new product launches include additional entry-level price point products for affordability and larger sizes of key high-usage items for better value.\nWhile we are still seeing strong consumer spending, we know that inflation is a significant concern for consumers, more so than COVID. We're leveraging our proprietary research, which served us well during the pandemic, to monitor for any signals of changing behavior. Our research continues to indicate consumers are going to cook as much at home or more than they did during the pandemic for many reasons. One of them is that they find it more economical. To the extent there is a recession, it further reinforces cooking at home, and we know from our past sales performance that our categories and brands perform well during recessionary periods.\nNow for some summary comments on Slide 13 before turning it over to Mike. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years regardless of the environment.\nThe long-term fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical performance remains strong. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly gives us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate a challenging global environment.\nDespite the pressures we experienced in the second quarter, we are well positioned and confident in delivering strong performance in 2022 and beyond, while driving sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. McCormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment. Their agility and their teamwork drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 15. Our top line constant currency sales were comparable to the second quarter of last year, reflecting 7% growth from pricing actions, offset by a 7% decline in volume and product mix. Excluding the 4% impact of the discrete items Lawrence mentioned earlier, our sales performance would have reflected 4% growth.\nConsumer segment sales declined 7% in constant currency. The impact from lapping the U.S. trade inventory replenishment, the consumption disruption in China, the exit of low-margin business in India and the conflict in the Ukraine contributed 6% to that decline. The remaining 1% decline was due to lower volume, partially offset by pricing actions. On a 3-year basis, our second quarter constant currency sales CAGR was 4%.\nOn Slide 16, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency, driven by lower volume and mix, partially offset by pricing actions. This decline is attributable to lapping trade inventory replenishments in the second quarter of last year. Over the past 3 years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 7%.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 11%, primarily due to lapping high year-ago demand driven by COVID-related lockdowns, the most significant impact of which was lower sales of Vahiné homemade dessert products. A 1% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia and Ukraine also contributed to the decline. Pricing actions in all markets partially offset the lower volume. Over the past 3 years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 3% CAGR.\nConstant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 18%, including a 20% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low-margin business in India. Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. On a 3-year basis, APZ's second quarter constant currency sales CAGR was a 7% decline, driven by the China and India impacts I just mentioned. Excluding those impacts, sales grew at a 5% CAGR over the past 3 years.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 19. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 11% due to pricing actions as well as higher volume and mix. This growth was partially offset by a 1% decline in sales related to the combined impact of the China disruption and the conflict in Ukraine. Second quarter constant currency sales for the last 3 years grew at an 8% CAGR.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales grew 12%, driven by both pricing and the combination of volume and mix. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth, with higher demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing to growth. Over the past 3 years, constant currency sales in the Americas grew at a CAGR of 8%.\nIn EMEA, we drove 19% constant currency sales growth with a 14% increase in volume and mix and 5% related to pricing actions. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth, excluding a 1% decline related to the conflict in Ukraine, was broad-based across its portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and branded foodservice customers. Over the past 3 years, EMEA's constant currency sales grew at a 10% CAGR.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales declined 6% in constant currency. The decline was driven by a 7% impact from lower volume in China due to the COVID-related restrictions, partially offset by pricing actions in all markets across the region. APZ grew constant currency sales at a 3% CAGR over the past 3 years.\nAs seen on Slide 23, adjusted gross profit margin declined 550 basis points in the second quarter versus the year ago period. Realizing this is a sizable compression, I will spend a moment on the significant drivers. Let me start with the drivers we anticipated.\nFirst, nearly half of this declined approximately 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. We focus on gross profit dollars. This impact was more significant than in the first quarter because of the higher level of pricing in the second quarter.\nProduct mix was unfavorable as compared to the second quarter of last year. In our Consumer segment, as we mentioned earlier, we are lapping strong U.S. spices and seasonings growth related to the inventory replenishment. In our Flavor Solutions segment, sales growth in our away-from-home products was higher than our at-home products and we are lapping strong sales of beverage flavors last year. A sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix.\nIn our Flavor Solutions segment, as we mentioned in our last earnings call, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by start-up and dual running costs as we transitioned production to our new U.K. Peterborough manufacturing facility. Of note, CCI-led cost savings partially offset the impacts I just walked through and we are on track to deliver our expected savings of $85 million for the full year.\nIn addition to the net impact of the anticipated items I just detailed, gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by the following items. As Lawrence discussed, cost inflation and supply chain pressures escalated during the second quarter impacting our results more than expected, primarily related to transportation costs and faster-turning materials.\nWhile we have adjusted our upcoming pricing actions to reflect that escalation and we plan to fully offset cost pressures over time, our second quarter gross margin compression reflects the usual lag associated with pricing. We expect pricing to begin outpacing the cost pressures later this year and continue into next year. Our cost recovery will vary by region and segment. Currently, our pricing lag is more significant in our Flavor Solutions segment.\nLawrence previously mentioned we have incremental costs to meet strong demand for certain parts of our Flavor Solutions business, thus impacting our gross margin. And finally, as already mentioned, significant cost due to the COVID-related restrictions in China had an unfavorable impact to profit.\nMoving to Slide 24. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lower than the second quarter of last year and as a percentage of net sales, declined 20 basis points. The decline was driven by lower employee benefit and brand marketing expenses as well as discretionary spending reductions, partially offset by higher distribution costs. The decline in brand marketing investments was driven by China and Russia reductions. Importantly, across our other markets, we invested in brand marketing at a comparable level to last year.\nThe net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges of 33% compared to the second quarter of 2021. In the Consumer segment, adjusted operating income declined 29%; and in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 40%. A 1% unfavorable impact from currency is included in each of these declines.\nTurning to income taxes on Slide 25. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 18.6% compared to 22.2% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 26, second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.48 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income.\nOn Slide 27, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $154 million through the second quarter of 2022 compared to $229 million through the second quarter of 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income. Cash flow from operations will be weighted to the second half of the year, similar to our profit growth.\nWe returned $198 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $102 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.\nNow turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 28. As a reminder, last quarter, the conditions in Russia, Ukraine and China were just unfolding and cost inflation and supply chain challenges remain dynamic and fast moving. Today, we have a better view of the macro environment and our guidance for the full year considers the greater impact from these items. In addition, and as noted previously, we have always expected our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We now expect it to be even more so.\nWe are projecting strong top line growth with profit impacted by the global challenges I just mentioned. We also expect there will be an estimated 2 percentage points unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, an increase from our previous estimate of 1 percentage point unfavorable.\nOn the top line, we now expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%. We expect sales to be driven primarily by pricing, which will accelerate significantly in the second half versus the first half. While we anticipate volume and product mix to be impacted by increasing elasticity, we expect elasticity to remain at a lower rate than historical levels.\nOur volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio as well as the impact of demand disruptions in China and Ukraine. We plan to drive continued growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans.\nWe are now projecting our 2022 adjusted gross profit margin to be 200 to 150 basis points lower than 2021. Given the rapidly escalating cost environment, cost pressures have outpaced our pricing and future actions have been adjusted to reflect the higher cost level. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the impact of a high teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments and favorable impacts from pricing and CCI-led cost savings.\nAs a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. We focus on gross profit dollars. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression.\nWe now expect to grow our adjusted operating income 2% to 4% in constant currency. In addition to the gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million and brand marketing investments comparable to 2021 which reflects reductions in China and Russia.\nConsidering the year-to-date impact from discrete items as well as our estimated mix of earnings by geography, we now project our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%. This outlook is expected to be a year-over-year headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately 2%.\nWe are lowering our 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations to a range of $3.03 to $3.08. This compares to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 and represents a decline of 1% to an increase of 1% or, in constant currency, growth of 1% to 3%. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and an expected $15 million benefit from the impact of optimizing our debt portfolio.\nIn addition, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue our operating momentum and drive another year of strong performance.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on Slide 29. Our long-term performance has been industry-leading and met or exceeded our objectives, including through volatile environments. The long-term fundamentals that drove this historical performance remained strong.\nSeveral discrete items unfavorably impact our sales comparison to the second quarter of last year. Excluding these impacts, our sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio, the effective execution of our strategies and our pricing actions. Our sales growth momentum is strong.\nPersistent high cost inflation and supply chain challenges intensified as the second quarter progressed and unfavorably impacted our profit. Importantly, we expect to mitigate this impact in the second half of the year. We're confident that with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, effective growth strategies and our ability to navigate challenging environments, we will drive another year of strong performance in 2022 and build value for our shareholders.\nNow let's turn to your questions."

Jenkins\n\nVP of IR, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning. This is Kasey Jenkins, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you for joining today's first quarter earnings call. To accompany this call, we posted a set of slides at ir.mccormick.com.\nWe will begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO, and we'll close with a question-and-answer session.\nDuring this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. The nature of those non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.\nIn addition, as a reminder, today's presentation contains projections and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or other factors. Please refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more information. I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman, President & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I go to business, it is with great sadness that I mention the passing of Buzz McCormick, who is one of the most beloved and admired leaders in McCormick's history. Buzz's career at McCormick span 50 years rising through the ranks across many functions becoming President and CEO in 1987 and serving as Chairman of the Board for a total of 11 years until his retirement for the third time in 1999. As CEO, Buzz focused McCormick on flavor by divesting noncore businesses and driving category leadership in spices and seasonings, setting the course for McCormick to be the global leader in flavor.\nNotably, McCormick's market cap grew by 4x under his leadership. Buzz will not only be remembered for his enduring legacy of performance but just as importantly, for his deep commitment to the well-being of all McCormick employees. He truly made McCormick a great place to work, and leaving his biggest accomplishment as a CEO is helping all McCormick employees have a better life.\nToday, as we reflect on his life and his contributions, we know that his legacy will live on. He has inspired many generations of McCormick leaders with his passion for people, focus on flavor and commitment to delivering shareholder value.\nNext, I'd like to comment on the situation in Ukraine. First and foremost, we extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine and hope for an immediate end to the conflict and the suffering of innocent people. As we previously announced, we suspended our operations in Russia in mid-March. Our operations in Ukraine have been paused to focus on the safety of our employees and their families. Our thoughts are with the people impacted by these tragic events particularly our employees who we continue to support. To aid in humanitarian efforts, we're donating to the Polish Center for International Aid and the World Central Kitchen.\nI would also like to express my sincere appreciation to our EMEA employees, especially those in Poland for their many personal efforts in aiding their Ukrainian neighbors in need. Their actions epitomize our Power of People principle.\nNow moving to Slide 4 and to our business results. We delivered solid financial results in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our strategies and the engagement of employees. We are confident our strong year-to-date momentum will continue to drive strong performance throughout 2022.\nIn the first quarter, we grew sales 3% or 4% in constant currency on top of our 20% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year, demonstrating again the strength of our product offering and broad global portfolio, which drives differentiated growth and consistency in our performance.\nConsumer segment sales, while lapping high year ago demand continued to reflect the sustained shift of higher at-home consumption compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our Flavor Solutions segment growth was driven by outstanding growth with our packaged food and beverage customers as well as robust demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers, due in part to recovery from curtailed away-from-home dining in the year ago period.\nThrough the breadth and reach of our balanced flavor portfolio, we are meeting the global demand for flavor and delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products. We are end-to-end flavor.\nAdjusted operating income was down 14% or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted earnings per share was down 13%. As anticipated, the profit driven by our sales growth was more than offset by the well-known and anticipated headwinds of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges.\nWe have a demonstrated history of successfully navigating through a volatile environment, and we expect to do the same through this high current inflationary period using pricing and other levers to offset cost pressures, which is reflected in our 2022 profit outlook.\nNow for more on our first quarter segment performance. Starting with the Consumer segment on Slide 5. Growth in the Americas was more than offset by lower sales in the EMEA and APZ regions. Total Consumer segment sales declined 2% against 35% consumer growth in the first quarter of 2021. Given the difficult year-over-year comparison, volume declines were reflected in each region.\nOn a 2-year basis, however, compared to the first quarter of 2020, each region grew sales by double digits. This growth highlights the strength of our categories and importantly, our products as consumers continue to cook more at home demand for flavor continues to grow. The pricing actions we have taken were also reflected in each region's results, and the elasticity impact we experienced has been lower than historical levels.\nAs we look ahead and our additional pricing actions are phased in, the elasticity we experienced may change, and this could be a cumulative effect, but we still expect the impact to be lower than historical levels.\nTurning to highlights by region, starting with the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 2% which follows a 15% consumption increase in the first quarter of 2021. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit consumption growth versus the 2 year ago period.\nDemand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of the manufacturing capacity we added as well as our increased resilience. Our first quarter shipments were in line with consumption, however, some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions continue to improve as does our share performance with another sequential improvement in the first quarter as we expected. Versus last year, we are beginning to grow our spices and seasoning share, and in recipe mixes, we had another quarter of considerable share gain over 4 share points.\nWe continue to see further improvement as we begin the second quarter, and we are confident in our continued momentum.\nIn EMEA during the first quarter, we lapped high prior year demand, partially due to restrictions resulting from COVID resurgences last year while continuing our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nOur market share performance was stronger this quarter. We maintained our total EMEA region herbs, spices and seasoning share on top of strong gains in the first quarters of the last 2 years. Of note, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption 60% and gained significant share versus the 2 year ago period. And in the Asia Pacific region, first quarter growth was tempered by scaled down Chinese New Year celebrations due to several cities in China imposing restrictions, as a result of new COVID outbreaks. These restrictions impacted our branded foodservice demand that is included in the Consumer segment in China.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our Flavor Solutions segment grew 12% or 14% in constant currency driven by base business growth, new products and 1 month of incremental sales for our acquisition of FONA in December 2020. All 3 regions contributed to our growth each with higher volume and product mix as well as the pricing actions to partially offset costs.\nOur first quarter Flavor Solutions results reflect similar market conditions across the region. As a reminder, our customer base in the Americas is skewed more to packaged food and beverage customers, and in EMEA and APZ to quick service restaurant or QSR customers. Our differentiated customer engagement and technical capabilities continue to drive outstanding growth, both in base business and with new products, with our packaged food and beverage customers or at-home customer base.\nOur performance with these customers led our first quarter Flavor Solutions results with double-digit growth in flavors for performance nutrition and health end market applications as well as savory snacks and our momentum with flavors for alcoholic beverages also continued.\nOur QSR momentum has been strong with core menu items and limited time offers driving first quarter growth and other restaurant business continues to rebound. Our first quarter results also reflect the lapping of curtailed away-from-home dining last year.\nRestaurants are benefiting from the shift to takeaway and delivery that was amplified by the pandemic. There's been a blurring between channels and most of the restaurant food being consumed off-premise.\nFor instance, 1 in 4 dinners consumed at-home that supplemented with a restaurant or other foodservice items. For our other institutional foodservice customers and our branded foodservice product category, we expected some recovery coming into 2022, and we saw that demand strengthen in our first quarter and drove growth in the Americas and EMEA regions.\nNow I'd like to share some comments on our momentum and the growth initiatives we have underway. Turning to Slide 7, global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices.\nThese long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate. Our alignment with these trends, in combination with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and the successful execution of our strategies sustainably positions us for future growth.\nIn this current dynamic global environment, we remain focused on long-term sustainable growth. We continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges. To partially offset rising costs, we raised prices where appropriate late last year are currently facing an additional pricing actions. And as costs have continued to accelerate, we will raise prices again this year where appropriate.\nWe appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. Additionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. Throughout our history, we have successfully grown and compounded our growth regardless of the environment and plan to do so again in 2022 as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength.\nIn our Consumer segment, across our major measured markets, we have gained millions of households over the last 2 years and had double-digit buy rate growth. Our brands have gained new consumers, and we have driven increased usage at the same time. This performance, combined with billions of additional at-home eating occasions from consumers cooking more at-home has created a new baseline for growth.\nWe are continuing to drive our Consumer segment momentum by accelerating flavor usage, including delivering on the demand for heat, building confidence in the kitchen and inspiring flavor exploration. We're also strengthening our consumer relationships at every point of purchase and creating a delicious, healthy and sustainable future.\nWe are fueling growth through our brand marketing investments, category management initiatives and new products. Our brand marketing is resonating with consumers, particularly as we connect with them online. And as we expand the capabilities of our marketing excellence organization globally, we're gaining efficiencies, executing with greater speed and shifting our investments to working dollars to drive greater effectiveness.\nOur U.S. spice aisle reinvention is further driving our category leadership with growth for McCormick and our customers. This initiative is continuing this year with additional stores being implemented and we're also starting to build momentum with similar initiatives in Canada, the U.K. and France. Our consumer new product innovation differentiates our brand and strengthens our relevance with our consumers. Our new products are focused on what's important to consumers, such as freshness, modern packaging, convenient and flavor exploration as well as affordability and value. 75% of global consumers find it more economical to cook at home. And in the current inflationary environment, it resonates even more now.\nOur products are already part of the consumer solution to manage inflation across their whole grocery basket. For instance, inflation is hitting the meat case hard and a little bit of our flavor can make less impressive meat, more palatable and make the consumers whole meal both more affordable and favorable.\nWe have products at all price points that attract many types of consumers and households as well as different income levels. We continue to focus on ensuring we're launching new products that appeal to all types of consumers such as additional entry-level price points for affordability as well as value offerings, including larger sizes to meet the needs of price-conscious consumers.\nAnd with our new products and recipes tailored to popular new appliances such as air fryers and instant pots, we are providing consumers flavor inspiration and greater convenience when using our products.\nIn our Flavor Solutions segment, we plan to continue migrating our portfolio to more value-added products and technically insulated products, particularly our flavors product category. We're targeting opportunities to grow with our customers in attractive, high-growth end markets such as alcoholic beverages, savory snacks and performance nutrition. We have been outpacing the market growth in these categories. They all contributed first to strong growth in our first quarter results and further migrated our portfolio.\nFollowing a record year of new product growth last year, we are excited about our robust 2022 pipeline of culinary inspired innovation. We are leveraging our broad technology platform to develop clean label, organic and better-for-you solutions to some of our customers' issues without compromising on taste. We're using SAGE, our AI-enabled product development tool to develop consumer preferred flavors at an increased speed that have a track record for lasting longer in the market for our customers.\nAnd we are building a pipeline of opportunities to accelerate our global seasonings growth by expanding our mid-tier customer base, being added to core supplier list and strengthening our leadership in heat. We plan to continue to drive Flavor Solutions growth through a differentiated customer engagement. We have a strong passion for creating a flawless customer experience.\nAcross both segments, our strong sales and growth plans bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory. We also recognize we are operating in a challenging global environment. Before Mike reiterates our guidance in a few moments, I'd like to comment on some current conditions.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine very closely and adapt accordingly. Cost inflation has remained persistent with recent escalation in some areas such as transportation costs. And as such, we have raised our cost inflation guidance, it is now a mid- to high-teen increase.\nAnd in regard to COVID, as I mentioned earlier, there are new COVID restrictions being imposed in several cities in China. We are continually assessing the dynamics of these conditions as they evolve. We recognize there will be some near-term impact, which we expect to mitigate later in the year, in part with additional pricing actions.\nWe are well positioned to deliver another strong year of growth and performance in 2022, through the effective execution of our strategy and with our robust operating momentum. In addition to delivering top-tier financial results, we are also committed to doing what's right for people, communities and the planet.\nWe recently released our 2021 Purpose-led Performance Progress Report, which highlights our key initiatives and the progress we are making, including our recent announcements on the update of our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas submissions by 2030, aligning with the United Nations 1.5 degree Celsius target as well as our commitment to net zero by 2050.\nAs we move forward in 2022, we are excited to continue to share our progress and success on all our purpose-led performance goals.\nNow for some summary comments on Slide 11, before turning it over to Mike. The combination of our strong business model, the investments we have made, the capabilities we have built and the power of our people, position us well to continue our robust growth momentum. We are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. We are actively responding to changing market conditions, consumer behaviors and customer needs while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing environment.\nWe have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate today's environment, responding with agility to volatility and disruptions while remaining focused on the long-term objectives, strategies and values that have made us so successful. Through the execution of our strategy that are designed to drive long-term value, we have grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years, regardless of the environment.\nOur fundamentals that drove that performance and our momentum and outlook are stronger than ever. McCormick employees continue to do a great job navigating a dynamic environment. Their agility and teamwork drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. Now I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top line growth continues to be strong. During the first quarter, we grew constant currency sales 4%, driven by pricing actions across both segments and incremental sales from our FONA acquisition.\nConsumer segment sales declined 2% in constant currency due to lapping high demand in all 3 regions last year, with a partial offset from pricing. On a 2-year basis, compared to the first quarter of 2020, constant currency sales grew 30% with double-digit growth in all 3 regions, reflecting the sustained shift to at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nOn Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions, partially offset by lower volume and product mix due to lapping last year's elevated demand. Branded products led the growth, with strength in McCormick, Zatarain's, Stubb's, OLD BAY, Simply Asia, Frank's RedHot and French's, partially offset by a decline in private label.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 9% from a year ago, driven by lower volume and product mix, most significantly in Vahiné homemade dessert products due to lapping last year's high demand across the region. This decline was partially offset by pricing actions. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 6%, driven by the exit of some lower-margin business in India.\nChina's consumer and branded foodservice demand partially related to the Chinese New Year impacts Lawrence mentioned earlier, also contributed to the decline. These declines were partially offset by pricing actions.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew first quarter constant currency sales 14%, including a 2% contribution from incremental FONA sales in December. As a reminder, we acquired FONA on December 30, 2020. The remaining increase was driven by higher volume and product mix as well as pricing actions.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2020, constant currency sales grew 18%, with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 12%, with FONA contributing 2% and the remaining growth due to both pricing and the combination of volume and product mix. Higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings led the growth with the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers also contributing.\nIn the EMEA, we drove 24% constant currency sales growth with a 17% increase in volume and product mix and 7% related to pricing actions. EMEA's growth was led by the robust recovery of demand from QSRs and branded foodservice customers.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 5% in constant currency, driven by pricing actions and growth from higher volume and product mix. This growth was driven by our QSR customers, both in their core menu items as well as their limited time offers and promotional activities.\nAs seen on Slide 21, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges declined 14% or in constant currency, 12% in the first quarter versus the year ago period.\nAdjusted operating income declined 12% in the Consumer segment with minimal impact from currency. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 17% or 11% in constant currency. Both segments were unfavorably impacted by higher inflation and distribution costs. Both of which accelerated in the second half of last year as well as incremental investment spending on our ERP program, which we expected to be higher earlier in 2022 versus 2021. CCI-led cost savings favorably impacted both segments.\nIn the Consumer segment, lower sales, partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19-related costs also contributed to the decline. In the Flavor Solutions segment, higher sales were more than offset by the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned as well as costs related to supply chain investments, which will continue in the second quarter.\nAs seen on Slide 22, adjusted gross profit margin declined 260 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period. This was driven by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the pricing actions we have taken. We estimate the dilutive impact of pricing to offset this dollar inflation increase was approximately 200 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, a sales shift between segments also contributed to the margin decline.\nOur selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points from the first quarter of last year due to higher distribution costs and a higher level of investment in our ERP program. This, combined with the adjusted gross margin compression, resulted in an adjusted margin decline of 280 basis points, in line with our expectations.\nTurning to income taxes on Slide 23. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 19.7% and compared to 22.7% in the year ago period, driven by a higher level of discrete tax items this year. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 30% versus the first quarter of 2021. Due to the elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest as well as higher inflation costs impacting our McCormick de Mexico joint venture.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 as compared to $0.72 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by our lower adjusted operating income.\nOn Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an inflow of $18 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to an outflow of $32 million in the first quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily driven by working capital improvements and lower payments for transaction and integration costs related to our Cholula and FONA acquisitions.\nWe returned $99 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $44 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.\nNow turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 27. First, I would like to provide some additional perspective on some of the current conditions Lawrence mentioned earlier. As we have said, we are currently not operating in Russia and the Ukraine. And while the impact is not fully known, our business in these markets is small with the combined sales across both segments totaling less than 1% of total company sales last year. Additionally, we have no manufacturing in either country. Any operating profit impact would include those related to the impact on sales as well as potential expenses stemming from the current situation.\nRegarding cost inflation, we are revising our outlook and are now projecting inflationary pressure in the mid- to high teens as compared to mid-teens increase in our previous guidance. We expect cost inflation to remain persistent, especially as it relates to transportation, and we are continuing actions to mitigate these costs, including pricing.\nAgain, as Lawrence mentioned, we recognize these dynamics will have some impacts on our results, certainly in the second quarter. While we continue to monitor impacts on the broader economy and will adapt as necessary, we are reiterating our 2022 sales and profit outlook that we previously shared in our January earnings call.\nWe are projecting strong top line growth and operating performance with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 1 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.\nOn the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%. We expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth with volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities, although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans.\nOur volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by the pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio.\nOur 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid- to high-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings.\nAs a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases, we do not margin up. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression.\nWe expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in COVID-19-related costs and our continuing investment in ERP business transformation. This projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid- to high teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million.\nAs we shared on our last earnings call, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we are phasing in pricing actions and with costs continuing to escalate, we'll raise prices again as appropriate. While we plan to cover the cost pressures, due to the recent acceleration of inflation, there will be a lag. And as a result, our profit will now be weighted to the second half of the year, even more than originally expected. And as a reminder, we expect our ERP investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021.\nOur 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 3%.\nOur 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind I just mentioned. This resulted in an increase of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22 compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021.\nIn summary, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio and effective growth strategies to continue to accelerate our operating momentum and drive another year of strong growth and performance.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman, President & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. We delivered solid first quarter results in line with our expectations with strong sales growth on top of our 20% constant currency growth last year. We are confident that the hard work and dedication of our employees will continue to drive momentum.\nWe recognize we're operating in a challenging global environment. Through the execution of our strategies, we've successfully grown long-term value over the years regardless of the environment. Our long-term fundamentals that drove our performance are stronger than ever. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capability, our alignment with long-term consumer trends that are in our favor and the attractive categories we are in provide a strong foundation for long-term sustainable growth.\nWe're confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders.\nNow let's turn to your questions."

Kurzius\n\nChairman, President & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 4. Our fourth quarter completed another year of robust and sustained growth.\nIn 2021, we remained focused on growth, performance and people, driving another year of strong results and continuing our momentum. We drove record sales growth by executing on our long-term strategies, actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities, all while remaining forward-looking in an ever-changing global environment.\nThe profit driven by our strong sales growth in 2021, while tempered by the well-known headwinds of higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges, was also strong. Our 2021 operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and the resilience of our employees. We have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures and did so again in the fourth quarter, and we expect to do the same through this inflationary environment using pricing and other levers to fully offset cost pressures over time.\nThe breadth and reach of our global flavor portfolio ideally position us to fully knowing demand for flavor around the world and drive continued differentiated growth. This has never been more evident than over the last 2 years as consumers are (inaudible) reacting to the ever-changing environment.\nOur compelling offerings in our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segment for every retail and customer strategy across all channels create a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive growth and consistency in our performance. It also gives us significant flexibility to adapt to changing conditions wherever they may arise and continue on our growth trajectory. This is a significant differentiator in the dynamic environment in which we currently operate.\nWe are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion regardless of whether the occasion is consumed at home or away from home through our products and our customers' products. We are end-to-end flavor. Now turning to Slide 6 and our fourth quarter results, our performance was at the high end of the guidance range we provided for sales and adjusted operating profit on our last earnings call and exceeded the guidance range we provided for adjusted earnings per share.\nOn our top line versus the year ago period, we grew fourth quarter sales 11%. Both of our segments delivered strong growth with contributions from base business growth, driven by higher volume and pricing actions as well as new products and acquisitions.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share both increased 6%, driven by growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by cost inflation. Let's turn to our fourth quarter segment business performance, which includes some comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which we believe are meaningful, given the level of demand volatility from quarter-to-quarter experienced in 2020.\nStarting on Slide 7. Consumer segment sales grew 10%, including incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition. The increase was driven by strong volume growth and the impact of pricing actions phased in during the quarter as we discussed on our last earnings call. Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a 2-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpace its pre-pandemic level.\nOur Americas sales growth was 13% in the fourth quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 1%, following a 17% consumption increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a 2-year basis.\nAs we previously discussed, in the year ago period, elevated demand challenged our supply chain were as a but the actions we took to add capacity and increase resilience, we were far better positioned and able to ship in line with consumption.\nDemand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions are improving, as is our share performance with another sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, as we expected. We continue to see further improvement in our recent performance as we begin 2022.\nImportantly, and as I just mentioned, we are better positioned than we were a year ago and are confident in our continued momentum. Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the fourth quarter of 2019 was the seventh consecutive quarter that our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the 2 year ago period. Our key categories also continued to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the 2 year ago period.\nHousehold penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. And when consumers shop, they are buying and therefore using more and more products than they were pre-pandemic.\nNow turning to EMEA. During the fourth quarter, we continued our momentum with strong consumption growth in key categories compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, we gained market share in key categories and across the region. Similar to the U.S., our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the 2-year-ago period. And when consumers shop, they are buying more than they were pre-pandemic.\nAnd in the Asia Pacific region, our fourth quarter performance continued to reflect the recovery of China's lower branded food service sales last year as well as consumer consumption growth across the region.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our Flavor Solutions segment grew 14%, reflecting higher base volume growth in new products as well as pricing actions to partially offset cost inflation and contributions for our phone and Cholula acquisitions. On a 2-year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all 3 regions.\nIn the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our fourth quarter growth. Additionally, we continue to see robust growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers as well as the recovery of demand from branded foodservice customers as more dining out options are open versus a year ago. We continue to execute on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products in the region, both through the addition of FONA and Cholula to our portfolio as well as the exit of some lower-margin business.\nTurning to EMEA, which has continued its strong momentum. We are winning in all channels with double-digit fourth quarter growth to quick service restaurants, or QSRs, branded food service customers and packaged food and beverage customers. Recovery has been robust in the away-from-home part of the portfolio and growth in our at-home offerings has been outstanding.\nNotably, for the full year, on a 2-year basis, we have driven 19% constant currency growth across the portfolio. In APG, our momentum with our QSR customers remains strong, driving double-digit growth versus 2020 as well as on a 2-year basis.\nAs for the fourth quarter and in line with what we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter-to-quarter.\nMoving to our fourth quarter results, I'm pleased to share highlights of our full fiscal year, including an update on our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, starting on Slide 10.\nWe drove record sales growth in 2021, growing sales 13% to $6.3 billion with strong organic sales growth and a 4% contribution from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. Notably, on a 2-year basis, we grew sales 18%, reflecting a robust and sustained growth momentum in both of our segments.\nOur consumer segment sales growth of 9% was driven by consumer sustained preference for cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, strong digital engagement and new products as well as growth from Cholula. Versus 2019, we grew sales 20%, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brands.\nOur Flavor Solutions segment growth of 19% reflected the strong continued momentum with the at home products in our portfolio, including a record year of new product growth and a robust recovery from last year's lower demand for away-from-home products as well as contributions from FONA and Cholula.\nNotably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and away-from-home products in our portfolio. On a 2-year basis, we grew sales 15%, driven by the at-home part of our portfolio, the demand for the away-from-home portion recovering to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe have consistently driven industry-leading sales growth resulting in McCormick being named to the latest Fortune 500. We're proud of our sustained performance and for being included in this prestigious group of industry-leading companies.\nAt year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend, marking our 36th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. Finally, we continue to be recognized for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet.\nDuring the year, McCormick was named the United Nations Global Compact Lead Company and awarded the inaugural (inaudible) seal from his royal highness of price of oil, our industry leadership in creating a sustainable future. And just last week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2022 Global 100 Sustainability Index as the world's 14th most sustainable corporation and for the sixth consecutive year, #1 in the food products sector.\nMoving to the 1-year anniversary of our 2 fantastic recent acquisitions. Cholula and FONA are creating value, achieving synergies and delivering results according to our plans. Importantly, we've achieved our 1-year sales and earnings per share accretion expectations for both Cholula and FONA. I'd like to share some comments about the successful execution of our growth plans. And then in a few moments, Mike will cover in more detail our delivery on acquisition plans.\nStarting with Cholula on Slide 12. The addition of this beloved iconic brand with authentic Mexican flavor is accelerating the growth of our global condiment platform. In our consumer segment, we're unlocking Cholula's significant growth potential by using our category management expertise, leveraging e-commerce investments, launching new products and optimizing brand marketing spend.\nWe executed on initiatives this past year, including optimizing shelf placement and assortment, expanding into new channels, gaining momentum in e-commerce, where Cholula had been under-penetrated, increasing awareness, both through brand marketing investments and brand partnerships such as with DoorDash, and leveraging promotional scale across McCormick brands.\nWe are excited about the results our initiatives are yielding. During 2021, we gained significant momentum on top of lapping elevated growth in 2020, adding over 1 million new households and growing Cholula's consumption 13% in 2021 versus last year. Cholula is continuing to outpace category growth and gain share. Combined with 19% total distribution point growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, it is clear our plans are driving accelerated growth. And notably, we drove Cholula to the #2 hot sauce brand in the U.S., joining Frank's RedHot, the #1 ranked brand, at the top of the category.\nWe are just as excited about Cholula's performance as part of our Flavor Solutions portfolio. With our broad presence across foodservice channel, we have strengthened Cholula's go-to-market model through 2021. We continue to build on Cholula's strong front-of-house presence, which builds trial and brand awareness beyond food service with significant double-digit growth of portion control packs as more restaurant meals are now consumed as delivery or takeaway.\nLeveraging our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends, we've also driven double-digit growth in our back-of-house foodservice penetration through recipe inspiration and increasing Cholula's menu participation. We are growing with big national accounts and smaller independent restaurants, as well as expanding distribution through leveraging the strength of our distributor relationships where Cholula was less developed.\nWe are succeeding with new menu items, including both permanent ones and limited time offers. Our momentum with Cholula is very strong, and we are confident our initiatives will continue to build on consumers' growing passion for heat and drive further growth of this fantastic brand.\nNow turning to FONA. The addition of this leading North American flavor manufacturer is accelerating the growth of our global flavors platform. We are thrilled our first year of owning FONA has been a record year for the business with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages with particular strength in the fast-growing performance nutrition category continued to drive significant growth for FONA up 15% compared to last year. FONA's new product wins and its pipeline potential have also hit record high, fueling future growth.\nWe are continuing to drive growth and create new opportunities with our global footprint. We are leveraging FONA's infrastructure to expand FONA's flavors into the EMEA region. In our APZ region, the combination of our infrastructure, which includes our recent flavor capability investments to China and FONA's local application and flavor creation talent is unlocking further potential to accelerate flavor growth in that region.\nAnd just a few months ago, we began our expansion of FONA's footprint to increase our Americas flavor manufacturing capacity, an investment we planned as part of our acquisition model, enabling us to deliver the future growth we expect.\nBy expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale as well as increasing our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we are providing our collective customers with a more comprehensive product offering and fueling more opportunities for growth across our entire portfolio. We are cross-selling products across our customer base, and we've also realized the benefit of our combination within our own portfolio.\nFor instance, with FONA now leveraging McCormick's USDA savory flavors and developing flavors for pet food applications, the combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to participate on briefs that capitalize on core strength across McCormick and FONA, enabling us to build a robust pipeline of opportunities and importantly, win and grow with our customers.\nWe are thrilled with both Cholula and FONA. Our enthusiasm for these acquisitions, as well as our confidence that we will continue to achieve our plan, accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only continued to strengthen.\nIn summary, for 2021, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our consumer segment and the at-home part of our Flavor Solutions segment. We have successfully navigated through the pandemic-related disruption in the away-from-home portion of our Flavor Solutions segment and solution have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. All of this reinforces our confidence for continued growth in 2022.\nThe Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great, fast-growing categories and will continue to differentiate our performance. We are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorable cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as ever, with the younger generations fueling them at a greater rate.\nOur alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our global portfolio and the successful execution of our strategies, sustainably positions us for future growth.\nIn this current dynamic and fast-paced environment, we remain focused on long-term, sustainable growth. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to experience cost pressures from higher inflation and broad-based supply chain challenges similar to the rest of the industry. To partially offset rising costs, we raised prices where appropriately last year and began to realize the impact of those actions in our fourth quarter sales growth.\nAs costs have continued to accelerate, we are raising prices again where appropriate in 2022. These pricing actions are on track, and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment.\nAdditionally, our plans to mitigate cost pressures include our CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. Throughout our history, we have grown and compounded our growth regardless of short-term pressures and plan to do so again in 2022, as we continue to accelerate our momentum and drive growth from a position of strength. Across our consumer segment, our 2022 plans include continuing to build consumers' confidence in the kitchen, inspire their home cooking and flavor exploration and accelerate flavored usage, including delivering on the global demand for heat.\nWe also plan to strengthen our consumer relationships at every point of purchase as well as create delicious, healthy and sustainable future. When our investments in brand marketing, category management and new products, we expect to drive further sales growth.\nFor our Flavor Solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2022. Our plans include targeting opportunities to grow with our customers at attractive, high-growth categories continuing to leverage our broad technology platform to develop clean and natural solutions that taste great and strengthening our leadership in heat.\nWith our culinary inspired innovation and our passion for creating a flawless customer experience, we plan to continue our new product momentum and drive further sales growth. Our achievements in 2021, our effective growth strategies as well as our robust operating momentum, all bolster our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2022.\nWe're looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2022 growth plan in just a few weeks at CAGNY. In summary, we have a strong foundation and are well equipped to navigate through this ever-changing environment, responding with agility to volatility and disruptions while remaining focused on our long-term objectives, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We are in attractive categories and are capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. A combination of our strong business model, the investments we've made, the capabilities we've built and the power of our people position us well to continue our robust growth momentum.\nImportantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top line growth and margin expansion. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. McCormick's employees around the world have done a tremendous job of navigating this past year's volatile environment. Their agility, teamwork and passion for flavor drive our momentum and success, and I want to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. Now I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael R. Smith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide additional remarks on our fourth quarter and full year results, I would like to build upon Lawrence's comments on Cholula and FONA and highlight how we have delivered on our acquisition plans now that we have completed the first year.\nStarting on Slide 19. As Lawrence already shared, we have created value by driving sales growth according to our plans. In addition, Cholula was margin accretive to the gross and operating margins in both of our segments, and FONA was accretive to the margins in the Flavor Solutions segment.\nWe are delivering against our synergy and onetime cost estimates, in fact, doing better than our acquisition plan. Starting with our original synergy targets. For Cholula, we have achieved the targeted $10 million to be fully realized by 2022. For FONA, we are on track to achieve our targeted $7 million by the end of 2023. We are also achieving revenue synergies as expected.\nOur transaction and integration costs for Cholula and FONA are both lower than our acquisition plans. Early in 2021, we took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following the acquisitions, raising $1 billion through the issuance of 5-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes and therefore, realized lower interest expense than we originally projected.\nAdditionally, our ongoing amortization expense is favorable to both of the acquisition models. In summary, we executed our year 1 acquisition plans in line with and in some areas better than our modeled, including the adjusted earnings per share accretion we expected. Successful acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy.\nImportantly, we have a proven track record of driving value through acquisitions and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, and Cholula and FONA are adding to that history.\nNow for our fourth quarter and full year performance, starting on Slide 20. Our fourth quarter capped off a year of record sales growth. During the fourth quarter, we grew constant currency sales 10% with higher volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributing to the increases in both segments.\nOrganic sales growth was 6%, driven by strong growth in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments and incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency, with both our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments growing double digits.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our consumer segment sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven by higher volume and product mix, pricing actions and a 2% increase from our Cholula acquisition. The year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales grew 14% in constant currency, led by the Americas. On Slide 21, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 13% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as the sustained shift to at-home consumption continues to drive increased demand as well as lapping last year's capacity constraints.\nPricing actions and a 3% increase from the Cholula acquisition also contributed to sales growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales increased 19% in constant currency, driven by broad-based growth across branded products as well as an increase from the Cholula acquisition. A decline in private label sales partially offset the branded growth.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 5% from a year ago due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 5% in constant currency, driven by growth in spices and seasonings, hot sauce and mustard. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 11% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales in China or away from home products and higher sales of cooking at home products across the region.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2019, sales were flat, with growth across the region offset by a sales decline in India due to the exit of some lower-margin business.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 24. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 12%, including a 7% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was led by double-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13% year-over-year with FONA and Cholula contributing 11%. Organic sales growth was driven by the recovery of demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, higher sales to packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasons and pricing. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019, driven by higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business in other parts of the portfolio.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales grew 16% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers, as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, both driven by QSR growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities.\nAs seen on Slide 28, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as special charges, increased 6% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency.\nAdjusted operating income in the consumer segment increased 14% or in constant currency, 13%. The higher sales and CCI-led cost savings more than offset cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges. Brand marketing investments, as planned, were 10% lower in the quarter, following an 18% consumer segment increase in the fourth quarter of last year.\nFor the full year, we increased our brand marketing investments 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 16% or 15% in constant currency. Higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by the cost pressures in this segment, unfavorable product mix and costs related to supply chain investments.\nAcross both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERP program was offset by lower COVID-19 costs compared to last year. As seen on Slide 29, adjusted gross profit margin declined 150 basis points, driven primarily by the net impact of cost pressures we are experiencing and the phase-in of our pricing actions. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 70 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth and the reduction in brand marketing I just mentioned. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of 80 basis points, as we had expected.\nFor the fiscal year, adjusted gross profit margin declined 140 basis points, primarily driven by the cost pressures we experienced in the second half of the year and the lag in pricing. Adjusted operating income grew 6% in constant currency with the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income increasing 1% and the Flavor Solutions segment, 23%. Both segments were driven by higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by cost pressures and incremental strategic investment spending. Adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points for the fiscal year, driven by the adjusted gross profit margin decline.\nTurning to income taxes. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.3%, compared to 22.9% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20.1%, comparable to 19.9% in 2020. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 5% for the full year.\nThe elimination of higher earnings associated with minority interest impacted both comparisons unfavorably. Our adjusted income from operations was also unfavorably impacted by the elimination of ongoing income from Eastern continents following the sale of our minority stake earlier this year. For the fiscal year, this was partially offset by strong performance from our McCormick to Mexico joint venture.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 32, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.84 from $0.79 in the year ago period. And for the year, adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $3.05 for fiscal year 2021. The increases for both comparisons were driven by higher adjusted operating income attributable to strong sales growth.\nOn Slide 33, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $828 million. The decrease from last year was primarily due to the higher use of cash associated with working capital and the payment of transaction and integration costs. The working capital comparison includes the impact of higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues as well as buffer against cost volatility.\nWe've returned $363 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $278 million for capital expenditures in 2021. Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. For example, our new U.K. flavor solutions manufacturing facility, our ERP business transformation, additional hot sauce capacity in the U.S. in our new U.S. Northeast distribution center. In 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2021 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth.\nWe expect 2022 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.\nNow turning to our 2022 financial outlook on Slide 34. We are well positioned for another strong year of growth and performance in 2022. We are projecting strong top line and operating performance with earnings growth partially offset by a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 1 percentage point unfavorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.\nOn the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 4% to 6%. As Lawrence mentioned, we are taking further pricing actions in 2022, and as a result, expect pricing to be a significant driver of our growth. We expect volume and product mix to be impacted by elasticities, although at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. Our volume and product mix will also continue to be impacted by our pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio.\nOur 2022 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between comparable to 2021 to 50 basis points lower than 2021. This adjusted gross margin compression reflects the anticipated impact of a mid-teens increase in cost inflation, an unfavorable impact of sales mix between segments, a favorable impact from pricing and CCI-led cost savings.\nAs a reminder, we price to offset dollar cost increases. We do not margin up. This has a dilutive impact on our adjusted gross margin and is the primary driver of our projected compression. We expect to grow our adjusted operating income 8% to 10% in constant currency, which reflects our robust operating momentum, a reduction in COVID-19-related costs and our continuing investment in ERP business transformation. This projection includes inflationary pressure in the mid-teens, a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million.\nOur cost savings target reflects the challenges of realizing commodity and packaging cost savings in the current inflationary environment. Importantly, we believe there continues to be a long runway to achieve cost savings in 2022 and beyond.\nBased on the expected timing of certain items, we expect our profit growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our additional 2022 pricing actions are expected to be phased in during the second quarter. Cost inflation will have a more significant impact in the first half of 2022 as cost pressures accelerated in the back half of last year. We also expect our ERP investment to be higher earlier in the year versus 2021.\nAs a reminder, we are also lapping a very strong business performance in the first quarter of 2021. Our 2022 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be 22% to 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2021 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 3%.\nOur 2022 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong operating profit growth of 8% to 10% in constant currency, partially offset by the tax headwind I just mentioned. This results in an increase of 4% to 6%, or 5% to 7% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 is $3.17 to $3.22, compared to $3.05 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021.\nIn summary, we are well positioned with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies to drive another year of strong growth and performance.\n\nLawrence E. Kurzius\n\nChairman, President & CEO, McCormick & Company, Incorporated\n\nNow that Mike Has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 35.\nWe drove record sales growth in 2021. Our strong operating performance underscores the strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the resilience of our employees. We achieved our 1-year Cholula and FONA acquisition plans. Cholula and FONA have proven to be fantastic additions to our portfolio. We have a demonstrated history of managing through short-term pressures on driving growth, as we did in the fourth quarter. McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of the environment.\nWe have a strong foundation. We are in attractive categories, and we're capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that are in our favor. We are confident that our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we will drive another year of strong growth in 2022 and build value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to your questions."

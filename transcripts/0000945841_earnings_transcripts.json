Additionally, we have provided a presentation summarizing key points from our press release and today's call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website.\nWe will begin today's call with comments from Peter Arvan, our President and CEO.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning, everyone. I am excited to share that our teams have maintained the momentum we established in the second quarter, delivering another solid performance in Q3. Thanks to their hard work and dedication. We continue to drive growth with top line sales up 1% and gross margin expansion of 50 basis points. This was fueled by consistent maintenance activity and encouraging signs of stabilization in both new pool construction and remodel. I'm also pleased to see that we achieved year-over-year growth in building materials for the first time since Q3 of 2022 driven by improvements in remodel activity and share gain.\nAs you know, we have continued innovating and investing in our POOL360 applications. And I'm pleased to say that our adoption rate of these industry-leading tools continues to grow as our customers realize their full potential. Building on these successes, we recently shared our strategic road map for the next year and beyond with the entire management team at our international sales conference, and their excitement was palpable. The innovative products and ambitious growth plans we unveiled are already gathering a buzz and our teams are ready to hit the ground running as new initiatives start rolling out immediately.\nWe're focused on key areas of our business where we know we can win. This forward-looking approach not only positions us to close 2025 with momentum, but also lays a strong foundation for an even more dynamic 2026. Looking at the macroeconomic environment, uncertainty around tariffs and elevated borrowing rates continue to weigh on consumer sentiment and limit discretionary demand, particularly for pool projects that require financing. While we observed overall permit data down mid-single digits year-over-year through August with considerable variability across the country, recent easing of interest rate policy offers a promising path forward towards relief.\nFor clarity here, we believe it will take further reductions to bring borrowing rates to a level that will motivate potential entry-level pool owners to build. Despite these challenges, however, our new pool construction sales have outperformed industry permit data indicating continuous share expansion. On the remodel side, consumers remain focused on essential repairs and targeted improvements rather than large-scale upgrades. In response, our teams are leveraging our robust product portfolio, our strong private label offerings and enhanced technology while partnering with vendors to deliver innovative solutions and drive future growth. Overall, I am more than confident in our team's ability to adapt, execute and position us for long-term success.\nNow I will walk through our third quarter results. We reported $1.5 billion in net sales, up 1%, building on the growth we generated during peak season. Maintenance product sales performed well, particularly parts and private label chemical volumes. As mentioned, we saw growth in building materials used in new construction and remodel projects. mid-season price increases created a slight lift on top line, but were diluted some by chemical deflation. Related to our geographic markets, Florida produced 1% growth with Texas flat and California and Arizona each down 3%.\nFlorida remained steady across our product categories and leads the country with new pools being built in 2025. And while flat, Texas showed sequential improvement compared to recent quarters. New pool builds in Texas remain pressured, but continued to improve throughout the year and maintenance-related product sales showed resilience. In California, we see continued pressure on new pool build, particularly in areas affected by recent wildfires. Arizona showed some deceleration in permits compared to earlier this year, but we believe this may be related to timing versus reversion, while maintenance held up for both California and Arizona during the quarter.\nIn Europe, net sales decreased 1% for the quarter in local currency and increased 6% in U.S. dollar. Similar to last quarter, we saw growth in the southern countries while impacts from political strain and related consumer uncertainty pressured sales in France. For Horizon, net sales increased 3% in the quarter, supported by solid maintenance growth and improvement in sales for outdoor living products like landscape lighting, hardscapes and synthetic turf.\nShifting to product categories. Total chemical sales declined 4% this quarter, reflecting some additional deflation. Overall, I consider the demand for chemicals and our performance to be stable. Our private label offerings generated volume growth during the quarter, showing that our teams are being successful in showing the power of our brands and the innovative products that we offer. With our new product showroom displays and marketing support, our customers continue to see strength of our value proposition, and this bodes well for the upcoming selling season.\nBuilding Materials sales increased 4%, again driven by our expansive private label offering and elevated customer experience. We recently rebranded NPT, formerly National Pool Tile to National Pool trends to align our brand name and marketing efforts to highlight our many offerings. The new name brings greater clarity to our value proposition, showing NPT as our customers' partner for complete backyard transformations using our tile pool finish decking to name a few. Our premier product offering, product sales specialists and consumer showrooms offer a one-of-a-kind customer experience, and it is shown in our results. Equipment sales, which excludes cleaners increased 4% during the quarter, mostly reflecting benefit from price and steady replacement volume for critical components.\nTurning to end markets. Our commercial sales increased 2% in the third quarter, showing steady momentum from a strategic focus area. We continue to make investments in our team during the quarter and created greater connections to key designers and builders to better support commercial aquatic projects. Sales to our independent retail customers declined 3% and chemical deflation created mild headwinds here, while DIY consumers continue to be hesitant with discretionary purchases like cleaners and above-ground pools, spas and some equipment.\nFor our PinchoPenney franchise group, represented -- sales represented our franchisee sales to their end customers declined 1% during the quarter. Also of note, we have not seen any meaningful shift between do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers. For covering progress on our initiatives, I want to briefly highlight gross margin ahead of Melanie's prepared remarks. I'm extremely pleased with the team's effort to expand gross margin by 50 basis points this quarter. Although the operating environment remains challenging, our teams continue to deliver by making strategic and efficient supply chain choices refining our network and applying disciplined buying and sales strategies, all while providing an unparalleled customer experience.\nA key investment area and differential year for POOLCORP is our technology suite. POOL360 is the largest and most comprehensive set of customer-facing tools in the industry and our adoption rate continues to grow. For the quarter, sales through the tool represented an all-time high of 17% of our total sales for the third quarter, which demonstrates the customers' desire for technology that creates value. While still in the early stages, this growth shows the output of our technology investment over the past few years. Our targeted spend in our digital ecosystem is driving technology adoption and fueling not only growth in private label chemicals but also service and traditional B2B offerings.\nOur deliberate investments in innovation and enhancements of our tools have been key drivers of Pool 360's impressive sales results. These advancements empower us to support higher sales efficiently while creating capacity for future growth. Increased POOL360 transaction adoption delivers significant benefits, not only strengthening our margins, but also elevating the customer experience, accelerating private label and exclusive product growth and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage. We completed 1 acquisition during the quarter, adding 2 locations in key markets. Additionally, we opened 1 greenfield bringing our year-to-date opening to 6 sales centers we remain on track for additional openings in the fourth quarter to reach 8 to 10 new sales centers for the quarter, adding to our Arizona presence and bringing the pinch of Penney locations to 303 franchise stores.\nTouching on guidance. As we exit the cool season and enter the fourth quarter, we expect full year sales performance to be relatively flat to up slightly. We are confirming our diluted EPS guidance for the year to a range of $10.81 to $11.31 updated to reflect the $0.11 in realized ASU benefits year-to-date. At POOLCORP, our relentless pursuit of continuous improvement is driving us to lead the way on innovation across products and processes. Recognizing the industry's need for fresh ideas and solutions, we are making a new and intentional push to discover, shape and bring new innovation to market for our customers and as the strongest channel to market for our supplier partners by identifying emerging opportunities and thoughtfully [Audio Gap] industry while growing sales, expand margins and generate strong cash flows and delivering exceptional returns for our shareholders.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for her detailed commentary. Melanie?\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete. For the third quarter, we saw year-over-year improvement in sales. driven by increased maintenance on the installed base, favorable pricing and market share gains, while noting that the impact from lower discretionary spend levels was less of a drag on a comparable basis, compared to the third quarter of prior year.\nDuring the quarter, we realized a 3% benefit from pricing, reflecting the full quarter impact of price realization on the mid-season vendor price increases implemented in April and May. Trichlor selling prices continue to be impacted by the lower level of spend in the industry and somewhat offset our positive price realization in the quarter. Throughout the quarter, in certain markets, we saw some positive months where there were permit increases year-over-year from the prior period. However, in total, year-to-date permits remained below last year's level.\nOur estimate of new pool construction remained flat to slightly down, consistent with our expectations included in last quarter. Overall, the lower level of discretionary spend had a 2% impact on our sales for the quarter. similar to the impact we saw in the second quarter, with both Horizon and Europe having positive sales growth in the quarter. As Pete mentioned, we added 2 new sales centers through acquisition during the quarter, as well as on newly acquired location in October. These additions did not have a significant impact on our base business results, so we have not reported base business performance separately for the quarter.\nOur gross margin in third quarter was 29.6%, representing a 50 basis point improvement over prior year. This improvement was driven by favorable pricing, successful supply chain initiatives and an increase in sales of our expanded private label offering. All areas that we continue to focus on and excel in despite the persistent impact of the macro environment and lower levels of consumer discretionary spend. The sequential change from the second quarter margin is consistent with our typical seasonal trends.\nOperating expenses increased 5%, slightly ahead of the quarter-over-quarter changes we reported during the first half of the year. This increase includes the impact for our cumulative new greenfield locations that were not open in both periods. Also, as Steve described, the positive results we have seen with our expanded POOL360 initiatives we accelerated some incremental technology costs during the quarter because we believe that this further differentiates us from our competition and will yield better sales and operating leverage in the future.\nOperating income improved $2 million over prior year and was $178 million for the quarter. Interest expense of $12 million continues to compare favorably to prior year. Our effective tax rate was 23.5% for the quarter compared to 23.4% in prior year. ASU benefits contributed $0.01 in both periods presented. We generated diluted earnings per share of $3.40, up 4% from the $3.27 we realized in the third quarter of last year.\nNext, I'll discuss our balance sheet, cash flows and capital allocation. We finished September with inventory balances of $1.2 billion, up 4%, our lowest level of inventory we expect during the year as we exit the season. The increase includes product inflation and also includes stocking for our 9 new locations, including Beta greenfields and the acquisition completed during the quarter. Total debt of $1.1 billion resulted in a leverage of [ 1.58 ] remaining at the low end of our stated target range of 1.5 to 2x. We generated $286 million in cash flow from operations year-to-date, compared to $487 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to higher tax payments and investments in working capital. We expect to achieve our current year target of converting 90% to 100% of net income into cash flow from operations, which includes a deferred tax payment from prior year.\nWe continue to execute on our share repurchases opportunistically under the authorization provided by the Board. We have completed $164 million of share repurchases through the third quarter with an additional $20 million through our earnings call ahead of $159 million through third quarter of last year. We have $493 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. -- in out the year, we continue to expect full year sales to be relatively flat compared to the prior year, with 1 less selling day. This outlook reflects a modest decline in discretionary spending compared to last year. offset by positive impact from maintenance growth and pricing realization. In the prior year, we've ended 1% in the fourth quarter from weather-related hurricane activity, which at this time is not expected to reoccur in the fourth quarter.\nOur full year gross margin rate is forecasted to be similar to the prior year, which, on an ongoing basis reflects improvement as the prior year rate included a nonrecurring import tax benefit recorded in first quarter of prior year. This would include some improvement on a year-over-year basis in gross margins in the fourth quarter. While customer mix remains less favorable, these impacts are being offset by growth in private label sales ongoing supply chain improvements and pricing benefits. Our estimate for full year operating expenses remain in line with last quarter, with an expected annual increase over prior year of approximately 3%.\nThis reflects productivity improvements, offsetting inflationary cost pressures with increases attributable to our investments in greenfield locations and our focus on technology initiatives. Forecast for interest expense estimated tax rate and share count for the full year are included in our quarterly earnings presentation posted on our website. There have been no significant changes to these estimates since last quarter, with interest expense updated to include share repurchase activity. As we typically see, our third quarter tax rate is lower than the annual rate due to discrete timing differences, and we expect our fourth quarter rate to be in line with the first and second quarter rate.\nWe are confirming our diluted EPS range of $10.81 to $11.31 including $0.11 in ASU tax benefits realized year-to-date, of which we reported an additional $0.01 in third quarter that is now included in the range. I am pleased with our team's ability to perform and remain focused on our internal strategic initiatives, which have delivered tangible results year-to-date. This highlights the strength of our team and the significant value that industry-specific talent contributes across the outdoor living value chain. While we continue to manage the business effectively, we are also investing in our key strategic growth areas to create long-term value for our shareholders.\nI will now turn the call over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings conference call.\nOur discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2025 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures included in our press release are posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. We have included a presentation on our investor website to summarize key points from our press release and call comments.\nPeter Arvan, our President and CEO, will begin today's call with his comments.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning, everyone.\nWe were very pleased to see positive sales growth in the second quarter, along with stable gross margins and steady operating margins versus the prior year. Given all the challenges affecting the broader economy and industry dynamics, I consider these results to be very solid. They are a testament to the team and reflect our ability to deliver outstanding value and exceptional service to our customers, further reinforcing POOLCORP's leadership position in the industry.\nThe second quarter started off similar to how we exited the first quarter. We saw encouraging trends in most areas of the business through April and early May, unfavorable weather conditions in certain markets through mid-June, tempered demand but turned more favorable towards the end of the quarter, helping us post a modest sales gain.\nThe macro uncertainty and constantly developing policy decisions, combined with no signs of interest rate easing continue to pressure new pool construction and larger renovation projects. Despite this, our construction-related sales fared better than the permit data would have suggested. As you all know, permit data indicates that new pool construction is down high single digit, but it's still too early to call the year. It is worth noting that the second quarter trends improved from the first quarter, but still represent a headwind on a year-over-year basis. The remodel activity we expect will be modestly better than the new construction activity for the balance of the year. The aging installed base necessitates certain remodel and renovation projects each year, creating ongoing demand. We believe that larger renovation projects in the most recent quarters have been split into phases, allowing consumers to reduce their spend per project or spread out the spend over a longer time frame.\nThe second quarter results, we reported $1.8 billion in net sales, up 1%, reflecting our team's effort in executing on strategic areas of our business. Maintenance products performed well, including strong growth in our private label chemical products. On sales related to new construction and renovation activities, we saw improving trends during the quarter, creating less of a drag on sales than in recent quarters. Tariff-driven price increases had a modest impact on the quarter due to timing and was somewhat offset by the [ inflation ] in our commodity categories.\nRegionally, we saw distinct trends across our 4 major U.S. markets. Florida and Arizona each delivered solid 2% sales growth for the quarter, outperforming national averages. In both states, ongoing population growth in migration and favorable weather patterns fueled continued demand across the maintenance, renovation and new construction categories. Our strong local presence, robust distribution network and targeted marketing initiatives have kept us top of mind with cool professionals allowing us to expand our customer base and capture additional market share. Additionally, franchise growth and emerging builder partnerships in these states further strengthens our position for long-term success.\nTexas and California continue to experience this challenge in new pool construction with sales down 2% and 3%, respectively, reflecting macroeconomic headwinds and tempered consumer confidence. However, maintenance and aftermarket sales in these markets remained resilient, highlighting the value of our established installed base and trusted service partnerships. Our teams in Texas and California are focused on supporting remodel activity and enhancing customer support to ensure we are well positioned for recovery as local economies and construction activities rebound in the future. We remain confident that our disciplined investment and regionally tailored strategies will enable us to continue outperforming the broader market across all our core geographies. Additionally, we were encouraged by the sequential improvement in permit data for Texas as the quarter developed, although it is still negative.\nIn Europe, net sales increased 2% for the quarter in local currency and 7% in U.S. dollar. We saw sales growth in most European economies, particularly in the southern counties while France dealt with colder temperatures but showed some improvement in June. We are encouraged that this trend for Europe continued into July. For Horizon, net sales declined 2% in the quarter. Maintenance product sales were solid. However, weakness in larger development areas -- I'm sorry, larger development-related construction projects muted those gains. Pricing, for the most part, has stabilized in the market, and we are encouraged with the month of day July sales trends.\nLooking to our product sales mix, chemical sales grew 1% despite price deflation and weather headwinds in certain markets, highlighting the power of our brands and expanding offerings for our customers. When combined with our POOL360 water test platform, it is a very strong chemical offering that will continue to take share as our brands grow. Customer feedback is excellent, and our confidence in this area and our entire retail support offering is strong.\nBuilding Materials sales declined 1%, a sequential improvement from what we saw in the first quarter and much of last year and better than the underlying trends would suggest. The results highlight the value of our NPT branded offering, improving trend -- including improved trends in our proprietary pool finish and the effectiveness of our consumer-facing showrooms and refreshed dealer showrooms that support our customers and enhance the pool owners design experience.\nEquipment sales, which include cleaners increased 1% during the quarter -- which exclude cleaners increased 1% during the quarter, reflecting modest price realization and stable replacement volumes mitigating the year-over-year decrease in new construction units. For context, the most recent price increase went into effect late in the quarter.\nLooking at our end markets. Our commercial sales increased 5% in the second quarter, supported by the investments we have made in developing our commercial team, designating commercial warehouses and expanding start-to-finish project capabilities.\nSales to our independent retail customers declined 3% in the quarter, showing a similar cadence during the quarter on what we saw in overall sales, but with greater headwinds -- weather headwinds on our DIY maintenance in May and early June, considering our retailers heavy concentration in northern markets. We saw much improved retail sales in these markets in the latter half of June. For our Pinch A Penny franchise group, representing our franchisees' sales to their end customers, sales increased 1% for the quarter, reflecting their best-in-class offering and customer experience while also noting their Sunbelt concentration with less weather headwinds this quarter.\nNow let me comment on gross margin results. As you saw, the business posted a solid 30% gross margin for the quarter, consistent with the same period last year. I'm pleased with our team's collective effort and focus in this critical area. We have seen historically downward cycles place additional pressure on winning business. And through collaborating with our supply chain teams and [ pricing ] specialists and making smart decisions on the ground, we've been able to maintain gross margins in line with prior year in a very challenging and dynamic environment. Melanie will cover this in more detail in her prepared remarks.\nOur continued investment in digital innovation are paying off with POOL360 platform transactions now represent 17% of net sales, up from 14.5% last year, reflecting enthusiast customer adoption and creating durable competitive advantages that are hard to replicate. We celebrated the opening of our 450th branch during the quarter, strategic openings in the market with higher pool densities continue to be the driver in further building out our footprint and positioning ourselves for further share expansion. We opened 2 new locations during the quarter and 4 year-to-date. Our Pinch A Penny franchise network added 5 new stores in the quarter, including the first new store in North Carolina and increasing the Pinch A Penny locations to 302 franchised stores.\nAs we move through the peak season, we expect sales in the back half of the year to be modestly up with the full year performance anticipated to be relatively flat. In the absence of an interest rate cut or external catalyst, we are updating our diluted earnings per share guidance for the year to a range of $10.80 to $11.30, which includes a $0.10 realized benefit from ASU year-to-date. We remain highly confident in the long-term fundamentals of our industry with the demographic trends, desirability of at-home leisure and continued need for maintenance and renovation supporting ongoing demand, we believe that when the macro backdrop improves and the housing turnover resumes, new pool construction and renovation activity will accelerate and [ footwork ] will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on that growth.\nFinally, I want to thank the entire POOLCORP team for your dedication and adaptability. Your commitment enables us to deliver exceptional value and reliability to our customers and partners and importantly, drive success for our shareholders, we look forward to the opportunities ahead.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for her detailed commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning again, everyone.\nWe continue to see robust maintenance activity, benefiting from both volume and industry pricing. While new construction permits are improving in several key markets, we have not yet seen a consistently positive trends across all regions. We are closely monitoring these variations and remain prepared to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. Both the traditional pool season price increases implemented earlier in the year and the subsequent late April, early May price increases enacted by certain vendors to react to higher expected tariffs have passed through and have been accepted into the marketplace. Although initially up for discussion, there was not a third wave of June price increase that impacted our cost to date. Pricing for the quarter benefited sales 2% to 3% but continues to be offset by 1% related to chemical and commodity selling prices. Chemicals, specifically trichlor, are seeing selling prices less than what we saw in the second quarter of prior year. This pricing, although lower than last year, still represents a significant premium over 2020. We saw volume increases, in particular, in our private label chemical sales activity. Negative comparisons from discretionary spend leveled out with just a 2% impact overall on the sales for the quarter.\nAs Pete highlighted, our investments at our MPT showroom continue to pay dividends and showcasing for our builder customers and homeowners, the many options where our unique MPT branded tile decking and pull finished products are available to customize their backyards. Our resulting building material sales decrease of 1% is outpacing the market activity compared to permit trends.\nI'm very pleased to be reporting a positive comp sales quarter. We continue to showcase our ability to get pricing in the market as a result of both our service levels and our focus on the aftermarket, resulting in a 1% sales benefit. Impacts of discretionary spend in remodel and new pool construction were a 2% headwind, but again improving from a 3% impact in the first quarter. We were encouraged to see the positive results in Europe and better horizon trends. Gross margins of 30% for the quarter remained strong. We continue to see our internal initiatives related to supply chain improvements, private label growth and effective pricing enabling us to maintain margins even with lower building material product sales and impact from customer mix. We saw normalized second quarter seasonal margin benefit. We reported a 1% increase in operating expenses for the second quarter. Through our earnings release date, we have now opened 8 new locations since the same time last year, contributing around 1% to the expense increase with our disciplined operations offsetting other cost increase drivers. Our volume-related expenses for both compensation and freight remained very well managed. During the quarter, we were able to maintain expenses as a percentage of revenue of 14.7%. We realized operating income of $273 million, an improvement compared to $271 million in prior year. Interest expense of $12.2 million represented a reduction of $1.8 million, altogether generated diluted earnings per share of $5.17 compared to $4.99, which is up 4% from second quarter of last year.\nSummarizing our second quarter results, we are pleased with the positive signs related to discretionary spend in the pool and outdoor living space and our ability to utilize our technology tools to grow our private label chemical sales while leveraging our network to generate positive income over prior year.\nMoving on to our balance sheet. We finished the quarter with inventory balances of $1.3 billion, which is up 3% from the prior year. This increase includes new product offerings and supply chain actions to stock our network location for the season. We expect that our inventory patterns for the rest of the year would follow a typical seasonal pattern with balances drawn down through the third quarter, which will position us to evaluate our needs for the 2026 season during the fall and winter early by offering. Inventory days on hand improved 1.5 days from prior year second quarter. Our 1.47 leverage ratio remains at the lower end of our targeted leverage range. In early July, we amended and extended our term loan facility to increase capacity, lengthen the maturity and obtain more favorable borrowing terms. Cash flow for the quarter remains in line with our annual expectation of achieving 90% to 100% of net income and cash flow from operations, weighted more heavily to the second half of the year from a cash generation standpoint.\nConsistent with first quarter 2025, we increased the pace at which we have completed share repurchases, purchasing $104 million during the quarter, an increase of $36 million in the prior year second quarter. Year-to-date, we have exceeded prior year repurchases by $76 million and have [ $560 million ] remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nAs we look out over the second half of the year, on our first quarter call, we referenced an expected future data during equipment cost increase. With the changing tariff landscape, we do not actually see an increase in cost with a June effective date. However, there were some additional vendors over the initial group of 20 that did push through May effective price increases.\nSales for the full year now are expected to be relatively flat with last year, reflecting some pricing benefit from the April-May price increases, but no significant change in discretionary spending from current levels for the rest of the year. Although trends have improved throughout the year, based on the activity to date, we do not anticipate a pace that would provide a significant benefit to 2025. Gross margin rate is also expected to be in line with the prior year full year, which would represent an improvement after considering the nonrecurring positive import tax included in 2024. Execution on realization of tariff-driven price increases and supply chain improvements are net positive that are offsetting any impact from product and customer mix. As you have come to expect from us, SG&A expenses will continue to reflect productivity to offset inflationary increases and be adjusted real time based on actual volumes at each sale center location. The year-over-year increases in the back half are expected to be higher than the current quarter, likely ranging from a 2% to 3% increase for the full year an improvement from the 3% previously estimated and will include the cost spent on the new sales centers we will open this year.\nWe do not have any significant changes to our expectations regarding interest expense and our estimated tax rate. We have included those ranges along with our forecasted share count as part of our quarterly earnings presentation posted to the website. The update on our interest expense range to be $46 million to $47 million, includes the incremental share repurchases we have done year-to-date. Having completed our largest quarter of the year, we have updated our expected diluted EPS range to $10.80 to $11.30, including the $0.10 ASU tax benefit recognized year-to-date. We continue to focus on running a strong business through this period of higher interest rates and reduced consumer spending. Our actions on sales that support market share gains and on our gross margins holding up in a slower demand environment, suggest strong fundamentals that will support the business in discretionary growth returns. Our capital allocation, expense management and strategic actions remain focused on long-term profitability.\nThanks, everyone, for listening in on today's call. We will now begin our Q&A session."

A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. We have also included a presentation on our investor website to summarize key points from our press release and call comments.\nWe will begin today with comments from Peter Arvan, our President and CEO.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier this morning, we reported our first quarter results and affirmed our full year guidance for 2025. While the first quarter started off with some challenging weather in key markets, we began to see some improvement in conditions in March. Although also meaningful this year, the Easter holiday occurred 3 weeks later than last year falling into the second quarter versus the first.\nAs expected, our maintenance product sales performed well during the quarter and so far [indiscernible] into the season. The recurring nondiscretionary demand of these products is durable in all economic cycles, and we believe we can continue to achieve above-market growth based on our strategic initiatives around customer experience, private label products, POOL360 and our expanded footprint.\nAt the time of our last call, there appeared to be some signs of macro stability approaching, but we have seen the challenging economic environment continue to weigh on new pool construction and to a lesser degree, renovation activities. Our dealers are reporting that the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment and persistently high interest rates is causing a wait-and-see pattern in demand for large discretionary purchases.\nBy and large, they are reporting that inquiries are steady, but time to contract is still protracted. In aggregate, the permit data in the first quarter was softer than 2024, which is somewhat surprising given the more optimistic outlook prior to the recent tariff actions.\nWe are hopeful that as things settle, consumer confidence will help stabilize that. When we compare our new pool construction related sales to the permit data, almost without exception, we are outperforming the market, which gives us confidence that our overall value proposition to our customers continues to help us gain share in this area. Remodel activity will continue, but there may be some deferrals of discretionary remodel and replacement or reconfiguration of plans to complete projects in phases.\nDespite these persistent conditions, we are encouraged by improving trends in our top line performance, and we expect our initiatives will allow us to perform better than the market in all areas of our business as we push through the transition to a more normal industry environment. Another topic we would like to add some color on prior to discussing the quarter is our exposure to tariffs and how they are affecting the business as of the latest information that we have.\nOur exposure to direct imports in total is relatively small and would amount to less than 1% of revenue. For clarification, this includes some building material and maintenance products. Chemicals as a category, have little exposure because of domestic supply arrangements or exemptions. The biggest tariff impact in our business is being felt in the equipment area where the manufacturers have exposure for whole goods or components that are impacting their costs.\nSince our last earnings call, our largest equipment vendors announced and implemented an in-season price increase that range from 3% to 4% that took effect in April to address the March tariff announcements, and we increased our selling prices accordingly. We observed similar patterns during the pandemic years and those increases passed through the channel with no reversals. Our current thinking is this will be the case this time as well.\nIn addition to that, on Tuesday of this week, an additional 4% increase was announced by Pentair that will take effect on June 2 of this year. We will, in the normal course, raise our prices accordingly as these and future increases are announced and come into effect. Melanie will add additional color in her remarks and how we see these impacting our results. No doubt, we are living in a dynamic market condition, but the team is focused on execution and is very experienced.\nNext, let me turn to our first quarter results. We reported $1.1 billion in net sales as our teams continue to execute on our strategic priorities. First quarter sales were down 4% versus last year, but down 2% on a same selling day basis, a similar improving trend to what we saw in the end of 2024. After a challenging January and February with tougher weather comps, we saw overall top line growth in March.\nMaintenance product sales performed well with Chemicals volume and revenue growth, including double-digit growth in our private label chemical products. On new construction and remodel, we saw the continued effects of tight discretionary spending under the current macro backdrop, but this area provided less of a drag on top line than we have seen in recent quarters.\nNext, I will recap the P&L. Gross margins came in at 29.2% versus the 30.2% in the first quarter of 2024. Recall that last year, we realized a 110 basis point benefit from an import tax accrual reversal. Without that benefit, our prior year gross margin was closer to 29.1%, reflecting some year-over-year improvement largely driven by our pricing optimization and supply chain initiatives. Competitive pricing became more prevalent in the first quarter similar to what we observed at this time last year and typical for this time of year, however, using price appears to be more -- a more pronounced tactic by our competitors of late.\nWe evaluate these circumstances on a market-by-market basis and respond as we feel appropriate on a market-by-market basis. Both our field and support to manage controllable expenses and even with inflationary increases and investments in our network expansion, operating expenses increased only 2% during the first quarter. We generated operating income of $77.5 million and operating margin of 7.2%, reflecting structural improvements in the first quarter operating margin as compared to our pre-pandemic first quarter operating margins that range from 5.7% to 6.5%.\nWe generated diluted earnings per share of $1.42, including a $0.10 ASU tax benefit. Covering sales in more detail. By major geographic market sales increased 2% in Arizona, came in flat for California and declined 1% in Florida and 11% in Texas. As we mentioned on our year-end call, we saw challenging weather in January and February in varying markets, which notably impacted sales in Texas and to a lesser extent, some areas in Florida.\nAgain, we did see improvement in March as total company revenues turned positive in contrast to January and February and continues in April. In Europe, net sales declined 4% in local currency and 6% in U.S. dollars. As it continues to work through the macro uncertainties but is mostly holding the improved trends we began to see in the back half of 2024. While France, our largest presence in Europe sees pressure from tough market conditions on new construction, we see positive trends in Spain and Portugal signaling a solid setup for the season in those markets.\nFor Horizon, net sales declined 4% in the quarter. While commodity pricing has shown sign of stabilization, deflation impacted Horizon results by 4% on a year-over-year basis, most notably in PBC. Volumes came in flat overall for the period, tempered by weather and a soft macro. Maintenance-related sales are helping offset pressure on both commercial and residential irrigation, but our team remains encouraged by our pipeline of projects heading into the second quarter.\nRelated to our product sales mix, chemical sales were up 1% for the quarter, with volume increasing as well as total sales. Our -- as we observed last year, market prices declined during the first quarter compared to year-end, but we believe pricing will rationalize further as the industry enters the busier selling season. We remain focused on gaining shelf space and dealer stores with our best-in-class chemical programs, converting dealers chemical lines is a strategic focus area for our business, but it is a longer-than-normal selling process.\nOur success so far in this area is encouraging. Building Materials sales declined 5%, a sequential improvement from what we saw in the fourth quarter and much of last year. The improvement in our NPT branded product finish pool finish and tile, particularly in a tight environment, highlights the power of our offering and the unmatched value seen by our customers.\nEquipment sales, which excludes cleaners, declined 4% during the quarter, following spikes from repair activities in much of Florida during the first quarter of 2024. Our inventory is well positioned for the season as our early buy terms allow for delivery from our vendors in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of each year based on manufacturers capacity. Aftermarket demand remains healthy. Automation and innovation remain top priorities for homeowners and our ability to partner with our vendors and utilize our expansive network to effectively bring those products to market, highlighting the strength and value of our team.\nLooking at our end markets. Our commercial business sales increased 7% in the first quarter. We are pleased with the continued progress in this area as we leverage knowledge gained from recent acquisitions to align with our sales force, leverage brand names and expand our warehouse distribution capabilities and enhance our expertise serving this robust market. Sales to our independent retail customers declined 1% in the first quarter, showing some improvement trends ahead of the peak season.\nFor Pinch a Penny franchise -- for the Pinch a Penny franchisees group, representing our franchisee sales to their end customers. Sales came in flat for the quarter, showing some impacts from varying Texas and Florida weather patterns and the normalization after hurricane repairs in the fourth quarter. Collectively, these results show the stability of the maintenance market and our progress to expand our capabilities to serve the key do-it-yourself end markets.\nFor POOL360, orders processed continued to expand at close to -- or continue to expand, and we're close to 13% of total sales for the first quarter of [ 2020 ] -- for the first quarter growing from 11% in the first quarter of last year, utilize the opportunities that the first quarter offers through industry shows and retail events to educate our consumers and potential customers on these value-added tools.\nAlong with growth in orders process, we observed double-digit growth in our private label chemical sales, further highlighting our progress from the streamlined abilities of the POOL360 water test and POOL360 service to direct our customers to our private label solutions driving growth and productivity for our dealers and for POOLCORP. We continue to expand our wholesale distribution network, opening 2 new locations in the first quarter, bringing our total locations to just shy of 450.\nOur Pinch a Penny franchise network added its first store in Arizona, positioning us to expand into this key do-it-yourself market. With 3 stores opening this quarter, we are now coming close to 300 Pinch a Penny franchisees. As we enter the industry's seasonally most significant time of year, we confirm our full year EPS guide in a range of $11.10 to $11.60, including the 10% -- including an updated $0.10 estimated benefit from ASU.\nThrough our thoughtful and innovative investments, we believe we have positioned ourselves to capture more available demand than anyone else in the industry during the most critical part of the season. Our teams will focus on providing the best customer experience while leaning into advanced POOL360 offerings to help our customers grow their business. Tools remain highly sought after with continued concentration towards the higher end.\nRemodeling activity will continue despite some projects being spaced out over multiple projects or longer time spans. Through our robust distribution network, we will continue to focus on best serving both the professional contractors and servicers as well as the retailers to also reach the do-it-yourself pool owner. We will utilize our 4 domestic central shipping locations to create supply chain efficiencies and fulfill demand needs better than anyone in the industry, benefited by our ample cash flows and disciplined capital allocation practices, we will invest in strategic growth and shareholder returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nThe seasonally significant second quarter underway, our teams will be relentless in providing an industry-leading customer experience and improving on capacity creation through utilizing of our innovative technology solutions, best-in-class team, unmatched value proposition and continued investment in the industry that builds upon itself.\nUnlike a year ago, this year, we have an additional in-season price increases that will help offset the slower start to the year on discretionary spending. I would like to thank our POOLCORP team, who I can always count on our -- to operate on our initiatives, particularly well in this key time of year. They continue to battle and win in a challenging market in a challenging market and through our teaming with supply partners, creating value for our customers. I look forward to seeing what they will accomplish during the season.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for her detailed commentary. Melanie?\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete. Exiting the quarter, we saw improved momentum in mark sales, finishing them up on a same-day basis at 2% over prior year. The improvements we saw in March were not enough to cover for the tough weather we saw early in the quarter in January and February, resulting in a 2% decrease on a same selling day basis compared to the prior year for the full quarter. We were successful in the quarter in passing through the vendor price increases that were put in place at the beginning of the year.\nThese previously announced increases were expected to benefit sales by 1% to 2% on an overall product blend, with continued negative 1% impact for chemicals and commodities, netting to an overall plus 1% for pricing in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by our progress on our Chemical business which is a good proxy for over 60% of our sales that are derived from the maintenance of the installed base.\nVolumes increased for these products and benefited total sales for the quarter by an estimated 1%. Discretionary spend in the new construction and remodel areas have still not seen a recovery, resulting in an estimated 3% drag on sales activity. We did see negative comparables and permits across most of our large states, However, the trend continues to improve in some of our key markets.\nSumming up the sales impact for the quarter, we saw a plus 1% on maintenance volumes, plus 2% on realized vendor price increases offset by a negative 1% on pricing impact from chemicals and commodities, a 2% loss on 1 less selling day, a decline of 3% on volumes on sales of discretionary products for new pools and remodel activity, and a 1% impact on sales for declines in Horizon and Europe combined. The first quarter included 1 less selling day than prior year for a total of 1 less selling day for the full year 2025 compared to 2024.\nOur gross margin for the quarter finished at 29.2% or 10 basis points higher than prior year when considering the 110 basis points positive impact recognized in first quarter 2024 related to import taxes. We realized benefits during the quarter from our pricing initiatives and supply chain, including higher levels of private label chemical sales with offset from less favorable customer mix.\nIn the current period, with lower discretionary demand, our larger customers are still winning a higher proportion of the business in the market. While this may put some pressure on margins, the stickiness of these larger customers is evident in our ability to capture sales in periods where demand for discretionary product is slower and we are best at serving their broader needs. Early by sales were similar in both periods and they did not have a meaningful impact on margins. Product mix was a slight drag with lower building materials and strong growth in commercial sales, which also had a slight negative margin impact.\nWe saw some instances of aggressive competitive pricing for certain orders that appears to be in response to continued softness in the market. On the margin side, this was the main difference from our initial forecast and diluted some of the benefits we have seen on our internal initiatives. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $235 million, an increase of only 2% over prior year.\nFirst quarter includes the impact of our annual merit increases, continued investments in our technology offerings as well as increased spend for the 6 sales centers operating second quarter of last year. This modest expense increase demonstrates leverage gains from our ongoing capacity creation efforts and disciplined variable cost management.\nOperating income of $78 million was a decrease of [ $31 ] million compared to prior year, including the [ $13 ] million import tax impact that benefited first quarter of 2024. We reduced interest expense by $2.3 million compared to the first quarter of 2024 and reported diluted earnings per share of $1.42 compared to $2.04 in prior year which included an additional $0.09 from ASU and $0.24 for import taxes.\n[ Operationally ], the resulting change in EPS would have been $0.29, primarily driven by top line activity. Overall for the quarter, we realized continuing improvement in sales trends, consist performance in maintenance product categories and strong value growth in private label chemicals driven in part by our POOL360 applications. We also continued to grow both our wholesale distribution sales center network and franchisee store network while executing with strong expense discipline.\nWe continue to benefit from our strong balance sheet position. Our days sales outstanding of 25.9 days reflects an improvement compared to 26.9 days in prior year, reflecting our continued strong credit management process and collections discipline. In view of market conditions, we thoughtfully executed early by ordering to ensure the right inventory was on hand. Inventory balances increased $171 million from year-end as we receive products across our vast footprint to position for sale. The balance at the end of March of $1.46 billion reflects less than the prior year of $1.5 billion for the inventory stocking improvements we have made.\nInventory days on hand improved 3 days from prior year first quarter. We ended the quarter with total debt of $1 billion, debt and interest expense typically increases from first to second quarter as we build inventory for the season and as early by payments are due during the second quarter. Even early in the season, as we increased our inventory position, we have been able to maintain our leverage ratio of 1.47 at the lower end of our target.\nWe reported $27 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter. This year, higher inventory purchases and timing of related payments use incremental cash of $70 million. We also made the payment of the 2024 deferred tax amount, which reflected $68.5 million less in cash flow during the quarter unrelated to the current year activity.\nDuring the quarter, we completed total share repurchases of $56 million, an increase of $40 million over prior year and have $291 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. At our upcoming Board meeting, we will present our request to the Board to increase our authorization so that we have plenty of capacity to continue our opportunistic share repurchase activity within the parameters of our disciplined capital allocation approach.\nMoving into our expectations for the current year. I'll start with the expected impacts to our business of tariffs. We primarily sell our products domestically and so expect that announced tariffs will have a minimal impact on our direct import. Examples of which would be in the tile and maintenance product categories and represent less than 1% of our total annual purchasing activity. Recently announced tariffs, we have received an incremental 3% to 4% price increase from around 20 or so of our vendors.\nAs we have historically, we would expect that those cost increases will be passed on to our dealer customers. We communicate as these increases are announced by our vendors and adjust pricing as quickly as the market circumstances allow. The impact [indiscernible] for the full year. This will increase our pricing benefit to 2% for the annual period.\nOur initial sales guidance are flat to a low single-digit [indiscernible], included 1% to 2% net for pricing volume growth on maintenance and flat discretionary spending. Permit data, a reasonable approximation of new construction activity remains lower than the prior year levels through the end of the first quarter. There has also been a new level of uncertainty in the macro environment since February, including sustained higher interest rates, increased tariffs, a volatile stock market, which we believe could be more impactful to our traditional homeowner demographic.\nWhere our larger customers are confident in a similar number of builds as last year, other dealers in the market are still trying to [indiscernible] season. Again, more visibility in May and June, our 2 largest months of the year, however, at this point, we have considered in our range the possibility that we may still see some negative impact in the current year from lower discretionary spend.\nOur forecasted gross margin range of 29.7% to 30% included our estimates that internal initiatives related to supply chain, pricing and increased private label would make up for the 20 bps of nonrecurring positive import tax benefit included in 2024. At this point in the year, we are not anticipating any significant gross margin benefit recovery from new pool construction and remodel activity, which is a significant component to reach the top end of our 30% gross margin target.\n[indiscernible] that product mix could be a slight drag for the year. Additionally, we have considered that the current market environment may result in a competitive pricing environment, putting pressure on margins outside of just the first quarter. Our forecast for sales considered at the low end, similar discretionary sales levels in [ first ] quarter, offset by the additional 1% tariff pricing.\nAt the midpoint, continued improving trends on discretionary as we have seen late in 2024 and into early 2025 and the additional 1% tariff pricing. Our forecast for margins considered at the low and midpoint, lower sales of higher-margin discretionary products, customer mix skews to larger customers and ongoing market pricing pressure.\nAnd at the top end, a more traditional seasonal recovery of the market pricing. Expenses will continue to be very well managed and in accordance with the trend. Including the investments in the new sales centers and some incremental compensation expense, we expect expenses for the year to increase around over prior year. [indiscernible] are still expected to be around $40 million to $45 million with higher interest expense in the second quarter after payment of early buys, turning lower during the third and fourth quarters as we collect on receivables from seasonal sales activity.\nCash flow in 2025 is expected to be between 90% and 100% of net income and will be impacted by the deferred tax payment made in the first quarter of 2025 related to 2024. Our consistent capital allocation strategy consider a spend of approximately $50 million to $60 million on CapEx for the existing business, including new sales center openings, an estimated $20 million on acquisitions, dividends of around $200 million [indiscernible] the cash to be used for debt paydown and to repurchase shares opportunistically.\nOur annual tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, excluding ASU. This rate is estimated to be [ $0.25 ] during the second and fourth quarters and lower in the third quarter. We are expecting approximately 37.8 million weighted average sales outstanding that will be applied to the net income attributable to common shareholders for the rest of the quarter.\nOur guidance remains unchanged at a diluted EPS range of $11.10 to $11.60, including the $0.10 ASU tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. We have proven our ability to manage the business in a profitable way during various market conditions and external [indiscernible] team provides value to the customers and our vendors thus has a unique ability to outperform the market. The strategic actions we have taken in pricing, the technology and network expansion are showing positive results and position us for strong future performance as industry conditions ultimately normalize capability. Thanks to everyone for participating in today's call. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin our question-and-answer session."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melanie Hart, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2024 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements including management's outlook for 2025 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures included in our press release are posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. We have included a presentation on our Investor Relations website to summarize key points from our press release and call comments.\nPete Arvan, our President and CEO, will begin our call today.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we released our full year and fourth quarter 2024 results, reflecting sales slightly better than our earlier expectations and solid execution by our teams. As construction and remodeling activities remained under pressure, we focused on providing an unmatched customer experience, driving growth in our maintenance business, including double-digit growth in our private label chemical sales and continued development and deployment of our POOL360 ecosystem and tools. We believe that consumer spending on discretionary, especially that which requires financing continues to remain a headwind, while still preliminary, we believe new pool construction will land at approximately 61,000 units for 2024, which equates to a 15% decline in new units compared to last year.\nFrom the Pandemic-driven peak to the most recent data, we have seen new pool construction declined by approximately [ 15% ] in units with declines also observed in renovation and remodel. Considering this, along with the general economic headwinds, we are pleased with our team's ability to gain share in a tough environment. We believe our share position has grown driven by our best-in-class team, solid execution, unmatched value proposition and continued investment in a resilient industry.\nNow I would like to recap our full year and fourth quarter results. For the full year, we delivered $5.3 billion in revenue, down 4% from 2023 and slightly above our latest guidance driven by a tremendous team effort in creating an unmatched customer value proposition. Our gross margin finished the year at 29.7%, reflecting weaker product mix as higher gross margin construction and remodel related products represented a smaller portion of our total revenues, along with some competitive pressures and customer mix impacts, which Melanie will comment on in her remarks.\nGenerated operating income of $617 million, operating margin of 11.6% in line with our expanded 2020 operating margin and operating cash flow of $659 million, we consider this a solid achievement while continuing our strategic technology investments, sales center network expansion and overcoming higher operating cost inflation over this period.\nWe generated diluted EPS of $11.30 a share, including a $0.23 ASU tax benefit. For the fourth quarter, total sales were $988 million, down 2% compared to last year. Continuing the year-over-year sequential improvement we demonstrated throughout the year. Gross margins improved 10 bps to 29.4% compared to the same period last year and we generated operating income of $60.7 million, operating margin of 6.1% and diluted EPS of $0.98 per share, including a $0.01 ASU tax benefit.\nBreaking sales down by geography for the full year. Florida came in flat, while we saw a mid-single-digit decline in the other year-round markets. Florida showed resilience throughout the year and in the fourth quarter outperformed our other markets with 12% growth. Repair and replacement activity following Hurricanes Helene and Milton provided some weather-related benefit to Florida's fourth quarter results, but the storms likely delayed some construction and renovation activity. Remaining year-round markets saw sales decline ranging from 3% to 7% in the quarter.\nSimilar to what we observed throughout the year, maintenance-related sales held up well, while construction-related products saw pressure, particularly in Texas and California.\nFor Horizon, net sales declined 6% for the full year and 4% for the fourth quarter. Stronger commercial irrigation projects, along with a maintenance-related sales offset softness in the residential construction activities. Considering PVC pipe deflation impacts, volumes came in mostly flat for Horizon for the fourth quarter, which we consider an encouraging and improving trend.\nFor Europe, sales declined 9% for the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter. We noted year-over-year sequential improvement during the 2024 swimming pool season in Europe.\nOn to our product categories, chemical sales increased 2% for the year and 8% in the fourth quarter. As mentioned, mid-teens growth in our private label chemical sales supported our ability to grow overall chemicals greater than the increase in the installed base. Fourth quarter sales were lifted by post-storm cleanup efforts in Florida but continued to show growth across the overall business.\nAt the winter industry shows, we also unveiled our new chemical branding and marketing plans, which will create even more demand for these best-in-class products. Complementing this, we introduced branded test trips that will work with our private label consumer app, which is new for the 2025 season and will allow us to drive additional growth through our dealers for our proprietary products.\nBuilding Materials sales declined 10% for the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter, considering the estimated 15% decline in new pool units constructed. These results are strong indicators that our value -- our proprietary NPT branded pool and tile finishes, [ our ] expansive outdoor living offering the power of our model and the superior tools and expertise provide to our support -- or to provide to our builders.\nEquipment sales, which exclude cleaners were flat for the year and up 6% in the fourth quarter. As expected, maintenance-related equipment demand remained steady, and the fourth quarter included heightened repair and replacement activity in Florida. Not only during this critical recovery period, but also throughout the year, our supply chain teams worked very closely with our vendors to improve inventory vitality and fill rates while reducing days on hand. We have invested in people and processes and technology that helped deliver a better customer experience and solidify the confidence that we will effectively deliver needed products when they are needed most.\nTurning to end markets. Our commercial pool product sales continued to grow with 9% growth both for the full year and in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in capabilities that allow us to take a larger share position in a very technical market. Our recent investments, which include acquisitions, inventory and talent expansion will allow us to continue delivering growth in commercial aquatics.\nSales to our independent retail customers declined 4% in the -- for the full year, but were up 1% in the fourth quarter. Pinch A Penny retail sales representing our franchise [indiscernible] sales to their end customers increased 4% for the year and 15% in the fourth quarter. While the franchisee sales to end customers have been steady throughout 2024, most pinch stores are concentrated in Florida, where a significant amount of storm-related repair and replacement activity occurred in the fourth quarter.\nOrders through our B2B POOL360 application increased to 12.5% in the fourth quarter compared to 11% at the same time last year. As we introduce new and improved versions of our POOL360 water test and POOL360 service tools, we consider this metric and private label chemical product sales to be the most meaningful indicators of success in the early adoption and ongoing utilization of these tools and applications.\nAlso noteworthy, our pool water chemistry test recommended over 1 million product applications to consumers through our dealers in 2024 to balance pool and spa water. Over the long term, we see POOL360 service as a revolutionary opportunity to help our maintenance customers grow their business and create efficiencies and productivity in their operations and in ours.\nWe remain focused on tactically expanding our widespread and fully integrated sales center network. In 2024, we opened 10 new locations and added 2 more through acquisitions, bringing our total count to almost 450 sales centers. Our Pinch A Penny franchise network added 11 new stores, including 7 in Texas for a year-end network total of 295 stores. With the growth of our Pinch A Penny network, we have added additional capabilities, and as of the end of 2024, our operating distribution points specific for continued franchise growth in both Dallas and Houston. Pinch A Penny open our first store in the Arizona market in the coming weeks and has developed distribution capabilities to support this market and future expansion in the Western Sunbelt.\nNow I'd like to frame up our view of the 2025 market and outlook. Our teams delivered solid results in 2024, executing on our strategic initiatives to grow share in both our steady maintenance-related business and to capture available new pool and remodel work and a weaker discretionary spending environment, while investing in our capabilities that further differentiate our customer experience. Our expectations for 2025 are no different under the present macroeconomic conditions. The current interest rate outlook is not likely to benefit our industry in the near term. Having said this, our dealers continue to communicate inquiries on new pool construction and discretionary remodeled projects are solid. But when financing is involved, we believe consumers tend to remain hesitant.\nAs in 2024, we expect maintenance-related product sales to be steady, offering some growth potential from the 2024 increase in the installed base, modest inflation and continued market share gains. In the meantime, we remain aggressive in helping our customers grow their business and providing an unmatched customer experience.\nBreaking down our top line expectations. We expect total sales growth for 2025 to be relatively flat to up slightly. Growth components include benefits from inflation of 1% to 2%, some maintenance-related product sales growth and continued market share expansion.\nMoving to the discretionary portions of our business. Currently, we expect new pool construction in units to be relatively flat. While around 60,000 units may be close to the bottom, the uncertain economic environment makes it unclear how quickly entry-level financing dependent consumers will return to the market. Renovation and remodel activities should be stable in most markets. Over the past 2 years, remodel projects have been lower in number and scope, indicating separation of projects for a pullback of more highly featured comprehensive project spending. Deferred remodels will likely be a growth opportunity as the economy improves, but we remain cautious at the present time.\nTaking these factors into consideration, our 2024 guidance for diluted earnings per share is $11.08 to $11.58 per share, including an estimated $0.08 ASU benefit. Melanie will go into more details on the remainder of our P&L assumptions and capital allocation plans in her prepared remarks.\nLooking out beyond 2025, we're fortunate to operate in an industry that grows upon itself. Each year, new pools go into the ground, creating growing demand for the products we sell to maintain and improve those pools every day. Continuing to invest in expanding our sales in our footprint, developing enhanced technological tools that differentiate our value proposition creating productivity for us and our customers and introducing new products are instrumental in growing our business.\nWith our intense focus on serving the pool service professional, pool builder and DIY markets through our incredible dealer base, and the Pinch A Penny franchise, we can continue to grow our share through all economic cycles. Additionally, the long-term factors that position outdoor living as a growing industry continue to thrive. [ Southern ] migration, the growing millennial and emerging Gen Z home buying population, a housing shortage and technological advancement [indiscernible] support a favorable long-term growth outlook.\nAs I reflect on how we have emerged from our significant growth cycle post-pandemic, I see a company that has strategically expanded its footprint, grown its revenue base by $2 billion, increased margins, accelerated the growth of a franchise network acquired and increased the utilization of a vertically integrated chemical repackaging plant, and develop technological tools to help both service and retail customers grow and enhance their productivity.\nOur widespread distribution network, combined with our 4 central shipping locations throughout the U.S. and fully integrated ERP system differentiate us and allow us to efficiently provide our customers with the products they need, when they need them, along with unmatched expertise to help them grow their business. We are larger and more strategically positioned and integrated than anyone else in the industry.\nAs I wrap up, I want to especially thank the POOLCORP team. Their ability to adapt to their dynamic environment focused on what they can control and propel our growth forward gives me great pride. I also want to thank our vendors. Our commitment to them and the industry is unmatched, and we truly value the partnership. Lastly, I want to thank our customers for helping homeowners reap the benefits of outdoor living.\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her prepared remarks.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete. I'll start with a quick recap of our fourth quarter results to highlight our 2024 accomplishments and then discuss our plans for 2025 based on today's environment.\nSales reflecting a 2% year-over-year decrease for the fourth quarter continued to show an improving trend from the beginning of the year, where we were down 7% in first quarter, 5% in second, and 3% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter included an additional selling day, which fell into December, therefore, having little impact on the overall results for the quarter.\nPete commented on the outperformance we saw in Florida, primarily weather-driven, which had an approximately 1% benefit in quarterly sales. Similar to the second and third quarters, we estimate a net 1% inflation benefit, positive realized pricing was offset by lower selling prices for chemicals and commodities over the same quarter last year. Sales continued to be impacted by the lower levels of new pool construction and repair and remodel activity, which contributed to an estimated 5% comparative decrease in sales, mitigated by positive volumes in maintenance products.\nGross margin of 29.4% was consistent with prior year fourth quarter of 29.3%. Product mix related to lower sales of building materials continued to dilute margin similar to what we have seen throughout the year, and were balanced by year-over-year improvements from pricing and supply chain actions. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $15 million, or 7%, over last year. Including certain timing shifts of costs from the third quarter of 2024, the 10 new sales centers opened during the year and our incremental technology investment.\nOperating income of $61 million compares to prior year operating income of $79 million. Operating margin was 6.1% in the quarter, compared to 7.9% in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.98, compared to $1.32 in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are pleased with the outcome of our full year 2024 results, and the way that we have managed the business in a year with continued macroeconomic pressures and lower levels of consumer discretionary spending. We maintained our significantly stepped up 2020 operating margin, compared to historical results, even to sales contracting and our commitments to expanding our footprint and technology services to our customers. This was accomplished by continuing to make the right choices to focus on the long-term growth and profitability of the company.\nSolid earnings, combined with excellent working capital management, including a $76 million reduction in inventory, propels our operating cash flow generation to almost $660 million. Our capital allocation for the year included 10 greenfield sales centers and 2 acquired sales centers. 11 new Pinch A Penny franchisee stores, increased capabilities in our POOL360 ecosystem, a [ $130 million ] reduction in debt outstanding and $483 million returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nNet sales of $5.3 billion continues to represent our leadership position in the outdoor living space. The 4% sales decrease was primarily driven by the approximately 15% decrease in new pool construction units, and over 10% estimated decrease in full renovation and remodel spend. Collectively, these impacted top line sales by around 5%. Maintenance held up very well overall with volume improvement ahead of the growth in the installed base of pools, and realizing about 2% pricing from pass-through of vendor product cost increases. Chemical and commodity pricing have offset the positive pricing impact by 1%, or an overall 1% net pricing benefit.\nUnfavorable weather during the first part of the year has been offset in the fourth quarter for an overall impact of less than 1% for the full year. Lower sales at Horizon Europe resulted in an additional 1% decrease. We estimate that our 2024 full product sales were around 64% in maintenance items, 22% used for renovation and remodel and 14% for new pool construction projects. This compares to 2023, where the breakout was closer to 62% maintenance products, 24% renovation and remodel, and 14% for new pool construction.\nOur sales for products we track for use in new pool construction and remodel saw less of a decrease in the overall market, as our Building Materials product finished the year down 10%, even including negative impacts of [ pricing ]. We continue to believe that our long-term gross margin target of approximately 30% is achievable in a normalized industry growth environment and would expect that to vary seasonally. We achieved a gross margin of 29.7% for 2024, compared to the 30% realized in the prior year.\nIn 2024, product mix mostly related to lower levels of new construction and customer mix where our larger customers fared better overall than our smaller customers negatively impacted gross margins. These fluctuations were offset by positive contribution realized from the reversal of previously recorded import taxes, pricing benefits, increased private label chemical sales, and a return to normal for purchase-related volume incentives. Specific to product mix changes, [ are ] building materials as a percentage of sales represented 12% of sales in 2024 compared to 13% in 2023.\nOur operating margin at 11.6% was consistent with our 2020 operating margin of 11.8%. This includes the incremental investment in technology, or 18 basis points impact to 2024. The comparison here is important in that we have maintained profitability after a period of sales contraction while managing through much higher levels of cost inflation.\nOur operating expenses increased 5%, or $45 million, to $958 million. Included in the increase was approximately $32 million of future gross levers comprised of the $20 million related to technology, and $12 million for the addition of the 10 new greenfield [indiscernible] centers. The remaining $12 million, or around 1.5% increase, represents significant capacity creation efforts where we were able to control volume-related expenses, utilize our footprint, gain operating efficiencies and control the increase in total operating expenses to a much lower rate than the inflationary cost impact to the business.\nWe had an ASU benefit of $8.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share for the full year, of which $0.01 was added in the fourth quarter. Excluding ASU, our full year tax rate was 25%. We've finished the year with earnings per share of $11.30 for 2024, which was 15% lower than prior year reported EPS of $13.35. Excluding the ASU benefit, our EPS of [ $11.07 ] was a decrease of 16% compared to $13.18.\nComing off of a record cash flow from operating activities of $888 million in 2023, we achieved 2024 cash flows of 152% of net income. We reduced inventory, a larger percentage than the sales decrease, even while providing stock for our 10 new locations. Cash flow in 2024 includes $68.5 million of deferred tax payments for those impacted by Hurricane Francine, which will be paid in the first quarter of 2025 and lower the cash flow for that period. Even without the tax timing benefit, cash flow from operations exceeded net income by 36%.\nNext, I'll recap key areas on our balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 26.3 days was favorable when compared to 2023 DSO of 26.8 days. Year-end accounts receivable of $315 million compares favorably by $28 million, or 8%, from prior year. Our inventory balance of $1.3 billion was $76 million less than the prior year balance of $1.4 billion. The 6% reduction exceeded sales changes as our efforts related to supply chain initiatives continue to add value. Days in inventory was 129, a decrease of 6 days from prior year.\nTotal debt outstanding was reduced by $103 million, from $1.05 billion, to $950 million. The debt reduction was funded by operating cash flows and was achieved even with over $59 million of capital purchases for new and existing locations, funding of our technology initiatives, acquisitions, a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend, and $304 million in share repurchases. We finished the year with a leverage ratio of 1.4, slightly below our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2x.\nWe completed total share repurchases of $304 million, including $144 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to a 2% reduction in weighted average shares outstanding, compared to 2023 year-end. The total amount returned to shareholders for the full year, including dividends and share repurchases was $483 million, second only to 2022. Despite a challenged business environment and pressured earnings, we have returned almost $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the past 2 years.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025. At this time, we are not anticipating a quick recovery in sales trends. From a macroeconomic standpoint, we are entering 2025 with higher than historical interest rates, possibilities of increased cost and continued inflation impacts [ an unclear path ] for consumers to return to more normalized levels of discretionary spending in the pool and irrigation space.\nAs proven in 2024, our steady maintenance business will continue to benefit from new pools added during the prior year, even without a meaningful improvement in new construction and repair and remodel activities. Pricing based on pool season updates from vendors across our product portfolio is expected to have a blended 1% to 2% benefit with some continued drag in first quarter for chemicals and commodities. Our sales outlook range for 2025 is flat to a low single-digit increase.\nAs we do not have a significant amount of direct imports, we do not anticipate that the currently enacted additional tariffs from China will have a material impact on sales for 2025. The vast majority of our products are purchased domestically, however, may include some portion of goods that could see cost increases if further tariffs from Mexico or Canada were to be passed. We will include any estimated impact of future tariffs in our guidance when we receive cost increases from our vendors and can reasonably estimate the potential effects. As we have historically, we would expect to pass these cost increases through as additional selling price.\nOur gross margin for 2025 is expected to be within the range of our 2024 gross margin and our long-term guidance target of 30%. On a comparative basis in 2025, contributions from our success in supply chain management, pricing and increased private label sales are expected to offset the positive import tax included in 2024. Based on trends as we exited the year, we are not anticipating a significant increase in new pool construction and remodel activity, thus product mix is not expected to have a significant positive benefit to 2025 gross margins.\nOn the expense side, we continue to see higher-than-normal growth in wages rent and other operating costs that the management team will continue to focus on to offset these cost increases with improved productivity. The stepped-up level of focused investment in technology will continue in 2025, at a similar level as 2024, and is considered a core part of our customer value creation efforts. We expect an incremental $10 million of costs associated with new sales and our expansion in 2025 as we continue to add to our distribution network.\nAs we start to see market recovery in top line growth, we expect some incremental incentive-based compensation, where a low single-digit top line would result in around $15 million of incremental compensation expense. We expect that interest expense will range from [ $40 million to $45 million ] based on current rates and excluding any share repurchases. Interest expense is typically higher in quarters 1 and 2, as we build inventory to support the swimming pool season.\nThe improvement from 2024 is primarily driven by lower expected average debt levels estimated at current interest rates. We have included around $50 million to $55 million for our depreciation and amortization estimates. Capital allocation plans include use of cash of around 1% to 1.5% of net sales on capital reinvestments into the business, including new sales center openings. We plan for between $25 million to $50 million on acquisitions. Once approved, our dividends will utilize cash of around $200 million. As we would expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically.\nCash flow in 2025 is expected to be between 90% and 100% of net income and will be impacted by the $68.5 million deferred tax payment made in the first quarter of 2025 related to 2024. Our annual tax rate is estimated to be approximately 25%, excluding ASU. This rate typically runs closer to 25.5% during quarters 1, 2 and 4 and lower in Q3. We are projecting an 8% benefit from ASU in the first quarter for the expected impact of restricted share vesting and stock options expiring in 2025. We expect approximately 38 million weighted average shares of outstanding that will be applied to net income attributable to common shareholders at the end of the first quarter, and 38.1 million shares for the remaining quarters before consideration of any additional share buybacks.\nOur guidance for 2025 is our diluted EPS range of $11.08 to $11.58, including an estimated $0.08 ASU tax benefit. From an operational standpoint, excluding the benefit of the $12.6 million import tax on the 2024 results, the improved earnings at the midpoint would be around 4%. First quarter 2025 will include 1 less selling day than prior year for a total of 1 less selling day for full year 2025 compared to 2024. From a seasonality standpoint, with Easter falling later in the year, this typically would shift pool openings from first quarter to second quarter in some markets.\nLast year, first quarter included the $12.6 million of benefit to gross margin related to import taxes. This will provide a negative comparison for 2025 as we would expect a normal seasonal gross margin for Q1.\nAs we look forward to the 2025 season, our team is prepared to capitalize on the stable maintenance portion of our business, continue to capture incremental market share and adjust the business and economic changes that will position to outperform the market. When new construction and remodel activity return to more normalized historical levels, we will be ready as we have made the investments necessary to continue to grow faster than the overall market.\nI appreciate all of you participating in today's call. We will now open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nWelcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2024 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures included in our press release are posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.\nAs we introduced last quarter, we have included a brief presentation on our investor website to side key points for our press release and call comments. Unless otherwise stated within our prepared remarks, all comparisons refer to second quarter 2024 versus second quarter 2023.\nWe are now ready to begin with comments from Pete Arvan, our President and CEO.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning, everyone.\nAs we reported this morning, we generated $1.8 billion in net sales during the second quarter, reflecting a solid performance in the maintenance portion of our business during the busiest time of the year. This performance showcases our crisp execution, progress on strategic initiatives and our ability to continue gaining share by providing an unmatched value proposition.\nAs we discussed in our June release, the trends we observed in discretionary spending for new pool construction and large renovation projects and some larger discretionary items based continued economic headwinds, while the nondiscretionary demand is solid and in line with our expectations.\nOur customers who primarily focus on new pool construction and renovation and remodel continue to report lower demand for low to midrange pools, while demand remained solid at the higher end. The trend remains unchanged from recent quarters. A similar pattern is seen in renovations. High-end renovation project interest is reported to be solid, although the summer, when people are using their pool, is the slow season for renovation. Similar to new construction of low-end pools, smaller renovation projects are being deferred frequently in this environment.\nDealers are reporting more inbound calls. However, many consumers remain hesitant to pull the trigger in the current economic cycle. We view this as a positive sign for the future. So far this year, we have made progress in several strategic areas of our business that excite us and to drive our ability to capture future industry opportunity and extend our leadership position going forward.\nWe remain deeply focused on our customers and areas of our business where we can position ourselves for sustainable future growth as we leverage the power of our widespread and highly integrated distribution network. We have strengthened our commitment to providing our customers exceptional service and value-add tools to grow their business, while advancing our digital ecosystem development.\nAdoption of our POOL360 tool continues to increase. We closed the second quarter with 14.5% of our sales completed on our POOL360 digital platform, which is our highest level to date, as our customers experience next level service and convenience, which ultimately creates capacity not only for POOLCORP but for our customers as well. Our new digital marketing programs continue to gain traction as our dealers experience unmatched capabilities in driving demand for the brands that they carry and lead generation for their core business function.\nWe are also increasing utilization rates at our chemical packaging facility. Since we acquired the chemical packaging operation from Porpoise Pool & Patio, we have increased the production at the plant by almost 60%, which gives us, again, unmatched capabilities and drives incremental profitability for our business.\nWe continue to expand our sales center network, adding both convenience and needed capacity to support our growth as the industry's installed base continues to grow, and we continue gaining share. So far this year, we have opened 8 new sales centers in line with our strategic plan.\nNow moving to our second quarter results. Total sales in the second quarter declined 5%, which is an improved trend compared to the year-over-year changes that we have seen in recent quarters. As we mentioned in our press release, the last week of June showed a notable improvement in the daily sales, which was sparked by favorable weather and strong execution from the team. Our maintenance business is strong. Our software platforms are gaining traction, and our building material products performed better than new pool construction trends and external permit data would suggest.\nWhile we take some encouragement from this slightly improved trend, we are maintaining our top line guide along with our year-to-date results sales trend. Once we pass the midpoint of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, the discretionary portion of our business can have a greater impact on our total sales based on the seasonality of the industry. So we also considered this dynamic in our full year guide.\nOur gross margin for the second quarter finished at 30%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. Remember that last year, we were still selling through our strategic excess and lower cost inventory in the second quarter. Lower levels of our higher margin in building material sales also inhibited the gross margin in the quarter. So our ability to deliver 30% gross margin under these circumstances highlights some of the underlying structural improvements on supply chain, value-added pricing and our strategic priorities.\nFrom a profitability standpoint, we produced an operating income of $271.5 million and operating margin of 15.3%. Although down from the 17.6% operating margin from the same period last year, it reflects continued strategic investment in technology, a continuation of planned new sales center openings, acquisitions and further expansion of our Pinch A Penny network. Melanie will give you a more detailed commentary on expenses.\nWhile we are without a doubt managing controllable expenses, we also continue to invest in the long-term success of our business, recognizing that we are working through an economic cycle and that the business is getting stronger. We finished the quarter reporting diluted earnings per share, including the $0.01 tax benefit at $4.99 per share.\nLooking at sales by geography, Florida saw the strongest performance, with sales being down just 1%. In Texas, sales declined 6%, as we observed incredibly wet conditions through May, making construction difficult and impeding maintenance spend. California and Arizona were down 5% and 8%, respectively, with a similar overall trend of solid maintenance and aftermarket sales dragged by lower new construction and remodel. In total, our year-round markets were off 5%, while the seasonal markets were down 6%.\nEurope was down 11% and remains challenged with a tough consumer sentiment and was further impacted by cold and rainy weather and late pool openings this season. We continue to make operating improvements that will position us well in this area when sentiment improves.\nFor Horizon, net sales declined 6% compared to the second quarter last year and at the same level of sales decline as we saw in the first quarter. Our irrigation business is more impacted by commodity pricing than the swimming pool business, and has seen some irrigation project deferrals in both commercial and residential during the quarter.\nMoving to our product and end market details. The 1% increase in chemicals reflects a 3% growth in volume, with a 2% deflationary impact on price, still primarily driven by trichlor. We see the positive effects of our efforts in this area, particularly noting that our private label chemical sales grew at double-digit rates and outpaced the growth of the rest of our chemical portfolio.\nOn Building Materials, the 10% quarterly sales decline is better than what we are seeing in overall new pool builds and our remodel expectations. Equipment sales ended flat for the quarter and is an area that we have seen improvement, particularly around lights, pumps, heaters and parts. Remember that our equipment results exclude cleaners, which is a discretionary area that remains challenged.\nThe equipment performance is noteworthy considering the new pool construction trends and the maintenance of our aftermarket business. As an example, we estimate that pumps used for maintenance versus new pool construction is 4:1. So we expect our maintenance and repair business on equipment to continue to hold up well.\nPrice on equipment came in at up 2% to 3%. Related to price in other areas, we did see some pressure during the quarter on certain commodities like pipe and rebar, which show up in our building materials and irrigation business results and on chemicals, as discussed. Commodity prices moved with the market and represent a relatively small portion of our overall business.\nLooking at our end markets and commercial business. Sales increased 16%, rising after a flat first quarter and in line with another travel-rich summer and openings of community pools. Sales to independent retail pool customers declined close to 6%, which represents sell-in to those stores. We believe that this is reflective of consumers being more selective on some discretionary purchases and a later start to the season in some markets.\nOur Pinch A Penny franchisee sales to their end consumers collectively increased 4%, which reflects a high concentration of stores in year-round markets and a strong customer value proposition.\nCircling back to POOL360. We are pleased with our progress since launching our POOL360 service platform in February and the POOL360 water test application last summer. As we have discussed, these tools ultimately link into our enhanced B2B POOL360 platform, the foundation for our digital ecosystem. Our POOL360 water test tool provides optimal water chemistry recommendations to ensure safe water and an enhanced swimming environment directly tied to our private label products. To date, we are very pleased with the number of retail stores using the software, which we soft launched after the season began in 2023. Our retail solutions team has been fully engaged with water test in the first half of this year and continues to onboard dealers.\nAs peak season comes to a close and customers have more time to schedule onboarding, we will again be focused on driving our technology and offering, in conjunction with our 2025 retail and service programs. POOL360 service allows our customers to expand their businesses by automating manual tasks like quotations, scheduling, routing, billing and collections, all while providing direct purchase access to the POOL360 tool. Orders processed through the traditional B2B POOL360 platform increased to 14.5% of total sales this quarter, growing from 13% in the second quarter of last year and 11% in the first quarter of this year.\nTechnology is a key source of differentiation and continues to be an effective tool to grow sales and create stronger partnerships with our customers. We continue to strategically expand our network, opening another 3 sales centers in the second quarter and acquiring 1. Our second quarter acquisition offers us a premier presence in the Atlanta market with a central location, combined with our established presence in the market, this gives us the greater ability to serve the entire metro to fulfill demand in this major Sunbelt market. These additions bring our global sales center network to 445 locations.\nOur Pinch A Penny franchise network added 3 new stores, each in the strategic Texas market, ending the quarter with a total of 292 franchise stores. Continuing to build on our franchise network, along with expanding support offerings provided to our independent retail dealers, will allow us to expand our reach and continue to capture the do-it-yourself maintenance market.\nTaking all of this into consideration, in view of the peak season activities and our current outlook, we are confirming our full year diluted EPS guidance range of $11.05 to $11.45, including an updated $0.20 estimated benefit from ASU.\nEven under somewhat challenging operating conditions, our strong cash flow allowed us to return a total of $173 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase so far this year. During the quarter, our Board increased our quarterly dividend to 9%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend rate increase and increased our repurchase authorization to $600 million, reflecting our commitment to generating returns for our shareholders.\nFor the remainder of 2024, we plan to center our focus on execution and our strategic growth initiatives. From an industry perspective, pools and expanded outdoor living space remains highly attractive to homeowners. Pools remain one of the most frequently searched terms in the online real estate sites. Home values remain strong. Demographic trends, such as southern migration, the large millennial population we're driving household formation and continued new home builds, all support the long-term industry dynamics even during the period of higher interest rates and suppressed existing home turnover.\nAs we have seen for well over a year now, high-end consumers appear to be making up a large portion of the new pool build again in 2024. It is unclear when the mix will shift based on the amount and timing of interest rate reductions and the economic indications needed for consumers to feel less pressured. We are best positioned to provide the widest product offering in the industry, support enhanced outdoor living features and aesthetics through our NPT branded products and partner with our vendors to unveil the latest available automation offerings.\nWe remain ready to serve our customers with everything they need to help them create the outdoor living oasis that people want, while providing the tools and support to grow their business. Although we expect a lower number of new pools to be built this year at roughly 60,000 new units, this still represents a 1% increase in the installed base of pools that will need to be maintained going forward.\nWe remain relentless in expanding our network to best serve the professional and do-it-yourself maintenance customer and improving the customer experience, enhancing our capacity creation and launching our industry-leading digital ecosystem.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her detailed commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning again, everyone.\nWe reported net sales of $1.8 billion in our seasonally largest second quarter, a decrease of 5% from prior year. We experienced an approximate 1% inflation benefit during the quarter. From a product perspective, price increases on equipment sales continue to hold in the 2% to 3% range. While seeing positive volume trends on chemicals, there were negative effects on pricing of chemicals and other commodities impacting sales by 1%.\nSelling prices, specifically for chemicals, will likely remain lower than last year for the remainder of the year. From an end market and business line perspective, as we stated in our recent update, the trends regarding new pool construction and remodel activity are less than projected at the end of last quarter. As discussed in our June pool season update release, we now expect around 15% to 20% lower levels of new pool construction compared to the prior year, which impacted total sales by around 3% for the quarter.\nAs discussed, we believe that remodel activity may be down as much as 15% for the full year, and that lower level of remodel activity adversely affected total sales by about 2% from prior year during the quarter. Declines in sales at Horizon in Europe had an approximate 1% negative impact on total net sales for the quarter.\nOur gross margin for the quarter finished at 30%, down 60 basis points from the prior year. As we expected, gross margin in the current year is lower than last year when we were reducing our inventory levels and selling down lower cost inventory, which for the most part, has now been normalized. And we do not expect any significant quarter-over-quarter changes from this effect in the second half of the year.\nBenefits realized over the last several years from growth of higher gross margin building material sales did not occur in the quarter, although other factors such as acquisition contribution, pricing optimization and supply chain actions have benefited gross margin and should continue to support margins going forward.\n[indiscernible] expenses this quarter were $259 million, $18 million higher than prior year, representing 14.6% as a percentage of net sales. The year-over-year increase in the quarter of 7.4% is higher than the 2.6% increase reported in the first quarter as we had a higher level of spend in the quarter to accelerate our sales center network expansion and technology development.\nSpecific to the quarter, through July, we have opened up 8 new sales centers and have also rolled out several enhancements to our customer-facing technology platform, providing our customers with even better digital tools for use during the peak pool season. Additionally, we closed 3 Horizon locations, 2 in June and 1 in July, where performance did not meet our return criteria, and we did not see appropriate near-term improvement opportunity. Expenses related to these locations were close to $1 million during the quarter, and will not be continuing into the rest of the year.\nThese locations for projects we used to evaluate different product or location offerings and have characteristics outside of our traditional Horizon business. and thus does not reflect any changes to our expected results on the remaining part of the business.\nIn light of the mid-season sales trends, we intensified our focus on controllable expenses during the second quarter, in an effort to improve cost leverage, and we'll see the benefits of these incremental efforts as expenses in the second half of the year are expected to increase in the low single-digit range, with the third quarter expenses expected to increase similar to first quarter and slightly higher growth expected in the fourth quarter.\nOperating income of $271 million was down $56 million or 17% compared to prior year. We continue to operate with less debt outstanding and we're able to reduced interest expense, $2.8 million during the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. Overall, second quarter net income of $192 million compares to $232 million in prior year. For the quarter, our results reflect a $0.01 benefit from ASU. Diluted earnings per share of $4.99 decreased 16% compared to $5.91 in the second quarter of 2023.\nMoving to our cash flows and balance sheet. Second quarter cash flows remained strong, reflecting normalized contribution after early buy deferred payment terms, which came viewed during the quarter. Cash flows from operating activities of $172 million year-to-date is on pace to meet or slightly exceed our target of approximately 100% of net income for the full year.\nOn the working capital side, our accounts receivable days outstanding of 26.8 days remains consistent with the 26.9 days from last quarter. Inventory of $1.3 billion is $97 million less than prior year. As of June 30, 2023, we had completed $186 million of our stated inventory reduction goal of over $200 million during 2023. Thus, the prior year second quarter number already reflected some destocking from the end of the prior year. Our inventory days on hand have reduced from 141 to 131, a similar improvement to what we reported in first quarter. Our prior year inventory positions were normalized as we got to the end of the season at the end of the third quarter.\nTotal debt of $1.1 billion is $68 million less than last year as strong cash flows provided funds for repayment. Debt leverage ratio of 1.4 as of the end of the quarter was just below our 1.5 to 2x target, reflecting significant capacity for funding future growth opportunities.\nMoving to capital allocation. We continue to support the ongoing business and organic growth with $34.9 million of capital expenditures, including new sales center openings. We completed another acquisition during the quarter for a total of 2 additional sales centers added through acquisitions year-to-date.\nAlso during the quarter, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by $0.10 or 9% to $1.20 per share, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings beyond the current economic cycle and expected ongoing strong cash flows. The Board also increased our share repurchase authorization back up to $600 million, adding $316 million in additional repurchase capacity. We made repurchases of $68 million during the quarter and an additional $10 million through today's earnings call. We currently have $572 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nLooking ahead to the second half, our expectations for pricing for the remainder of the year are similar to actual results seen to date. The estimated lower number of new pool builds and reduced renovation activity are expected to continue to negatively impact sales around 4% to 5% collectively for the year. Horizon and Europe are expected to represent an additional 1% decrease.\nSeasonal gross margins held up well in the second quarter, although impacted by lower building material sales year-over-year. For the remainder of the year, we expect gross margin to be in a similar range to last year, with internal strategic initiatives offsetting the drag from building materials. Full year gross margins we anticipate to be approximately 30%.\nOperating expenses for the full year, as mentioned above, are expected to see a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase year-over-year, and will include continuing technology investments of approximately $20 million and costs associated with the newly opened greenfield locations estimated to be around $12 million and the acquisitions we've completed to date. Our rate of expense increase, after considering inflation and these incremental investments, reflect substantial efficiency improvement benefits from our capacity creation and operating initiatives.\nFull year interest expense is expected to come in closer to $50 million from our previous estimated range of $50 million to $53 million. Our annual tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, excluding the ASU benefit with a lower rate to be reported in Q3 and a slightly higher rate similar to our second quarter rate in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding the effects of additional share buybacks, we anticipate that fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding would be approximately 38.5 million shares for the third and fourth quarter and 38.6 million shares for the full year, reflecting a reduction of approximately 140,000 shares from year-to-date share repurchase activity. Consistent with our June update, we expect that our 2024 diluted EPS will range from $11.05 to $11.45, including the $0.20 of ASU realized year-to-date.\nWe completed our third annual corporate responsibility report last month. This year's report included expanded disclosures, in particular, around our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and our workforce, and it is also aligned with the SASB framework, a leading framework that identifies important environmental, social and governance topics, typically most relevant to stakeholders.\nAs we wrap up our comments today, we are reiterating our focus on managing the business through the current cycle, while continuing to invest in strategic technology tools, sale center network expansion and selective acquisitions that will enable our long-term growth, superior operating performance and attractive shareholder return.\nWe will now begin the Q&A portion of our call."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2024 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures included in our press release are posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. In order to assist our investors and analysts and following along with our earnings call comments, we have posted a brief presentation on our investor website. It will summarize key points from our press release and call comments.\nWe are now ready to begin the call with comments from Pete Arvan, our President and CEO.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. We released our first quarter results this morning, reporting $1.1 billion in net sales, our fourth consecutive year of achieving the $1 billion mark in a seasonally slower quarter. This was down 7% from the previous year, but up 6% from 2021. Overall demand for pool-related maintenance products in the quarter was solid with sales ending roughly flat, which is a good result considering the poor weather that we experienced in Florida for almost the entire quarter. As you can imagine, in the first quarter, Florida is our largest market.\nWe were also pleased with early buy activity, much of which we attribute to share gain given the return to more normal supply chain conditions. On the new construction side of our business, a continuation of economic uncertainty combined with elevated interest rates have further weighed heavily on [indiscernible] starts. Our builders are reporting that consumers remain interested in pools, but as we have noted previously, lower-end pools remain a challenge, while demand for higher-end pools is steady, explaining the increased permit value on a per pool basis.\nOverall, we saw permits down 15% to 20% for the quarter, which is more than we anticipated for the year. We believe that easier comps and signs of the bottom of the trough that we are seeing in some markets will allow the full year construction level to be more in line with our previously stated full year expectation of flat to down 10%. We have seen similar results in the first quarter on renovation and remodel, but our builders are telling us that interest from consumers may be starting to rebound in key markets.\nNormally, we would expect it to take 60 days from the time we see permits improve to any meaningful change in purchase trends from the customer base in the affected areas. Keep in mind that historically, the first quarter has represented just under 1/5 of our total annual sales in a typical year with the all-important second quarter ahead of us, our teams remain keyed into the start of the swimming pool season with their ability to fulfill demand needs better than anyone in the industry in any environment. We all remain intensely focused on providing our best-in-class customer experience, expanding our integrated network and enhancing our industry-leading technology solutions.\nLooking at our sales by major geographic markets, sales declined 9% each in Florida, Arizona and Texas, while California sales declined 4%, showing overall sequential improvements from the fourth quarter of 2023. As we mentioned on our year-end call, we saw a lot of rain in January and February in key markets. While March weather somewhat improved, it still carried above average rain in many areas. For the first quarter last year, we estimated approximately $60 million to $70 million impact from unfavorable weather, particularly in the Western U.S. We clearly see the weather recovery in California's first quarter results, which outperformed the other areas of the country. Conversely, in markets that experienced unfavorable weather comparisons this year such as Florida and the Southeast region of the U.S., we observed sales headwinds due to the limited ability for pools and outdoor living activity to jump off to a robust start or continue usage in the year-round markets.\nAcross the company, we participate in numerous trade shows and partner with our suppliers and customers to prepare for the season. From what we are hearing, there are -- there has been some consolidation amongst builders some newer builders are exiting due to the challenging construction environment. This is resulting in some of our larger builders gaining share, as you would expect. Typically, the newer builders were more heavily focused on industry-level pools, which, as we have said, have been the most pressured. Related to our product sales mix, chemical sales were essentially flat for the quarter, up 1% in volume with a 2% deflationary impact on price, primarily from trichlor and commodities. This result reinforces our expectation that maintenance volumes will perform well even with the weather patterns and the industry conditions that were not ideal in many markets.\nWith a slow start, we did see instances of lower selling prices on trichlor around 5% lower than at the end of the year. At the current cost positions, we see these occurrences as minor top line pressure for the remainder of the year. Building materials sales were down 11% versus prior year following the declining trend in new pool construction and deflationary impacts across several categories as freight costs passed down from the manufacturers have decreased. Although the number of new pools is down, our superior value proposition and extensive MPT network allow us to continue to expand our share in the strategic product category. Equipment sales showed an improved trend decreasing 3% for the quarter versus the 9% decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 and showed some early signs of recovery in discretionary product demand like heaters and lights. Looking across the major equipment categories, we see that despite a slow start to the pool construction season, our sales transfer for equipment seems much healthier than what new construction alone would dictate.\nLooking at our end markets. Our commercial business sales came in flat compared to last year's 12% growth in the first quarter and better than the overall business as we further integrate our recent investments in our widespread distribution network and enhanced our service to commercial pool operators. Sales to our independent retail customers declined 4% in the first quarter, improving from an 8% decline in the fourth quarter of 2023 as we extend our reach and resources available to these customers. For our Pinch A Penny franchisee group, sales came in flat for the quarter. Collectively, these results provide additional indication that maintenance remains stable and that our focused efforts in this critical area of the market support our ability to continue to gain share.\nIn Europe, challenging weather and continued geopolitical uncertainty constrained sales in the first quarter, which declined 17% in local currency and 16% in U.S. stock dollars. We completed important supply chain projects at the beginning of the year that will position us well in improving our overall product cost and fulfillment as we work to gain scale in Europe. For Horizon, net sales declined 6% in the quarter. Our irrigation business is more impacted by commodity pricing than the slimming pool business and the growth in our commercial irrigation continue to support our distribution business during the first quarter. Gross margins came in at 30.2% versus the 30.6% in the first quarter of 2023. Going into the quarter, we expected about a 60 basis point headwind compared to last year, primarily related to the sell-through of lower-cost inventory in the first quarter of 2023. Melanie will walk you through the various components impacting margins as part of her financial commentary.\nBoth our field and support teams did a good job managing expenses as the operating expenses increased just 2.5% in the first quarter. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we have several key areas where we continue to invest this year, including our technology initiatives, customer experience enhancements and continued footprint expansion. At the same time, we continue to work on capacity creation. In mid-February, we launched our POOL360 service platform. At our Investor Day, I was excited for my team to provide a deep dive into this innovative tool and demonstrate power that our customers will see from using the POOL360 ecosystem. Our technology and sales teams were on the ground doing exactly that during the quarter for both our customers and our field teams in preparation for the season.\nOrders processed through our traditional B2B POOL360 platform and continue to expand at close to 11% of total sales in the first quarter of 2024, growing from 10% in the first quarter of last year. Related to our POOL360 water test, we finished the first quarter with 2.5x the number of customers on board than at the end of 2023, and this has translated into a similar increase water test perform versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Our analysis of customer buying behavior confirms our assumptions of the power of POOL360 water test with our POOL360 water test customers private label chemical purchases up significantly versus the rest of the customer base. While in the very early stages, we are already beginning to see the positive impacts of our POOL360 service tool through volume growth in our private label chemical brands and revenue dollar growth in other products.\nOur customers are reporting very favorable feedback on the ecosystem and all it provides. Driving adoption of our POOL360 service application not only provides a meaningful differentiator and deeper relationships with our customers but also adds capacity for our customers to grow their business, which we believe will drive additional growth for POOLCORP. The progress among these tools reflects the collaborative efforts of our sales, field and technology teams to roll out the new software and educate our customers and teams on this enhanced abilities.\nWe continue to expand our network, opening 3 new locations in the first quarter and acquiring one, bringing the total sales center network to 442 locations. Our Pinch A Penny franchise network added 5 new stores, including 2 as part of our focused expansion in the Texas market, ending the quarter with a total of 290 franchise locations. Continuing to expand our franchise footprint geographically and our retail-edge programs are critical elements of our strategy to reach the attractive do-it-yourself maintenance market.\nWe recorded $108.7 million in operating income in the first quarter of 2024. Operating margins of 9.7% decline when compared to the 12.1% in the first quarter of 2023, but well exceed the pre-pandemic first quarter operating margins that ranged from 5.7% to 6.5%. Our increase in scale since that time shows the immense leverage attainable from top line growth, focused cost management and disciplined execution. With the first quarter behind us, we are reiterating our full year EPS guidance range of $13.19 to $14.19, including an updated $0.19 estimate from the benefit of ASU.\nLooking forward, we see the primary challenges affecting our industry as being the macroeconomic picture. Without a doubt, the decline in new pool construction creates a complex operating environment, but we are confident that this is just a cycle that will change just as we have seen in the past. Remember, pools are still highly desirable. The installed base continues to grow and the aftermarket upgrade opportunities are sizable. Demographic shifts will only help power these important trends for years to come. We are intensely focused on improving the customer experience, capacity creation and building and launching our industry-leading digital ecosystem. We will continue to expand our network to position us to best serve the pros and support the retailers that cater to the DIY market.\nGross margins remained the top priority for the team as well. We have identified comprehensive plans to achieve our goals and enhance our performance in this area. Our teams are committed and focused on supply chain efficiencies, private label product growth and pricing optimization, along with our proven track record on execution. With our robust cash flow generation, capital capacity and strong balance sheet, we will continue to be a disciplined capital allocator and a strategic growth investor. Through our team, we collectively work to provide the best service to our customers and exceptional returns to our stakeholders.\nI would like to wrap up by thanking the POOLCORP team for their continued persistence, through our collaboration with our supplier partners and our customers, we aim to provide -- we aim towards executing a successful 2024 swimming pool season. I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her detailed commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete. Starting on Page 3 of our presentation, you will see our first quarter 2024 results at a glance as reported in our press release. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4 as we discuss the components impacting net sales and gross margin in the quarter.\nNet sales of $1.1 billion declined 7% over prior year, which shows an improving trend from the 8.4% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter of 2023. Positive price realization of approximately 2% was offset by continuing though modestly improving trends in new pool construction and remodel activity with estimated volume decreases of 15% to 20% on construction and around 10% on remodels. Those translated into a [ 3% ] and 2% decline in consolidated sales compared to prior year. We estimate weather impact primarily in Florida negatively impacted sales approximately 2% in the quarter. Chemical and commodity pricing continued to normalize and are estimated to have a 1% negative impact on sales for the quarter.\nHorizon [indiscernible] Europe sales declines in the quarter together had an approximate 1% effect on total net sales. While the quarter had the same number of selling days, March had 2 fewer days, which had some impact on the quarter as we typically see an upward ramp into the season and March is, by far, the largest sales month of the first quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.2% compared to 30.6% in the first quarter of last year. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 included a benefit of $12.6 million or 110 basis points related to estimated import taxes previously recorded which was not considered in our latest discussions of expected first quarter margins as both the timing and the conclusion of this open area were not readily determinable.\nAs referenced on our call discussing fourth quarter 2022 results, with supply chain normalization and a return to our domestic sourcing strategy, we do not expect significant impacts from import tariffs going forward. From a comparative standpoint, net resulting margin of 29.1% was down 150 basis points compared to prior year including the expected decrease from higher average cost inventory in 2024 compared to 2023. Other impacts include product mix as lower margin equipment sales outpaced higher margin building materials. Customer mix, reflecting a greater proportion of sales to larger customers who participate in customer rebate programs and have volume-based pricing and an increase in customer early buys sold at special pricing including preseason pricing in a number of major markets, resulting from the rainy and sluggish start to the season. These were offset by a higher volume-based vendor incentives as purchasing patterns normalize in 2024. Main area's different from our expected 60 basis points decline, as previously communicated were the lower building material sales and the higher mix of preseason pricing. On Page 5, you will see our quarterly financial trends.\nDue to the seasonal nature of our business, many of these metrics vary sequentially. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales is typically highest in the fourth and first quarters due to the lower sales volumes. Operating expenses in the quarter were 20.5% and increased by $6 million or just under 3% over prior year. We continue to manage variable expenses to offset higher inflationary increases in rent, insurance and our first quarter merit wage increases. As discussed, we continue making investments in our strategic technology and initiatives such as our POOL360 ecosystem. We added 4 new sales centers in the first quarter, 3 organic and 1 through acquisition and we are working to add another 5 new grew [indiscernible] sale centers prior to the peak event.\nFor the quarter, we reported operating income of $109 million compared to prior year operating income of $146 million. Lower levels of debt, even with a higher borrowing rate resulted in a $2.4 million reduction in interest expense versus last year. Net income of $79 million compared to $101 million in prior year first quarter reflects lower operating income, partially offset by lower interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate due to an increase in ASU tax benefit this quarter versus Q1 2023. We realized a $0.19 benefit from ASU in the quarter, up from the $0.10 we estimated in our guidance and compared to a $0.12 benefit in Q1 2023. We also realized a benefit of $0.24 from the reduced import tax amount recorded during the quarter. This resulted in diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $2.04 compared to $2.58 in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of 21%. Moving to Slide 6.\nCash flow from operating activities increased to a first quarter record of $145 million, an increase of $42 million over last year's first quarter. We continue to invest capital in technology development initiatives, sale center network expansion and improvements and acquisitions, closing on during the quarter. Our accounts receivable days outstanding of 26.9 days remain in line with typical preseason activity levels, including customer early buy programs and are in a good position as we enter the peak selling season and exit the portion of the year where our customers are typically more cash constrained. As we planned, inventory levels continue to normalize, finishing the first quarter at $1.5 billion, $190 million lower than Q1 last year. The increase from year-end of $131 million is intended to prepare for the upcoming season and is fully offset by increased accounts payable.\nOur inventory days on hand have reduced from 142 to 132 and we expect to continue seeing this trend of lower comparative days as we lap last year's higher inventory levels through third quarter. We reduced our saving borrowings by $387 million compared to Q1 last year and $74 million from year-end, while continuing to make investments in the business. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio stands at 1.4 as of the end of the quarter, slightly below our 1.5 to 2x target, providing significant growth investment capacity. Our current quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share returned $42 million to shareholders. We also completed $10 million of open market share buybacks during the quarter and $50 million through our earnings call. And of $284 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nWith the first quarter behind us and an early view to the start of the [ '24 ] season, we maintain our full year guide of flat to slightly positive growth in 2024. Based on historic pre-pandemic seasonal sales pattern, our first quarter sales as a proportion of full year sales suggests this is a reasonable expectation. As we move further into second quarter and the beginning of the peak selling season, our visibility improves, and we will have better insight into the full year after our second quarter. The 1% to 2% annual benefit we could have achieved from normalized weather in the first 2 quarters has not been observed to date. Therefore, it is so uncertain that we would see a significant weather recovery for the full year.\nOur expectations for inflation for the year remain unchanged as price benefits of approximately 3% on equipment has progressed as expected, slightly less on our remaining categories for an estimated 2% overall. Maintenance activity is tracking as expected, and our volume expectations for renovation and remodel and new construction markets in the range of flat to down [ 10% ] remains reasonable at this point in the year. We still anticipate that Horizon in Europe could decline 5% for the full year. No significant contribution is expected from the additional selling days as they are late in the year. We still anticipate full year gross margin to approximate 30%. We look for the increased activity across the industry to moderate some of the preseason pricing activity combined with our supply chain and pricing strategic actions underway to realize the favorable seasonal benefits in second quarter.\nOur expectation for operating expenses remain relatively unchanged. Volume-related [ expenses ] continues to correlate with business activity, while certain inflation affected expenses, such as rent, insurance and wages, will increase compared to last year. Performance-based incentive compensation will only increase based on operating income improvements achieved as it will reflect actual performance relative to performance plans. Strategic growth-oriented expenses, such as investments in sales center network expansion, tuck-in acquisitions and ongoing technology development will continue as we gain share and work to improve our service offering.\nWith flat revenue for the full year, we believe operating margin of around 13% is attainable. Estimated interest expense in the range of $50 million to $53 million is unchanged from our previous guidance. and we would expect it to be highest in Q2 following our early buy payments to vendors. No changes to our expected annual tax rate of 25.3% excluding ASU benefit. Fully diluted weighted average sales outstanding is expected to be approximately 38.75 million shares, excluding any effect of additional share buyback. Guidance for 2024 diluted EPS of $13.19 to $14.19 now includes $0.19 of ASU benefit, up from $0.10 in our previously provided range.\nIn summary, we are focused on continued discipline in managing our business through this time of economic uncertainty, while investing in areas of strategic long-term growth. We are in a position of strength as we have accessed the high levels of capital to fund our growth plans. At the same time, we continue to reward our existing shareholders with increasing cash dividends and an ongoing share buyback program. Our capital allocation approach allows us to continue to deliver increasing returns as we improve our operating results from a legacy of disciplined consistent execution.\nWe are now ready to move into the Q&A portion of our call."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nWelcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings conference call. Discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2024 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of any of our non-GAAP financial measures included in our press release are posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. President and CEO, Peter Arvan, will begin our call today. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. For the full year 2023, we generated over $5.5 billion in revenue, the second largest in company history and over $2 billion higher than 2019, a year with a similar number of new pools constructed in the last year before the pandemic. We generated $747 million in operating income, more than double our operating income in 2019 and operating margin of 13.5%, a 280 basis point expansion above 2019 operating margin.\nThese results highlight the larger installed base available for us to serve post-pandemic and our ability to fulfill our customers' maintenance remodel and renovation and new construction product needs. Even in a challenging environment, our customer service outshined our competitors through our powerful distribution network, the largest, most integrated in the pool industry, and we continue to make wise investments to promote our future growth.\nWe were up against tremendous comps throughout most of the year, yet the team at all levels, worked extremely hard to deliver very solid results. The year began with us lapping 33% sales growth in the first quarter of 2022 over 2021, sales declined 15% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 amidst unusually poor weather conditions in key year-round markets. Delayed pool openings in many of our seasonal markets followed and higher-than-normal inventory levels across the industry contributed to an abnormal selling environment during the first half of the year.\nMacroeconomic constraints and uncertainties, primarily in the form of elevated and escalating interest rates and recent inflation, resulted in new pool units declining from 98,000 units in 2022 to an estimated 70,000 to 75,000 units in 2023 or a 25% to 30% decline. These evolving external factors made it extremely difficult to forecast underlying demand at the start of the year. As 2023 progressed, clarity around the market improved and we adapted accordingly.\nWe focused on specific customer needs and opportunities, particularly those related to maintaining the ever-growing 5.4 million swimming pools in the installed base. Given our broad reach, unmatched capabilities, it is in situations like this that our team shines. We continue to invest in expanding our footprint and in technology tools that improve our customers' ability to grow their business and be more productive.\nWe continued our focus on customer experience and being the best channel to market for our suppliers. These efforts combined allowed us to continue growing our share and outperforming the industry. Our disciplined execution enabled us to generate $888 million in operating cash flow in 2023, a company record. This result positively demonstrates our working capital management capabilities, capital capacity and insightful and opportune investments in inventory.\nNow I'd like to recap our full year and fourth quarter results. Total year -- our total sales for the year came in at $5.5 billion, which was down 10% from the record of 2022 and in line with our third quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, sales -- total sales came in at $1 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 or down 8%.\nGeographically, the sales declines were fairly consistent in 3 of our major markets and improved sequentially as the year progressed. For the full year, in the fourth quarter, we saw sales in California come in at minus 12% and 8%, respectively. In Texas, sales were consistent and down 10% in both periods. Arizona experienced similar results as we recorded sales down 9% for the full year and 8% -- down 8% for the quarter. Florida performed a bit better for the full year at down minus 5%, but declined 12% in the fourth quarter of 2023 against very strong comps of 20%, 22% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFor the full year and the fourth quarter, our sales declined 9% and 10% in our year-round markets and 13% and 7% in our seasonal markets showing improvement in the season and most of our year-round markets as the year progressed. For perspective, in 2022, our seasonal markets were up 8% for the year and up 15% in our year-round markets. I will now provide some color on our key product category sales compared to the full year and fourth quarter of last year.\nChemical sales were down 1.5% for the year, but up 1% for the fourth quarter. Considering the significant [ trichlor ] deflation that hit during the 2023 pool season and the softer start to the year in the first quarter, driven by excess inventory in the channel and the challenging weather pattern, we considered the full year result of down only 1.5%, a clear indication of us further expanding our share in this critical maintenance category.\nWe believe the significant price volatility exhibited from 2021 to 2023 will be behind us after we pass the first quarter of 2024 and that excess channel inventory has normalized. As it relates to our chemical supply initiatives, we made great progress on expanding our usage of SunCoast chemical packaging facility that we acquired as part of the Porpoise acquisition.\nIn 2023, our teams more than tripled the amount of chemicals produced and sourced from the strategic and very capable facility compared to 2022. These actions not only improve our surety of supply but also improve our profitability. Building Materials sales declined 9% for the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter. Considering that new pool construction was down an estimated 25% to 30% and that renovation and remodel was down around 12%, we are quite pleased with how the team performed in this highly profitable product group.\nOur proprietary NPT branded products expanded building material offering and convenient nationwide sales center and design center network remain the go-to source for discerning pool owners in our outstanding dealer base. No one has a more complete product offering or a more capable team that caters to the best builders and remodelers in the industry. We look towards the equipment pad, equipment sales decreased 9% for both the year and for the fourth quarter, demonstrating the resilience of the maintenance-related equipment demand and our best-in-class customer service despite lower new pool construction activity in 2023.\nDemand for heaters and cleaners the most discretionary product within the equipment category saw continued headwinds as we cycled through the demand that was pulled forward during the pandemic and cautious consumer spending on more discretionary pool item purchases. We remain confident that the ever-increasing installed base of pools and the need to modernize the older equipment pads and a desire to move towards the connected backyard present many years of incremental growth opportunities going forward.\nTurning to end markets. Our commercial business continued to grow at 9% for the full year and 5% for the fourth quarter. The growth in 2023 is on top of 27% growth for both the full year and the fourth quarter of 2023. We continue to invest in resources to expand our reach in the commercial pool market. In 2023, this investment included acquiring a commercial products wholesale distribution company, furthering our competitive efforts to serve the commercial pool markets, new construction and installed base equipment needs and utilize our expansive distribution infrastructure to service commercial pool operators.\nWe continue gaining wholesale distribution market share in this growing specialty area of the pool industry. Sales to our independent retail customers declined 11% for the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter. Unfavorable weather resulting in less chemical and maintenance needs and supply normalization affected our sales to independent retailers in the first half of 2023.\nWe have a high concentration of retailers that operate in seasonal markets that were adversely impacted by the late start to the year. Additionally, this category is heavily impacted by products like cleaners and pools and spas, which are all returning to pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind, this represents the sell to the retail channel.\nRetail sales by our independent Pinch A Penny retail stores, which are highly concentrated in Florida and Texas and represent sell through the retail channel increased 3% for the full year in 2023 compared to 2022 and declined 4% in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with this result, given the dynamic market and the tough comps we had.\nFor reference, Pinch A Penny grew 17% in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. Turning to Europe. As we previously reported, following record results in 2021, Europe sales declined 15% in 2022 under the backdrop of the war affecting Eastern Europe, resulting in rapidly escalating energy costs and an economic slowdown in customer -- or consumer caution. In 2023, European sales declined 11% in local currency for the full year and 7% in the fourth quarter.\nWe began to see some signs of inflection towards the end of the swimming pool season and believe our long-term growth opportunity in Europe remains strong. Keep in mind, this market makes up about 4% of our total revenue. For Horizon, net sales declined 4% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. Throughout 2023, stronger sales from commercial irrigation projects buffered weaker residential market sales. We continue to focus on expanding our reach, primarily through the Sunbelt and through greenfield expansion in growing markets and on leveraging our distribution operating model to support the long-term growth opportunities within the irrigation landscape and equipment needs.\nNow let me talk a little about gross margins. Our gross margins finished at 30% for the full year, consistent with our recent guidance and long-term expectations. We are proud of this accomplishment, which highlights our capabilities on supply chain optimization, our growing portfolio of private label products and value-added pricing initiatives. For the fourth quarter of 2023, our gross margins improved 50 basis points to 29.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMelanie will provide more details on gross margins in her prepared remarks. Operating expenses reflected a 0.6% increase in 2023, in line with our previous guidance. Despite the cyclical sales trends, we continued investing in our talent and on our employer of choice initiatives to make sure that we retained the best team in the industry and continue to separate ourselves from the competition.\nAdditionally, we continue to opening new locations, conducting customer-facing events and training and expanded capacity at our chemical packaging facility. In 2023, we opened 14 new locations and added 5 locations through acquisition, bringing our total count to almost 440 sales centers. We also expanded our Pinch A Penny distribution capabilities. Our Pinch A Penny franchise network added 15 new stores, over 2x the number of stores added to the franchise network last year, which is the most stores that the franchise has ever added in a year.\nTaking advantage of our synergies, we now serve the Pinch A Penny Texas stores through our localized distribution network. Our wide footprint and integrated distribution network open the door for us to expand quickly throughout the Sunbelt. While we continue to invest in growth-driven initiatives, we applied intense focus to controllable and variable expenses without compromising customer experience or service. Orders processed through our B2B POOL360 platform continue to grow in total lines, increasing 3% in 2023, growing from 11% of total lines in 2022 to 14% of total lines in 2023 or a nearly 30% increase in total lines.\nWe also increased total revenue dollars through the tool by 1% in 2023, showing sales through our digital tool growing faster -- growing at a rate faster than our overall net sales. These results demonstrate significant progress, particularly in this year's environment and the customers benefit it provides. We have put significant time and effort into improving this critical user feature like product search, product information and the overall user experience.\nWith a renewed innovative approach to our customer-facing solutions, we march towards transforming POOL360 from a B2B tool to a complete customer-facing digital ecosystem. Last year, we revamped the POOL360 ordering platform. In 2023, building on our next-generation POOL360 application, we launched our POOL360 water solution software. And just last week, launched our POOL360 service platform. These are all incredible tools for our customers that will continue to gain traction for years to come.\nPOOL360 water provides best-in-class in-store and mobile water analysis and offer solutions that help us grow our private label chemical products and improve brand awareness. Water testing from a variety of methods from liquid titration to digital are all fed into the tool, delivering a proprietary diagnosis and chemical dosage recommendation that will ensure a safe and healthy swimming pool.\nPOOL360 water allows all of our dealers to offer consistent, accurate advice to pool owners and operators while creating demand for our tremendous chemical offering. This tool also has embedded in it a CRM that will help the stores provide an unparalleled customer experience. POOL360 service designed for our service customers, large and small, includes the CIRM and applications to better manage their business through facilitating daily routes, quoting and securing onetime service requests, automating, invoicing and collections, enhancing electronic ordering and integrating procurement with our already established POOL360 account.\nOver the next few years, we plan to add more phases to this digital ecosystem to further add productivity and help our customers grow their business more quickly. For all 3 platforms, customers can leverage our proprietary best-in-class digital marketing resources that will help them drive profitable growth for their business. Recognize we are in the early stages of customer adoption, but we see tremendous opportunity to help our retail and service customers expand their offering, provide unique professional services and connect directly and easily to our products.\nMoving on, let me comment on our operating income performance. We recorded $747 million in operating income in 2023, down from a record $1 billion in 2022, but up $405 million from 2019. For the quarter, we recorded $79 million in operating income, a 26% decline from 2022, but over 3x the operating income of the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating margins for the full year of 2023 was 13.5% compared to a record 16.6% in 2022 and expanded 280 basis points from 2019, demonstrating our ability to leverage fixed costs and effectively manage variable expenses generating enhanced operating margins while making growth-oriented investments in our business.\nWith 2023 behind us, let me comment on the future. I remain excited and very confident in the long-term growth potential for our industry and specifically POOLCORP. A growing and aging installed base drives 85% of our revenue through continual maintenance and periodic renovation and upgrading needs. We will continue to do what we do best in serving the nondiscretionary maintenance needs, which made up over 60% of our business in 2023. We expect slight growth from our maintenance product components in 2024, assuming normal weather conditions.\nFurther, no one is better positioned to serve the pool professional considering our scale, industry-leading talent and digital platform and tools. With DIY market, we have added considerable capabilities to enhance our independent retail products and service offering, and we'll continue to expand Pinch A Penny network to grow share in this important aftermarket and maintenance and repair category. We expect inflationary increases to benefit our consolidated business again in 2024 with an estimated 2% to 3% added to our overall top line.\nWe believe chemical pricing to have largely stabilized, equipment pricing remained solid as expected and that we will see some fluctuations on commodities that make up a very small portion of our sales. New pool construction represented just under 15% of our business in 2023. Currently, we expect that new pool construction in units could be flat to down 10%, although likely to reflect higher pool values. The number could vary broadly by market and geography.\nWhile the full impact of the interest rate hikes over the past couple of years and timing of future interest rate cuts remain uncertain, the long-term outlook for outdoor living products growth remains strong. As higher borrowing rates and recent inflation have increased the cost of building a swimming pool to approximately $80,000, we expect budget-conscious consumers will likely stay on the sidelines and more affluent consumers seeking pools with enhanced features and products content will drive the mix of new pools towards the higher end again in 2024.\nMillennials are outpacing other generations seeking homes and with the slowdown of existing home sales, new construction is making up for the housing shortage, creating new available backyards or swimming pools in the future, but at a slower rate than we have seen for the last several years. We carefully watch this trend and considered it as part of our expansion strategy to ensure that we are located to effectively serve where the new pools will be.\nAutomation and connected products remain a high priority for all and particularly for this generation, driving how we work with our vendor partners to provide the most efficient channel to market for introducing new technology-enabled products. Renovation and remodel activity should be stable in most markets, but about 10% of the installed base contemplating a renovation on an annual basis.\nSurfaces wear out are a need of a more modern look. Equipment gets outdated and becomes uneconomical to operate, maintain or repair. As we have discussed, we consider this market to be semi-discretionary. So larger R&R sales could potentially be flat to down 10% if higher interest rates persist, but this too will cycle with the economy and borrowing costs. We consider this not an if market, but a win market as all pools will need renovation periodically during their normal life cycle.\nConsidering these sales variables, we are estimating an EPS range for 2024 to be $13.10 to $14.10 on a per share basis, including an estimated $0.10 benefit from ASU. Melanie will provide additional comments on gross margin and expenses in her comments that will help you understand our view. We expect that cash flow from operating activities will be in line with net income, and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.\nWe will use our robust cash flow to invest in our operations, growth and expansion. We will fund strategic acquisitions and with the approval of our Board, continue to pay dividends and consider share repurchases while maintaining a prudent debt structure ultimately providing exceptional returns to our shareholders.\nOur competitive position has never been stronger. We remain approximately 5x larger than our nearest competitor and have a history of being relentlessly focused on execution. This execution focus is further enhanced by a new spirit of innovation that will allow us to provide unmatched customer value and support, which will enable us to continue gaining share.\nNo doubt, the rate of new pool construction has slowed. Consumers are more cautious today than in the last few years, but there is a desirability of pool ownership at outdoor living is strong and will get even stronger. It is imperative that we continue investing that we continue our focus on the customer and on investments in the future to ensure we get stronger.\nThe demand environment will change as the economy changes and monetary policy evolves, but that impacts only the smaller portion of our business, which is one of the most unique things about the industry. Don't lose sight of the fact that this industry continuously grows upon itself, and no other company is better positioned to weather the cycles and continuously improve like POOLCORP.\nI am proud of the continued progress -- I am proud of our continued progress as the clear leader of our industry and confident in our superior value proposition, of which each of our 6,000-plus employees work hard to improve each and every day. In closing, I want to say thank you to the POOLCORP team. As I reflect on this year, it has been a tough one. But because of you, we are a better and stronger company than ever.\nI also want to thank our supplier partners and most importantly, our customers, for helping millions of people enjoy the benefits of healthy outdoor living and making the memories of a lifetime. I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, for her detailed commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our fourth quarter results, move into how we finished out 2023 and then cover what we are seeing as we start 2024. Net sales for fourth quarter showed a modestly improved trend, down 8.4% versus negative 8.7% for the third quarter of 2023 when compared to the prior year. Inflation moderated as expected and was an approximate 1% benefit for the quarter.\nWe realized a 29.3% gross margin during the quarter, an improvement of 20 basis points from third quarter 2023 and a 50 basis point improvement over fourth quarter 2022. The year-over-year change includes a margin decrease from the prior year inventory gain benefit, offset by the additional 120 basis points for import taxes recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 3% over last year's fourth quarter. Cost inflation in occupancy, wages and insurance expenses continue to be largely mitigated by sales center operating efficiency improvement and cost management.\nOperating income of $79 million for the quarter represents a decrease of 26% from prior year operating income of $107 million. Operating margin was 7.9% in the quarter compared to 9.8% in Q4 of 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.32 compared to $1.82 in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting lower operating income, slightly offset by less interest expense.\nNow I'll move on to a review of our full year 2023 results. Other than comparing to a record 2022, full year 2023 represented a very strong performance. As our industry transitions from heightened demand of the pandemic period and the effects of inflation and supply chain disruptions, we successfully rightsized our inventory position, invested for future growth with 14 greenfield sales centers and 5 acquired sales centers, covering all parts of our business and opened 15 new Pinch A Penny franchise stores, introduced new customer-enabling technology, held our operating expenses approximately flat, generated over $820 million in free cash flow, reduced outstanding borrowings by over $330 million and returned almost $475 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAll in all, we're proud of our performance in 2023, as we demonstrated the resilience in our operating model and positioned ourselves for successful future growth. We finished 2023 with net sales of $5.5 billion, a decrease of 10.3% from prior year record of sales. Within net sales, we realized approximately 3% of product cost inflation benefit. Lower levels of net sales were driven principally by reduced new pool construction activities expected to be down around 25% in units built and lower pool renovation and remodel activity, which combined represents approximately 7 percentage points of the reduced total sales during the year.\nUnfavorable weather during the first half of the year resulted in 2% lower net sales. Lower customer early buys primarily due to higher customer inventory at the start of the year and chemical and commodity pricing are estimated to have contributed an additional 2 percentage points of the negative impact on sales in the maintenance portion of the business.\nAdditional impact representing the remaining 2 percentage points were attributable to declines in sales of certain discretionary products, such as heaters and cleaners and lower Horizon and Europe sales activity during the year. Lower levels of new pool construction in 2023 slightly changed our estimate of the composition of our North American net sales.\nFor 2022, we estimated sales of new construction-related products were approximately 17%. Renovation and remodel product sales comprised roughly 22% and maintenance product sales represented the remaining approximately 61%. In 2023, the lower level of new construction product sales moved that portion of our business closer to 14%, with renovation and remodel product sales estimated at 24% and the remaining 62% coming from maintenance. Based on our sales activity of certain products, specifically used in new pool construction, we appear to have outperformed the market as our decreases for these products were less severe than the total market as indicated by reported new pool permit decreases and preliminary estimates of total new pool units constructed in 2023.\nGross margin finished the full year in line with our long-term target of 30%. As we see in a typical year, we expect pluses or minuses each quarter due to seasonality and product sales mix variations. During the year, each of our quarters saw varying fluctuations from normal seasonal patterns as we realize remaining benefits of lower cost inventory, impact from the slow start to the season, product mix changes and lower vendor incentives resulting from lower purchase level.\nOperating expenses increased $6 million to $913 million, only a 0.6% increase over 2022, including $12 million related to greenfield sales centers opened and locations acquired during the year. Increased wage inflation, occupancy costs and continued investments in digital transformation and technology were partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation and volume-related sales expenses.\nThe investments in new sales at our development and digital transformation are expected to generate additional sales growth and capacity as market conditions stabilize and industry growth returns to normalized levels. Operating margin of 13.5%, decreased 310 basis points compared to the prior year record operating margin of 16.6%, which represented a significant expansion compared to pre-pandemic operating margin levels as we have leveraged scale benefits even when revenue dollars have normalized over prior year and our gross margin rate came in consistent with our long-term target.\nWe received an ASU benefit of $7 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the full year, of which $0.02 was added in the fourth quarter and not included in our prior guidance. Full year tax rate, excluding the ASU, was 25%. Earnings per share for 2023 of $13.35, decreased 29% when compared to the record $18.70 we earned in 2022. Without the impact of the ASU in both periods, our EPS of $13.18 compared to $18.43 was a decrease of 28%. Cash flow from operating activities increased to a record $888 million, an improvement of $403 million over 2022. This includes cash benefit from our strong operating results and a net benefit from our working capital management, including inventory reduction efforts that contributed $230 million.\nMoving to comments on our balance sheet. We ended the year with accounts receivable totaling $343 million, down $9 million from year-end 2022 and days sales outstanding of 26.8 days comparable to prior year. A great job by the team working to meet our customer needs, especially during a tough demand environment. During the third quarter, we reported on our inventory reduction goals and accomplishments.\nEven with higher early buy inventory receipt activity during the fourth quarter, we executed almost $230 million reduction in inventory balances year-over-year, including the impact of higher-than-normal number of new locations opened, acquisitions and current year inflation. We expect to see a seasonal increase in first quarter ahead of the 2024 season, but plan to maintain inventory balances throughout 2024 that are lower than 2023.\nWe reduced total debt outstanding by $330 million to $1.05 billion compared to year-end 2022. Total borrowing levels remain below our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2x, finishing the year with a leverage ratio of 1.4x. We also repurchased $306 million of our stock, including $119 million in the fourth quarter, reducing our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 800,000 compared to the full year 2023.\nAdditionally, in May 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 10% to $1.10 when compared with share repurchases, we returned almost $475 million to our shareholders, the second highest year in our history. Next, I'll comment on our outlook for 2024. Pete has included in his comments our expectations regarding the market in 2024 and the timing of net sales growth recovery.\nWith that as a backdrop, we expect to continue to outperform the market in 2024. We are currently expecting flat to low single-digit sales increases in 2024, with a 2% to 3% pricing benefit on a blended product line basis and could potentially see a 1% to 2% benefit from normalized weather, primarily attributable to the first 2 quarters. This considers our expectation that maintenance will rise slightly with the increase in installed base of pools and discretionary product sales will still see some pressures until economic conditions stabilize.\nOur guidance considers volume expectations on renovation and remodel and new construction markets continuing at similar levels to 2023 at the high end and the potential for a decrease of up to 10% at the low end. Horizon in Europe could also see modest pressure up to a 5% decline at the low end. During 2024, we will see an increase of 2 selling days with 1 in the third quarter and 1 in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, given the timing of extra days, we expect the impact to be less than 1%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be near our long-term guidance target of 30%. Margin will vary seasonally over the quarters as it has historically, with second quarter typically reflecting the highest gross margin for the year. We expect that the carryover from the remainder of the lower cost inventory sold through in first quarter of 2023 will be substantially similar to the benefit we will get in 2024 from the normalized vendor early buys that took place at the end of 2023.\nHowever, the lower level of customer early buys in first quarter 2023 was also a benefit to margins in prior year from which we are not expecting a corresponding impact in 2024. We will see the remaining effect on margins from the lower selling prices of chemicals and commodities also in the first quarter. And at current pricing, there should be minimal impact on second quarter. Wages, rent and other operating costs are still a headwind, resulting in modest expense increases in 2024.\nBut our ongoing capacity creation projects throughout the company will drive improved productivity. We plan to continue accelerating our technology initiatives that will exert pressure on the short-term operating margin improvement. However, these additive investments are intended to drive long-term strategic growth, provide increased capacity to grow and drive continued future operating efficiency.\nSpecifically, we have considered in our SG&A cost guidance incremental expense of $15 million for normalized performance-based compensation, $12 million for new greenfield locations we will open in 2024 and a $20 million incremental investment in our technology initiatives. Overall, we expect 2024 operating margin to be approximately 13%. Interest expense should be between $50 million and $53 million based on current rates and excluding any share repurchases.\nDepreciation and amortization for 2024 is anticipated to be in the range of $44 million. We are estimating a $0.10 benefit from ASU in the first quarter for the expected impact of restricted shares vesting and stock options expiring in 2024. Our annual tax rate is projected to be approximately 25.3% excluding ASU.\nFor weighted average shares outstanding that will be applied to the net income attributable to common shareholders, we expect approximately 38.7 million shares at the end of Q1 and 38.8 million shares for the remaining quarters with no additional share buybacks. This results in guidance for 2024 diluted EPS of $13.10 to $14.10, including the $0.10 ASU benefit. The midpoint of our guidance represents a 2.4% improvement excluding the ASU.\nAfter our record cash flows in 2023, we would expect to see 2024 return to normalized levels of around 100% of net income. Our consistent capital allocation priorities include uses of cash of around 1% to 1.5% of net sales on organic growth, such as ongoing capital expenditures and sales center expansions. We also plan to continue strategic acquisitions, authorized dividends and share buybacks.\nWe ended the year with $344 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. In 2023, 58% or the majority of our cash flow from operating activities was generated in the second half of the year as is typical from a seasonal standpoint. Since 2019, we have reported increased sales of 73%. Gains from inflation and market share over the 2020 to 2022 higher growth period coupled with acquisitions and relative stability of higher levels of inflation and product cost remain.\nWe also continue to realize higher margin from acquired sales and supply chain and pricing initiatives versus our 2019 levels. Our decision to continue to invest in 2023 and as we move forward to 2024 in areas that have proven can position us for long-term growth while improving our operations and strengthening our leading position in the market will allow us to continue long-term shareholder value.\nThank you for joining today's call. We are now ready to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call.\nOur discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2023 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.\nWe will begin today's call with comments from Peter Arvan, our President and CEO. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call.\nOur third quarter results came in largely as expected. As the 2023 swimming pool season winds down, we consider our results to be solid on a stand-alone basis, particularly when considering the dynamic conditions we have been operating in.\nThe third quarter carried on with typical summer weather conditions overall, allowing us to evaluate our performance and in the industry environment on a mostly weather-neutral basis. Our third quarter 2023 sales of $1.5 billion is a 9% decline compared to 2022 and with one less selling day, but exceeded 2021 third quarter sales by $63 million, or 4%. As expected, sales declines continued to moderate in the third quarter, showing sequential improvement versus the 10% and 15% declines we saw in the second and first quarter of 2023.\nIn view of the neutral weather conditions during the third quarter, our sales trends across our major markets were relatively consistent. Starting with the year-round markets, sales declined 5% for the quarter in Florida compared to the third quarter last year, with Arizona finishing down 8%, California down 10% and Texas down 11%.\nFor context, last year, in the same quarter, Florida sales were up 20%, Arizona was up 18%, California was up 16% and Texas was up 10%, respectively, versus the third quarter of 2021. This simply highlights the difficult comps that we were up against this year. Year-round base business declined 8%, while seasonal base business markets declined 10%, a slight sequential improvement from the 9% and 11% decline in the second quarter of 2023. Again, for comparison, last year in the same period, we saw growth in our year-round base business markets of 15% and 5% in our seasonal base business markets.\nMoving on to product category results. Chemical sales increased 5% in the third quarter, mostly driven by increased volume as chemical pricing came in relatively flat for our collective offering. Our strong footprint, leading proprietary products and enhanced technology tools gives us an unmatched value proposition and contributed to our share growth.\nBuilding material sales for the quarter were down 13%. This category includes products necessary for both new pool construction and renovation and remodel projects. The building material trend continues to suggest that renovation and remodel demand is stable and outperforming new pool construction and our MPT footprint and product offering enables us to outperform the industry in this category. Equipment sales declined 9% in the quarter. As you can see, this implies solid demand for maintenance and repair despite the softer demand for new pool construction and renovation and remodel.\nLooking at end markets, commercial pool product demand remained strong in the third quarter, with sales up 10%. Sales to our independent retail customers were down 8% for the third quarter, an improvement from the 11% decline and 16% decline we saw in the second and first quarters of this year.\nPinch A Penny franchisees collectively reported sales growth of 1% for the quarter. The franchisees generated solid sales for their maintenance products, but weaker sales of discretionary items in line with what we are seeing across our distribution business. Europe's third quarter sales showed a 2% decline in local currency, a notable improvement from the 7% and 22% decline in the second and first quarters of 2023.\nEurope has been challenging for the past 15 to 18 months, and we are encouraged by this more favorable trend. For Horizon, sales declined 7% during the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, sales activities for commercial projects remained stronger than residential.\nMoving on to gross margins, where we ended the third quarter at 29.1%. Consistent with our past thinking, we believe gross margins for the full year will be an approximate -- will be approximately our long-term guidance of the 30% range. As is typical, Melanie will provide more details on what to expect in the fourth quarter gross margins in her comments.\nEven while continuing to invest in new locations, acquisitions and technology during the quarter, we reduced operating expenses by 2% compared to last year. The team did a good job managing expenses that typically ramp up during the season in light of the softer demand environment. Thankfully, the team has been focused on capacity creation for many years, and that helps us offset inflationary headwinds and leverages our fixed expenses, leading to a 15.9% operating expense percentage.\nPOOL360, our B2B tool, saw sales increase 5% over the prior year, a higher growth rate than our overall sales activity. The line volume growth for the same period was 3% and demonstrates the tool's contribution to our capacity creation effort, while also improving the customer experience and productivity and adding value to our business and our customers. We view this tool as best-in-class, providing multiple benefits for both our customers and the local operating teams.\nOperating income for the third quarter of 2023 was $194 million, down $69 million compared to last year. This, however, represents an 85% improvement over 2019. Our reported third quarter operating margin of 13.2% is 10-basis-point expansion from 2019 and a 20-basis-point expansion from 2020, showing the sustainability of our fixed cost leverage initiatives.\nDuring the third quarter, we added two new greenfield locations. This puts us at 10 new greenfield locations for the 2023 season, a further testament to our strong bent and refined expansion process. In addition to our organic openings, we added four new locations through acquisitions this year. Additionally, we expanded our Pinch A Penny franchise network by adding two new franchise customers in the quarter, bringing the new franchise store count to 11 for this year.\nWe continue to prioritize organic growth investment as the future of the business, which not only expands our customer reach, but also creates capacity for additional products and service offerings at our existing locations. Melanie will be commenting on most of the balance sheet items, but I would like to highlight one significant accomplishment that is the work that is the work that the team did on rightsizing our inventory.\nBecause of the tremendous effort of our team, in conjunction with our vendor partners, the team surpassed our inventory reduction goal and delivered a reduction of over $216 million year-to-date. This was done while expanding our footprint, integrating acquisitions and maintaining best-in-class inventory availability. This achievement helped us generate $750 million in operating cash flow through September 30, a company record and nearly 2.5x that of this time last year.\nAs we move into the final quarter of the year, we have proven that even in the most difficult operating conditions, our experienced team delivers an unmatched value proposition, which enables us to outperform the industry and expand our share. We have built the largest, fully integrated network of sales centers in the industry, and we are adding new locations faster than anyone, with a proven process that delivers a solid ROI.\nWe have a vertically integrated chemical packaging operation and the broadest selection of proprietary building material products from pool tile to finish, over 135 NPT showrooms and design centers, four centralized shipping locations for importing consolidation, industry-leading technology solutions for our customers and our own use and best-in-class retail franchise development and support operations. Perhaps most importantly, we have over 6,000 employees that operate in a performance-based culture that know how to compete and win.\nWhile new pool construction is likely to finish down -- with units down 30% in 2023, we still expect about 70,000 additional pools will be expanding ever-growing installed base of pools where we derive over 80% of our revenue. No doubt, the current macroeconomic environment is tough, but the desirability of swimming pools and outdoor living has never been stronger, and we do not see that changing. We firmly believe that even with fewer pools being built, our share and the value of our products on a per pool basis has grown. We know that renovation activity will continue as homeowners upgrade both services and pool technology to enhance their backyard oasis.\nWe believe that our relentless focus on delivering a second-to-none customer experience positions us better than anyone in the industry to serve the pool professional and support the specialty retailers that cater to the DIY owner. In short, we believe in the long-term growth characteristics of the industry, the strength of our company and we believe in our team.\nAs I look back on the pool season, I'm very proud of our team that has remained focused on innovation, execution and collaborative partnerships to deliver a customer experience that, as I said, is second to none. Lastly, with over 3 quarters of the year behind us, we have narrowed our annual earnings guidance and now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $13.15 to $13.65, including the impact of year-to-date tax benefits of $0.15.\nMelanie will now provide additional details in our financial commentary. Melanie?\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete. Net sales for the quarter finished at $1.5 billion, a 9% decrease from prior year record sales in the third quarter. We estimate a year-over-year quarterly sales decline in the range of 5% related to new pool construction, which is trending as expected, with units likely to show a 30% decline for the year.\nRemodel activity, with a roughly 3% year-over-year comparative decrease effect on our top line, is outperforming new pool construction, but still at lower levels from prior year and in the range of our previously estimated down 10% to 15%. We also saw several other areas, which each represented an approximately 1% decline in net sales.\nFirst, we had one less selling day in the quarter compared to last year. Secondly, selling prices on commodities, including trichlor. Pricing on trichlor is showing recent signs of stabilizing. But during the quarter, selling prices were approximately 20% lower than third quarter of last year. Third, volumes on certain discretionary products, such as above-ground pools, heaters and cleaners, reflected weakness, suggesting consumer hesitation on these more discretionary items.\nOutside of these products, maintenance spend remains relatively stable. Inflation continued to provide an overall advantage, resulting in a benefit of approximately 2% to 3% for the quarter. Net sales from acquisitions or new market openings contributed less than 1% in the quarter. And therefore, we have not broken out these activities from base business separately in the press release as they had an insignificant impact on the financial information for the quarter.\nGross margin was 29.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a typical sequential decrease from second quarter. Gross margin was 210 basis points less than prior year, resulting from the expected decrease in inventory gains realized in 2022 that benefit from investments in inventory ahead of the multiple inflationary price increases. Other items impacting margins in the quarter, our product mix, including the lower selling prices on trichlor and new construction and remodel activity, which resulted in building materials, seeing a higher year-over-year decrease than other products.\nCustomer mix, such as a higher proportion of sales to larger customers, also had a negative impact on margins when comparing to 2022. Weaker industry demand and wrapping up of channel inventory rationalization contributed to a more competitive pricing environment, causing some modest additional pressure on gross margins during the quarter.\nWe also saw lower purchasing incentives than a normal year in conjunction with our inventory reduction plan. SG&A expenses continue to be very well managed, reflecting a 2% decrease year-over-year after seeing a 3% decrease in the second quarter as these two seasonally larger quarters have the most ability to benefit from reductions of volume-related expenses.\nOperating expenses compared to prior year also includes the impact of four locations added from acquisitions and 14 new sales center openings since third quarter of last year. Additionally, expenses for the third quarter include a $550,000 goodwill impairments.\nOperating margin of 13.2% was 300 basis points less than prior year, reflecting the 210 basis points impact from gross margin and effects of lower top line revenue. We reported 11.6% operating margin in third quarter 2019. So we have been able to maintain benefits in our operating margin.\nInterest expense on a comparative basis for the third quarter resulted in a $1.9 million increase in expense as a result of higher rates, offsetting a significant reduction in debt outstanding. As is consistent with prior years, our third quarter tax rate is generally the lowest quarterly rate, with all other quarters being slightly higher and averaging to our full year rate.\nThird quarter EPS, excluding ASU of $3.50 compares to $4.78 in third quarter 2022. Despite the decline from our record 2022 results, these earnings highlight our ability to retain the majority of the significant growth seen throughout the 2020 to 2022 period as Q3 '23 results are higher -- 90% higher than the third quarter of 2019. Our credit and collections process and management of trade receivables remains a business advantage, with DSO of 26.3 days at the end of the quarter, comparable to prior year.\nI was confident in our ability to execute when I stated our inventory reduction goal at the beginning of the year, to bring down inventory by $260 million. In fact, we were able to reduced inventory $332 million from December 2022, even with acquisitions, new locations and current year inflation, exceeding our goal.\nIn the fourth quarter, we plan to selectively participate in vendor early buys that we determine to make strategic sense for us. As we look ahead to the 2024 season, we are expecting to see a range of price increases for next season of around 3% to 4% based on some equipment vendor pricing announcements to date. This will result in dollar growth in inventory from third to fourth quarter as we would normally build inventory to be ready for next season. There will be no cash flow impact in 2023 from early buy shipments we received before year-end as these purchases will be done on deferred payment terms.\nWe generated $750 million in cash flow from operating activities year-to-date. We have also completed $137 million of open market share repurchases during the quarter, leaving $463 million available under our authorization. We have also reduced debt by $479 million from the same time last year and $353 million from year-end 2022. Our debt leverage ratio remains conservative at 1.48 and at the low end of our stated target expectations of 1.5 to 2x.\nAs we finish out the year, we are confirming that our sales expectations for 2023 is to be down in the range of negative 10%. For the fourth quarter, we would expect to see sales down mid- to high single digits, mostly dependent on the weather and how the level of new pool construction finishes out the year. The one less selling day that we reported in the third quarter will not be made up in the fourth quarter, and so we will have one less selling day for the full year. Gross margin for the full year will approximate our long-term guidance of 30%.\nFourth quarter is seasonally expected to be less than the full year rate. Our range for margin for fourth quarter is expected to be around 29%, but could vary in either direction. Margins in the fourth quarter will be reduced by the year-over-year increase in average cost we have seen to date as we compare against last year's fourth quarter that benefited from lower cost inventory.\nFrom a comparative view, this will primarily offset the 120 basis points negative impact recorded in fourth quarter '22 for the additional import tax expense. Additionally, we would expect to see some continued pressures on margins from product mix, similar to what we saw in the third quarter. The other structural benefits we have discussed on gross margin all remain.\nOur target for full year operating expense growth is still to limit base business expense growth to 1%. Fourth quarter will not see the year-over-year decrease in operating expenses we saw in second and third quarter due to the lower volume-related expenses in the smaller quarter, but the year-over-year increase will not be as high as we saw in first quarter.\nFull year interest expense is expected to be approximately $61 million. Our fourth quarter tax rate will be consistent with our rate in first and second quarter to result in our full year expected rate of between 25% to 25.2%. The expected annual rate is similar to our prior year rate, excluding ASU.\nOur guidance on uses for capital allocation are the same as those discussed at the end of the second quarter, with a use of cash of approximately $25 million on acquisitions, $60 million on capital expenditures and $170 million on cash dividends, reflecting the 10% quarterly increase approved in the second quarter. We will continue to retire debt and repurchase stock opportunistically throughout the balance of the year, with the remaining excess cash flow.\nWe have completed $180 million of share buybacks to date, leaving our expected share count for fourth quarter to be 39.3 million shares and weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the full year will also be 39.3 million, down 700,000 from last year.\nWe have narrowed our range for our EPS guidance for the full year 2023 to $13.15 to $13.65, including the $0.15 ASU tax benefit realized to date. Providing a narrower range in the third quarter after completion of the full season is consistent with our historical process.\nThird quarter came in very much in alignment with our latest expectations. Our focus on operational improvements and customer experience will allow us to continue to support our customers and provide them the broadest product selection with continued opportunities to grow their business.\nWe will now begin our Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nAnd welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2023 and future periods.\nActual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K. In addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section. Pete Arvan, our President and CEO, will begin today's call. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning. 3 months ago, you will recall that we said the year was off to a challenging start driven primarily by weather, but we cautiously believe at the time that as the year progressed, things would improve. Although things did improve sequentially, allowing us to post the second best quarter in our company's history, they did not improve as much as we would have liked as weather continued to provide headwinds and new construction remains under pressure.\nOne notable exception to this is for high-end new construction where demand remains solid. The weather change that we count on to initiate the start of the pool season came later than what we have seen for the last couple of years. This effectively shortened our season as homeowners delayed openings into cooler weather kept water temperatures lower, which negatively impacts our maintenance business, particularly chemical usage.\nHigher interest rates and uncertain macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh heavily on new pool construction, particularly at the lower end of the market. Additionally, we have seen some indication that more discretionary purchases like heaters and high-end cleaners have been deferred, but we are seeing resiliency in the remodel market.\nDealers are reporting that demand for renovation is outpacing demand for new construction in many markets. Despite the challenging market conditions, POOLCORP recorded a strong quarter, demonstrating the power of the brand and tremendous execution by the team.\nWe continue to invest in our growth and focus on the customer experience, which is helping us retain and grow our market share. We have opened 8 new sales centers since the beginning of the year, far more than the rest of the industry combined. In Japan, we added 9 new stores since the beginning of the year, adding to our already impressive network of over 275 franchise stores.\nOur ability to manage operating expenses in a declining demand environment is noticeable as our operating expenses declined 3% on a year-over-year basis in a quarter even though we continue to invest in our new locations, new technology and our people.\nPOOL360 adoption is growing as dealers are recognizing the added benefit and time savings that they receive by using the latest release of the tool. Additionally, we are launching our POOL360 water test application at our independent retailers, which is a best-in-class online water testing solution that helps dealers provide water chemistry excellence and drive sales of our private label chemical brands.\nOur strong balance sheet has gotten even stronger as we have generated over $377 million of cash from operations, paid down debt, reduced inventory while providing best-in-class service. As in past recessionary periods, we get stronger and we'll exit this cycle stronger than ever. When I step back and look at the revised earnings outlook that we reported this morning and put it in context to historical results, not just 2022, I'm proud of how the team is performing and all that we have accomplished.\nOur market share is improving. The team is more focused than ever on providing best-in-class service. Of course, we are disappointed to report a year-over-year decrease in sales. But when you put things in perspective in this environment, we have achieved a 93% growth in sales and EPS growth of almost 200% from 2019 to 2022.\nOur North American market has been expanded by over 311,000 new pools built in the last 3 years. Over 30% product inflation has passed through the channel, market growth from new products, strategic acquisitions, continued market share gains and consistent renovation and remodel activity of the aging installed base all gives us confidence in the future.\nOur size, scale and unmatched experience in the industry allows us to excel in each of these areas and outperform the competition because we have the broadest footprint, the best talent in the industry and the swift is access to capital, allowing us to prudently and responsibly invest during all business cycles.\nEven with these negative impacts, our second quarter 2023 sales of $1.9 billion exceeded 2021 second quarter sales by $70 million or 4% as adverse weather carried over into April, then varied in impact by geography for the rest of the quarter, the negative trend on top line moderated in the second quarter to minus 10% compared to the first quarter where sales declined 15%.\nWhen we look at our year-round base business markets, the impact of varying weather patterns are apparent. For the second quarter, we saw California sales decline 8%, which is a sequential improvement when compared to the weather-driven down 24% that we saw in the first quarter. For reference, California sales increased 9% in the second quarter of 2022 and 33% in the second quarter of 2021.\nMoving to Arizona. Sales declined 7%, which again is a significant improvement over the 14% decline that we saw in the first quarter. For historical context, sales in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 were up 20% and 24%, respectively, in Arizona.\nTexas experienced cooler temperatures throughout the second quarter and significant precipitation in May, resulting in a 13% decrease over last year and trending down from the 6% first quarter decrease. For perspective, sales in Texas increased 17% in the second quarter of 2022 and 30% in the second quarter of 2021.\nFlorida sales decreased 7% over last year, where for the quarter, we observed typical weather for this time of year other than a wetter June. You will remember that Florida sales was up 7% in the first quarter, bringing the year-to-date number to essentially flat. We have seen a slowdown in Florida new construction, but we must keep in mind that Florida experienced a 23% and 35% growth for the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, so it remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to our seasonal markets. Our sales declined 11% in the second quarter, in contrast to the 23% decrease we experienced in the first quarter. Although we observed some improvement as the ground began to thaw, key areas such as Canada, the Northeast and Midwest still experienced temperatures below swimming standards through June.\nSales in our seasonal markets grew 5% and 32% in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pricing on equipment continues to hold with overall sales down 8% for the quarter and less unfavorable than the declines in new construction. Chemical sales in the quarter were down 3%, driven by the weather patterns I discussed earlier and trichlor pricing came down more than we saw in the first quarter, resulting in a 1% drag on consolidated sales for the quarter.\nBuilding material sales for the quarter were down 8%, continuing to indicate renovation and remodel numbers are faring somewhat better than anticipated despite the lower new pool construction. As consumers take advantage of leisure travel, our commercial swimming pool sales continued to see an uptick with net sales for the quarter, increasing 8% following a 12% increase in the first quarter over last year.\nJapan franchisees collectively reported relatively flat sales for the quarter compared to last year. The franchisees have seen overall impact from less sales of discretionary items such as equipment and recreational items, but nondiscretionary sales are steady. Sales to our independent retail customers were up 11%, an improvement over the 16% decrease that we saw in the first quarter.\nEurope's second quarter sales remained challenged and were down 6% compared to the prior year, but also saw a seasonal increase in trend improvement from the 25% decrease they recorded in the first quarter. In the Horizon business, base business sales were flat for the quarter, an improvement over the 7% decrease we reported in the first quarter. Our irrigation and product category a strength for us, performed well, particularly boosted by commercial projects but growth was offset by some pricing pressures on commodities, which have seen higher levels of inflation over the last couple of years.\nPOOL360, our B2B tool saw sales increased 3% over prior years, which continued to be better than total sales activity. Line volume growth for the same period was 4%, which indicates an accelerating adoption rate as our customers find value in the tool. We are encouraged by the resiliency of our gross margins, which came in at 30.6% in the quarter where competition has increased due to softer new pool construction and current market conditions. Melanie will provide more detail on this topic in her comments.\nDuring the quarter, our operating expenses were 13% of net sales, an improvement over the 18.6% of net sales we reported in the first quarter. We saw good leverage on our fixed expenses and continue to add new sales centers, opening 3 during the quarter to expand our market presence. We also continue to invest in and expand our employer of choice initiatives and customer-facing programs to ensure we can expand our service offering to our customers.\nOperating income for the second quarter of 2023 was $327 million, down $92 million compared to last year, an almost 90% increase over 2019. With our reported operating margins of 17.6%, you can see that we've held on to the majority of the benefits we realized as the business rapidly grew over the last 3 years due to our disciplined execution.\nDuring the second quarter, we added 5 new locations, 2 acquired and 3 green deals. This puts us at 8 new greenfield distribution locations to date, keeping us on track to open around 10 for the full year. We also expanded our Pinch A Penny franchise network by adding 4 new franchise customers in the quarter.\nWe continue to invest in the future of the business as we expect to return to steady historical growth after lapping the swift ramp that we have seen over the last several years. Last quarter, we began to experience the impact of weather, heightened interest rates, lower consumer spending and the end of COVID tailwinds. As part of our full year expectations, we believe we can see new pool construction down 30% with around 70,000 new pools being added to the installed base in 2023.\nWe expect some increases in the average spend on new pools built this year as lower priced pools are experiencing stiffer headwinds than higher-priced units that typically are less dependent on financing. Our product offering continues to expand and we are adding additional capabilities to our sales centers.\nSimilarly, on remodel and renovation activities in a typical year, we would see around 10% or 550,000 pools, upgrading their pad equipment and taking advantage of new automation, more efficient pumps, alternative sanitizers, all of which increase the ease of pool ownership. Renovation remodel activities often involve changing the look of the pool in the backyard using our proprietary tile, PoolFinish and deck material selections.\nThe owners of the 5.4 million in-ground pools are continuing to spend approximately $1,000 or more on full maintenance annually, although some may choose to defer installation to more discretionary items in times of economic stress. Chemicals and minor repairs will continue on these bodies of waters along with the unground pools and spas that also saw accelerated growth over the last few years.\nWhile we are expecting a decline in sales in the current year mostly due to tough comps, we are comparing against on a year-over-year basis, the long-term outlook of the industry as a whole remains strong. The installed base is bigger than 2019 and continues to grow. Equipment and most all other is holding and continues to buoy the top line.\nAs I mentioned earlier, some trichlor pricing is under pressure as supply conditions have returned to historical normal levels following a period of significant supply disruptions, but this is largely being offset by inflation of other chemicals. Look, [Audio Gap] and our numerous competitive advantages, our every bit as true today as they were in the past and give us great confidence in the future.\nLastly, with almost 7 months of the year behind us, providing an even clearer picture, we have adjusted our full year guidance for 2023 to $13.14 to $14.14 delivering solid teens EPS in the face of unfavorable weather early on macroeconomic headwinds, higher interest rates and market normalization showed the cumulative benefit from exceptional execution by a very dedicated and talented team. Melanie will now provide additional comments in her financial commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported $1.9 billion in net sales for the second quarter of 2023. This was the second best top line in history after the exceptionally strong results we generated in 2022.\nInflation in the quarter was approximately 3% to 4%, slightly higher for equipment products and a marginal overall pricing benefit from chemicals. We saw some pressure on trichlor prices in the quarter, offset by inflation in other chemical products. The pricing impact of trichlor was around a 1% drag on net sales for the quarter.\nAs we had anticipated, gross margin of 30.6% saw a 180 basis point decline compared to second quarter 2022. The benefit from lower cost inventory on hand have largely been sold through and contributed nominally to the second quarter gross margin. Current gross margin primarily reflects replacement costs and the seasonal benefit we would typically expect to see in the second quarter. Gross margin was somewhat negatively impacted by sales concession activity in our response to competitors reacting to the slower start to the season.\nOperating expenses declined by 3% year-over-year in the quarter. SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales was 13% for the quarter, significantly better than the 18.6% we reported in first quarter, as we realized improved expense leverage on our fixed costs in the higher sales quarter.\nOur field teams did an excellent job in managing through the seasonal expense growth between the first quarter and the second quarter. Last year, we increased expenses by $36 million from first quarter to second quarter, and we were able to moderate that to only $17 million in the current quarter compared to Q1.\nWe remain focused on compensation and freight-related variable expenses, while continuing our investments in new locations and tools and technology to support our long-term growth. The 13 new locations opened since June 2022 added incremental expenses and were a moderate drag on operating income.\nWe completed 3 acquisitions year-to-date, each providing unique strategic benefits and once pulled into the network will contribute profitable growth going forward. Together, these added less than 1% to net sales for the quarter. So for us, it was not significant to break out separately in the press release.\nOur second quarter operating margin was 17.6% versus 20.4% last year, but continues to be above the 15.4% in 2019. Looking back to 2019, we ended the year with a 10.7% full year operating margin. That expanded almost 600 basis points to 16.6% for the full year 2022 as we realize benefits of around 150 basis points from inflation-driven price increases and inventory gains that have now largely normalized.\nWe are experiencing some pullback in our operating margin from last year, but we believe the margins we will achieve in 2023 well above the pre-pandemic levels are setting a good baseline and will be sustainable as we hold on to the 30% to 35% industry growth from inflation, combined with our strategically beneficial acquisitions, increased scale, product expansion and improved operating efficiencies.\nWe reported diluted EPS, excluding ASU of $5.89 compared to $7.59 in second quarter 2022. While 22% below last year, this is comparable to 2021 second quarter EPS and is 94% higher than the $3.03 excluding ASU, we reported in second quarter 2019. Many changes have affected our historically stable and growing industry since then, which bring positive opportunities for our future growth and profitability. continue to be well managed. Days sales outstanding was 26.2 days compared to prior year of 27.2. We have made excellent progress on rightsizing our inventory by vendor and by location now that supply chains have normalized.\nSo, one of the metrics we monitor to ensure a great customer experience and analyzed for lost sales opportunities continue to trend well. We have reduced inventory year-over-year by $186 million against the $260 million inventory reduction we estimated at year-end. We are continuing to aim toward the end of the season or end of third quarter to achieve these inventory levels.\nAs we accomplish this, we will be uniquely positioned to work with our channel partners on early buys to best position us for the 2024 season. With acquisitions, new locations and expanded product line offerings at many of our sales centers, our capabilities in managing work at capital is another indicator of our focus on capacity creation and the value we continue to provide to our customers while generating strong returns for our shareholders.\nWe reduced debt outstanding by $411 million from June of 2022. And although we had lower average debt outstanding during the quarter, an increase in our average interest rate resulted in a rise of $8 million in our quarterly interest expense. Cash flow from operating activities was $377 million, an increase of $348 million compared to last year as strong earnings and working capital reductions contributed to increased cash flow.\nWe have completed $44 million of share buybacks in the open market during the first half. Our Board increased our authorization under our share repurchase program to $600 million during the quarter. Our full year cash flows are expected to be about $800 million, benefiting from cash generated due to reductions in inventory. From a timing standpoint, our cash flow is strongest in the second half of the year after building preseason inventory in first quarter and paying for early buy inventory purchases in the second quarter.\nMoving to our outlook. For the full year, we expect sales compared to 2022 to be down in the range of negative 10%. We're down 12% through the first half with a 15% year-over-year decrease in Q1 and a 10% decline in Q2. Last year for base business, we realized a 10% increase in Q3, which was the same as Q2 and a 1% growth in fourth quarter. We will have 1 less selling day in the third quarter and for the full year, which we typically add or subtract around 1% to 2% for the quarter.\nGross margin is expected to return to seasonally normalized level in the second half of the year as inventory gain benefits have now fully passed through. As we have stated previously, we expect full year 2023 gross margins to be around 30%.\nOperating expense growth moderated in the second quarter for year-to-date growth over prior year of 1% and will continue to be well managed for the full year. With continued investments in the business, we will maintain certain core expenses and limit full year base business expense growth to 1%. This will have us well positioned for in top line growth returns.\nWhen we look at potential uses for the increased cash flows, we expect to generate this year, we anticipate spending around $25 million to $50 million on acquisitions, $50 million to $60 million on capital expenditures, $170 million on cash dividends and the remaining approximately $550 million on a combination of debt reduction and share buybacks.\nWe continue to maintain our leverage ratio at the low end of our target rate of 1.5 to 2x with the mix of floating and fixed rate debt, reflecting a strong and flexible financial position to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Interest expense for the full year is expected to be between $55 million and $62 million, including slightly higher interest rates in the second half.\nOur annual tax rate should be in line with last year's tax rate of 25.2%, excluding ASU. We expect the third quarter rate to be slightly lower than the annual rate. Our Board increased the quarterly dividend payout by 10% this quarter, increasing the quarterly dividend to $1.10. We expect to pay full year 2023 dividends of around $170 million, more than double the $84 million paid to shareholders in 2019. As Pete commented earlier, we have updated the range for our EPS guidance for the full year 2023 to $13.14 to $14.14, which includes the $0.14 ASU tax benefit realized to date.\nThis assumes a share count of 39.4 million shares consistent with June 30. We based our guidance on the assumption of normal historical weather conditions as the midpoint. We issued our second annual corporate responsibility report during the quarter. We are proud to have expanded our disclosures in the areas that we are focused on and our capacity creation efforts.\nThese initiatives and activities are paying off through more efficient water usage and the benchmarking of our electricity usage in our continued efforts to lower our overall emissions.\nOur results for the second quarter, while somewhat less favorable than we had hoped, through the resilience of our industry and the sustainability of much of the pricing and market growth components we realized over the 2019 to 2022 period prior to this period of market stabilization. Our financial position is strong, and we are well situated to support the return of industry growth.\nI will now turn the call over to begin our Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nWelcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2023 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in the Investor Relations section.\nPeter Arvan, our President and CEO, will begin the call with his comments.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, we released our first quarter results, which were adversely affected by challenging weather patterns across most of the North American market, and we were up against extremely difficult comparisons from 2022. Despite cooler and extraordinarily wetter weather across many of our year-round markets, we posted revenue of $1.2 billion, down 15% for both total and base business revenue when compared to 2022. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2021, our base business sales grew 51%. In the first quarter of 2022, we saw sales grow by an additional 26%, which makes a quarter-over-quarter comparison tough in and of itself, but especially when confronted with unprecedented weather in some of our major markets.\nWhat is encouraging, though, is that in the areas where the weather was normal, our business performed in line with expectations.\nLooking specifically at our year-round base business markets, we saw sales decline 9%. California, as you well know, saw historic amounts of rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter, which curtailed both construction and maintenance spending and led to a sales decline of 24% in this very important market. This compares with the same quarter last year where we saw sales increase by 31%.\nIn Arizona, we saw sales decline 14% as they, too, experienced above-average rain and cooler temperatures as compared to the normal seasonal patterns and what we saw in 2022. Again, by way of comparison, for the same quarter last year, Arizona saw sales increase by 31%.\nTexas, which experienced a more normal weather pattern, saw sales decline 6%, following a 7% gain for the same period last year, which is in line with expectations set earlier [ the year ].\nFlorida, which experienced favorable weather in the quarter, saw sales increase 7% on top of the 30% growth that we saw last year in the same quarter. Our seasonal markets, which include Canada, saw sales decreased 23%, but this compares with the 28% growth that we saw in the first quarter of 2022.\nAs has always been true in our industry, the biggest single external variable that can impact our business is the weather. Early in the quarter, we were encouraged by the weather conditions, but that quickly changed to a headwind and became more impactful as the quarter progressed and the sales effects became more meaningful.\nAll in, we believe that the historic weather pattern that we have seen so far this year, particularly in the Western U.S., negatively impacted revenue by approximately $60 million to $70 million. Typically speaking, adverse weather delays pool and outdoor living construction, which may be made up on the shoulders of the season if the weather allows. Maintenance and repair spending are mostly lost as the pools go unused during the inclement weather, limiting some equipment usage, which may lower postpone repair spending and definitely curtails chemical needs.\nAfter assessing initial permit data, demand for new pool construction is clearly down. The decline ranges from a high negative teens percent to over 50% in some markets. In total, we believe the overall pool permit number is down approximately 30% so far. This is worse than we had contemplated in our previous guide that's driven mostly by the weather and some additional economic headwinds.\nHowever, when comparing 4Q 2022 levels to the first quarter of 2023, we see permits up 4%, which is encouraging.\nWeather, interest rates, consumer spending and the end of COVID tailwinds all contributed to lower pool construction activity on a year-over-year basis, but we are encouraged that the sequential quarterly permit level is up. We continue to see lower end pools that typically are financed under the most pressure as consumers grapple with the higher cost of borrowing and higher pool construction costs. We estimate that our sales into the pool construction segment are down 25%, which implies that we continue to take share, which is consistent with our past performance.\nOur unmatched value proposition and commitment to an unparalleled customer experience continue to make us the supplier of choice for the industry. For context, new pool construction accounts for approximately 15% of our business. Approximately 60% of the business is driven by maintenance and repair, with the remaining 25% being driven by renovation and remodel.\nAs you can see, approximately 85% of our business is driven by pools that already exist. As we had anticipated, renovation -- the renovation business appears to be holding up much better than new pool construction. This is based on our estimates that our new pool construction sales are off approximately 25%. However, sales of key construction products that are used only in construction and renovation are down only 3%, which implies that renovation activity is solid.\nTurning to end markets. Commercial swimming pool product sales, which tend to be less weather dependent, are up 12%. Base business sales to the retail channel were off 16% for the quarter, reflecting a return to more normal buying patterns as supply chains have normalized. We believe normalized supply, cooler weather and a later spring across most of the country also delayed some shipments to the stores to align with a later start to the season and normal material availability.\nPinch A Penny, franchisee revenue is our indicator for retail sell-through. Here, we saw sales increase 10% in the quarter, which we believe is a good indication of the resilience of demand in markets where the weather is more typical for this time of year.\nMoving on to specific product categories. It should be no surprise to see that equipment sales were down 14% in the quarter, which is attributable to construction unit volume declines based on lower backlogs, unfavorable weather and smaller and later customer early buys. As previously noted, we saw no change in pricing as all the increases in this category are holding and are expected to hold as is normal.\nChemical sales in the quarter were down 11%, which is also expected with the cooler and wetter weather. Of note, Florida, which had favorable weather throughout the quarter, saw chemical sales increased 12%.\nBuilding material sales for the quarter were down 7%, reflecting lower new build offset somewhat by higher renovation and remodel numbers.\nLet me now provide some context on Europe. We continue to see the demand in Europe remains soft. The general economic outlook, the effects of the war and, again, the weather have combined degree headwinds that resulted in our sales decline in 25%. For context, last year, in the first quarter, sales were up 5% as the effects of the war had yet to begin, and the general economic outlook was more stable. For reference, the first quarter of 2021 saw sales increase 115%, so the 2-year stack is quite difficult.\nTurning to Horizon base business results. The first quarter sales decreased 7%, with residential activities declining most prevalent in the Western states, offset somewhat by commercial project demand and stronger demand in Florida and Texas. Weather implications are being felt in this business as well, delaying some projects, but we are optimistic that some of this loss can be made up.\nMoving down the income statement. Let me briefly cover gross margin. We are very pleased with the 30.6% that we posted, reflecting the work that we have done in this area related to mix, pricing and inventory investments. Melanie will provide additional color in her prepared remarks.\nOperating expenses came in at 18.6% of net sales. Although this is higher than we have seen in the previous 2 years, this is largely attributable to investments that we continue to make towards our long-term growth inflation and the effects of a softer weather-driven revenue quarter. As we have previously discussed, our cost model is somewhat variable, but we do not want to take structural actions that would impede our ability to fulfill future demand. As you know, the first quarter is our seasonally least significant, especially given the unprecedented weather headwinds. It would be premature to read too much into the quarter.\nWe, however, continue to invest in new sales centers and customer programs that we believe allow us to continue to provide best-in-class service and value for our customers and suppliers. For the quarter, we added 7 new locations, 2 acquired and 5 greenfields. For the balance of the year, we expect to add another 5 to 7.\nAdditionally, Pinch A Penny welcomed 5 new franchise new locations in the quarter. With respect to customer tools, POOL360 saw online or activity decreased by only 3%, indicating deeper penetration and increased usage within our customer base.\nCompleting the income statement, we reported operating income of $146 million, which reflects strong execution in the weather-constrained environment. It is noteworthy that although this represents a 38% decline at the shoulders of the season, it is 13% higher than what we posted in the first quarter of 2021 and significantly higher than prepandemic levels.\nBefore I turn the call over to Melanie for her financial commentary, let me address our guidance update. In any given year, we face challenges with the weather and uncertainties in the economy and how that can affect customer behavior, labor cost and availability and operating expenses. Competitive pressures, and of late, geopolitical events can also impact our results. Some of these we can foresee and prepare for, while others we cannot, but still have a significant short-term impact on financial results.\nIn a typical year, it is not uncommon to be impacted by one or more of these conditions. The implications on short-term operating results vary with each, but experience tells us that the more prominent impact are felt with significant changes in the weather, which can produce immediate impacts on operating results that will vary based on the weather event, the market size where they occur and timing. This is nothing new, and we have seen it frequently in the past.\nChanges in economic factors can be as significant. But generally, the effects are felt more slowly across the business. In 2023, we saw significant weather impacts in 2 of our largest year-round markets, Arizona and California, which were most prevalent later in the quarter where the effects are more pronounced. At the same time, we saw and expected the expiration of COVID tailwinds, which favorably impacted 2020 through the 2022 season. Results -- and were contemplated in our previous guidance. Individually, each will cause notable variances and results on a year-over-year basis. But when they stack up in very large year-round markets and are combined with return to normal buying patterns in the rest of the markets, it can meaningfully change our operating results in the short term.\nWe want to remind our investors that the fundamentals of this business remain unchanged over the long term. Pools and outdoor living remains highly desirable. The southern migration will continue, and the resilience of our industry, which is driven by the installed base of pools, is very much -- as true today as it was pre-COVID, just larger and more valuable. Flexible work-for-home arrangements remain in place for many pool and homeowners.\nThe inflation that has made its way through the channel is here to stay, making the size of the industry larger. The installed base of products continue to grow and age. And the opportunity to upgrade and modernize existing pools and backyard continues. And our ability to take share based on our unmatched competitive profile gets stronger every year.\nTaking a short-term view of the business and reacting to short-term issues like weather with structural changes or deviating from our proven strategic plan would be a disservice to our investors. We remain committed to being the best supplier in the industry. We see the value in investing in our capabilities to broaden our product and service offering that will enable us to continue share gains while remaining focused on discipline and execution and capital allocation.\nThe weather issues will pass, but their effects on the first quarter results will mostly stay. The economic pressures related to interest rates will affect new pool construction in the short term, but the desirability of pools and outdoor living will remain strong in the long term.\nOur installed base will continue to grow in size and value. Asset creation continues. Our investment in our people and our focus on being the employer of choice is ongoing. And helping our customers grow and be more efficient is what we focus on each day and gives us the confidence that short-term issues that we see will have no bearing on the continued and long-term success of our business.\nWith this in mind, we have elected to lower our guidance and increase the size of our estimated range for 2023 from $14.62 to $16.12 to account for the recent challenges but remain incredibly proud of what the team has done and very confident in the future.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie for her financial commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. We have exceeded $1 billion in sales in the first quarter for the third year in a row as we continue to see the cumulative 30% to 35% inflation realized over the last several years remain a part of our base.\nOur first quarter revenue decrease of 15% compared to first quarter 2022 where we realized 33% top line growth and 26% base business growth and still represents a 14% increase over 2021. Inflation is in line with our expectations, and the pricing that took place at the beginning of the season on equipment remains intact. At this time, we are not aware of any additional price increases to come through during the season.\nChemical inflation overall was around 4% for the quarter, with trichlor pricing seeing some pressures offset by increases in other chemical product lines. Gross margin of 30.6% was 110 basis points less than prior year and reflects a strong margin for the first quarter from a historical comparison standpoint. Prior year gross margin included a benefit from multiple price changes amid higher levels of inflation. As expected, first quarter gross margin benefited from the sell-through of our lower-cost inventory investments made last year and also reflects the higher base we would anticipate toward our full year longer-term guidance of 30% gross margins, which includes the continuing benefit from acquisition-related accretion.\nOperating expenses increased $12.5 million or 6% over prior year. Fixed costs impact our first and fourth quarters more significantly as the higher sales quarters of second and third provide us more ability to leverage nonvariable costs and is also where we would typically see higher correlations to sales for volume-related expenses.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to invest in strategic projects that we anticipate will drive long-term growth and profitability, specifically those around our customer experience offerings.\nOur overall costs related to facilities, freight, insurance, IT, advertising and marketing and people have increased from a year ago, and we are focused on increasing productivity in the network to offset the inflationary increases we are seeing in these areas, therefore, limiting the total year-over-year expense dollar increases.\nWe have also added 5 new locations during the quarter, which will increase our overall capacity and ability to gain market share in expanded geographic areas. These new locations will be an initial drag on earnings and represent higher operating cost growth but will generally be neutral to earnings in year 2 and generate normalized profitability by year 4.\nFor the full year, we still plan to open the 10 new locations anticipated as our longer-term view has not been impacted by short-term market considerations. This is in addition to a similar number of franchise locations to be added as part of the Pinch A Penny network.\nWe realized operating margin for first quarter of 12.1%, which was consistent with the 2021 first quarter margin and a meaningful step-up over the prior 5 years as we have become larger and more efficient. The quarters in the shoulder of the season provide less of an opportunity for leverage, but the results achieved in the first quarter of 2023 are a good indication of the benefit we would expect to see longer term as we continue to leverage our scale for increased profitability.\nInterest expense for the quarter increased $10.6 million over prior year as we saw our average interest rate increase from 1.5% in prior year to 4.8% for the current quarter. We have held our debt outstanding consistent with year-end while also making $44 million in open market share repurchases year-to-date. We continue to remain under our stated target leverage ratio and have more than adequate capacity to fund our capital priorities.\nNext, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flows. Days sales outstanding was 26.5 days compared to 26.4 days in 2022. Net receivables decreased consistent with overall sales changes, and we continue to utilize our credit function as a valuable resource to our customers as we work with them to support their sales activity.\nInventory level increases have continued to improve from third quarter 2022 when we saw supply chains and lead times normalize. We have reduced our base business inventory growth from 43% year-over-year in third quarter 2022 to 18% in fourth quarter 2022 and again to 3% at first quarter 2023. Our focus on inventory is by sale center and by SKU, which ensures that we have optimal levels of inventory and can provide the highest level of service for our customers.\nWe are making progress on moving through the safety stock inventory levels we had at the same time last year and are continuing to target the end of the season as a return to normal inventory levels.\nOur efforts on managing working capital are evident in the improvement in cash flows from operations of $311 million over first quarter last year. We are expecting higher payments in the second and third quarter on vendor early buy seasonal payment terms compared to last year where these programs were generally not offered. However, full year cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $800 million.\nWe completed $44 million of share buybacks during the quarter and have $186 million remaining under our share repurchase program authorization. We typically review our capital allocation plan with our Board of Directors at the time of our upcoming annual meeting and will announce any changes shortly thereafter.\nWe have updated our EPS guidance for the full year 2023. Our new range is $14.62 to $16.12, including the $0.12 ASU tax benefit realized to date. Our range considers the results to date, and at the low end, impact from a mild recessionary environment.\nContinuing unfavorable weather throughout the remainder of the year or awarding economic comment could impact our expected outlook. We are now expecting to see sales compared to 2022 to be down mid-single digits versus a flat to down 3% from our initial guidance. Based on current trends, it is possible that new pool construction could decline up to 30% in view of the number of permits issued year-to-date and the less available billable days.\nMaintenance revenue is also expected to see a 1% lower increase than previously expected from the use of less consumables stemming from the unfavorable weather in the first quarter. Our overall expectations related to renovation and model activity, our Horizon business and Europe remained relatively unchanged. We continue to pursue 4 to 5 tuck-in acquisitions for the year with a minimal impact from the current year results.\nWe completed our first acquisition of 2023 by purchasing Pro-Water Irrigation and Landscape Supply, adding 2 locations to our Horizon network during the quarter.\nLooking at the trends on base business growth last year, we saw a 26% growth in the first quarter, followed by 10% growth in Q2 and Q3 and modest growth in Q4. The largest year-over-year impact is expected to be seen in the first quarter and first half. We have 1 less selling day in the third quarter and for the full year compared to 2022.\nWe continue to forecast gross profit margin for the full year in line with our longer-term guidance of around 30%. Second quarter will be a difficult comparison as prior year gross margins increased 150 basis points from 2021. So we would expect the 2023 margin for second quarter to be slightly higher than the full year projection as is normal for the second quarter.\nInflationary pressures on operating costs will be partially offset by our continued efforts in capacity creation and our ability to manage variable costs. Growth on expenses will be significantly less than the inflationary cost inputs we are challenged with. Our management teams will make decisions to manage costs while continuing to invest in valuable programs and team members that will be necessary to support our long-term growth.\nProduced volumes would allow for more field focus on our ongoing operational projects such as expansion of our priority pick express order program in replenishment, velocity flooding and delivery optimization. These initiatives will increase available capacities longer term across the network without more significant capital spend.\nThere have not been any changes to our expectations on interest expense for the full year. We still anticipate interest expense will range from $50 million to $60 million. With exceptional cash flow generation, we expect debt balances to decrease throughout the year. We also plan to complete the transition from LIBOR to SOFR on our available rate debt agreements before the end of second quarter. This change will not materially impact our results or financial position. Our overall borrowing rate continues to benefit from the portion of our debt currently tied to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements.\nEstimated weighted average shares outstanding that will be applied to net income will be approximately 39.5 million shares at each remaining quarter and 39.5 million for the full year. This number was 39.4 million shares at March 31. We will update our forecast quarterly to reflect the impact of any future share repurchases.\nAs we continue to focus on our 4 key operating priorities, our ability to integrate our ESG framework into those priorities has expanded. We expect the benefits not only to expand our efforts around sustainability and governance, but also to assist in our capacity creation efforts as we utilize the same practices to grow our operating margins over the long term. Our second annual corporate responsibility report will be issued during the quarter, and we'll provide more detail on what we have accomplished.\nOur first quarter 2023 reflects the transition period as we exit time of our characteristic growth, coupled with supply chain disruptions only to navigate challenging weather and macroeconomic conditions while generating strong current year operating results and focusing on the long-term stable growth nature of our business.\nWe will now begin our Q&A session."

Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nWelcome to our Fourth Quarter and Year End 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2023 and future periods.

I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Peter Arvan. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, President & Director, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us. 2022 was another extraordinary year for POOLCORP. We achieved results in revenue and earnings. We grew our market share. Our focus on the customer experience and execution has never been stronger, and we continue to enhance our capabilities as we integrated Porpoise Pool & Patio. For the first time ever, we exceeded $6 billion in net revenue, ending the year at $6.2 billion and generated just over $1 billion of operating income. When compared to 2019, the last prepandemic year, our revenue has almost doubled and our operating income has tripled. We now operate over 420 sales centers, and we are continuing to expand our footprint and capabilities.\nIn 2022, we opened 10 new locations, and Pinch A Penny added 7 new stores to the franchise network. The industry has grown substantially, and POOLCORP has significantly outpaced the industry by providing best-in-class service to our customers and helping them grow their business and being the best channel to market for our suppliers.\nLet me now recap the full year and quarterly results. As I previously mentioned, total sales for the year came in at $6.2 billion, which represents a 17% increase over 2021, where we saw sales grow an incredible 35%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we grew revenue 6%, and this is on top of the 23% growth that we saw in 2021. From a base business perspective, fourth quarter revenue grew by 7% in our year-round markets and fell by 6% in the seasonal markets.\nCertainly, the less favorable weather impacted the business in both markets, contributing to fewer pools being built and lower usage in the quarter as compared to last year. For the full year, our base business grew by 15% in our year-round markets and 8% in the seasonal markets. Our growth was driven by the resilience of the industry and the larger installed base, inflation, greater adoption of higher-end features and technology, share gains and expansion of our powerful sales center network, both organically and by acquisitions.\nPOOLCORP has built a tremendous team and a footprint that is not only focused on execution but also providing an unmatched customer experience, which enables us to be the preferred supplier to the swimming pool industry trade. Our execution-focused and unmatched capabilities have allowed us and will continue to enable us to outperform the industry. Our culture and people are performance-driven, our investments in capabilities and new facilities drive revenue growth and incremental profitability and our track record is unmatched. Simply put, we could not be prouder of our team.\nNow let me provide some details on base business sales in our 4 largest markets. For the total year, California grew by 14%. Florida grew by 24%. In Arizona, we saw 18% growth, and our Texas business grew by 8%. It is worth noting that Texas in 2021 had the benefit of the freeze, which made the comps much more difficult for 2022. For the fourth quarter, California grew by 5%. Florida continued to show significant growth with sales up 22%. Arizona sales were largely flat for the quarter, and Texas saw sales decline 5%.\nTurning to end markets. Our commercial business continues to gain momentum with the fourth quarter and full year growth coming in at 27%. This is on top of 26% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% growth for the full year. We continue to gain share and capture the demand in growing municipal and leisure and travel-related spending.\nShipments to our base business retail customers in the fourth quarter were up 1% and for the full year up 9%. This is on top of the 18% fourth quarter 2021 growth and a 20% increase that we posted for the full year of 2021. We believe that weather and some change in buying habits as the supply chain returns to normal affected the fourth quarter. We feel that, with the supply chain issues in 2021, many dealers placed larger orders in the fourth quarter of 2021 to make sure they had product available when the 2022 season began.\nWith product availability almost back to normal level, most dealers reverted to more normal ordering patterns by the end of 2022. Pinch A Penny retail sales, unlike our shipments to dealers and contractor customers, represents sales through to the end customer, saw sales increase 17% for the quarter and year. Keep in mind that the footprint for the Pinch A Penny franchise store network is highly concentrated in Florida, with an expanding presence in Texas and a small number of stores in Gulf states. We continue to gain synergies where significant value is being derived for both the franchise and wholesale business. With 1 year of ownership now under our belt, we remain confident and on track with our initial expectations.\nNow let me add some commentary on specific product sales in the quarter and year. Equipment, which represents about 1/3 of our sales, increased 9% for the year and 2% for the quarter. With lead time and availability of equipment mostly back to historic levels, our dealers changed their buying habits back to a more normal practice of purchasing equipment as needed during the construction and repair process as most availability concerns have abated.\nDemand in units for equipment, which surged last year and early this year, has retracted some but remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. Pricing has held with no weakness, so the overall impact on our revenue was positive for the quarter and for the year. Base business chemical sales for the quarter were up 19% and 32% for the year, reflecting share gains, installed base growth and inflation.\nProduct availability has improved dramatically over the previous year, and we are now well stocked for the upcoming season. We have refreshed our brands, and we'll begin launching our POOL360 Water Solution software in 2023 for our independent retail dealers, which we believe will be a best-in-class growth tool for our retailers. This will allow us to continue to take share in the very important maintenance and repair market. This is our next generation offering in our software solutions for the trade. POOL360 usage continues to grow and now makes up about 11% of our total lines.\nBuilding materials, which are used in both new construction and renovations were flat in the quarter as compared to the 20% growth of this category in the same quarter of 2021 and 42% in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year, building materials sales were up 18% on top of the 28% growth that we saw for the full year in this category in 2021 and 23% growth in 2020. Clearly, the reduction in new pool construction in 2022, these results illustrate that a solid remodel market, and our share gains are fueling our growth. It is particularly obvious in the fourth quarter when we believe that new construction was the slowest in 2022 and compares to a much stronger build level in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNow I'd like to provide some insight on Europe. As we have seen all year, the market in Europe has been affected not only by less favorable weather but the Russia-Ukraine war, elevated energy costs, inflation and a slower economy. Europe's fourth quarter 2022 net sales were down 22.5%. For reference, the same quarter in 2021 was up 18% and 48% in 2020. For the full year, we saw sales decline 15% in U.S. dollars. Net sales in Europe for the full year of 2021 were up 39%.\nLooking across the continent, the Eastern and Northern countries were affected much more by the factors that I listed above. We believe in the longer-term growth opportunities in Europe and our team's ability to manage the business while providing best-in-class service in a very dynamic environment.\nLet me now provide some comments on Horizon's performance for the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 5%, and for the full year, net sales increased 15%. In 2022, we opened 5 new locations, 1 in the first quarter and 4 in the fourth quarter. Our strategy for this business remains unchanged. We are investing in areas where we need additional capacity and expanding our footprint further into the Sunbelt primarily through new sales center development activities.\nOur operating model is solid. The team continues to execute at a high level, and we are encouraged by the long-term growth opportunities of this business. Although this business is more tied to residential construction than the blue business, we also have a large commercial business that is holding up quite well and is also benefiting from inflation.\nAs you saw in this morning's release, for the full year, our gross margins increased 80 basis points to 31.3%. This follows the 180-basis point increase that we realized in 2021 over 2020. For the fourth quarter and in line with our previous guidance, our gross margins declined 230 basis points, ending at 28.8%. Given the seasonality of our business, with margins fluctuating quarter-over-quarter, we believe that the full year number is far more indicative of where we are from this -- for this metric. Melanie will provide some more detail on our gross margins in her comments.\nMoving on to operating expenses. We continue to show that we can improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on capacity creation and execution. Base business operating expenses decreased by 1% for the quarter and increased by 6% for the full year. In both cases, we continue to show that our expense growth is about half of our revenue growth contributing to our improved operating leverage.\nWrapping up the income statement. We were very proud to post operating income of just over $1 billion. This compares with $833 million that we recorded in 2021 and $464 million that we recorded in 2020. For the quarter, we recorded $107 million in operating income, a 16% decline, most of which is driven by the seasonality of our business and magnified by the relative size of the quarter.\nHere, again, I would point you to full year results as a better indicator of performance, on which Melanie will provide additional comments. Operating margin for the full year of 2022 was 16.6%, which is 90 basis points better than our previous record high that was posted in 2021.\nLooking ahead, I'd like to provide some color and context on how we expect to see 2023 taking shape. There is no doubt that our industry and POOLCORP have benefited from several factors over the last few years that will have a lasting impact on our industry. Desire for swimming pool and outdoor living has increased with both viewed more favorably and desirable for homeowners today versus the past. This is especially true as more people are migrating to the Sunbelt in search of a comfortable year-round climate and a healthy outdoor living lifestyle.\nNew connected product adoption rates are increasing. The value of the goods and services related to the maintenance, renovation and construction of swimming pools and outdoor living has increased, propelled by unprecedented inflation that is now embedded in the industry. We are continuing to expand our footprint and leverage our capacity creation activities to anticipate and improve the customer experience. And we remain closely aligned and partnered with our key suppliers, working together to improve the industry and homeowners' ability to enjoy their pool and outdoor living spaces.\nAt the same time, and underpinning our results is a growing and aging installed base that will need to be maintained and remodeled. As new construction levels will likely decline in 2023, the wholesale value of the pools built, should in fact be at least 4% higher on a per unit basis driven by inflation alone. Add to this, the specific competitive advantages unique to POOLCORP, and it gives us the confidence that 2023 will be a solid year.\nOur people and network are second to none. Our balance sheet is strong, giving us flexibility to take advantage of dynamic market conditions and investing in the future. Our CSLs, vertically integrated chemical facility, PLEX programs, technology applications for the customer and our proven team will enable us to get the most out of whatever market conditions present themselves.\nOur seasoned leadership team has been -- has seen many cycles and is quite skilled at managing the business in line with volume realities. As of right now, we expect that new pool construction in units could be down approximately 15% to 20%, although this number will likely vary broadly by market and geography. Higher end markets will be stronger, while lower end and entry-level pools will continue to see headwinds.\nRenovation and remodel should be solid in most markets as we believe renovation activities may see only a modest decline in 2023. These considerations are baked into our guidance. Inflation at this point looks to be in the 4% to 5% range for the year. We see little to no risk of deflation except for trichlor but movement in that chemical will likely be offset by others.\nOverall, we expect the chemical sales in line with the installed base growth and of course weather, which is the largest driver of chemical needs, particularly in the seasonal markets. With supply chains returning to normal, we expect that customers' buying habits largely have and will continue to return to normal. With all of this in mind, we would expect that our EPS range for 2023 will be $16.03 to $17.03 on a per share basis, including an estimated $0.03 benefit from ASU. Again, for context, I'd like to remind our listeners that the bottom of our range is, in fact, over 2.5x our full year 2019 results.\nFrom a cash generation perspective, we would expect that free cash flow will exceed net income as inventories return to a more normal level, and our capital allocation model remains unchanged. As is typical, we will use our cash flow to invest in our operations, growth and expansion. We will, with the approval of our Board, continue to pay dividends in accordance with our policy, fund acquisitions and continue to buy back our shares to provide returns to our shareholders.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the POOLCORP team, our incredible customers and our invaluable supplier partners for their unyielding support.\nI'll now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for her detailed commentary. Melanie?\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with highlighting a few items for the quarter, recapping the year and then move into our expectations for 2023.\nAs we finished out the year, fourth quarter sales exceeded $1 billion, marking the second year in a row where we had hit the $1 billion mark in our seasonally slowest quarter. Our gross profit percentage was 28.8% in the quarter or 230 basis points less than the fourth quarter 2021. However, it was still 30 basis points higher than the 2020 fourth quarter margin.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded an additional $13 million in cost of sales resulting in 120-basis point decrease in gross margins for fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the full year. This amount relates primarily to import duties and taxes on purchases throughout 2022 of certain imported chemical products. Without the impact of the increase in duties, gross margins would have been 30%, which is 110 basis points less than prior year and slightly better than the decrease of 150 basis points we were expecting at the end of second quarter as benefits from inventory investments remained strong.\nAs mentioned in the press release, we have seen the supply chain in this area stabilize, and thus, we are not expecting to import a significant portion of our chemical supply in 2023. Operating expenses grew 7% to $208 million and, as a percentage of sales, were roughly comparable with prior year fourth quarter. Operating income declined by $21 million primarily due to lower gross profit generated in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the quarter, interest and other expense came in at $15 million, which was lower than our projected $18 million at third quarter as we began reducing inventory purchases earlier during the quarter. 2022 finished off another dynamic year in POOLCORP history. Sales reached $6 billion, representing growth over the prior year of 17% top line and 21% EPS growth, excluding the ASU. Revenue growth has expanded since 2019 by 93%, driven by approximately 30% to 35% from inflation, 17% from acquisitions, 9% from new pool construction, 7% from the growth in the installed base of pools and 25% to 30% from market share and new product growth.\nMarket share growth includes 23 new greenfields opened since the beginning of 2020 and an increase in consumer interest in automating their pools, higher price point product spending and expanded features in the backyard. 2022 demonstrated the resilience of the POOLCORP operating model. With the new pool construction expected to be approximately 98,000 new pools, down 16% from prior year, we estimate that our 2022 domestic pool distribution revenue was comprised of slightly more than 60% from maintenance. This includes increases in the portion of our business related to specialty retail customers, whose business primarily serves the maintenance portion of the industry added with our 2021 acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio.\nSales of retail products in 2022 represented approximately 14%, up from 12% in 2021, as we added these new customers in this channel. We also saw a decrease in the portion of our business related to new pool construction, to more historical levels of 17% to 18%. And for remodel, we estimate this comprise 21% to 23% of our 2022 sales.\nGross profit increased 20% and reached $1.9 billion. The gross margin improvement of 80 basis points reflects benefit from acquired sales representing approximately 50 basis points and inventory-related gains from multiple vendor price increases throughout the year.\nThe related benefit from our inventory investments in response to supply chain disruptions as well as benefits from product mix, these benefits were offset by lower amounts earned under vendor incentive programs and higher costs related to the import duties and taxes.\nOperating expenses increased $123 million to $908 million, a 16% increase over 2021. $77 million was attributable to acquisitions. Base business expenses rose only 6% compared to the 12% increase in gross profit. These increases were related to volume-related sales, occupancy cost, employer of choice initiatives, marketing costs and continued investments in digital transformation and technology. They were partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation of $13 million.\nWe achieved operating income of $1 billion and increased our operating margin to a record 16.6% of net sales. Operating margin benefited from higher sales and gross margins enhanced by the capacity creation efforts we began several years ago, enabling increased operating efficiencies and productivity, producing a significant step-up in our operating margin.\nOur full year tax rate, excluding ASU, was 25.2%. We received an ASU benefit of $10.8 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the full year, of which $1.2 million or $0.03 was added in the fourth quarter and not included in our prior guidance. Earnings per share increased 17% to a record $18.70. And without the impact of the ASU in both periods, our EPS increased 21%. We estimate that Porpoise Pool & Patio accounted for approximately 3% of the increase, right in line with our expectations at the time of acquisition.\nDespite our higher working capital investment throughout the year and an $80 million deferred tax payment in 2022, cash flow from operating activities increased to a record $485 million, an increase of $171 million over 2021.\nMoving next to highlight a few key items from our balance sheet. Receivables continued to represent excellent credit management, finishing at a DSO of 26.9 days in 2022. As discussed on our third quarter call, we expected inventory growth to moderate in the fourth quarter as lead times have come down on those products. We finished the third quarter with year-over-year base business inventory growth of 43% and reduced that to 19% at year-end. The 19% increase includes approximately 10% from inflation and approximately $30 million of inventory added for the new locations opened during the year.\nLooking at days in inventory, we have 136 days on hand compared to 2019 year-end of 113 days on hand. This difference from historical normal levels represents additional inventory value of around $260 million. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, our days in inventory fluctuate quarter-over-quarter, and we would expect some natural growth in first quarter in anticipation of peak selling season requirements.\nOur expectation is that by the end of second and third quarters, we would see our days of inventory on hand return to levels consistent with historical turnover rates of approximately 3.5x on a trailing 4-quarter basis, while still providing the high in-stock performance and broad product selections that our customers have come to expect and are key competitive advantages. This forecast is not considering any additional strategic M&A or new product investments.\nTotal debt finished the year at $1.4 billion, up $204 million from prior year. Debt balances remain below our targeted leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2x with a conservative leverage ratio of 1.37 at year-end. During 2022, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for a total of $461 million and increased our quarterly dividend per share by 25%, returning $611 million or almost 82% of net income to shareholders. Our return on invested capital was 28.8%, continuing our leadership position in ROIC achievement among our distribution industry peers.\nLooking ahead into 2023, we have developed our guidance range based on flattish organic net sales to a decrease of 3% compared to 2022 as we have lapped our larger acquisitions. With a more uncertain economic climate, we approach 2023 cautiously. For the roughly 60% of our business that serves the maintenance of the existing base of pools, we expect to see growth in line with manufacturer inflationary increases of around 4%. We continue to expect a 1% benefit from installed base growth from 2022.\nRenovation and remodeling activity, which grew in 2022 as labor began shifting from new pool construction, may experience deferrals or reduced spending in view of economic uncertainties and could be down 10% to 15% from 2022. New pool construction could be down 15% to 20%, resulting in approximately 80,000 pools being built roughly equivalent to the 2019 levels.\nHorizon sales, more affected by new home construction, may be 5% to 10% lower than in 2022 Europe's larger concentration of aftermarket versus maintenance could result in a 10% to 20% decrease from 2022 levels.\nComparing expected 2023 sales cadence to 2022, we will have tougher comps at the beginning of the year due to the higher base business growth in 2022. We are likely to see low to mid-single-digit decreases in the first half with greater declines in Q1 and somewhat less in Q2 and then modest growth in the second half of the year. For 2023, there will be 1 less selling day in the third quarter and for the full year compared to 2022. Gross profit margin in 2023 is expected to be in line with our longer-term guidance of around 30% compared to the 31.3% gross margin we reported in 2022. We will realize some benefit on the existing inventory we carry into 2023 during the first half of the year.\nAs we have stated previously, this represents an increase compared to more historical levels of approximately 29% with the improvement comprised of around 50 basis points from acquisitions and additional benefits from a combination of supply chain enhancements, product mix changes, increases in private label and customer pricing. In particular, on the product mix, building materials is growing faster than the rest of our business and carries a higher gross margin percentage.\nOperating expenses will continue to be challenged by inflation, affecting wages, transportation and real estate. We will continue to invest in our industry-leading talent within the organization with both market level and performance-based compensation. Inflationary wage increases will be partially offset by aggressive management of overtime and temporary labor costs supplemented by our continued capacity creation investments.\nLooking at our SG&A, we have around 50% that is partially variable, which includes our incentive compensation. We have significant variability with the portions of our business we serve with third-party freight. Other variable costs include warehouse supplies and facilities and vehicle fleet maintenance.\nWithout a doubt, our experienced management teams will actively evaluate expenses at every level to ensure that we offset inflationary expense increases with appropriate capacity benefits and manage in line with sales activity. Even with expected weaknesses in economic conditions, we anticipate exceptionally strong cash flow from operating activities in 2023 as normalization of inventory investments, combined with solid earnings, will likely produce operating cash flows exceeding $800 million for the year.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to focus on funding the ongoing business, expanding our sales center network and investing in enabling technology projects. We continue to look for accretive, appropriately priced acquisition opportunities to further grow and complement our businesses both domestically and internationally. Dividends, subject to Board approval will increase, and opportunistic share buybacks will provide additional return opportunities, increasing shareholder value. We currently have $230 million available under our existing share repurchase authorization.\nIn view of the potential for flat to slightly lower sales, gross margin compression and inflationary pressures on expenses, we would anticipate operating margin to decline as much as 100 to 150 basis points compared to 2022 full year results. We believe we can achieve a 15% operating margin even under these reduced sales expectations by continuing an intense focus on expense management and the crisp operating execution we have demonstrated consistently over time.\nInterest expense for the year may vary depending upon our capital allocation opportunities. However, assuming outstanding debt balances remain relatively consistent with our current leverage ratio and higher borrowing costs, interest expense could range from $50 million to $60 million. With strong cash flows and 20% of our debt at fixed rates, we are well positioned to manage these costs during times of rising rates.\nOur annual tax rate is expected to be between 25.3% and 25.5%, excluding the ASU. Currently, we are estimating a $0.03 benefit from ASU in the first quarter for stock options expiring in 2023 and the expected impact of restricted share vesting. In 2022, we reduced shares outstanding by 1.1 million primarily as a result of our robust share buyback activity. Our estimated weighted average shares outstanding that will be applied to the net income attributable to common shareholders will be approximately 39.6 million shares without giving effect to share repurchase activity that may occur in 2023. As we do with ASU, if we complete significant buybacks during the year, we will include the expected impact in our updated guidance quarterly.\nOur 2022 diluted EPS guidance range of $16.03 to $17.03 includes an estimated $0.03 ASU tax benefit. I'm sure we will all agree that 2023 is poised to bring on many new challenges. However, I believe that this experienced, proven management team operating in a growing industry, supported by significant nondiscretionary recurring revenue, will produce strong financial results for many years into the future. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nWelcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2022 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our Investor Relations section.\nI will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Peter Arvan.\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, President & Director, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, we were pleased to report another solid quarter for the business. Net sales, including acquisitions, came in at $1.6 billion, a 14% improvement, with base business posting a 10% improvement over the same period in 2021. Our results were fueled by solid demand for nondiscretionary maintenance and repair products, continued new pool construction activity, strong renovation and remodel activity, and inflation in the 9% to 10% range.\nNow that we have closed the third quarter, we are fairly certain that new pool construction activity in 2022 will be down when compared to 2021. We would estimate that new pool construction units this year will be 10% to 15% less than the previous season. As expected, remodel activity has tapped into the free capacity of our builders to keep them busy.\nFrom a macro perspective, inflation, adoption of smart pool products, consistent demand for nondiscretionary maintenance on the installed base of pools and the leveraging of our operating network are all enabling continued share gain and growth.\nNow let me provide some specifics on what we have seen in our 4 largest base business year-round markets. As expected, Florida continues to be very strong with base business revenue up 20% for the quarter. Arizona also posted strong results with revenue up 18%, while Texas and California finished the quarter with solid results, up 10% and 16%, respectively. Our year-round markets grew 15% for the quarter, and seasonal markets grew 5% as less favorable weather impacted the buildable days and pool usage in the northern seasonal markets.\nLooking at end markets. I'm pleased to report that commercial pool product demand remains strong with sales up 28% for the quarter. This is in line with total year-to-date growth rate of 27%. Retail sales, excluding Pinch A Penny were up slightly at plus 4%, which reflects some inventory correction in the channel and less favorable weather in the seasonal markets.\nLooking at Pinch A Penny as a stand-alone, we continue to be very pleased with the results. Retail sales through the franchise stores are up 16% over prior year third quarter. From a product perspective, equipment sales growth is solid, posting gains of 9% for the period. This category includes pumps, heaters, lights, filters and automation.\nChemical sales were up 32% for the quarter as the trichlor shortage and inventory issues have abated. At this point, the only chemicals that remain in short supply are liquid bleach and cal hypo, which are used to shock the swimming pool. Lastly, building material grew 14% in the quarter, reflecting solid demand in a still labor-constrained market.\nLet me now add some commentary on our European operations that, as a reminder, make up about 4% of our total revenue. After a tremendous year last year, the teams in Europe have been impacted by less-than-favorable weather, a very tough economy, spiraling energy cost and the war in Ukraine. This is combined to create a significant headwind for our team as we saw sales declined 24% in the quarter, 11% on a constant currency basis. This follows 2 solid years of growth in the quarter, where combined sales grew approximately 44% in the same quarter.\nThe Horizon team continued to perform well as we posted base business revenue growth of 12% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date sales growth to 17%. We continue to expand this platform and remain confident in our ability to grow.\nTurning to gross margins for the quarter. Our overall gross margin was 31.2%, which is a decline of 10 basis points when compared to last year. Generally, we are pleased with the stability of our gross margins with the year-to-date results being a very solid 31.8%, which is a 140 basis point improvement over prior year.\nFrom an expense perspective, the team again delivered incredible results. Our operating expenses for the quarter were up 17%, which slightly exceeds our revenue growth but is in line with expectations given the acquisitions, new location and investments in growth. From a base business perspective, operating expenses were up 8% with revenue up 10% in the period.\nYou can see clearly that our capacity-creation activities continue to deliver value for our customers, team and supplier partners alike. POOL360 and our other digital platforms continue to grow. In the third quarter, POOL360 sales increased 14%. As previously mentioned, we released a new version of POOL360 this year and are in the rollout phases. As a percentage of our revenues, sales through POOL360 are at 12%. This is an area that we expect to expand as more and more customers experience the benefit of using this improved app and other B2B tools in our arsenal.\nWrapping up the income statement. You will note that our operating income came in at a solid $264 million, which is an 11% increase over the previous year same period. Operating margins came in at 16.3% for the quarter with our year-to-date operating margin at a strong 18.1%.\nFinally, with 3 full quarters behind us and a favorable outlook for the balance of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for the full year 2022 to $18.50 per share to $19.05 per share. Excluding the ASU adjustment, the range is $18.26 to $18.81 per share. This represents an incredible 22% improvement at the midpoint on top of a tremendous year in 2021.\nAs you can see, the POOLCORP team continues to raise the bar within the industry and deliver very strong results in a dynamic economic environment. The last 2.5 years have been both challenging, and at the same time, transformative for the industry. No single company was or is better positioned to capitalize on these challenges and opportunities in POOLCORP. The depth of our team, our expansive footprint, our strong balance sheet and sheer grit and determination have allowed us to not only gain share but gain efficiencies at the same time.\nThe industry has transformed as well and is now larger driven by, one, a higher installed base, which is approximately 6% larger when compared to the 2019 installed base of in-ground swimming pools; and two, structural inflation that has increased the size of the industry by approximately 30%. Pool owners continue to upgrade their equipment pads with new technology as normal repairs are needed and replacements are made. This too increases the size of the market as people invest in technologies that make their lives easier and may not have been available when their pools were built.\nConsider the average age of a pool in North America is around 25 years old with about half of those pools operating with little to no automation or modern features. Clearly, the jump in new pool construction activity in 2020 and 2021 helped drive our growth. At the same time, however, the nondiscretionary maintenance and increasing content on the replacement items as well as the structural inflation on the growing installed base have allowed us to grow this year despite the fact that new pool construction activity may be down from the previous year by as much as 15%.\nWith announced inflation from the major equipment manufacturers in the 4% to 5% range for 2023, we expect this to mitigate potential declines in new pool construction and a less robust renovation market should those market conditions occur. Additionally, we are confident that the strategic investments that we made with the acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio to improve our value proposition for the retail and DIY segment that we serve through our thousands of independent retailer customers will drive continued growth.\nWe also continue to expand the number of Pinch A Penny franchise locations in the Sunbelt markets, gaining an even stronger foothold in key year-round markets as we added 7 franchise locations this year with more in development for next year. This acquisition also brought us strategic capabilities in chemical packaging, making us more vertically integrated in improving our margins and capabilities.\nWe further gained incredible customer technology platforms and applications that we intend to leverage across our entire business to grow our independent retailers' customers' businesses. We have remained disciplined in our capital allocation, maintaining a leverage ratio well below the 1.5 to 2x target that we have historically observed. And we have returned $572 million to our shareholders this past year in the form of share buybacks and increased dividends.\nOur industry is somewhat unique given the high recurring revenue nature of the business. We also enjoy a market-leading position, expanding capabilities and an unmatched track record. While no one is certain about what challenges we will face in the future, we can be certain that we will rise to the occasion. Our mix of business is most heavily weighted on nondiscretionary spending, and we provide best-in-class service and value for our customers.\nAdditionally, we do not believe that inflation across most of our product categories will revert to previous levels as this would be unprecedented and not sustainable given the historic cost increases that our manufacturer partners have absorbed.\nThank you. And I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter finished with a record $1.6 billion in sales, representing 14% growth over the 24% growth realized in 2021 for a 2-year cumulative increase of 42%. In comparing the quarterly growth of 14% to the full year expectations of 17% to 19%, we saw third quarter growth of approximately 10% on pricing, 4% on acquisitions and net overall domestic volume growth. This was offset by unfavorable impact of 1% each for Europe operations, foreign currency and 1 less selling day in the quarter.\nWe also had some sales center closures during Hurricane Ian over the last few days of the quarter. Historically, big weather events have resulted in short-term disruption with a slight positive impact in the subsequent quarters. Gross margins of 31.2% came in slightly below prior year margins of 31.3%. Base business margin decreased 80 basis points over prior year, where we saw a 250 basis point increase in the third quarter 2021 over 2020 levels.\nFocused pricing efforts, supply chain initiatives and product mix all contributed to sustaining higher margin levels during the quarter as prior year benefited from our strong ability to pass through price as we saw multiple in-season price increases from our vendors. Base business operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 14.5% in prior year to 14.2% as our capacity-creation efforts continued delivering operating margin leverage as we managed through the inflationary cost impact of our business.\nAcquisitions added $20 million in expenses during the third quarter compared to last year. Overall, our quarterly operating margins remained strong at 16.3%. We continue to invest in growth strategies while being focused on our disciplined expense management.\nInterest expense for the quarter increased $9.4 million as we have higher debt levels compared to the same time last year, reflecting our investments in acquisitions, share buybacks and working capital. Our average interest rate increased from 2.8% to 3.2%, reflecting higher borrowing costs. We continue to maintain a conservative trailing 4-quarter leverage ratio of 1.25, still well below our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2x.\nFor the quarter, we recorded an ASU benefit of $0.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The same quarter last year had a higher level of activity, resulting in a $4.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share benefit. With our current stock price, we estimate that we would recognize approximately $0.04 in additional benefits in either the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for remaining options that expire in first quarter 2023.\nThe effective tax rate excluding ASU for the quarter was 24.9% compared to 23.2% for the prior year period, consistent with our historically slightly lower rates in third quarter than for the full year. Net income for the quarter represents an improvement of $5.4 million. Excluding the ASU, it reflects an improvement of $9 million or 5% driven by revenue growth, healthy gross margins and continued strong execution. This resulted in a 7% earnings per share growth, excluding the ASU in both periods.\nMoving into our balance sheet and cash flow discussion. Accounts receivable increased consistent with sales growth compared to last year. Days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 27 days, a slight improvement when compared to more historical levels that were in the 28- to 30-day range. Inventory increased to $1.5 billion compared to slightly over $1 billion in Q3 2021. We have seen incremental growth in inventory year-over-year decrease from 77% at second quarter to 48% or 43% base business as we wrapped up third quarter.\nApproximately $104 million of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation, $52 million was added to support acquisitions and $13 million for the 5 new U.S. locations that were not open in third quarter of last year. We have realized strong returns from our investments in inventory and supply chain initiatives, and the value of the inventory on hand will continue to provide incremental gross margin benefits as we have seen additional vendor cost increases in the 4% to 5% range heading into next season.\nDuring fourth quarter 2022 and first quarter 2023, we expect to begin receiving inventory placed on early-buy terms consistent with 2019 and prior years to prepare for the upcoming season. Our resulting inventory balances at year-end will vary depending upon the timing of shipments of those orders by the vendors. However, any orders placed on early buys have all been strategically evaluated.\nWe have reduced the dollar value of [OPPOs] by approximately 60% from peak levels as lead times have improved from vendors. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $307 million compared to $359 million in 2021. The increase in net income of $134 million was offset by increases in working capital. Recall that 2022 cash flow also reflects $80 million of income tax payments that we deferred from 2021 as a result of Hurricane Ida.\nIn the fourth quarter 2021, we continued to add to base business inventory. And so this year's fourth quarter, we would expect to generate more cash as the number of our inventory receipts expected in fourth quarter will include extended early-buy payment terms. We anticipate finishing the year with solid adjusted cash flows, around 80% of net income excluding the Ida tax payment, while positioned to benefit from inventory investments going into 2023.\nOur inventory balance at year-end could range from plus 10% to plus 25%, depending on the timing of vendor early-buy shipments. This is slightly ahead of the plus 5% we were expecting earlier in the year before we had the opportunity to evaluate the early buys.\nWe have paid $112 million to date in dividends to shareholders, a 27.5% increase over last year through the third quarter. Additionally, we have purchased $192 million worth of shares on the open market during the quarter for a total of $461 million year-to-date and have $230 million available under our current authorization.\nLeverage at the end of third quarter was 1.25x and is well managed within our stated capital allocation model while investing first in the working capital of the business and providing strong returns to our shareholders. We expect to be at or below our target range at the end of the year.\nAs we look out for the balance of the year with just the fourth quarter remaining, we still expect our sales growth to range from 17% to 19%, reflecting a 5% contribution from acquisitions and 10% from inflation. We are not expecting Europe to recover during the remainder of the year so we project that to be a 1% drag on the full year with an additional 1% from foreign currency.\nWeather and the extent of repair activity that takes place in the Florida area may impact how we close out the year. Inflation impacts for fourth quarter are expected to be approximately 8% compared to the 10% for the full year. Selling days for fourth quarter and the full year will be the same as last year.\nAs we lap the 260 basis point gross margin improvements realized in fourth quarter 2021, we would expect gross margins in the fourth quarter to decline sequentially due to seasonal timing and also be negatively impacted by lower inflation from vendor price increases this year and fourth quarter compared to last year and lower incentives earned under volume-based vendor programs, resulting in 150 to 200 basis points decline in Q4 gross margins compared to last year. We focus mainly on full year gross margins and will finish the year up from prior year.\nConsidering future expected rate increases during the balance of the year and our higher borrowing levels, interest expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be significantly higher than last year, resulting in interest expense for the year of $43 million to $44 million, up from our previously estimated $40 million. Consistent with our overall capital allocation, we have a conservative position on debt management and currently have in place $300 million or 20% of our outstanding debt covered under interest rate swap agreements that convert our line of credit debt to fixed rates that are currently below market rates, mitigating the full impact of our debt exposure to rising interest rates.\nThe share repurchase activity during the year reduced overall shares outstanding, and we expect full year weighted average diluted shares to be approximately 40.1 million, including participating securities. Any further share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter is not expected to have an impact on our share forecast for the year based on the time remaining in the year.\nWe have narrowed our earnings guidance range and reflected the additional ASU benefits recorded during third quarter. This brings our guidance range for the year to $18.50 to $19.05, including the $0.02 ASU tax benefit added in the quarter for $0.24 year-to-date. This represents expected earnings per share growth of 20% to 24%, excluding the impact of ASU benefit.\nAs mentioned above, the impact from expiring options in first quarter will be expected to provide a $0.04 benefit. However, timing is uncertain and thus not considered in the guidance range for Q4 but will be included in the 2023 guidance for any unexercised amounts as of year-end.\nAs we wrap up another successful pool season, we are extremely proud of the hard work the team has done to continue to grow the industry, and we look forward to finishing the year strong. We will now begin our Q&A session."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call.\nOur discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2022 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K.\nIn addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our Investor Relations section.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Peter Arvan. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, President & Director, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call.\nThis morning, we proudly reported another record quarter with net sales coming in at $2.1 billion, an increase of 15% marking our first ever $2-plus billion quarter and beating last year's very strong second quarter where we saw sales increase by 40%. These results prove exceptional given the challenges that we faced this past quarter in weather, the supply chain and recognizing that the second quarter is where growth capacity industry-wide is most limited.\nThere were many factors that came into play this quarter that when taken in totality, demonstrate the strength of the company and the resilience of the industry.\nFirst off, I would say that demand for new pools is solid and not surprisingly, the backlog on new pool construction is somewhat smaller than this time last year. Our builders are reporting leads have slowed a bit, but that they have plenty of work on new construction and renovation projects on the ever-expanding installed base of pools.\nSecond, following 2 years of very favorable weather in the second quarter, we experienced a cooler and wetter start this year in our seasonal markets that delayed many projects, impacting the demand and timing of sales of many products from packaged pools and equipment to chemicals. As we would have expected, when the weather improved later in the quarter, sales for these products increased to fulfill the strong demand.\nThird, supply chain constraints have improved in many areas, but persist in several products that contain computer chips like variable speed pumps and automation. Our trichlor inventories have improved tremendously, but the availability of granular cal hypo used to shock swimming pools is very tight affecting sales for that product.\nFourth, we have seen a continuation of the demand for connected and smart technology products like automation, salt chlorination, variable speed pumps, robotic cleaners and customizations, which positively impact revenue on repair and replacement as well as new construction and remodel, and we expect that will continue.\nFifth, without a doubt, our inventory management program has helped us keep pace with the strong demand and fluctuating lead times as the installed base of pools grows and favorable market dynamics continue. At the same time, we have seen a decline in the demand of some categories that were supercharged by the pandemic, such as above ground pools and heaters as mentioned on previous calls. Fortunately, the decline represents a very small percentage of our total sales.\nLastly, the inflation that has worked its way into the industry is passing through the channel, which is reflected in our revenue and gross profit performance. We believe that most of the inflation that we are seeing is driven by structural cost increases by our suppliers, making these new price levels permanent in nature.\nTo summarize, we would characterize the current situation and near-term outlook as positive with mix and price more than offsetting some declines in unit volumes that are driven by supply chain constrained items and weather-related delays for both construction and pool maintenance products. As I mentioned, the reported backlog may be returning back to more normal levels, but the installed base, which is where we derive over 80% of our revenue, continues to grow ensuring that demand for our products, including maintenance and repair and remodel items remain strong.\nAcquisitions, most notably Porpoise Pool & Patio as projected, are performing extremely well at 85% to our revenue during the quarter. Excluding revenue from new franchise locations, our acquired Pinch operations grew by 14% in the quarter. Pinch is a very proven and unique value -- Pinch has a very proven and unique value proposition, which allows the individual owners to operate best-in-class stores while the business continues to attract new franchisees.\nLooking at the base business in our 4 largest markets, California saw sales increased 9% in the quarter. This is on top of the 33% growth that we saw last year in the same quarter. Texas saw revenues grow by 17%, while Arizona saw sales grow by 20%. Our Florida business continues to benefit from a very robust economy and grew by 23%.\nOverall, our year-on markets grew by 16% and our seasonal market by 5% as they were impacted by the weather pattern that I mentioned above.\nContinuing to base business product sales results, we were very pleased with what we saw during the quarter.\nEquipment, which grew by 35% in the second quarter of 2021, grew by an additional 7% in the second quarter of 2022. As mentioned, supply chain disruptions and shortages of key components continue to impact this area, and it is worth noting that last year, in the same quarter, we were still working through the Texas freeze impact. Additionally, keep in mind the seasonal markets experienced unfavorable weather this year which is very different than the favorable weather in early parts that positively impacted their results in the previous 2 years.\nChemical sales increased by 25% in the quarter, a better inventory position on trichlor helped, but we were hampered by the shortage in cal hypo this year. Not surprisingly, with this year's weather pattern, volumes, particularly in the retail sizes were softer in the quarter when compared to last year. As mentioned, retail sales improved as the weather turned more favorable as the quarter progressed.\nBuilding materials' sales increased by 22%, which is on top of the 33% growth in this category that we saw in the second quarter of 2021. Our ability to grow this category is strong. We are adding and refreshing NPT centers and capabilities to bring the most complete product offering in this category closer to our customers and help them showcase this product to the millions of pool owners and thousands of new or prospective pool owners across North America. Our capabilities in this area are unmatched as we offer the most complete line of products, expert advice and training and the best customer experience in the industry. Additionally, our digital catalog and augmented reality tool called the NPT backyard app, helped bring the showroom to the homeowners' own backyard virtually.\nRetail sales, which -- retail sales excluding Pinch A Penny grew by 7% in the quarter, clearly feeling the effects of the weather in our seasonal markets. For comparative purposes, we grew retail sales 20% in the same period last year. It is noteworthy that the results on a year-to-date basis are up 13%.\nLooking at the results on a regional basis, we see a clear bifurcation that is weather-driven with the year-round markets posting results similar to Pinch A Penny, which is highly concentrated in Florida and Texas.\nCommercial pool product sales are up 23%, and that is on top of the 45% growth that we saw in the same period of 2021. With leisure travel bouncing back and strong demand in this category, we are encouraged with this trend and no one is better positioned to serve this than POOLCORP. We have deep expertise and an expansive inventory earned in the critical time-sensitive nature of this business.\nNow let me add some color on our European business results. After a tremendous 2021, Europe is facing a difficult 2022, driven by very unfavorable weather, uncertainty on the continent because of the war in Ukraine and a slowing economy that is grappling with surging energy and food costs, we saw sales decline 18% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, it was negative 8%. For perspective, this compares with the same quarter in 2021, where we saw sales surge 42%. Our European team is very seasoned and is managing the business appropriately, and we remain very committed to our European strategy over the long haul.\nTurning to Horizon, once again, we are very pleased with the results. Base business sales grew by 14% and total sales, including acquisitions, increased by 15%. Once again, I'd like to point out that this compares with 2021, which in the same period, we saw sales increase by 31%. Jeff Clay and his team continue to execute our strategic plan with very strong results. We remain very committed to the industry and highly confident in our team's ability to grow and take additional share.\nAt this juncture, let me add some commentary on gross margin, expenses and operating income. Starting off with gross margins. I'm very pleased to show that overall gross margin percent increased 150 basis points to 32.4%. This marks the first time that we have ever exceeded 32%, so yet another milestone for the POOLCORP team. For our base business, gross margin percent increased 100 basis points to 31.9%. Many factors combined to drive the increase. Pricing management, our supply chain activities, product and customer mix all helped drive the increase in gross margin percent. Additionally, we are in the early stages of vertically integrating certain chemical lines with Porpoise Pool & Patio, which is helping drive the increase.\nConversely, we faced headwinds in some of our vendor incentive programs as growth tiers are impacted by the timing of our purchases. Furthermore, the rapid pace of vendor price increases has subsided. Again, none of this is a surprise and we have planned and executed accordingly. As you can see, our gross margin improvement is driven by a multitude of levers that, when combined, more than offset the headwinds that we face.\nLooking at operating expenses, we are very pleased to see that our capacity creation activities continue to drive rebuilds. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales in our base business fell 40 basis points while overall operating expenses increased 20 basis points, reflecting the acquisition of Porpoise in our results. Considering the tremendous inflation that we have seen almost across the board from wages and salaries to fuel leases and transportation, we are very happy with how the team has remained focused and executed at the highest levels.\nPOOL360 sales grew by 9% in the quarter, making up 12% of total sales. I would also like to point out that we have released our next generation of POOL360 which contains a long list of customer-driven enhancements that we believe will result in higher adoption rates of this capacity creating tool.\nWrapping up the income statement, we posted operating income of $419 million, and operating margin of 20.4%, respectively. These results reflect a 24% increase in operating income and a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. We are extremely proud of these spectacular results, all made possible by the combined efforts of our extraordinary team here at POOLCORP, our dedicated and loyal vendor partners and our tremendously creative and hard-working customers, all of whom work together to help more people enjoy outdoor living. We could not be more thankful for this teamwork.\nPOOLCORP is a unique well-managed company in a resilient industry. Technology to modernize the millions of pools that make up the installed base and build pools of the future continues to be developed and released by our supplier partners and adoption as such is in the early stages at best. Our own technology to make the entire supply chain from the manufacturers to the customers more productive and bring us closer together, giving everyone back valuable time continues to get better. The future is bright and more connected than ever.\nWe are balanced in our approach and have always been very strategic with capital allocation and investments looking out at the changing landscape and positioning the company to have a value proposition that is second to none and create additional capacity for growth.\nOur latest investment in Porpoise Pool & Patio is only just starting to realize its true potential now that we have integrated and are one team. We will continue to expand the footprint, extract the synergies and leverage the industry-leading technology to improve our value proposition to the thousands of independent specialty retail stores that we serve, giving them world-class capabilities. This is a very powerful combination that we know accelerates our growth and the ability to gain share even in an uncertain business environment because each business is made better by the combination.\nWe have always been an organic growth-oriented company with the ability to select, acquire and integrate accretive businesses where we see value. Additionally, no one is better or has a more prudent track record with greenfields than POOLCORP. We have successfully opened in 31 locations in the last 4 years and will open an additional 10 to 12 this year. We are a performance-based company that attracts, retains and develops industry-leading talent, creating vibrant career paths for our employees. We have a deep, loyal -- or we have deep loyal customer relationships and strong vendor partnerships that when combined with our team produce great financial results that are durable.\nUnlike most other building product distributors, POOLCORP enjoys a unique advantage of essentially maintaining a lifelong relationship with every pool that is built and remains in service. We provide the construction material and the maintenance supplies and the remodeling products required during the entire existence of each pool, whether it is a DIY maintained pool or one that is serviced by one of our professional customers. It is an annuity industry and business model that grows upon itself as more pools are built or products are demanded forever.\nWith all of this in mind and half of the year behind us, we are raising our full year guidance to $18.38 to $19.13 per share.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie for her financial commentary and balance sheet update.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone.\nAs expected, second quarter 2022 continued with robust 15% sales growth over 2021, pumping last year's phenomenal growth in our seasonally significant quarter, which is a tremendous accomplishment. This represents a 22% sales growth increase year-to-date.\nInflation impact for the quarter was around 10%. Additional vendor price increases, primarily in the equipment area occurred during the quarter, having just a partial impact on the current quarter due to the timing of the increases. Our recent acquisitions added 5% to our sales growth in the quarter.\nOverall volume growth was in line with our expectations, lapping the remaining impact of the Texas freeze that benefited sales growth in 2021. However, we did see negative impact on sales activity from weather in Canada, the Upper Midwest and the Northeast, which we believe slows sales growth by 1% to 2% during the quarter. The weather impact was evident in the April sales growth rate being the lowest month of the quarter. But as Pete mentioned, the growth rate improved throughout the quarter with sales growth in the year-round markets continuing to be strong.\nEurope experienced a negative weather and macro impact, resulting in an 8% local currency decline from 2021 during the quarter compared to a local currency 31% growth in Q2 2021. As they represented only 5% of net sales in '21, the estimated impact on the consolidated financials for the quarter is approximately 2%. A negative 1% impact from foreign currency also brought down results.\nIn summary, for the quarter, Q1 included an early buy shift of approximately 1% of sales that would have normally taken place in Q2. We experienced a negative 1% to 2% from North American weather, a 2% drag in Europe from weather and macro events and a 1% foreign currency impact.\nGross margins hit an impressive 32.4% for the quarter and 32.1% year-to-date. During the second quarter, we realized a 100 basis point improvement on base business activity with a 150 basis point consolidated increase over 2Q 2021.\nSecond quarter typically has higher gross margins than we report for the full year as a result of seasonality. This increase over prior year moderated in Q2 from the increase reported in Q1 as we faced significant improvements achieved in the same quarter last year.\nWe reported an accretive benefit from our acquisitions. We also continue to see gross margin dollar benefits from product mix as items such as variable speed pumps, LED lights, automation and custom features experienced higher sales growth than their more traditional nonautomated counterparts.\nWe saw increased activity through our CSLs or centralized shipping locations. This provides a significant benefit to our network in order to manage inventory in a tight supply environment and ensure we can replenish our locations timely to avoid lost sales from stock outs while enhancing our gross margins on certain products. Better inventory positions on faster-moving products and increased selling prices made necessary from vendor cost increases also provided an incremental benefit.\nOperating expenses increased only 16% on a gross profit dollar increase of 21% as our continued ability to manage seasonal sales volume coupled with our capacity creation efforts resulted in increased operating leverage, even though experiencing above historical levels inflationary increases in compensation expense, rent and freight costs. This includes an additional $21 million in operating expenses in the quarter from recent acquisitions.\nOperating margin increased 150 basis points in the quarter and operating income increased to $419 million. The power of our operating model is that it provides us the ability to make incremental improvements as we grow and also the flexibility to ensure that we sustain operating margin as a significant portion of our compensation expense is comprised of our performance-based incentive program so that our employees are rewarded along with our shareholders a series of operating income improvement. Our strategic planning process and proven operating capabilities and management discipline developed over our 40-year history and 27 years as a public company provides us the agility to respond in changing macroeconomic times.\nInterest expense for the quarter increased $6.6 million from prior year second quarter to $8.5 million due to higher debt levels compared to last year. Our trailing 4 quarter leverage ratio was 1.1x and a continued conservative position even with higher average debt from working capital investments, acquisitions and increased share repurchasing activities and remains well below our overall targeted range of 1.5 to 2x.\nWe recorded an ASU benefit of $1.6 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to $7.7 million or $0.19 per diluted share that we realized in the same period in 2021. As the timing of when these benefits are realized are related to restricted stock vesting and option exercises and computed based on the stock price in effect at the time of the transaction, this tax benefit has and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nI would now like to turn our discussion over to our balance sheet and capital allocation.\nReceivables increased 29%, reflecting higher sales growth in June than the full quarter, additional amounts due from vendor programs as a result of higher sales year-to-date and 5% from acquisitions. Product inventories had decreased from our peak in March 2022 as we prepared well and ordered inventory early to be fully stocked for the season. Inventories that were in short supply at this time last year, in particular, trichlor tablets are now in a position to allow for consistent supply to customers versus the rolling stockouts we experienced last year.\nAs a result, we have realized approximately 20% increased sales volume for these products. The overall balance includes approximately $90 million in higher cost inventory from inflation, which we expect to realize an additional selling price and approximately $50 million from acquisitions. We are pleased with the quality of the inventory on hand and do not expect any negative margin impacts resulting from managing inventory. We actively monitor inventory levels related to chemicals, pipe and rebar, areas where we have seen higher inflation. We review inventory levels and turns by sales centers at the individual SKU level and believe current on-hand amounts are appropriate in relation to expected future sales.\nNet cash provided by operations was $28.7 million year-to-date, down from the $187.2 million generated in the same period last year. The current year period includes an $80 million cash payment that was deferred from 2021 as a result of Hurricane Ida and $136 million more cash outlays in the first half of the year on inventory. In 2021, we continued to develop inventory through the second half of the year in order to keep up with sales demand and added approximately $430 million in base business inventory in the second half of 2021.\nAs we have seen improved lead times, we would expect to seasonally bring down inventory in third quarter 2022 in order to take advantage of early buy opportunities that we expect to arise as normal in fourth quarter 2022. For the year, we are expecting to generate significant free cash flows.\nThe Board authorized a 25% increase to our quarterly dividend rate beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Our quarterly dividend rate of $1 per share represents the 12th consecutive year we have increased our dividend rate. We now expect to return approximately $150 million to shareholders in cash dividends for the year.\nAlso in May, the Board increased our share buyback authorization to $600 million from the $404 million available under our previous share repurchase authorization. We have taken full advantage of the increased authorization and completed $216 million in share repurchases during the quarter, acquiring 547,000 shares and bringing our year-to-date total share repurchases to $268 million. This is the highest ever commitment from the company on both the dollars invested in the annual period and the number of shares purchased.\nEarnings or guidance for the year increased to $18.38 to $19.13 includes $0.22 ASU tax benefit realized to date. This reflects a growth range of 20% to 25% excluding the impact of the tax benefit.\nInflation expectations for the year are largely unchanged at an estimated 10% to 11%. Inflation in the second half of the year will moderate from what we have reported year-to-date as we begin lapping the increases that were realized in the second half of 2021.\nOur sales growth expectations for the year remain consistent with the net sales guidance range of 17% to 19% we discussed on our February call. Additional vendor price increases in second quarter, not factored into our previous guidance, are offset by slight decreases in volume as a portion of the business related to consumables was impacted by negative weather in Q2. Our guidance also factors in updates for Europe and foreign currency impacts. Our estimate for the 5% contribution from acquisitions is unchanged. We will also have one less selling day in third quarter and with the additional selling day we reported in first quarter, we will have the same net number of days for the year.\nForecasted gross profit margin for the full year may be slightly up from our previous guidance of comparable to 2021 as part of the revised inflation announced in Q2. We realized 240 basis points and 260 basis points improvement in margins in third quarter and fourth quarter 2021 and so expecting gross margin numbers in the back half of the year to moderate more in line with our longer-term guidance. The increases we have in interest rate environment, along with our revised average debt outstanding, resulted in an updated estimate of the interest expense line of $35 million to $40 million. We expect our year-end leverage to be less than 1.5x.\nNo changes are expected in our income tax rate for the full year and we continue to expect the third quarter rate to be slightly lower than the annual rate.\nWith the effect of the shares we have repurchased to date, we are updating our year-end estimate for shares outstanding to approximately 40.3 million shares.\nWe continue adding to our future growth capacity with 5 greenfield sales centers opening year-to-date and an acquisition completed early in the second quarter in West Virginia, a state we haven't previously had a physical presence in. With this acquisition, we now have sales centers operating in 40 states. We have also added one new Pinch A Penny franchise store during the quarter, bringing year-to-date new franchise openings to 3 stores. We still expect to open around 10 new franchise locations this year.\nOne area that has been in the headlines lately is a significant shortage of lifeguards across the country, preventing some community pools from opening this even. We're passionate about expanding the enjoyment from swimming and the outdoor living lifestyle. As part of our ongoing partnership with the YMCA, we recently donated $1 million to 8 YMCA's tubing locations throughout the country with strong aquatic programs. These donations will provide training for more than 900 lifeguards and swimming lessons for 8,600 children who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to learn basic water skills.\nWe are very pleased with our results for the first half of 2022 and expect continued growth in the second half as our industry begins to see some relief from the supply chain challenges.\nI will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nWelcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2022 and future periods.\nActual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K. In addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures will be included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our Investor Relations section.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Peter Arvan. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, President & Director, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. Earlier today, we released our first quarter 2022 results, and there were nothing short of spectacular. Revenue grew by 33% in the quarter, ending at $1.4 billion. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter with sales over $1 billion and is the second biggest quarter ever for POOLCORP. Making this even more notable is that this tremendous growth compares to a very strong first quarter in 2021 when we posted growth of 57%.\nOutdoor living remains a priority with homeowners across North America, which continues to keep demand for our products is strong. New pool construction backlogs are solid and will keep builders busy for much of this year.\nFamilies continue to invest in their backyards and enjoy the benefits of a healthy outdoor living lifestyle. Pent-up demand for renovation continues on the installed base of pools and hardscapes, fueled by a tight housing market and rising home values. The maintenance and repair business is strong, with the most maintenance companies commenting that the tight labor market isn't allowing them to expand as fast as the market opportunities will allow.\nFortunately, we have seen some improvements in the supply chain issues that plagued the industry last year. Our investment in inventory, infrastructure and relentless focus on execution, when combined with our vendors' capacity investments, had eased some shortages and allowed us to provide a better customer experience than a year ago.\nGeographically, we continue to see strength in our 4 major Sunbelt markets as well as our seasonal markets despite some adverse weather in the Midwest and Northeast markets during this quarter. Arizona showed the strongest growth rate with base business sales increasing 33%, followed by California where we saw base business increase 31%. Florida was also very strong with 30% base business increased growth. And Texas, which had an extremely tough comp due to the freeze event last year, posted a 7% gain in its base business.\nAs a reminder, we believe this event last year added approximately $20 million of revenue to our first quarter in 2021. With that in mind, we are quite pleased with the Texas results.\nDemand was also robust in our seasonal markets as we saw base business grow by 28%. Overall, we view the weather in the first quarter of 2022 as much less favorable than we saw in the same period of last year.\nWhen we reported full year 2021 results, we said that we believe new pool construction in 2021 was approximately 120,000 units. PK data has released their final number for 2021 and confirmed the number of in-ground pools constructed was 117,000 units, which equates to a 22% growth rate over 2020.\nWith 9 months left in the year, we think it is a bit premature to call the 2022 number given the many unknowns, which include weather, labor availability and other economic indicators, but we remain very encouraged by what we are seeing so far this year. Most of our builder and remodel customers are reporting strong backlogs for new pools and a growing backlog of remodel projects created by builders focusing on new construction -- more on new construction than remodeled during the last couple of years. Clearly, the southern migration where the attachment rate of swimming pools is much higher, de-urbanization, the continuation of the work from home trend and a tight housing market are all combining to fuel the industry's growth.\nIt is important to remind you that new pool construction, albeit very important to us and the industry, represents the smallest portion of our business at less than 20%. With maintenance and repair, renovation and remodel representing approximately 60% and 20%, respectively. We believe this is a very healthy balance and continue to invest in the margin-accretive maintenance and repair portion of our business that provides consistent growth with attractive margins. Porpoise Pool & Patio represents the latest and most significant investment in this area.\nTurning to end markets. Commercial Pool revenues were also very healthy as we saw sales increase 34% in the quarter. This compares with the 26% growth that we saw in the fourth quarter and 24% growth that we saw for the full year of 2021. This market is healthy with maintenance and repair demand growing and a healthy backlog of construction and renovation projects in the pipeline.\nOur base business sales to independent retailers, buoyed by strong demand in the year-round markets and strong early buy activity, grew by 28% in the quarter. Results from Pinch A Penny were very similar and quite encouraging.\nAs we closed the first quarter, we crossed the first 100-day mark of our ownership of this strategic acquisition. Store traffic is brisk and demand is solid across the platform. Pinch A Penny added 2 new franchise locations in the quarter and have a robust development pipeline. We have combined resources on chemical sourcing and product management and have begun packaging some products for our independent pool stores under the proprietary POOLCORP brands.\nThe operations teams have begun prioritizing the many synergies that we have identified. We are quite pleased with this investment as we believe it significantly strengthens our value proposition and extends our reach in the nondiscretionary part of the market serving the DIY pool owner, an estimated $3 billion market opportunity.\nNext up, let me provide some context on our base business product sales. Equipment, which includes heaters, pumps, filters, lighting and automation, grew by 18%. Considering the impact of the Texas freeze, we are very pleased with these results. By and large, the supply chain issues that continue to improve for these products, with some exceptions that I will comment on shortly. Chemicals grew by 58%, which was driven by much better supply, coupled with solid demand.\nFinally, building material sales, which is being fueled by strong demand in new construction and renovation activity, grew by 29%. This follows 20% growth in the fourth quarter and 28% growth for the full year in 2021, further supporting the theme that demand remains strong.\nLooking across all products, it is easy to see the strength in our business and how our unique value proposition allows us to leverage growth opportunities by providing unparalleled service to our customers while being the best channel to market for our supplier partners.\nSwitching continents now, I'd like to provide some comments on our European business. For the quarter, Europe grew by 5%, which compares to a very strong first quarter in 2021, where we saw sales increase by 115%. The weather situation in Europe when compared to last year same period was clearly a challenge, and product availability was also impacted by logistical slowdowns in Southern Europe.\nThe war in Eastern Europe is also having an effect on -- as consumers are grappling with higher energy costs and the overall uncertainty in the East. We expect that as the weather warms, demand will increase. However, our seasoned team remains focused on execution and vigilant of market conditions. As a reminder, in 2021, this business represented approximately 5% of our overall revenue and 4% of our profit, so the impact is small and is contemplated in our guidance.\nHorizon continues to perform very well. Overall, the base business in Horizon grew by 32% for the quarter, which compares to 22% growth in the fourth quarter and 24% growth for the same quarter in 2021. We are very pleased with our sustained progress on this growth platform and continue to invest in expanding the business.\nOverall, demand for housing, commercial construction and renovation of outdoor living spaces continues to grow and remains strong across all geographies and all products.\nWorking down the income statement, I'll discuss gross margins. For the quarter, we reported gross margins of 31.7%, a 330-basis-point improvement over the same period last year. Our supply chain initiatives, pricing and the Porpoise Pool & Patio acquisition, all combined to drive the increase. Melanie will add more color on this topic in her prepared remarks.\nOperating expenses as a percent of sales came in at an impressive 15% as compared to 16.2% for the same period last year. Our relentless focus on capacity creation and execution continue to pay dividends for us and help offset the inflation that we are seeing on operating costs.\nPool 360 utilization, which is a cornerstone of our capacity creation activity, grew by 28%, which shows how much customers value the convenience and time-saving and functionality that it provides.\nCompleting my comments on the income statement, we proudly reported operating income of $236 million, an 83% improvement over the first quarter of 2021. Not only is this another record first quarter profit, it is also the second most profitable quarter in our company's history.\nTo do that in the first quarter of the year makes it even more impressive. Operating margins came in at 16.7%, a 450-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter totaled $4.41, an 82% increase over the same period last year.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We significantly expanded our inventories during the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year as supply chain issues eased, and we bought ahead to ensure adequate supplies to meet the strong demand of the early buy season. We are in a very strong inventory position heading into our peak selling season to include chemicals where supply has been extremely tight in 2021. We expect that this will enable us to continue to gain market share, utilizing our capital strength and sales center network, leveraged to meet the continued strong customer demand. Melanie will give more specific details on the balance sheet and cash flow in her comments.\nBefore I provide comments around our updated guidance, I'd like to add some color on a few topics that I ensure are on everyone's mind: inflation, material availability and the near-term outlook.\nWhen we discuss the full year 2021 results, we mentioned that we believe inflation would be in the 9% to 10% range for the 2022 season and that we would expect that to pass through the channel as is normally the case. So far this year, this has generally played out as we expected on both accounts. Inflation is higher in the first part of the year, but because of the timing of increases, we expect that it will end the year between 10% and 11%.\nBecause this inflation traditionally passes through the channel, we made a strategic decision last year to invest incremental capital and inventory to address the supply chain uncertainties and improve our ability to fulfill elevated demand. In addition, in some cases, it provided us an opportunity to buy ahead of some anticipated price increases. This has and continues to provide benefit to our customers and our suppliers by bringing valuable inventory into the most expansive network of sales centers in the industry.\nAs of now, we have 414 locations, up from 410 at the end of the year, with an additional 6 to 8 planned for the balance of the year. To date, this inflation has yet to dampen demand as many of the current projects are part of a robust backlog that the industry carried into 2022.\nAt this point, very few cancellations or customer-driven delays are being reported, so we expect 2022 to be a very solid year. As you would expect, this inflation, along with the rising cost of labor and other costs, have increased the average price of an in-ground pool. PK Data, a well-known source for information on the swim coal industry just released their 2021 report, and they show that the average price of an in-ground swimming pool in 2021 to be approximately $56,000, a 17% increase over 2020. Given this year's inflation, we would expect that to climb again in 2022.\nMany of our builders report that $100,000-plus pools are becoming more and more common and a focus area for many of our customers. Our customers tell us that they remain focused on the bigger projects, planning to catch up on smaller opportunities as time and labor allow.\nThe pool remodel market continues to have strong demand and a growing backlog with many builders and remodelers focusing on new construction for the last couple of years as demand grew. Most builders are reporting that they have sufficient demand to carry them through the 2022 season. Those same customers are reporting that the backlog for renovation and remodel is healthy and will provide growth opportunities going forward, especially when you consider the aging installed base and the new construction focus that we have seen for the last 2 seasons.\nAs it relates to maintenance and the repair part of our business, which, let me remind you, is the largest portion of our business, making up approximately 60% of our revenues, and is essentially nondiscretionary and continues to grow with the installed base growth.\nNew products also are helping this category grow as many customers or consumers are opting for smart and energy-efficient technology when repair and replacements are needed. Material availability continues to improve. Capacity investments by our manufacturing partners, when combined with the increased investment in inventory, are allowing us to provide better service to our customers when compared to a year ago.\nOur chemical inventory, trichlor, in particular, is in much better shape than a year ago. This is driven by strategic sourcing activities along with the Porpoise Pool & Patio chemical packaging operation capabilities of SunCoast Chemical. Equipment inventories are also much improved this year, enabling us to start the season in a much better position than we did a year ago and not having to contend with the shock demand that the weather event of the Texas freeze triggered last year.\nLighting, automation and some variable speed pumps and motors are still suffering from the global chip shortage, but other products like heaters and valves are improved. We have seen some signs that products like above-ground pools and even spas may have peaked and are showing some weakness when compared to the elevated COVID demand. But in total, these products represent less than 2% of our revenue.\nOver time, POOLCORP has consistently demonstrated that our execution and strategic investments have enabled us to deliver solid results in a variety of economic environments. We expect to continue building upon our stellar track record.\nConsidering all of this information and reflecting our confidence in the remainder of the year, we are pleased to update and raise our guidance for the full year 2022 to $18.34 to $19.09 per share, including the $0.18 ASU tax benefit in the first quarter, from the previous $17.19 to $17.94, which included $0.19 ASU tax benefit.\nLastly, and before I turn the call over to Melanie for her comments, we would like to thank the team here at POOLCORP. Our customers and our supplier partners for their collective and tireless effort to help bring outdoor living to life. We could not be prouder of the team, more thankful for our customers and more appreciative of the partnerships with our manufacturers.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Chief Financial Officer, for her commentary.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. First quarter 2022 continued with record sales and earnings results. We remain focused on having the right products in the right locations to provide for the best possible customer experience as we all collectively continue to navigate supply chain challenges.\nSales activity in the first quarter benefited from inflation between 10% to 12% compared to the first quarter 2021 as our vendors had multiple price increases throughout the year in 2021. We also realized a 7% to 8% increase from acquisitions and an estimated 5% growth in the quarter from an additional selling day and increased early buy activity from our customers.\nTotal gross margins increased 330 basis points to 31.7%. Base business gross margin increased 270 basis points to 31.1%, resulting in an increase in base business gross profit dollars of 38%.\nHigher inventory levels, reflecting some quantities on hand received prior to the most recent vendor price increases provided some margin benefits during the quarter. However, there are other key components to our margin changes year-over-year. Our recent Porpoise Pool & Patio acquisition increased our consolidated margins. We also had favorable product mix during the quarter.\nAs Pete mentioned, chemical sales were up more than 50% for the quarter and we have more access to supply than we did a year ago. We also saw sales increases in construction materials and plumbing at a higher rate than overall growth for the quarter. In addition, we noted continued positive impacts to our gross margins from our ongoing pricing efforts. The purchasing and supply chain improvements we've implemented in 2020 and 2021 will continue to provide benefits as we go forward. As we have seen historically, our margins and margin improvements will vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of product and customer mix.\nOperating expenses grew 23% during the quarter and includes approximately $18 million in additional expenses from recent acquisitions. Higher compensation and employee-related expenses are the most significant growth contributor, the increased headcount to support our recent acquisitions and our ongoing sales growth, and we aligned our employee reward programs with company performance and market rates. Higher expenses for building rent, freight and other operating costs reflect recent increases in rental rate renewals and inflation.\nContinued investments in our ongoing digital transformation activities generated higher technology-related expenses in the quarter. And the 4 greenfields we opened also added to our operating expenses in Q1.\nOperating income increased 83% from first quarter of 2020. Our continued ability to manage higher volumes of sales activity through our existing infrastructure and locations, while adding greenfield and strategic acquisitions in the highest growth markets has generated significant operating margin leverage. Our capacity creation efforts to improve customer experience, reduce customer wait times and provide efficient technology solutions has also contributed to strong operating margin growth. Our scale and operating processes has positioned us to be able to continue to provide significant operating leverage in the future.\nWe continue to maintain a conservative leverage of 1.06x. Our average interest rate was 1.5% for the quarter based on average outstanding debt of $1.3 billion compared to $397 million at the end of first quarter 2021. We expect to see higher interest expense throughout the year as our average debt levels will remain higher than in 2021 and we will see higher borrowing costs in today's increasing rate environment.\nWe record an ASU benefit of $7.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share. This was slightly less than the $0.19 included in our guidance for first quarter as the stock price and effective time of restricted stock vesting and option exercises impacts the tax benefits realized. Consistent with prior periods, our updated guidance range only reflects the amounts we have realized to date.\nMoving to our balance sheet and cash flows. We made increased investments in working capital to support a robust sales growth of 33%. Net receivables increased 39% related to our sales growth, including sales from recent acquisitions. Days sales outstanding improved to 26.4 days from 26.6 days in 2021, highlighting our continued strong collections and positive aging trends.\nInvestments in inventory, we began in the second half of 2021 and discussed at year-end, supported our higher sales growth during a time characterized by significant supply chain challenges, and we are now well-prepared with the appropriate inventory levels for the upcoming full season.\nOur inventory dollars of $1.6 billion at March 31 are up 68% from Q1 2021 on a consolidated basis, and are up 62%, excluding inventory from acquisitions. Seasonal inventory increases from year-end levels are consistent with our prior practices as we built $302 million in first quarter 2022 compared to $196 million in 2021. Our inventory turn days of 116 are consistent with historical norms at the start of the season.\nThe additional inventory that we have strategically placed throughout our 414 locations will allow us to meet customer needs and continue to gain share. We believe this level of inventory is appropriate from the current business standpoint and would not expect to continue to further build inventory levels. We are beginning to see some lead time improvement on certain products, which is a positive sign that some of the supply chain challenges we have effectively managed over the last 12 months may be easing.\nIn prior years, we have seen significant uses of cash in the second and third quarters when amounts became due on vendor-sponsored early buy programs. As these programs were not offered in a similar manner in 2021, we have paid for our inventory purchases on current terms, which negatively impacted our Q1 cash flows, but will provide a positive influence later in the year.\nCompared to 2021, our cash returned to shareholders through dividends increased $8.8 million to $32 million, reflecting the 38% quarterly dividend rate increase that our Board of Directors authorized last year. During the quarter, we spent $62 million of the $495 million available to us at the beginning of the year under our authorized share repurchase program. In total, returning $95 million to shareholders to start off the year.\nReflecting a stellar first quarter, we have increased our EPS guidance for the full year 2022. Our new range is $18.34 to $19.09, including the $0.18 ASU tax benefit realized to date. This represents an additional 7% expected increase in earnings for the year on top of the 12% to 17% growth we projected coming into the year, for a total estimated growth of 20% to 25%. This increased full year performance estimate reflects the positive results for the first quarter and continued confidence in our expectations for the remainder of the year.\nWe now anticipate for the full year, we would realize sales growth more in line with the high end of our previous net sales guidance range of 17% to 19%. We expected to have strong growth in Q1 and results came in favorable, but largely in line with our expectations. So our revenue growth outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. We did realize 10% to 12% inflation in the first quarter and expect full year inflation to be at least 10%. Contribution from acquisitions for the full year are still expected to provide approximately 5% growth.\nWe had 1 additional selling day in first quarter that will be offset with 1 less selling day in third quarter, resulting in the same number of days for the year. We have also begun to see some impact from currency during the quarter, which could negatively impact sales growth by 1% to 2% for the year.\nWe continue to forecast gross profit margins for the full year, in line with a record 30.5% we achieved in 2021. As we discussed, these will come in higher in the first half of the year and then moderate in third and fourth quarters.\nNo significant changes were made in our updated range as it relates to operating expenses. We expect that our operating expense growth will come in higher than our historical levels, but still lower than the gross profit growth rate. Inflationary pressures on operating costs will be partially offset by our continued efforts in capacity creation initiatives, generating operating leverage, and so we expect improvement off of the record 15.7% operating margin realized in 2021.\nFor the year, we are expecting to generate significant cash, and our debt levels are projected to decrease by the time we reached December. There has been interest rate increases that have occurred so far in 2022, which pushes our interest expense estimates closer to the higher end of the range previously provided at $28 million. We are now projecting that our weighted average shares outstanding for 2022 will be approximately 40.6 million shares.\nIn conjunction with our annual report, we introduced our ESG framework, highlighting the areas we are focused on to ensure a safe and sustainable environment for our employees, customers, vendors and the communities we live and work in. Commitment to our sustainability efforts comes from the top of the organization, with our Board of Directors providing oversight as we continue to establish our baseline processes and metrics and incorporate these actions into our everyday practices. We are excited to share with you where we are on our journey.\nFirst quarter 2022 has started off the year strong. Our proven ability to continue to effectively serve our customers provides us an amazing opportunity to grow earnings in 2022 and into the future.\nI'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin our question-and-answer session."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nWelcome, everyone, to our year-end 2021 earnings conference call. Our discussion, comments and responses to questions today may include forward-looking statements, including management's outlook for 2022 and future periods. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ from projected results are discussed in our 10-K. In addition, we may make references to non-GAAP financial measures in our comments. A description and reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our Investor Relations section.\nI'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Peter Arvan. Pete?\n\nPeter D. Arvan\n\nCEO, President & Director, Pool Corporation\n\nThanks, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us. As you all saw in this morning's release, our fourth quarter results capped off an extraordinary year. Favorable weather, combined with strong demand and tremendous execution by our team, helped us post yet another record quarter. This amazing performance helped propel our full year 2021 net sales to $5.3 billion, which represents an increase of $1.4 billion over an impressive 2020.\nCertainly, acquisitions helped drive growth throughout the year, adding $257 million in revenue to our net sales, but the real star of the show and a testament to our people and strong operating model is that our base business grew 29% or $1.1 billion in very difficult operating environment. By focusing on execution, we were able to leverage this growth to achieve incredible earnings. For the full year, our diluted earnings per share soared to $15.97, a 78% improvement over 2020, yet another masterpiece.\nOur unmatched operating model and capabilities, coupled with the best, most dedicated team in the industry, allowed us to help more people enjoy a backyard oasis than ever before. We could not be prouder or more thankful for our team's efforts, our customer resilience and the support from our manufacturing partners who work diligently in a challenging business environment.\nIn this busy year, we also completed 4 acquisitions. We added Pool Source in the Nashville market, Backpack Builder Supply in the Jacksonville market to our pool distribution network. Additionally, we added water Wingate Supply to Horizon in the Tampa market. And we also completed the very strategic acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio in December. This business based out of Clearwater, Florida is a distributor of swimming pool products, a chemical packaging operation and a franchisor of best-in-class swimming pool retail stores throughout the state of Florida with additional franchise locations in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas. I'll cover this in more detail in a minute.\nIn addition to the 4 acquisitions, we opened 10 new locations this past year: 4 locations as part of our Horizon business and 6 locations on the pool side. Before getting into our view of the upcoming season, let me add some color around our amazing fourth quarter.\nIn the last quarter, we posted net sales of $1.04 billion, which is a 23% increase over the previous year's very strong fourth quarter and helped us achieve another milestone, marking 4 consecutive quarters with net sales above the $1 billion mark. Base business revenues in the fourth quarter rose 22% with acquisitions contributing 1% to the growth during the quarter. From a geographic perspective, our 4 largest markets ended the year strong. California grew by 16% in the quarter and 24% for the year. Arizona was up 24% in the quarter and 23% for the year. Texas posted 22% growth in the quarter and 34% for the year. Florida continues to be a strong area for us with 26% growth in the quarter and 30% for the year. Combined, our year-round markets grew 22% for the fourth quarter and 28% for the year.\nSeasonal markets had similarly strong results with 23% growth for the quarter and 30% for the year. Although it is still a preliminary number, we believe that new pool construction numbers in 2021 will come in around 120,000 units, which implies a growth rate of approximately 25% over the 96,000 pools that were built in 2020.\nMoving on to end markets. Commercial had a very strong fourth quarter with sales up 26% and 24% for the year. After a tough 2020, this market has rebounded nicely and continues to drive growth, with a strong maintenance and repair market and new construction picking up once again. Retail sales climbed 18% for the quarter and 20% for the year.\nLet me provide a couple of comments on inflation in the quarter. Most manufacturers announced increases in the fourth quarter as we discussed on our last call, but many came back again and announced additional increases subsequent to those previously declared. We expect these increases to pass through the channel as is normal for this business with no impact on demand. In the fourth quarter, we saw increased announcements of approximately 7%. So far this year, we have seen additional increases, which I will quantify for you later in my comments.\nTurning to product sales performance, beginning with equipment. We saw sales increased 21% for the quarter, bringing the total year to 35%. Heaters, automation products and variable speed pumps led this category's growth. Chemical sales driven largely by inflation grew 26% in the quarter and 20% for the year as supply problems continue to plague us and the industry. Lastly, building material sales, which is a key indicator of the health of the construction remodel business, saw sales climb by 20% in the quarter and 28% for the year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2020 was incredibly strong in this category as we saw sales for that period grow by 42%, making the 20% growth this quarter even more impressive.\nNow let me turn your attention to Europe. Once again, a tremendous performance. For the fourth quarter, net sales increased by 18%, and this was on top of a 48% increase for the same period last year. For the full year, Europe grew by 39%, another incredible performance by our dedicated and talented European team.\nMoving on to our Horizon business. We are incredibly proud of the performance of this strategic business and very fortunate to have such a talented team. As mentioned previously, we opened 4 new branches and completed 1 acquisition late in December that, when combined with our existing locations, helped Horizon grow by 28% in the quarter and 29% for the full year. Looking only at base business growth, Horizon posted 20% growth in the quarter and 22% growth for the full year, proof that our focus on the customer experience is helping us gain share there as well.\nTurning to gross margin. Overall, gross margin for the quarter ended at an impressive 31.1%, up 260 basis points over the same quarter last year. For the full year, we ended at 30.5%, a 180 basis point improvement over 2020. Volume-related incentive programs, along with supply chain initiatives, pricing management and product mix, all played a part in this improvement.\nOperating expenses as a percent of sales came in at 18.8% for the quarter, which is an 80 basis point improvement over the same period last year. For the full year, operating expenses as a percent of sales ended at 14.8%, which is a 210 basis point improvement over full year 2020. The team continues its relentless focus on capacity creation and when combined with strong growth, the results are very impressive.\nPOOL360 continues to be one of our biggest productivity tools for our team and the customer. Revenue growth through the tool was 46% in the quarter and makes up about 10% of our order line volume. We expect continued gains in this area as we are now rolling out our next generation of POOL360 with many enhancements that will continue to drive adoption, customer engagement and provide additional value to our customers.\nWrapping up the income statement. We are exceptionally proud to report operating income of $128 million for the quarter, which is 72% higher than the same period in 2020. Operating margin came in at 12.3%, which is a 340 basis point improvement when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year, operating income totaled $883 million, which is up 79%. Operating margins for the year ended at 15.7%, which is 390 basis points better than 2020. Again, this would not be possible without a strong market, dedicated and talented dealers, excellent manufacturing partners and the world-class team here at POOLCORP.\nBefore moving on to the outlook for next year, I thought it might be helpful if I provided some insight into the strategic acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio and SunCoast Chemical Packaging. We paid $789 million, and we funded this transaction through our existing credit facilities and remain well below our targeted leverage range of 1.5 to 2x trailing 12-month EBITDA.\nThis unique acquisition is essentially 3 businesses. One is a pool products distribution business that provides supplies to 262 individually owned and operated franchise pool and outdoor living retail stores and 3 company-owned stores. The second part of this business is a world-class chemical packaging operation that packages and sells chemicals to these franchise stores and other distributors and retailers in the industry. The third part of this business is a franchisor, Pinch A Penny, an award-winning, best-in-class franchisor with a stellar reputation in the franchising world and in the swimming pool retail market.\nTheir retailing and customer support expertise developed over a 45-year history include a cutting-edge technology platform will provide new capabilities to POOLCORP that can be leveraged to benefit all our current customer base segments. When combined with our tremendous buying power, our international distribution network and proven execution focused operating model, this is an extremely powerful and unmatched combination.\nAs I mentioned, the business includes a world-class chemical packaging operation that produces and packages trichlor tablets and other proprietary specialty chemicals, including a variety of proprietary liquid chemical blends under several well-known brands for use in swimming pool maintenance. The operation enhances our cost position, improves supply consistency and reliability and is scalable for future growth.\nToday, all products are warehoused in one state-of-the-art distribution center located in Clearwater, Florida and delivered to the retail stores by a fleet of dedicated delivery vehicles. As previously mentioned, the business has 262 stores, 232 of the stores are located in Florida with the remaining 30 located in Alabama, Southern Georgia, Louisiana and Texas. Supplying to now 21 Texas stores from South Florida is a challenge, so you can see that our existing distribution network creates tremendous synergies. It is our intent to leverage these capabilities over time and establish franchise locations throughout the Sunbelt to enhance our service to the significant number of homeowners maintaining their own pools.\nOne of the most strategic capabilities and key motivation for the acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio was the technology platforms and tools they have developed that can -- that we can leverage across all of our customer segments. Best-in-class tools such as a point-of-sale system, a water chemistry chemical application guide and customer apps, demand-creation tools, service management software and valuable local pool market databases that will help fuel our business growth and product sales for many years to come.\nJim Eisch, a 28-year veteran and key architect of this amazing business, has joined the POOLCORP team and will help us integrate and grow this business going forward. Jim will report to me and has already become a key contributor and confidant to our team. We plan to expand the Pinch A Penny franchise store network at an initial rate of 8 to 12 locations per year, focusing on maintaining and enhancing the brand while providing the high level of support that the franchisees have come to expect. To date, we have opened 1 new store in 2022.\nThe acquired Porpoise Pool & Patio operations are expected to contribute approximately 5% to POOLCORP's total revenue in 2022. We are confident that over time, this operation will accelerate our penetration into the important DIY pool maintenance customer sector comprised of highly desirable recurring revenue maintenance products for the growing installed base of swimming pools.\nFinally, and before I turn this over to Melanie for her commentary, let me provide some thoughts for 2022 and our initial guidance range for full year EPS. The pool and outdoor living industry driven by consumers' desire to spend more time outdoors in the comfort of their own backyard is strong. Whether it's an afternoon in a pool or spa with family and friends or grilling dinner on the patio in an amazing outdoor kitchen or simply enjoying a quiet evening in a manicured backyard that is accented with beautiful hardscapes and outdoor lighting, we are an integral part of the equation and demand is growing.\nDealers are reporting very strong backlogs. Realtors are reporting that homeowners seek properties with a backyard retreat, including a pool, are in very high demand. COVID has accelerated the movement to the suburbs, fueled the southern migration and changed the way people work, allowing millions of people to work from home. It created an environment that supercharged our industry.\nDemand remains very strong across all our geographies, and we see some encouraging signs as the supply chain is improving as well. Inflationary pressures continue but have yet to curtail demand. So we remain optimistic that the underlying -- about the underlying strength of the industry. We see labor constraints as continuing to be one of the biggest limiting factors on pool construction and remodeling growth but again are encouraged by signs of our contractor customers wanting to expand the size of their crews in many areas.\nLabor will continue to be a limiting factor on how fast the industry can grow. Whether we're talking about new construction or remodel or service, skilled labor is required, and there is a war for talent. This war also affects our suppliers and their suppliers, which is continuing to impact the product availability for the coming season.\nChemicals will continue to be tight, and the products that contain computer chips, such as automation and some variable speed pumps, will remain challenged. Inflation increased more than we previously expected. We ended the year with a benefit from inflation of 7% to 8%, including 8% to 9% in the fourth quarter. Inflation now looks to be in the 9% to 10% range as we move into 2022.\nAcquisitions and new locations will add 5% to 6% to our revenue growth. Taking all of this into account, we expect top line growth to be in the 17% to 19% on top of an amazing 2021. Earnings per share are projected to reach $17.19 to $17.94 per share.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the POOLCORP team, our amazing customers and incredible supply partners for helping us bring outdoor living to life for so many people.\nI will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her comments.\n\nMelanie M. Housey Hart\n\nVP, CAO, CFO, & Treasurer, Pool Corporation\n\nThank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to announce our outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and begin our discussion on 2022.\nAs Pete mentioned, our fourth quarter results were very notable as we achieved a record $1 billion in net sales and saw the momentum continue from our third quarter reported results. Gross profit increased 35% to $322 million, and we saw gross margins increase 260 basis points to 31.1%. This is a record high and was aided by continued strong realization on purchasing incentive programs and actions we took to proactively manage our inventory needs in times of longer lead times and rising cost pressures from suppliers.\nFourth quarter operating expenses were well controlled, increasing only 18% over fourth quarter 2020 expense levels, including additional incentive compensation expense incurred during the quarter, offset by higher bad debt recovery. We saw an increase in operating margins for the quarter as we realized 12.3% operating income from net sales, up from the prior year fourth quarter operating margin of 8.9%. The robust demand-driven growth in our top line and expanded gross margin provided the opportunity to increase operating income performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year in 2021. Interest and other expense for the quarter was lower than expected, primarily due to interest income received on a net receivable recovery.\nMoving on to the full year 2021. Eclipsing $5 billion in sales for the year is a remarkable accomplishment, even more so when considering the growth rate in prior year, where sales were up 23% in 2020 over 2019, resulting in a 2-year sales growth stack of 66%. Revenue growth was primarily the result of generally favorable weather throughout the year, strong new pool construction activity, higher inflation and revenues added from recent acquisitions. Other contributors to sales growth included the winter weather anomaly affecting Texas and parts of the Southwest in February, resulting in additional sales in the first quarter of approximately $20 million and an additional $10 million in the remainder of the year. There was also a new Department of Energy regulation that took effect in July, requiring that the majority of new pumps being sold be variable fee pump. We saw an increase in the percentage of higher-ticket variable fee pump sales in the second half of the year, realizing approximately $20 million in incremental sales in 2021.\nBase business sales increases of 29% included market share gains and an estimated 25% increase in the number of new pools constructed during the year. As we look at the expected contribution for 2021, we estimate that the maintenance portion of our business will continue to be around 60% of our total business with a slight increase in the proportion of new pool construction-related product sales as with limited labor, our customers prioritize new pool construction projects over remodel and renovation activities.\nGross profit reported was $1.6 billion, a 43% increase over 2020. Gross margin increased 180 basis points over the prior year to 30.5%, bolstered by supply chain management, pricing changes and vendor incentives from increased purchasing volumes. Overall for the year, we had an increase in operating expenses of $117 million, which included increased performance-based compensation of approximately $20 million.\nOur reward programs are directly tied to increased financial results, which allows us to leverage our overall compensation. Effectively executing on our capacity-creation initiatives allowed us to keep expense growth low at 18% compared to 35% sales growth during the year even after considering the increased performance-based compensation paid to employees to reward them for their efforts in delivering these results to shareholders. Where we have sales centers at capacity, we will look to invest in 2022 to enable a digital continued growth in those markets.\nOur expenses for the year benefited from a onetime net recovery of $2.5 million that was previously written off in March of 2020. There are no additional benefits expected on this note as it is fully recovered.\nAs a result of substantial revenue growth, enhanced gross margin and focused expense management, we realized significant operating income leverage throughout 2021, increasing our operating margin to 15.7% of net sales, up from 11.8% of net sales in 2020. Total reported operating income of $833 million represents a 79% increase over 2020 operating income of $464 million.\nIncluded in income tax expense, we received an ASU benefit of $14.2 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, which added to the $0.39 that was previously recognized and included in our guidance for a total of $0.74 for the year. Our full year tax rate excluding ASU was 24.7%. For 2022, we anticipate that our tax rate will be closer to our 25.5% historical rates.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We reported an increase in net receivables of 30%, consistent with our higher sales growth. DSO improved from 26.5 days in 2020 to 25.6 days in 2021. Inventory levels increased 71% compared to prior year and 65% excluding 2021 acquisitions. By comparison, our 2020 year-end inventory levels were lower than our sales increases due to product shortages and the absence of typical early buy purchasing program.\nDuring 2021, the increased level of industry demand put continued pressure on our supply chain partners, resulting in us electing to build inventory ahead of anticipated sales growth. Over the course of the third and fourth quarters, we made significant improvements to our in-stock inventory positions while continuing to meet high demand. We also increased inventory to support the 10 new locations we opened during the year and our completed acquisitions. These increased investments in working capital resulted in a lower-than-normal reported cash flows from operations. We are confident that our current inventory position will provide us a tailwind to better serve our customers in 2022.\nExecuting on our capital priorities, we spent $38 million on purchases of property and equipment to support our ongoing business operations. We invested $812 million on key strategic acquisitions, including $789 million on our December 2021 acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio. This also includes amounts paid in the current year for prior year acquisitions where a portion of the purchase side is deferred.\n2021 acquisition activity was funded by our long-term debt agreements, which we amended and expanded in September 2021, providing plenty of capacity to fund our future business growth. We ended the year with a trailing 12-month leverage ratio of 0.77 and expect to continue to remain under our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2x. We purchased 138 million shares and increased our dividend per share by 38% during the year, providing $120 million in dividend payments, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to $258 million for 2021.\nMoving to our guidance for 2022. We expect to realize earnings growth of 12% to 17%, resulting in a 2022 diluted EPS guidance range of $17.19 to $17.94, including an estimated [$19] ASU tax benefit, which is expected to be realized in the first quarter.\nIn developing our guidance range, we are expecting high-teen sales growth, including approximately 5% from acquisitions completed late in 2021. Inflation will continue to be a component of our sales expectations for the year. With already announced vendor price increases, we expect that inflation will add 9% to 10% to our top line for next year.\nSelling days for 2022 compared to 2021 will be up 1 day in the first quarter and down 1 in third quarter with the same number of selling days year-over-year. Currency impacts for 2022 are likely to be an overall drag on net sales growth and overall operating profit. Gross profit margin in 2022 is expected to be relatively flat with 2021 as we are well positioned with inventory, which will allow us to see modest improvements in the first half. We expect these improvements to level off as we reach the third and fourth quarters, which will have difficult comparisons because of the inflation realized in 2021.\nOur Porpoise Pool & Patio acquisition will be slightly accretive to gross margins. The distribution business, which is the larger revenue piece, has lower margins than our historical rates. However, the franchise revenue will have a positive impact. If inflation levels in the industry return to more normal growth rates and we see improved lead times from vendors, we would expect that our inventory levels would increase at a much lower rate than sales increases, returning our expected cash flow from operations to be more in line with our net income.\nOn the operating expense side, we are anticipating that expense growth will come in higher than our historical levels. Our sales growth has come in ahead of our strategic plan for the last 2 years, and we see 2022 as a year where we need to further increase our investment in technology and automation to drive our long-term growth and enable us to operate even more efficiently. We have initiated a multiyear project to transform our legacy enterprise systems and capabilities to improve customer and team member experiences. We are also expanding our proficiencies and investing in our digital marketing initiatives. We will also continue investing in new sales centers, serving growing markets and expect to see some cost increases as we build out these new locations and expand our market reach.\nFor both greenfield and existing lease renewals, we have seen sharp increases in industrial lease rates as a result of the strong demand on warehouse space. We are also seeing external factors impacting our labor costs, causing wage inflation in today's current competitive labor market. As these are our more significant components of operating expenses, higher increases in these areas contribute to higher expense growth.\nCapital expenditures, including our investments in ongoing IT project, will approximate 1% of net sales in 2022. Our technology investments are trending towards cloud-based systems and applications and will be reflected directly in operating expenses as they are amortized versus as a capital expenditure with associated depreciation expense. We completed the acquisition of Porpoise Pool & Patio in December 2021. This strategic addition to our business is expected to add approximately 5% to net sales growth and 5% to our EBITDA growth. Although the added debt used to fund the acquisition will result in increased interest expense and we will incur higher intangible amortization expenses in the current year, Porpoise Pool & Patio performance will be accretive in 2022, accounting for around 3% of our projected net income growth and provides significant long-term growth possibilities. The intangible amortization expense is included in the increases we expect in our selling and administrative expenses.\nEven with higher sales growth in 2022, our operating margin target is expected to return to our historical contribution levels, where we realize approximately 20 to 40 basis point improvement. This improvement is also a significantly higher base of 15.7%, which was a 390 basis point improvement over prior year. Interest expense for the higher outstanding debt balances is anticipated to come in between $26 million to $28 million, considering the expected interest rate increases that have been announced for later this year. This is subject to change based on the extent and timing of the proposed increases.\nExcluding any potential share repurchases, we anticipate that our weighted average shares outstanding that will be applied to the net income attributable to common shareholders will be approximately 40.75 million shares.\nI am also pleased to announce that later this year, we will be publishing our novel report on our ESG efforts. We are delighted to provide more details on the many things we have been working on in those areas.\nWe are excited to continue to collectively grow the outdoor living industry. With that, we will repeatedly offer strong and steady returns for our shareholders. Looking forward to sharing 2022 with all of you.\nI'll now turn the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

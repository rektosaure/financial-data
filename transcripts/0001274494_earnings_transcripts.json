This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] And please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Byron Jeffers, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nByron Michael Jeffers\n\nVP, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. Joining me are our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Widmar; and our Chief Financial Officer, Alex Bradley. During this call, we will review our quarterly results and share our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the line for questions.\nBefore we begin, please note that some statements made today are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We undertake no obligation to update these statements due to new information or future events. For a discussion of factors that could cause these results to differ materially, please refer to today's earnings press release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as supplemented by our other filings with the SEC, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You can find these documents on our website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nAll right. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from Q3 2025. Since our last earnings call, we secured gross bookings of approximately 2.7 gigawatts at a base ASP of $0.309 per watt, including 0.4 gigawatts of Series 7 modules impacted by previously disclosed manufacturing issues booked at an ASP of $0.29. We terminated 6.6 gigawatts of bookings under multiyear agreements defaulted on by affiliates of BP, a European oil and gas major, at a base ASP of $0.294 per watt. As a result, total debookings since the last earnings call were approximately 6.9 gigawatts. And our current expected contracted backlog is approximately 54.5 gigawatts.\nWe delivered a record 5.3 gigawatts of module sales and reported Q3 earnings of $4.24 per diluted share, both near the midpoint of our previous earnings call forecast. Gross cash increased to $2 billion, supported by improved working capital, new bookings, deposits and accelerated customer payments ahead of the effective date for the new beginning of construction guidance. Alex will walk through our financial results in more detail later in the call.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, we produced 3.6 gigawatts of modules in the third quarter, 2.5 gigawatts from our U.S. facilities and 1.1 gigawatts from our international operations. In Q3, we reduced production in Malaysia and Vietnam, primarily due to lower demand driven by the customer default previously mentioned.\nWe continue to advance our domestic capacity expansion, notably at our Louisiana facility, where we initiated production runs and started plant qualification. We've also continued to pursue the enforcement of our intellectual property rights. During the quarter, we made 3 separate filings requesting that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or PTO, deny petitions filed by affiliates of Canadian Solar, JinkoSolar and [ Munder ] that seek to invalidate our U.S. TOPCon patents. Our filings include a reference to comments made earlier this year by the Acting Director of the PTO, who stated, \"The longer a patent has been in force, the stronger and more settled the patent owner's expectations should be.\"\nWe believe our ongoing vigorous enforcement of our decade old U.S. TOPCon patents, which we consider fundamental to producing that technology, is a prime example of a patent holder having settled expectations of the integrity of its IP rights. The view that module manufacturers and their customers and financing parties should strongly consider the potential hurdles of producing, selling or purchasing modules employing TOPCon cell technology is not one held just by us. For example, earlier this quarter, the CEO of [ ES Foundry ] explained that his company's decision to focus on manufacturing PERC technology was due, at least in part, to the \"legal troubles that would be encountered by TOPCon producers.\"\nLastly, we're pleased to continue building on our commitment to responsible solar, not simply by exceeding industry norms and sustainability and human rights, but by continuously improving on our own performance. Our Ohio facilities, which previously earned a Silver rating in the Responsible Business Alliance Validated Assessment Program, have progressed to a Gold rating in its 2025 audit, which was completed this past quarter.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will now provide an update on our manufacturing operations. As it relates to our Alabama facility, 2 of our domestic glass suppliers faced manufacturing disruptions that limited our ability to operate at full capacity, which impacted Q3 production by approximately 0.2 gigawatts. The primary supply chain issue resulted from throughput limitations due to insufficient initial facility readiness at a new factory, while simultaneously, a different supplier experience unplanned downtime. Corrective actions have been implemented at both suppliers, and our U.S. glass supply base is again positioned to meet our requirements. While now resolved, this resulted in a temporary shortage of cover glass supplied to our Alabama facility, which led to reduced production and increased underutilization charges in the third quarter.\nOur Louisiana factory has initiated integrated production runs, started plant qualification, and the early-stage ramp is slightly ahead of expectations. We anticipate receiving required production certificates in Q4 and will begin shipment at that time. As it relates to our international capacity, we have previously indicated the implementation of the Reconciliation Act earlier this year as well as the evolving universal and reciprocal tariff environment could potentially support a business case to establish 1 or more lines in the U.S. to finish front-end production initiated within our international fleet.\nWe have made the decision to establish a new production facility in the United States, allowing us to onshore the finishing of Series 6 modules initiated by the company's international factories. While the location is subject to final negotiations, we have -- with an announcement expected in the coming weeks, the planned capacity will be 3.7 gigawatts. Production will start at the end of '26 and ramp through the first half of 2027.\nAs we previously noted, such an investment is expected to enable additional production in the U.S. market that we expect will be fully compliant with forthcoming guidance, as well as improve the gross margin profile of our sales of reducing tariff charges and logistics costs associated with importing finished goods. Furthermore, we expect that the modules produced at this facility will provide domestic [ content points ] benefits for our customers and qualify for 45X module assembly tax credits.\nWe continue to evaluate options for the remainder of our international Series 6 capacity, including options related to long-term U.S. market demand, U.S. market supply and the global tariff environment. Shifting to the current policy landscape, the U.S. policy and trade environment remains generally favorable. As we have long stated, one of First Solar's key competitive differentiators is the ability to provide certainty to our customers, both in terms of pricing certainty and the certainty of timingly producing and delivering product. These attributes are particularly valuable in the U.S. solar market, where [ FIA-compliant ] suppliers who have domesticated their supply chains and localized their production capabilities provide the surest pathway to enable developers to realize tax benefits and to mitigate the exposure of project pro formas to both the imposition of tariffs and the risk of project schedules associated with relying on imported products.\nA number of trade and policy developments over the quarter amplified these competitive [ initiators ]. In August, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the Biden administration's 2-year suspension of circumvention related antidumping and countervailing duties was unlawful, paving the way for possible retrospective duty payments on solar imports brought into the United States between June of '22 and June of ' 4.\nAlso during the quarter, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued a preliminary affirmative determination in an antidumping and countervailing duty case known as Solar 4 that imports of crystalline silicon cells and modules from India, Indonesia and Laos are causing material injury to the U.S. solar industry. In addition to a range of alleged illegal subsidies, the petitioners identified dumping margins of approximately 90% for Indonesia, approximately 247% for Laos and approximately 215% for India.\nAlso during the quarter, U.S. Custom and Border Protection issued a notice of initiation investigation and interim measures against an affiliate of Huawei Solar in response to a claim submitted by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, of which First Solar is a member, that Huawei had effectively transshipped Chinese solar cells and modules into the United States through India. In addition, we, together with the rest of the industry, are awaiting the results of the administration's 232 polysilicon and derivatives investigation, including the potential for incremental tariffs impacting the crystalline silicon supply chain. From a policy perspective, the industry also awaits guidance from the administration related to project impacts from foreign entity of concern, or FEOC procurement, which may be delayed as a result of the ongoing government shutdown.\nIn short, there continues to be mounting headwinds or uncertainties for U.S. developers associated with procurement dependent on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chain, which we believe enhances the value proposition of our vertically integrated production capabilities. It also validates our approximately $4.5 billion investment strategy of expanding our U.S. manufacturing production and reshoring supply chains, which began under the first Trump administration and continues through the current Trump administration, with our most recent facility currently ramping in Louisiana and the announcement of our new U.S. finishing line. This activity places us uniquely in the intersection of several of the administration's key priorities, including those related to domestic manufacturing job creation, American energy and energy affordability and serving among the generation solutions that enable the U.S. to win the artificial intelligence race against China.\nTurning to India. Since our last earnings call, there have been several notable policy deployments. First, significantly, the application of tariff rate for imports of finished modules into the U.S. was increased to 50%. We continue to monitor dialogue between the U.S. and Indian government related to a potential bilateral trade treaty easing of tariffs between the 2 countries. As it relates to the country's domestic market, the Indian government continues to promote its domestic renewable energy value chain by progressively including cells and the remit of the approved list of models and manufacturers under a recently announced [ List 2 ]. Inclusion in List becomes mandatory for solar OEMs to sell into key segments of the domestic market, effective June of '26. Notably, First Solar was automatically qualified in this list, which was released in August of '25.\nThe Indian government also released a stakeholder consultation in September of '25 related to a further extension of the ALMM regulations to include domestically made wafers for potential deployment after June of 2028. Once again, First Solar's India's production is expected to automatically qualify. We anticipate that these regulations will progressively strengthen our position in the Indian market by leveling the playing field.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss shipments, bookings, Q3 financials and guidance.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Beginning on Slide 5. As of December 31, 2024, our contracted backlog totaled 68.5 gigawatts valued at $20.5 billion or approximately $0.299 per watt. Through Q3, we recognized 11.8 gigawatts in module sales and recorded gross bookings of approximately 5.1 gigawatts. This includes 4 gigawatts booked between the enactment of the Reconciliation Bill in early July and the September 2 effective date for the new commenced construction guidance.\nSince our last earnings call, we had gross bookings of 2.7 gigawatts and average selling price of $0.309 per watt. This includes approximately 0.4 gigawatts of Series 7 modules impacted by previously disclosed manufacturing issues booked at an ASP of $0.29 per watt. The remaining bookings of 2.1 gigawatts were sold into the U.S. market at a blended ASP of $0.325 per watt. As a reminder, a significant portion of our contracted backlog includes pricing adjustments that may increase the base ASP, contingent upon achieving specific milestones within our technology road map by the time of delivery, according to the ASPs presented to exclude potential adjustments related to module bin, freight overages, commodity price fluctuations, committed wattage, U.S. content volumes and tariff changes.\nOur recent bookings scheduled for delivery in periods where such milestones could be met, the potential value is reflected in our backlog as an opportunity rather than the base ASP represented. For example, among recent bookings, we secured a 0.6 gigawatt order for 2027 delivery at an ASP of $0.316 per watt, with the potential for an incremental $0.046 per watt contingent on achieving specific milestones within our technology road map.\nDemand in the U.S. remains strong. However, we recorded full year debookings totaling [ 8.1 gigawatts ] as of September 30, including 6.9 gigawatts in the third quarter. The majority of these were driven by contract terminations with affiliates of BP, which accounted for 6.6 gigawatts. Note, aside from the contract terminations with the BP affiliates, a number of other terminations were for project-specific reasons as opposed to reflecting customer pivots from solar project element generally. For example, our Q3 bookings include volume expected to be delivered to a customer who terminated a project in 2024, but [ is recommended to solar development ] in 2025 continues to source its module supply with First Solar. In addition, we're currently in active negotiations for the procurement of new volume with another customer who previously terminated a contract with us for a specific project of theirs earlier this year. In both cases, these customers satisfied their termination payment obligations.\nIn prior calls, we highlighted the emerging risk of a strategic shift concerning multinational oil and gas and power and utilities companies, particularly those based in Europe, with some moving away from renewables project development and back towards fossil fuel investments. On September 30, First Solar filed a lawsuit against BP Solar Holding LLC and its affiliate Lightsource Renewable Energy Trading following their failure to [ cure ] multiple breaches of contractual obligations. According to public reports published earlier in the year, BP has been looking to divest its interest in its renewable development arm. Despite agreements to purchase approximately $1.9 billion or 6.6 gigawatts of solar modules, these BP affiliates did not meet required payment obligations or provide required payment security. After issuing default notices providing opportunities to cure, we terminated the contract, which entitles us to approximately $385 million in termination payments. Of this amount, we've recognized $61 million in previously collected down payments as revenue.\nWe're seeking monetary damages which includes approximately $324 million in remaining termination payments, along with certain other receivables for solar modules previously delivered and interest. And if realized, the $324 million, will be recognized as revenue. We were already willing and able to continue fulfilling our contractual obligations to these BP affiliates and disappointed that we must resort to litigation. The modules that are subject to the contract breach are a mix of domestic and international product, most of which were scheduled to be produced in Q3 and future quarters. The delivery is expected to extend into 2029. We're working to address the planned allocation of module inventory that could have been delivered to the BP affiliates, if not for their contract breach.\nWith respect to such planned future module production, the market for these modules may be constrained by the U.S., Indian and European policy and market conditions discussed on the February earnings call and that has since been further exacerbated in the U.S. with our traditional utility scale customer experiencing transmission and permitting rate challenges in large part due to the constraints reflected in the July Department of Interior memo related to renewables project development, the ongoing government shutdown and the impact of tariffs. Note, these same factors, which are further exacerbated by the breach of contract to the BP affiliates, given our loss of contracted offtake for the product, may drive further underutilization charges being realized in 2026 as it relates to our Southeast Asian production facilities for the planned module volume expected to be delivered to these BP affiliates.\nAs a result, our quarter-end contracted backlog stood at 53.7 gigawatts valued at $16.4 billion or approximately $0.305 per watt. And as of today, our total expected contracted backlog stands at 54.5 gigawatts, excluding any volumes sold off at the end of the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our total pipeline of mid- to late-stage booking opportunities remained strong, and bookings opportunities of 79.2 gigawatts and mid- to late-stage booking opportunities of 17.8 gigawatts. Our mid- to late-stage pipeline includes 4.1 gigawatts of opportunity that are contracted subject to conditions precedent. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we receive full securities ahead of the offer.\nI'll now cover our third quarter financial results on Slide 7. We recognized 5.3 gigawatts of module sales during the quarter, including 2.5 gigawatts from our U.S. manufacturing facilities. Our net sales totaled $1.6 billion, representing an increase of $0.5 billion compared to the prior quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and anticipated back-weighted profile of deliveries over the course of the year. Our sales included $81 million in contract termination payments, with $61 million related to the contract breach with the BP affiliates. This amount was recognized from existing cash deposits.\nGross margin for the quarter was 38%, a decrease from 46% in the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a lower mix of modules sold from our U.S. manufacturing facilities, which benefit from Section 45X tax credits. Additionally, we incurred higher underutilization costs due to continued production curtailments in Southeast Asia, the BP affiliates' termination and glass supply chain disruption at our Alabama facility.\nAs an update on warranty-related matters, we've resolved certain obligations and advanced negotiations with additional customers regarding manufacturing issues affecting select Series 7 modules produced prior to 2025. Based on our settlement experience, the estimated number of affected modules and projections of probable remediation costs, we believe a reasonable estimate of potential future losses will range from approximately $50 million to $90 million. Within this range, we recorded a specific warranty liability of $65 million, an increase of $9 million from our prior estimate, representing our best estimate of expected future losses associated with these manufacturing issues.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, we maintained approximately 0.6 gigawatts to potentially impacted Series 7 inventory, including 0.2 gigawatts under contract and included in our backlog. SG&A, R&D and production start-up expense totaled $145 million in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $6 million compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by start-up costs associated with the accelerated ramp-up of our Louisiana facility aimed at providing resiliency to our U.S. production for the year. Operating income for the quarter was $466 million, which included $138 million in depreciation, amortization and accretion, $49 million in ramp and underutilization costs, $37 million in production start-up expense and $7 million in share-based compensation.\nNonoperating income resulted in a net expense of $6 million in the third quarter, representing a decrease of approximately $4 million compared to the prior quarter. This is primarily driven by higher interest income as a result of an increase in investable cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Tax expense for the third quarter was $4 million compared to tax expense of $10 million in the second quarter. This decrease in tax expense was primarily driven by a $19 million discrete tax benefit associated with the acceptance of the filing position on an amended tax return in a foreign jurisdiction, partially offset by higher pretax income. This resulted in third quarter earnings of $4.24 per diluted share.\nTurning to Slide 8, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. At the end of Q3, our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities stood at $2 billion, an increase of approximately $0.8 billion from Q2, driven by improved working capital, new bookings deposits and accelerated customer payments ahead of the effective date for new beginning of construction guidance. As disclosed in our Form 8-K on October 20, 2025, we executed 2 Section 45X tax credit transfer agreements totaling up to $775 million in tax credits. The fixed agreement for the sale of $600 million in tax credits at a purchase price of $573 million, payable by year-end, a variable agreement with the sale of up to $175 million in tax credits, with payment expected in Q1 2026. These transactions highlight the liquidity of the 45X credit market and strengthen our near-term liquidity to support our technology road map and expansion priorities.\nAccounts receivable decreased sequentially, driven by higher cash collections. Quarter end, total overdue balances were approximately $334 million, including a deferred payment settlement of $93 million with a customer, which interest payments remain current. In addition, we have approximately $70 million in uncollected receivables related to termination payments. We currently have $82 million accounts receivable for delivered modules that are aged and past due with the aforementioned BP affiliates. This does not include any additional anticipated proceeds from potential recoveries associated with their breach of contract.\nAlthough termination payments remain contractually due, these balances are expected to persist pending the resolution of arbitration and litigation. In all instances of contract termination, we're actively pursuing all available remedies, including arbitration and litigation to enforce our contractual rights and recover amounts owed. Deferred revenue increased by $395 million, primarily due to accelerated customer payments ahead of the effective date for new beginning of construction guidance, partially offset by revenue recognized from delivered modules and termination payments. Capital expenditures totaled $204 million in Q3, mainly driven by investments in our Louisiana facility, where we initiated production runs and started plant qualification. As a result, our net cash position increased by approximately $0.9 billion to $1.5 billion.\nBefore addressing our updated guidance, I'd like to revisit the policy and trade environment that shapes our operational decisions throughout the year. These evolving dynamics influenced our strategy impacted quarterly performance and informed our adjustment to forward guidance. Our 2025 shipment profile acquired sustained production to fulfill contractual commitments concentrated in the second half of the year amid significant trade and tariff uncertainty. During this period, we navigated a range of potential tariff scenarios, customer negotiations and regulatory developments, including Section 232 actions, FEOC restrictions and AD/CVD investigations. At 1 point, we managed 2 possible tariff regimes, a continuation of a 10% universal tariff or adoption of reciprocal tariffs initially set at 26% for India, 24% for Malaysia and 46% for Vietnam, later amended to 50%, 19% and 20%, respectively.\nOur strategy has been to maintain sufficient capacity to fulfill international module commitments and to actively pursue tariff recoveries from customers at the same time as temporarily curtailing or idling capacity and recording underutilization in circumstances where tariff recovery was unlikely and module sale economics would be challenged. The upper end of our prior guidance assumes sustained production with partial tariff recoveries, whereas the lower end reflected risk by determination related impacts, including additional underutilization costs and margin erosion from terminated contracts.\nThree significant updates drive our revised guidance ranges today. Firstly, the decision announced today to establish a new 3.7 gigawatt U.S. production facility, enabling us to onshore finishing for Series 6 modules initiated by our international fleet, will result in approximately $330 million of the total program direct spend, including approximately $260 million of capital expenditures, approximately $70 million of noncapitalized expense associated with equipment de-installation, cleaning, packaging, shipping, import tariffs and reinstallation. Of this, we expect an incremental $26 million of CapEx and $2 million of production start-up expense in 2025. In addition, we forecast approximately $10 million of incremental indirect charges in 2025 associated with this decision, including severance and asset impairment expenses.\nAs previously noted, we continue to evaluate options for our remaining Malaysia and Vietnam facilities. Today's guidance excludes any additional costs associated with potential restructuring charges or asset impairments that may impact 2025 or future operating results. Secondly, as it relates to the termination of contracts with affiliates of BP, the loss of gross margin assumed in 2025 was largely offset by the termination payment recorded in Q3.\nIncreased underutilization expenses from reduced plant throughput as we curtail production given this termination of demand, were incorporated in the low end of our guidance range. Thirdly, as previously discussed, simultaneous incidents that 2 of our glass suppliers led to a shortage of glass available at our Alabama facility in Q3. This reduced full year production by approximately 0.2 gigawatts, resulting in a reduction to gross margin and Section 45X tax credits and increased underutilization costs.\nTurning to Slide 9. I'll now outline the key updates to our 2025 guidance ranges, which incorporate the cascading impact of our third quarter operational and financial results. Our net sales guidance is projected at $4.95 billion to $5.2 billion, reflecting a downward revision of approximately 0.5 gigawatts from the top end of our prior guidance. This adjustment primarily reflects reduced international volumes sold due to customer terminations, partially offset by termination payments, as well as 0.5 gigawatt reduction in assumed domestic India sales following the midyear redirection of India products in the U.S. market to the domestic book and bill market, driven by the high tariff for imports into the U.S.\nAdditionally, U.S. manufactured volumes sold is expected to decrease 0.2 gigawatts at the high end of the guide as a result of Q3 glass supply constraints at our Alabama facility, partially offset by 0.1 gigawatts at the low end by expected increased supply from our Louisiana factory. Gross margin is expected to be between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion or approximately 42%. This includes approximately $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion of Section 45X tax credits and $155 million to $165 million of ramp and underutilization costs. The bottom end of our previous guide has increased significantly due to further curtailment of our Southeast Asia manufacturing capacity following the contract terminations by affiliates of BP.\nSG&A and R&D combined expense is expected to total $425 million to $445 million. And total operating expenses, which include $90 million of production start-up expense, expected to be between $515 million and $535 million. Operating income is expected to range between $1.56 billion and $1.68 billion, implying an operating margin of approximately 32%. This guidance includes $245 million to $255 million in combined ramp ,underutilization and production startup expense, as well as approximately $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion in Section 45X tax credits, net to the anticipated discount associated with the sale of these credits. This results in a full year 2025 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $14 to $15.\nIn summary, the upper end of our EPS guidance range is reduced by $1.50 per diluted share. This includes approximately $0.60 per share from the supply chain impact at our Alabama facility, which resulted in increased underutilization costs and lower volumes sold. Contract termination by BP affiliates reduces EPS by another approximately $0.60 per share due to increased underutilization costs and lower volumes sold, partially offset by termination payments. The remaining $0.30 per share is a combination of reduced India volumes sold, increased production start-up expense, finishing line costs and warranty expense, partially offset by non-BP affiliate termination payments and decreased full year tax expense. Capital expenditures for 2025 are now expected to range between $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion. Our year-end 2025 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion.\nTurning to Slide 10, I'll now summarize the key messages from today's call. Despite some near-term headwinds, we continue to believe that our integrated domestic manufacturing platform and reshored domestic supply chain position us for long-term success. We're building a new 3.7 gigawatt capacity module finishing line in the U.S., which is expected to begin production in Q4 of 2026, and ramp at the first half 2027. We delivered a record 5.3 gigawatts of module sales, and our Q3 earnings per diluted share came in above the midpoint of our guidance range at $4.24 per share.\nWe saw an improvement in our gross cash position to $2 billion and recently executed agreements to sell additional Section 45X tax credits, which we expect to further enhance our liquidity position. We revised our full year guidance to reflect the impact of third-party glass supply chain disruptions as well as the termination of 6.6 gigawatts of volume by affiliates of BP, which we recognized a partial termination payment and have filed a lawsuit for damages for breach of contracts.\nWith this, we conclude our compared remarks and open the floor for questions.

Today's call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Byron Jeffers, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nByron Michael Jeffers\n\nVP, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. Joining me today are our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Widmar, and our Chief Financial Officer, Alex Bradley.\nDuring this call, we will review our financial performance for the quarter and discuss our business outlook for the remainder of 2025. Following our remarks, we will open the call for questions. Before we begin, please note that some statements made today are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We undertake no obligation to update these statements due to new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of factors that could cause these results to differ materially, please refer to today's earnings press release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as supplemented by our other filings with the SEC, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. You can find these documents on our website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Widmar. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from Q2 2025. We recorded 3.6 gigawatts of module sales during the quarter, above the midpoint of what we forecasted on the previous earnings call. Our Q2 earnings per diluted share came in above the high end of our guidance range at $3.18 per share.\nFrom a manufacturing standpoint, we produced 4.2 gigawatts in Q2 and with 2.4 gigawatts produced from our U.S. facilities and 1.8 gigawatts from our international facilities. We progressed our domestic capacity expansion during the quarter, continuing to ramp up at our Alabama facility. As of today, equipment installation and commissioning at our Louisiana site is complete. We have begun the integrated production run and expect to complete plant qualification in October.\nOnce fully ramped, this facility is projected to boost our U.S. nameplate manufacturing capacity to over 14 gigawatts by 2026. As it relates to technology, we have seen further improvements regarding our Cure technology platform from both the performance and manufacturability standpoint over the course of the quarter. Recent field data from deployed cure modules continues to validate the enhanced energy profile expected from the improved temperature response and bifaciality of cure. This field data is consistent with the superior degradation rate that we have seen through laboratory accelerated life testing.\nIn addition, progress continued during the quarter at our new development line located at our Perrysburg campus. The line on track for full in-line runs in August is expected to produce small form factor modules featuring a prostate semiconductor. We have continued to timely meet our internal metrics for our development program, including the achievement of initial stage efficiency, stability and manufacturability objectives. We are pleased with the progress we are making towards commercializing our Prostate technology over the next several years.\nFinally, we are proud to have published our annual corporate responsibility report yesterday. This report highlights First Solar's efforts to lead the way in strengthening support for solar by leveraging and extending our differentiation. As noted in the report, our vertical integration drives resource efficiency, enabling our products to deliver up to 5x greater energy return on investment in Christian silicon panels made from components manufactured in China.\nThis not only supports our nation's energy independence, it helps unleash American energy dominance. We also continue to achieve and SURPASS key metrics. For example, 2024 marked the second straight year that we have nearly doubled the volume of water we recycle conserving resources and water-scarce regions. We continued our focus on reducing waste, diverting 88% of waste from disposal and increasing recycling recovering a global average of 95% of materials from recycled panels. These are among just a few of the highlights of our approach to responsible corporate stewardship that can be found in the report, which is available through our website.\nTurning to Slide 4. I would like to focus on the current U.S. policy and trade environment. From an industrial policy standpoint, earlier this month, the President signed the new reconciliation legislation, that we believe places for in a greater position of strength than it was following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nAs it relates to Section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credits, under this new law, key provisions for solar were maintained and new restrictions severely limit 45X eligibility for products manufactured by or with material assistance from foreign control foreign energies of control or such as Chinese solar manufacturers. These restrictions address one of the biggest loopholes under the IRA, and we expect these provisions will factor into capital commitment decisions for U.S. manufacturing by our Chinese competitors.\nIn our view, it is not unreasonable to expect there will be limited Chinese solar manufacturing in the U.S. in the foreseeable future, which, together with other recent industrial policy and trade developments that I will discuss momentarily may reduce the supply of domestic content.\nTurning to the investment tax credit. The legacy PTC and ITC, which support project safe harbor by the end of 2024 and require place in service by year-end 2028, remains unchanged by the new legislation. We expect that these projects will proceed as scheduled, thereby strengthening the resiliency of our existing contracted backlog. We have a strong contracted position for our U.S. production through 2028, which we believe, coupled with the current policy environment creates a strategic foothold to integrate our international supply with U.S. and potentially create a U.S. finishing line to leverage our Series 6 and Series 7 international assets.\nIn addition, the provisions and the reconciliation legislation relating to the new technology neutral investment and production tax credits, potentially incentivize near-term demand for new bookings with deliveries through the end of this decade. There are 3 reasons for this potential demand catalyst. Firstly, under the new Tech Neutral credits, projects that commenced construction prior to July of 2026, will have a required place in service deadline by the end of 2030, thereby potentially incentivizing new procurement to safe harbor projects through 2030.\nSecondly, projects that commenced construction starting January 1, 2026, are subject to the new FEOC material assistance restrictions in order to be eligible for the tech-neutral credits. And thirdly, projects that have not commenced construction before June 16, 2025, will be required to meet increasing domestic content thresholds should they seek to qualify for the related bonus.\nWhile there remains uncertainty around the structure and scope of the forthcoming begin construction guidance pursuant to a recent executive order, we expect this guidance will be consistent with long-standing rules. Note, the same executive order also mandates the development of FEOC guidance.\nFocusing on the threat to national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries. As indicated earlier, these new demand drivers also potentially support a business case to establish 1 or more lines in the United States to finish front-end production initiated within our -- an international fleet. Leveraging existing overseas capital assets and our skilled workforce for front-end production, combined with new back-end factories in the U.S. could enable additional near-term fee-free supply for the U.S. market as well as improve the gross margin profile of our sales by reducing tariff charges and logistics costs associated with importing finished models.\nMoving from industrial policy to trade policy. We continue to see evidence that pursuing antidumping and countervailing duty or AD/CVD cases, while time-consuming and expensive, is effective at addressing illegal trade practices, imports of cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, which were subject of the SOLAR 3 AD/CVD case meaningfully decreased in the January through May of 2025 period as compared to the equivalent period in 2024.\nHowever, trade data also demonstrates an influx of cells and modules imported into the U.S. from other countries as the Chinese crystal silicon industry continues to move production to circumvent existing trade laws. Against this backdrop, the alliance for American solar manufacturing and trade, a distinct but similar coalition from that which launched SOLAR 3 AD/CVD case directed at Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam has filed a new AD/CVD petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce seeking investigations into the violation of trade laws by Chinese-owned companies operating through entities in Laos and Indonesia as well as Indian headquarter companies, which we believe utilized a Chinese subsidized supply chain.\nSeparately, the Department of Commerce has made the decision to self-initiate Section 232 investigation into imports of polysilicon and its derivatives. While the scope of derivatives is unclear, this could implicate downstream pricing for polysilicon-based products such as wafers, cells or modules introducing a new source of uncertainty for those relying on Chinese tied crystalline silicon procurement. The scope of the investigation includes many of the strategic vulnerabilities created by China's dominance of the polysilicon production, such as the risks posed by over concentrated supply chains, subsidy fueled mandatory trade practices, systematic overcapacity and the potential for export restrictions by U.S. adversaries.\nIn addition, we are encouraged by recent recently available, though not broadly publicized data regarding the processing of cell and module entries by the U.S. Custom and Border Protection, or CBP, that were imported during the Biden administration in June 2022 to June 2024, solar moratory. As a reminder, the moratorium provided AD/CVD duty free treatment for Southeast Asia imports if the entries -- we're both circumventing the China solar AD/CVD orders and were utilized in projects no later than December of 2024.\nThe U.S. government recently reported that approximately 44,000 entries were processed during the moratorium window. And that more than half, roughly 24,000 entries did not qualify for the moratorium and remain subject to the application of AD/CVD tariffs. The government reports that is taking multiple approaches to collect duties on these imports. The remaining approximately 20,000 continue to be under manual CBP review, which could take several months to complete and may become subject to the application of these tariffs.\nIn short, despite the Biden administration will advise enforcement suspension, no single entry has yet been closed with the benefits of the tariff moratorium and all remain subject to potential AD/CVD tariff payments, representing potentially significant contingent liabilities for the importers of record of these foreign produced crystalline silicon modules. We applied PPP for the thorough entry by entry process they are running. Our determination to advocate for strong industrial policy represented by the new reconciliation legislation is matched by our commitment to employ the rule of law to help create a level playing field for domestic manufacturers.\nAs we have long stated, we are supportive of free trade and international competition so long as this trade is also fair and within the constructs of the law. Unfortunately, in our industry, China relentlessly engages in an unfair in our view, illegal trade practices, leaving us no choice but to seek the enforcement of existing law that are designated to address these practices.\nThis respect for also underpins our effort to enforce our Topcon patent portfolio against potential infringements. For example, following our previously announced filing of a complaint against various Jinko Solar entities, alleging infringement of our U.S. Topcon patents. During the quarter, we filed a similar lawsuit against various Canadian solar entities. These actions reflect our intention to actively enforce our intellectual property rights against companies that we believe are infringing upon our long-standing Topcon technology patents.\nIn summary, our policy, trade and legal efforts can be viewed as a consistent 3-pronged approach. Firstly, a dedicated commitment to continuously advocate for strong industrial policies that enable domestic solar manufacturers in the face of a foreign adversary seeking to dominate critical aspects of the U.S. energy supply chain.\nSecondly, a commitment to employ the rule of law against the industrial representation of those adversaries who seek to violate our trade laws. And thirdly, a commitment to employ the rule of law to enforce long, established principles of intellectual property rights protection. As discussed during our previous earnings call, we are not immune from adverse effects related to trade policy.\nLater in the call, Alex will address the impact of the global tariff measures on our international production capacity, considerations as well as on our bill of material costs. That said, notwithstanding these headwinds, together with the uncertainty related to the executive order mentioned earlier as well as the potential implications for the recent Department of Interior Directive ordering Secretary's approval of many renewable project development activities, we believe that the recent policy and trade developments have on balance strengthens First Solar's relative position in the solar manufacturing industry.\nAs illustrated on Slide 5, at a broader macro level, we believe the long-term position of the utility scale solar industry as a whole remains strong. given significantly increasing demand for electricity and the ability of solar generation to meet this demand. As we stated previously, American leadership in AI cryptocurrency and reshore manufacturing needs abundant cost-competitive electricity generation.\nAbsent new generating capacity coming online quickly, there are risk of not being enough electricity to power the strategically important industries to their full potential before the current administration ends. Given its attributes of low cost and high speed to deployment relative to other sources of energy generation, solar should clearly be a significant part of the near-term solution mix. This argument is supported by numerous recent reports, for example, in June, Lazard, the most recent levelized cost of energy report demonstrates that fertility scale PV is cost competitive with conventional forms of energy generation, including natural gas and nuclear. This fact does not consider the practicalities of the typical natural gas project development time line which requires approximately 5 years to complete, assuming it is untethered by supply chain constraints or the availability of pipeline infrastructure or nuclear projects, which take about twice as long and creates a potential supply chain strategic vulnerability requiring sourcing uranium from Russia and China.\nWe believe that on a fundamental basis with its cost-competitive energy and faster time to power profile, the case for utility scale solar generation is compelling regardless of the policy environment. This case is underpinned by the role that utilities care solar can play alongside energy storage, as a viable, reliable, cost competitive complement to the eventual scale-up in nuclear power generation capacity.\nUtilities solar has also been shown to help lower electricity prices, dampening the effects of inflation, while supporting grid reliability and helping utilities navigate peak demand in extreme conditions, lowering the likelihood of blackouts Atellica Solar is mission-ready today to help power the key pillars of economic growth, which we believe places is First Solar utility scale leader in a position of strength. I'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss shipments, bookings, Q2 financials and guidance.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Beginning on Slide 6. As of December 31, 2024, our contracted backlog totaled 68.5 gigawatts valued at $20.5 billion or approximately $0.299 per watt. Through Q2, we recognized 6.5 gigawatts in sales. We continued our disciplined approach to new bookings, strategically leveraging the strength of our customer backlog amid the policy uncertainty that continued during the quarter and limited pricing visibility.\nAs a result, we recorded 0.9 gigawatts of gross bookings in the first half of the year. Offsetting this, we recorded 1.1 gigawatts of debookings driven by contract terminations, resulting in net debookings of 0.2 gigawatts through June 30, 2025. Notably, 0.9 gigawatts of the debookings related to our Series 6 international products and were recorded in our Q2 results.\nAs a result, our quarter-end contracted backlog stood at 61.9 gigawatts valued at $18.5 billion were approximately $299 per watt. As a reminder, a significant portion of this contracted backlog includes pricing adjusted that provide the opportunity to increase the base ASP contingent on meeting specific milestones within our current technology road map by the time of delivery. These figures exclude such potential adjustments, including additional changes tied to module bin, freight overages, commodity price shifts, committed wattage, U.S. content volumes and tariff in.\nFollowing the enactment of the recent reconciliation bill, we saw an increase in customer engagement, resulting in 2.1 gigawatts of new bookings as customers pursue near-term opportunities. Of this total, approximately 1.4 gigawatts of Series 6 international product, 0.9 gigawatts of which was recontracted volume that was previously terminated in Q2. We Including the associated termination payment, this recontracted volume was effectively sold at approximately $0.33 per watt. The remaining 0.7 gigawatts of the 2.1 gigawatts was contracted at approximately $0.32 per watt excluding the impact of adjusted in India domestic sales.\nAs of today, our total contracted backlog stands at 64 gigawatts while demand for our U.S. manufactured products remain strong, we continue to face an underallocation of Series 6 production from our Malaysia and Vietnam facilities. This imbalance initially resulted from customers exercising contractual delivery shift rights out of 2025 due to policy uncertainty and has more recently been exacerbated by increased tariff pressure. These factors contribute to the termination of a portion of our Series 6 international backlog this quarter.\nOf our total 64 gigawatt backlog, approximately 11 gigawatts consist of International Series 6 product. Of that, approximately 10.1 gigawatts is planned for sale into the U.S. with the vast majority under contracts that include circuit breaking provisions designed to mitigate tariff exposure as referenced in our previous earnings call. Accordingly, the inclusion of tariff mitigation provisions in our contracts serve as a strategic safeguard, enabling us to proactively manage and limit potential gross margin erosion should tariff-related impacts not be resolved through customer engagement. Beyond these immediate drivers and contractual mitigants, we are also continuing to serve indicators a broader strategic shift among multinational oil and gas and power utilities companies, particularly those hardcoded in Europe, away from renewable project development and back towards fossil fuel investments.\nMoving to Slide 7. Our total pipeline of mid- to late-stage booking opportunities remain strong. The booking opportunity is 83.3 gigawatts and mid- to late-stage booking opportunities of 20.1 gigawatts. Our pipeline includes 3.9 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracted subject to conditions precedent. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we've received full security against the offtake.\nTurning to Slide 8, I'll cover our second quarter financial results. We recognized 3.6 gigawatts of module sales, including 2.3 gigawatts from our U.S. manufacturing facilities. This resulted in second quarter net sales of $1.1 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion from the first quarter.\nThe increase was primarily driven by an anticipated increase in shipment volumes and stronger demand for domestic reduced modules. Our second quarter results included $63 million in contract termination payments tied to 1.1 gigawatts of volume, with $50 million related to 0.9 gigawatts of terminated Series 6 international volume. Note this 1.1 gigawatts of terminated volume represented only less than 2% of our contracted backlog as of second quarter end.\nGross margin for the quarter was 46%, up from 41% in Q1. The increase was primarily driven by higher contract termination revenue and a greater proportion of modules sold from our U.S. manufacturing facilities such are eligible to Section 45 tax credits. These factors were partially offset by increased detention and demurrage charges, higher core costs associated with the sales mix weighted towards U.S. produced modules and a change in Section 45X credit valuation between periods. The sale of a portion of these credits through an agreement with a leading financial institution, combined with our expectation to sell the majority of credit seated in 2025 resulted in a cumulative $29 million reduction to cost of sales, reflecting the anticipated value of the remaining credits generated through Q2.\nAs an update on warranty related matters, we did not incur any new warranty charges this quarter related to the Series 7 modules affected by prior manufacturing issues. As of the end of Q2, we continue to hold approximately 0.7 gigawatts that potentially impacted Series 7 inventory. We're making continued progress in reaching settlement agreements that impacted Series 7 modules from our initial production, consistent with our disclosed warranty range.\nSG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $138 million in the second quarter reflecting an increase of approximately $15 million as compared to the first quarter. The primarily driver of this increase was production start-up costs associated with the ramp-up of our Louisiana facility. Additional onetime expenses included broker fees related to the sale of our Section 45X tax credits and legal costs tied to the previously disclosed SEC division of enforcement investigation.\nAnd we're pleased to report that the SEC has concluded inquiring to First Solar and the start does not intend to recommend any enforcement action against the company. Operating income for the quarter was $362 million, which included $125 million in depreciation, amortization and accretion and $15 million ramping up the utilization costs, $31 million in production start-up expense and $7 million in share-based compensation.\nNon-operating income resulted in a net expense of $9 million in the second quarter, representing a decline of approximately $5 million compared to the prior quarter. This was primarily driven by lower interest income as a result of a decrease in investable cash, cash flow and smokable securities. Tax expense for the second quarter was $10 million compared to $8 million in the first quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a change in pretax income and the jurisdictional mix of such income.\nAnd this resulted in second quarter earnings of $3.18 per diluted share.\nTurning to Slide 9, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. As of the end of Q2, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash marketable securities was $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $0.3 billion from the prior quarter.\nThis increase was primarily driven by the sale of certain of our Section 45X tax credits generated in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, as disclosed in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, on July 28, we entered into a new tax credit transfer agreement to sell up to $391 million Section 45X tax credits, generating up to approximately $373 million in proceeds. Transaction instruction in 3 installments was approximately $124 million received in connection with closing and the remaining payments expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. This transaction further demonstrates the liquidity of the 45X credit market the proceeds will continue to support our near-term working capital expansion priorities.\nThe quarterly increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales volumes with approximately 2/3 of our quarterly revenue being recognized in June, resulting in back-end weighted receivables. As of quarter end, total overdue balances stood at approximately $394 million. This includes a previously negotiated settlement with the customer following a payment default, which deferred payments to Q4, which $93 million remains outstanding with interest payments being currently made on schedule also included a $70 million in cumulative uncollected receivables related to customer termination payments.\nThese overdue termination related receivables corresponds to approximately 1.8 gigawatts of contract of canceled volume. Such cases were actively pursuing litigation arbitration to enforce our contractual rights and recover the payment code. Inventory balances increased by $121 million, consistent with expectations reflecting the backloaded revenue profile tied to continuous production throughout the year to fulfill contracted commitments. We anticipate our working capital position to improve throughout the year as our module shipment and sales profile increases relative to production inventories decline, and we continue to collect on our accounts receivable.\nWhile they remain contractually due over due termination payments are expected to remain outstanding, pending resolution of arbitration and litigation proceedings. Capital expenses totaled $288 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by investments in our newest facility in Louisiana, where we've begun the integrated production run and expect to complete plant clarification in October.\nOur net cash position increased by approximately $0.2 billion to $0.6 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Before we turn to our updated financial outlook, I'd like to revisit the key assumptions informing our current guidance in light of recent policy and trade developments. These include tariff-related impact on anticipated international module sales volumes and the coated logistics costs.\nAs outlined on Slide 10, our prior guidance was based on a binary set of tariff policy scenarios, each with distinct operational and financial implications. At the upper end of our guide, we assume the continuation of the universal tariff regime through year-end 2025 applying a 10% tariff and maintaining the suspension of country-specific reciprocal tariffs excluding China. The lower end reflected the same baseline but incorporated the impact of reciprocal tariffs taking effect as of July 9, and with rates of 26% for India, 24% from Malaysia and 46% for Vietnam.\nOur revised guidance incorporates the anticipated implementation of recently negotiated tariffs of 25% from Malaysia and 20% for Vietnam. So it relates to India, our revised guidance incorporates the previously announced reciprocal tariff rate of 26% to India and does not incorporate the President's announcement yesterday of a 25% rate plus an unquantified penalties of India's purchase of military equipment and energy from Russia.\nOur volumes sold out of the U.S. manufactured modules remains unchanged at 9.5 to 9.8 gigawatts. Our forecast of sales from our India manufacturing entity remains unchanged. And combined with an increase at the low end of the Series 6 international range, we now forecast international module sales of 7.2 to 9.5 gigawatts for total module sales of 16.7% to 19.3%.\nThe international volume sold range remains wide and reflects both uncertainty and opportunity related to the outcome of tariff cost discussions with customers -- the Section 232 action related to polysilicon and its derivatives, CK-related restrictions and the SOLAR4 AD/CVD investigation. In the event of customer terminations resulting from an inability on willingness to absorb tariff impact on our international product, we plan to address the resulting supply-demand imbalance through additional curtailments, including the potential temporary idling of production.\nAs such, the lower end of our guidance range reflects increased unutilization period costs and the associated loss margin tied to these volume assumptions. Accordingly, this curtailment strategy is not assuming the incremental costs related to the warehousing retention, demurrage or other logistics associated with internationally produced modules. Important to note that certain indirect or currently unknown costs related to these tariffs, including potential restructuring charges or asset impairments are excluded from the guidance provided today.\nAs it relates to tariff impact, based on a doubling of Section 232 tariffs on aluminum and steel from 25% to 50% as well as updated rates applicable to other imports, including substrate glass and interlayer, we anticipate a full year production cost impact from tariffs of approximately $70 million. We forecast approximately $80 million to $130 million in tariffs on finished goods imports net of contractual recoveries from customers. It's important to note that without tariff recovery, international module sales may be dilutive to earnings.\nAs such, the ability to recover tariff is a key factor in our production and sales volume guidance. If we are unable to effectively negotiate these recoveries, we may further reduce International Series 6 production for low current assumptions, which would result in an additional utilization charges related to running our International Series 6 production below full production capacity with other absorption costs accounted for as period expenses are forecast to total approximately $95 million to $180 million for the full year.\nAdditionally, nonstandard freight, warehousing, detention demurrage and other logistics-related costs have increased approximately $100 million to $400 million for the full year. This increase was driven by several factors: accelerated imports ahead of the July 9 and subsequently revised August 1 tariff implementation dates, shorter ocean freight transit times, which led to an earlier-than-expected port arrivals, key 2 customer terminations of Series 6 international products, lower-than-forecasted Series 6 international sales, resulting in a short notice inventory buildup and ongoing efforts to avoid anticipated Section 301 tonnage fees on Chinese bill vessels beginning in Q4.\nAnd lastly, although our forecast value of 2025 Section 45X tax credits generated remains unchanged. Our bit guidance now assumes the sale of these credits from all but 1 of our U.S. facilities. The remaining facility, we plan to utilize the credit to offset taxable income and claim any residual benefit via direct pay. Accordingly, we've reduced the projected value of Section 45X tax credits and our guidance by approximately GBP 75 million.\nI'll now cover the full year 2025 guidance ranges on Slide 11. Our net sales guidance is between $4.9 billion and $5.7 billion, which includes an unchanged range of U.S. manufactured volume and India-manufactured volumes sold. Our update is a narrow range of international Series 6 volume sold and includes contract termination revenue of $53 million recognized in our Q2 results.\nGross margin is expected to be between $2.05 billion and $2.35 billion or approximately 42%, which includes approximately $1.58 billion to $1.63 billion Section 45X tax credits, $95 million to $180 million of ramp in underutilization costs. $80 million to $130 million of tariffs on finished goods imports and $70 million tariffs on biller material evals.\nSG&A expense is expected to total $185 million to $195 million, and R&D is expected to total $230 million to $250 million. SG&A and R&D combined expense is expected to total $415 million to $445 million and total operating expenses, which include $65 million to $75 million of production start-up expense are expected to be between $480 million and $520 million.\nOperating income is expected to range between $1.53 billion and $1.87 billion find an operating margin range of approximately 32%. This guidance includes $160 million to $255 million in combined ramp and utilization and plant start-up costs, low approximately $1.58 billion to $1.63 billion in Section 45x credits net of the anticipated loss associated with the sale of these credits. This results in a full year 2025 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $13.50 to $16.50. The midpoint of which is unchanged from our previous guidance notwithstanding the approximately $0.70 of impact of forecasted diluted EPS for our updated guidance now assuming the sale of 2025 section on for expedites from all but 1 of our U.S. facilities.\nFrom an earnings cadence perspective, we anticipate module sales of 5 to 6 gigawatts for the third quarter with $390 million to $425 million in Section 45X credits, resulting in earnings per diluted share of between $3.30 and $4.70 Capital expenditures for 2025 remain consistent with prior guidance is expected to range between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\nOur year-end 2025 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.3 billion and $2 billion.\nTurn to Slide 12, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Our Q2 earnings per diluted share came in above the high end of our guidance range at $3.18 per share, primarily due to customer contract termination payments and a favorable mix of U.S. versus international products sold within the quarter. Our forecast for U.S. produced volume sold remains unchanged for the year. In the near term, ongoing trade policy uncertainty, particularly around the tariff regime has introduced challenges that were not anticipated at the start of the year and have persisted and continuously evolved throughout. We've updated our guidance to reflect the expected impact of the most recent proposed tariffs Other than the present indication yesterday a potential penalty rate applying to India and our current outlook on their implications.\nWe know that the midpoint of our diluted EPS guidance remains unchanged even with the approximately $0.70 of the impact of forecast low EPS in our updated guidance, which assumed the sale of 2025 Section 45X credits more than 1 of our U.S. facilities.\nLooking ahead, we are on balance, pleased with the overall industrial and trade policy environment has emerged over recent weeks. We continue to remain confident in the long-term outlook for U.S. dollar energy demand and First Solar's continued leadership underpinned by a vertically integrated manufacturing platform, domestic supply chain, non-CC profile and proprietary cartel technology.\nDemand for our U.S. manufactured product remains strong, and our updated outlook continues to reflect the potential long-term resilience of our Series 6 international product, contingent on the U.S. market's ability to adapt to mid ongoing policy and trade uncertainty.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks and over the call for questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Byron Jeffers, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nByron Michael Jeffers\n\nVP, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. Joining me today are our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Widmar; now Chief Financial Officer, Alex Bradley.\nDuring this call, we will review our financial performance for the quarter and discuss our business outlook for 2025. Following our remarks, we will open the call for questions. Before we begin, please note that some statements made today are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We undertake no obligation to update these statements due to new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of factors that could cause these results to differ materially, please refer to today's earnings press release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as supplemented by our other filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-Q. You can find these documents on our website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CEO, Mark Widmar. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.\nBeginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from Q1 2025. From a commercial perspective, since the previous earnings call, we have secured net bookings of 0.6 gigawatts at a base ASP of $0.305 per watt. Excluding adjusters in India domestic sales, as a result, our contracted backlog today stands at 66.3 gigawatts. In Q1, we recorded 2.9 gigawatts of module sales, which is in line with what we forecasted on the previous earnings call.\nOur Q1 earnings per diluted share came in below the low end of our guidance range at $1.95 per share, primarily due to a greater portion of our Q1 sales being forecasted to be in international versus U.S. product. Alex will provide further details regarding our financial results later in the call.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, we produced 4.0 gigawatts in Q1, comprised of 2 gigawatts of Series 6 and 2 gigawatts of Series 7 modules. We completed a limited commercial production run of modules employing our cure technology from our lead line in Ohio during the quarter and continue to deploy these modules in both commercial and field test sites. Initial data indicates that enhanced energy profile expected from the superior temperature response and improved bifaciality of our cure technology is being realized. Furthermore, the laboratory accelerated life testing is confirming the industry's leading annual degradation rate.\nOur domestic capacity expansion has advanced during the quarter as we continued the ramp of our Alabama factory at our Louisiana facility, construction of the building was completed and equipment installation and commissioning is fully underway. The facility remains on track to begin commercial operation in the second half of this year and once ramped is expected to increase our U.S. nameplate manufacturing capacity to over 15 -- excuse me, over 14 gigawatts by 2026.\nTurning to Slide 4. I would like to focus on recent policy and trade developments. We continue to experience significant near-term uncertainty from the budget reconciliation process and its potential impact on the inflation Reduction Act, clean energy, tax credits, and now from the evolving trade landscape as the administration implements its new tariff initiatives. However, despite these near-term challenges, we believe on balance the political and trade environment continues to be an overall long-term favorable from a First Solar perspective. While the implementation of certain new trade policies was a possibility with the change in administration. The new tariff regime imposes earlier this month has introduced significant challenges to 2025 that were not known at the start of the year.\nI will focus on outlining the operational challenges that tariff poses for First Solar, while Alex will later discuss the detailed implications to our full year guidance. We have elected to update our guidance range with an upper end that assumes the current applicable 10% universal tariff structure remains in place throughout the year. The lower end assumes both a range of nontariff-related risks to our operations as well as implications from the previously announced but temporarily suspended country-specific reciprocal tariff structure. We currently operate international manufacturing in India to serve both the India and U.S. market and in Malaysia and Vietnam, which almost exclusively serve the U.S. market. The President's implementation of reciprocal tariffs earlier this month with rates of 26%, 24% and 46% applicable to India, Malaysia and Vietnam, respectively, creates a significant economic headwind for our manufacturing facilities in these countries selling into the U.S. market. While the subsequent 90-day pause to the effectiveness of these tariffs and the application of a 10% universal tariff partially mitigates the impact. The lower rate would still result in a meaningful adverse gross margin impact to sales into the United States, absent the duty being fully passed through to the module buyer.\nIn addition, the uncertainty surrounding whether the reciprocal tariffs will be reinstituted at the 90 -- after this 90-day pause or whether the pause will be indefinite or whether a different tariff regime will be put in place has created a challenge to quantifying the precise tariff rates that would be applied to our module shipments into and beyond the second half of this year.\nOur sales contracts for international volume shipped to the United States typically include provisions that are intended to mitigate the adverse gross margin impact from changes in law due to the implementation of tariffs on modules. These provisions, which may be invoked at First Solar's discretion, come in a variety of types, including some where First Solar may terminate the contract if it chooses not to absorb the new tariffs. Others, either the customers required to absorb or for solar and the customers required to share up to a certain amount of the tariff before either party may terminate and others, which represent the majority of these contracts where a negotiated period is contractually required for First Solar and the customer to discuss the allocation of tariff risk before either party may terminate. To the extent the contract is terminated on the basis of these provisions, the agreement would effectively unwind with neither the customer nor First Solar being responsible for termination payment, resulting in a corresponding reduction to our backlog and as well as a return to the customer of any related deposits. These provisions are intended to protect First Solar in the event of changes in law related to tariffs that pose significant economic risk to us, and they could otherwise force First Solar to transact at a loss.\nWith respect to our overall backlog of 66.1 gigawatts, as of March 31, 2025, we have approximately 13.9 gigawatts of forward contracts for delivery of international product into the United States. After accounting for the remaining volumes sold in 2025, at the low end of our revised guidance range that Alex will later discuss, there remains a forecasted year-end net 12 gigawatts of international product in the backlog that may be terminated based on these tariff-related provisions. With an ASP below the backlog average and after accounting for lower production costs, but significantly higher sales rate, including port-related costs, warehousing and storage associated with the international product, the profitability of this portion of our backlog is below the overall backlog average. Note, if this -- if this First Solar elects to absorb the tariffs cost beyond its contractual obligation, no termination right exist, and the volume will remain in the backlog.\nFurthermore, with respect to our module contracts for delivery of product from our U.S. facilities, module tariffs are not applicable and therefore, is not impacted to our contracted backlog with respect to this volume. From an allocation standpoint, our ability to optimize our U.S. production with our international production to support our customers' qualifications of the domestic content ITC bonus may be constrained under the new tariff regime. As we may not be in a position to utilize our currently available international production capacity, absent customers' willingness to absorb or meaningfully share the increased tariff exposure.\nOur customers' willingness to bear some or all of the tariff costs beyond this module contracted obligation must be considered in the contents of the overall project-related cost increases from the new tariffs, including not just with respect to the modules, but also tracker, inverters, transformers and other imported equipment. Given the majority of the best components with some dependency on Chinese supply chain, solar plus storage projects in particular, may face significantly increased costs. Given these headwinds, we expect to pivot our India facility away from exports to the U.S. and towards producing more product for the domestic India market.\nWith regards to the impact of new tariffs on our Malaysia and Vietnam factories, we will continue to evaluate best options to optimize production across these sites in a potentially reduced U.S. demand environment for nondomestic product but are mindful that we may need to further reduce or idle production at one or both of these locations, especially if the announced reciprocal tariffs are put in place. That said, despite these near-term challenges presented by the new tariff regime, we believe the long-term outlook for solar demand, particularly in our core U.S. market remained strong, and the First Solar remains well positioned to serve this demand. This belief is based on our unique profile of First Solar compared to its peers. We are the only U.S. headquartered PV manufacturer of scale. And by the end of this year, we will be the only one with a fully vertically integrated U.S. solar manufacturing presence across 3 states, including a large domestic supply chain, not just in Ohio, Alabama and Louisiana, but across states such as Wyoming, Utah, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania among others.\nAs we've mentioned before, by year-end, our U.S. presence alone is projected to support over 30,000 direct, indirect and [indiscernible] jobs across the country, representing almost $2.8 billion in annual payroll. Our powerful contribution to the U.S. economy is due to our differentiated proprietary thin-film technology but is also dependent in part on a level playing field given the unfair and illegal trading practices of so many in the Chinese crystal and silicon supply chain. As we've engaged with political leaders over the course of the year, and as recent developments have demonstrated, we believe there is recognition on politicians, policymakers and other authorities of the need to address these unfair practices as well as the criticality of maintaining an industrial policy that allows high-value solar manufacturing to grow and thrive in the United States and contributes to our energy and national security. One example of this recognition is the recent final determination results in the ADCB case known as Solar 3, addressing illegal dumping and subsidization by the Chinese headquarter companies operating in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.\nLast week, the Commerce department announced generally substantial AD, CVD duties across all 4 of the Southeast Asian countries, which are generally retroactive and stacked on top of the existing Section 201 tariff regime and the 10% universal tariff rate currently being implied. These results reflect what we have known that the unfair practice by Chinese headquartered solar companies put American manufacturers and American Jobs at risk, and the enforcement of the rule of law is essential to securing our manufacturing base and our domestic energy security. That said, while we are pleased with the results of Solar 3 and applaud the professionalism and tireless work of the commerce department, we're also well aware that the Chinese are shifting production to lower tariff regions in order to take advantage of our trade laws.\nTrade data published since our previous earnings call further demonstrates the surge trend of imported cells and modules from certain countries, including Laos and Indonesia when compared to the same period of year. We have no doubt that these Chinese manufacturers are also seeking to establish production in other regions around the world, such as Saudi Arabia, forcing us into a continued game of Wakeman. The American Alliance of Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, of which we are a member, continues to monitor this data and as noted on our previous earnings call, all trade remedy options remain on the table, including initiating a new antidumping and countervating-duty case directed towards those countries where the data is supportive. While it's time consuming and resource intensive, First Solar will continue to engage in trade actions as long as is necessary to support a level playing field and ensure compliance with existing trade laws. And we will not hesitate to pursue a critical circumstances determination that if imposed any new tariffs are retroactive.\nIn addition, we, together with like-minded allies and advocates in Washington across numerous industries, not just solar, continue to encourage legislation, such as the level leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0, which would combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases where production moves to another country in an effort to evade tariffs at the level playing field is a key aspect of the Chinese unfair practices playbook. This legislation, which was reintroduced at the end of February of this year and which was bipartisan, would also go a long way towards strengthening and monetizing U.S. trade remedy laws and ensuring that remaining effective tools to fight against unfair trade practices and protect Americans.\nTurning to industrial policy. While ultimately, the outcome of the budget reconciliation process will determine the fate of critical supply chain initiatives, such as the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, and demand side incentives such as the investment in production tax credit, or ITC and PTC as we continue to engage with the administration and members of Congress on trade and industrial policy. We are encouraged by the response we are receiving on our message. Specifically, we continue to advocate for maintaining these key tax policies, particularly with modifications such as the foreign entity of concern or FEOC provision, which will prevent Chinese companies from receiving U.S. taxpayer dollars. We also continue to advocate for strengthening the domestic content provision to make ITC and PTC eligible contingent on the use of high-value domestic content product produced in the America. We believe these modifications to clean energy tax credits would provide significant U.S. government budgetary savings support the administration's efforts to make the tax cuts and jobs at permanent and would represent major steps forward towards mitigating the risk of America's energy supply chain being contracted concentrated in adversary foreign countries.\nWe are pleased to see a growing number of Republican policymakers in both the House and the Senate recognized the value of preserving existing tax credits, such as 45X and the ITC and PTC. We recognize that these incentives help in their words, spur new manufacturing investment and ensure certainty for businesses that have already made meaningful U.S. investments. They also recognize that doing so would reduce utility bills for American consumers. The imperative of affordable, reliable electricity for American households and small businesses is top of mind, not just for politicians, but for leaders of American utilities as well. Recent analysis released by the National Electrical Manufacturing Association projected the U.S. electricity demand will grow 50% by 2050 or 2% annually, with data center energy consumption growing by 300% over the next 10 years.\nIn our recent discussions with several CEOs of some of the nation's leading utilities, these leaders recognize the reality of the near-term significant growth in the U.S. energy demand. and share our view that solar has a critical place in an all-the-above power generation strategy. We're a diversified portfolio of natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar with energy storage and other technologies work together to power our nation to prosperity. They have shared with us that they are lending their influential voice to continue to advocate for maintaining clean energy tax credits, and the transferability provisions associated with them as doing so will enable greater solar generation deployment, more quickly and at lower cost than traditional forms of generation to help address the immediate power generation need and help mitigate potentially rising repair electricity cost. There's plenty of evidence supporting the case with solar as a prominent component of the electricity generation mix. Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Nevada, markets where some of the country's highest level of utility scale solar deployment has consumer electricity bills that were between 8% and 24% lower than the national average in January of 2025.\nWhile the new tariff regime has introduced a new source of uncertainty in near-term product development time lines, we believe that it is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. load growth fundamentals. As the country's top grid operators testified during the March hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy, there is still an urgent need to not yet maintain but to add capacity to meet significant demand growth. America leadership in AI, cryptocurrency and reshoring manufacturing needs abundant cost-competitive electricity generation. Absent new generation capacity coming online, their risks not being enough electricity to power these strategically important industries to their full potential before the current administration ends.\nWith 92% of the U.S. interconnection queue being comprised of renewables, solar is the fastest form of new generation, the current ITC and PTC regime, which together with domestic content bonus, drives competitive solar PPA pricing and First Solar with his uniquely vertically integrated U.S. manufacturing process that critically features a domestically produced cell supported largely by domestic value chain remains, in our view, the vendor of choice to enable development partners to qualify for domestic content bonus, especially with the annually escalating domestic content points requirement. Continued policy uncertainty, included with the new announced Universal and reciprocal tariffs may result in delays to some announced domestic wafer and cell manufacturing. Given the multiyear lead time required to build and commission new factories, the uncertain environment gives First Solar or the ability to leverage another one of our competitive changes, delivering on our commitments to our customers. This differentiation is particularly valued by sophisticated developers seeking to secure module pricing and delivery certainty early in their project time lines.\nThrough long-dated module sale contract, we believe First Solar's established U.S. manufacturing presence provides greater certainty of delivery and pricing when compared to other prospects and speculative sources of supply. Furthermore, given First Solar's profile, as a U.S. company, any future domestic capacity expansion would be unencumbered by the prospects of FEOC legislation a concept based on discussions in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere has been favorably received by certain members of the administration and Congress, and we believe must be factored into capital commitment decisions the large majority of our prospective domestic competitors. This consideration is particularly predominant in the industry where these competitors are overwhelmingly Chinese owned or controlled.\nAnother factor which may further prevent manufacturers and their financing parties from having the clarity necessary to make capital and investment decisions is the fact that public reporting indicates that the reconciliation process and therefore, the fade of existing clean energy tax credits under the inflation Reduction Act may not be known until late 2025 or perhaps not until some point in 2026, particularly if a scenario where addressing tax policies delayed to a second reconciliation bill. The impact is compounded when you further consider the fact that the Section 45X manufacturing tax credit began to phase out at the end of the decade, reducing the window of availability for these credits for factories that are not operating. Our industry-leading established U.S. presence provides further competitive advantages under the current tariff environment.\nOver the past several years, we have invested heavily in a largely domestic supply chain, particularly as it relates to high-value aspects of our bill of material, such as glass and steel, where we have entered into long-term contracts with domestic suppliers. It's our estimation that any new crystal and silicon competition, would likely have to import significant aspects of their bill of material to support U.S. production, particularly with respect to patent glass, which currently does not have any domestic source of supply, and aluminum, which is domestically supply constrained and priced at a significant premium to imports.\nIn a rational market, these boom cost increases would be expected to drive higher pricing for domestically produced competitor products. In summary, while we are facing anticipated near-term challenges following the imposition of the April tariff regime. We remain confident in the long-term prospects for First Solar in terms of the U.S. solar energy demand and First Solar's ability to leverage its unique profile and competitive differentiation to serve this demand. Through this confidence, we must be tethered to the continued enforcement and strengthening of the U.S. trade laws and supportive of industrial policy given the irrational and illegal Chinese trade practices. This confidence is based on our profile as America's largest and most established domestic solar module manufacturer. It's only fully vertically integrated producer our significant network of domestic supply chain vendors, our proprietary CAD tail-based semiconductor that is not beholden to the Chinese crystal and silicon industry and our ability to enable prospects aspects of the administration's platform of reshoring American manufacturing and supporting the powering of the next generation of critical industries.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss shipments, bookings, Q1 financials and guidance.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Beginning on Slide 5. As of December 31, 2024, contracted backlog totaled 68.5 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $20.5 billion or approximately $0.299 per watt. In Q1, we recognized sales of 2.9 gigawatts and contracted an additional 0.5 gigawatts of net bookings, resulting in a quarter end contracted backlog of 66.1 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $19.8 billion or approximately $0.30 per watt.\nSince the end of the first quarter, we've entered into an additional 0.2 gigawatts of contracts, increasing our total backlog to 66.3 gigawatts. Of this total backlog, as Mark previously mentioned, 13.9 gigawatts as of today and forecasted 12 gigawatts by year-end 2025 are under contracts containing provisions that if invoked by First Solar at its discretion, serve as a circuit breaker for meaningful gross margin erosion in a tariff regime scenario such as was announced earlier this month. Given that we are only in the initial stages of engagement with our customers on any tariff-related impacts to these contracts, all of these agreements remain in place and are included within our backlog as of today's call.\nSubstantial portion of our overall backlog includes the potential to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters, contingent upon achieving milestones within our current technology road map by the expected delivery date of the product. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 32.5 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which, if fully realized, could generate additional revenue up to approximately $0.6 billion or about $0.02 per watt with the majority of this revenue expected to be recognized between 2026 and 2028. Contracted volume associated with these adjusters have reduced approximately 4.6 gigawatts since the previous earnings call. Approximately half of this is due to adjustments being confirmed with the associated change to the contracted backlog. The remainder has been removed as a function of the expiry of contractual notification periods as well as an expected delay in the timing of core conversion in Vietnam following the new tariff announcements. This figure does not account for potential adjustments that applies to the total contracted backlog, including potential changes to the ASP based on the specific module being delivered to the customer as well as fluctuations in sales rate costs were applicable aluminum and steel commodity prices.\nAs reflected on Slide 6, our total pipeline of potential bookings remained strong with bookings opportunities of 81 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 0.7 gigawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities have increased by approximately 2.6 gigawatt -- 2.7 gigawatts to 23.7 gigawatts, including 17.3 gigawatts in North America and 6.1 gigawatts in India. Increase in our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunity is primarily driven by increased demand in India from the PM custom segment, the government-funded initiative to add solar to distribution feeders supplying power for agricultural pumps. Launched in 2022, the scheme aims to add approximately 30 gigawatts of solar capacity by March 2026.\nRecently, several Indian states have allocated substantial capacities to developers under this initiatives. Requirement to use modules with India-made cells allows First Solar's locally manufactured Series 7 modules to qualify for deployment in this scheme. Our mid- to late-stage pipeline includes 3.8 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracted subject to conditions precedent. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we've received full security against the offtake.\nLeading on Slide 7, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter. We had 2.9 gigawatts of module sales in Q1, of which 1.75 gigawatts was domestically produced U.S. volume. This resulted in net sales of $0.8 billion, reflecting a $0.7 billion decrease from the previous quarter. Decrease in net sales was due to an anticipated seasonal reduction in the volume of modules sold during Q1. Gross margin was 41% in the first quarter, up from 37% in the prior quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of modules sold from our U.S. factories, which qualifies as Section 45X tax credits as well as the difference in IRA credit valuation between periods, partially offset by higher module production costs of domestic U.S. module volume.\nDespite the quarter-over-quarter increase, our Q1 gross margin fell below our forecast. Although we met our guided shipment and revenue numbers, our mix of U.S. Bay modules sold was approximately 250 megawatts less than expected at the midpoint of our guidance of the corresponding reduction in IRA section 45X credit recognized. Approximately half of this shortfall was driven by both lower-than-anticipated U.S. production in Q1 as well as the timing of sale of cure products from our limited production run, which concluded in Q1, which is now forecast to sell in the second quarter. The remainder resulted from shipping challenges in the final weeks of the quarter. And though as we continue to work through both the impact of module shipment schedules from our previously discussed and resolved 37 manufacturing issues as well as typical early year seasonality, approximately 70% of our volumes sold in the quarter was recognized as revenue in March. We did not incur any additional warranty charges from the sale of Series 7 modules affected by manufacturing issues. And as of Q1 quarter end, we continue to hold approximately 0.7 gigawatts that potentially impacted Series 7 modules in inventory. In addition, during the quarter, we began reaching agreements in principle and final resolution for some potentially impacted Series 7 modules from our initial production run consistent within our current warranty reserves. Furthermore, as an initial update, an independent analysis and review of the root cause, corrective actions and implementation plan for the manufacturing issues in our initial Series 7 production has been completed. Summary of the results of the independent review has been shared with customers and financing parties.\nSG&A, R&D and production startup expenses totaled $123 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase of approximately $12 million compared to the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to a higher reserve potential credit losses as a function of an increased accounts receivable balance as well as increased production start-up expenses for the ramp-up of our Louisiana facility. Our first quarter operating income was $221 million, which included depreciation and amortization and accretion of $126 million, ramp under the utilization cost of $20 million production start-up expenses of $18 million and share-based compensation expense of $3 million.\nNonoperating income netted to an expense of $4 million in Q1, which was favorable relative to the fourth quarter by approximately $6 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher interest income from past due payments and accounts receivable from customers. We recorded tax expense of $8 million in the first quarter compared to $53 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease in tax expense is primarily due to a favorable jurisdictional mix and lower pretax income in the current period. Additionally, there were higher reserves of state taxes in the comparative period for jurisdictions that do not adhere to the federal tax provisions of the IRA regarding the tax exemption of Section 45X credit sales. Combination of the aforementioned items led the first quarter earnings per diluted share were $1.95.\nNext turn to Slide 8 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Total balance of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities was $0.9 billion at the end of Q1, reflecting a decrease of $0.9 billion from year-end. The first quarter saw a decrease in our cash balance the company by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory accounts compared to year-end 2024. The change was driven by several anticipated factors. Firstly, our 2025 shipment profile with its back-ended revenue profile assumes continuous production throughout the year to meet our contracted commitments. This profile results in a transitory working capital imbalance leading to an increase in our finished goods inventory and warehousing costs, thereby creating near-term headwinds to our gross cash. pending any potential impact to international production is a function of the new tariff regime, which I'll discuss shortly in the guidance section. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, but anticipate it will reverse once our shipments increased in the second half of the year, reducing our inventory build. Secondly, we've seen an increase in our overdue accounts receivable balance of approximately $350 million as of quarter end. Within this is approximately $70 million due from 1.8 gigawatts of terminations, primarily due to default in 2024. We've not received the entitled termination payment and are continuing to pursue litigation or arbitration to enforce our full termination payment rights under the respective contracts.\nIn addition, a negotiated settlement with a customer following a payment default has deferred approximately $100 million of payments until Q4 of this year. While this deferred payment is fully backed by a surety bond and carried interest that is accretive to the year, nevertheless creates an additional near-term liquidity imbalance. We've also seen a recent increase in overdue AR as a function of ongoing discussions with customers related to the initial Series 7 manufacturing issues last year. Thirdly, our capital expenditures totaled $206 million in the first quarter. This expenditure is primarily related to our newest facility in Louisiana, which is projected to end to start up in Q3 of 2025 and to ramp production through the second half of this year. Accordingly, our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.8 billion to $0.4 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors.\nBefore discussing our updated financial outlook, I'd like to comment on the challenges facing us as it relates to providing operational and financial guidance in the current policy and trade environment, particularly within position of the new universal and reciprocal tariffs early this month. Please turn to Slide 9. When we provided our initial full year 2025 guidance on our earnings call in February of this year, we provided context, including related to risks in 2 key areas: Firstly, the risk of policy uncertainty in Europe, India and the United States, especially in the U.S. with regards to tariffs and the ongoing budget reconciliation process and its potential impacts on the IRA. And secondly, our balanced supply-demand position where, excluding India, we were cumulatively oversold through 2026, but with an undersold position in 2025 for our Series 6 Malaysia and Vietnam production, driven in large part by 2024 contract terminations module delivery shift rights in 2025 utilized by customers facing project layers and policy uncertainty. Policy uncertainty relating to the budget reconciliation process and the IRA remains. Policy impacts and uncertainty relating to tariffs have increased significantly. The recently announced tariffs directly and adversely impact First Solar in multiple areas, including by increasing capital expenditure costs for our new U.S. factories, increasing U.S. factory production costs, adding significant cost to import finished goods to the U.S. to our Malaysia, Vietnam and India facilities and therefore, potentially driving reduced international factory production which leads to increased underutilization expenses. They also indirectly increase risk and volatility for First Solar through their impacts to our customers. We faced increased project costs and project financing and construction delays which may in turn cause shipment timing delays to First Solar, delays and timing of cash receipts and may reduce new sales opportunities for us in the near term.\nWe've elected to update our financial guidance ranges based on expected impacts from the new tariff regime. For the upper end of our range, we assume the impact from the tariff policy in place as of today's call, remaining through at least the end of 2025. And including the 10% universal tariff rate, the suspension of individual country reciprocal tariff rates in all countries except China, higher tariff rates applicable to certain products from China, certain tariff exclusions for specific HTS imports codes, Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and Section 301 fees on Chinese-built vessels. The lower end of our range assumes the above with the addition of including the impacts from the assumption that reciprocal tariffs take effect as of July 9, namely 26%, 24% and 46% applicable to India, Malaysia and Vietnam, respectively.\nTariff and cost-sharing provisions across our contracts with both customers and suppliers vary. And while currently reflected in our guide, we'll continue to engage with both to assess tariff exposure allocation and ultimate cost and other related impact. Certain other potential indirect and/or unknown costs related to these tariffs, including but not limited to costs associated with any restructuring or asset impairment are excluded from our guidance provided today.\nHitting the volumes sold. Our forecast for 9.5 to 9.8 gigawatts of sold volume manufactured in the United States remains unchanged. Internationally, as it relates to Series 6, our previous guidance included an assumption of approximately 0.7 gigawatts of combined Malaysia and Vietnam product forecast to book and bill within the year. Given the tariff-related uncertainty associated with a solar project's overall CapEx and the challenges of booking new volume in the current unsettled policy climate. Our updated guidance removes this volume from both the high and low end of the range. In addition, both the high and low end of our guidance range has seen a reduction in capacity utilization and throughput at our Malaysia and Vietnam factories beginning in Q2 to align with anticipated reduced demand for these potentially highly tariff modules. The low end of our range includes an assumption of partial or full idling of these plants continuing through year-end. We continue to evaluate how best to optimize production across these sites in a potentially significantly reduced demand environment for internationally produced product, including through ongoing dialogue with customers. Temporary idling of production despite the near-term underutilization cost impact, approximately 40% of which is noncash, provides us with optionality as we await further updates to the tariff regime as it relates to Malaysia and Vietnam, as well as the outcome of the budget reconciliation process and any impact to the IRA. So it relates to international Series 7, we previously forecast approximately 2 gigawatts of the 3 to 3.2 gigawatts of India production in 2025 being sold into the U.S. market. Our revised forecast assumes total production in India is unchanged, but the reallocation of approximately half of this 2 gigawatts back to domestic Indian market in the second half of the year to avoid expected tariff impact. This results in increased domestic India book and bill dependency for the year from approximately 0.7 gigawatts previously to approximately 1.5 gigawatts in our current guidance. Combined, we now forecast full year module sales of 15.5 to 19.3 gigawatts. Combined impact of these volume and ASP changes is approximately $100 million to $375 million.\nIn terms of import duties on finished goods, we forecast approximately $90 million to $70 million of tariff expense on module imports. As it relates to production costs, the impact of the previously announced Section 232 tariffs on aluminum and steel imports into the U.S. at a rate of 25% was assumed in our previous guidance range. With the newly announced tariff regime, we forecast a total 2025 tariff impact on raw material imports of approximately $25 million to $55 million, primarily related to aluminum frames and substrate glass imports as we continue to ramp available domestic glass supply. Our forecast of fleet average sales rate, warehousing, ramp and utilization, supply chain LDs and other period costs has increased by approximately $65 million to $270 million, primarily as a result of underutilization charges from running the Malaysia and Vietnam factories at lower than full production capacity and the associated impact from underabsorption of fixed costs which are accounted for as period expenses. In addition, we expect small incremental freight and logistics charges as a function of accelerating imports ahead of the reciprocal tariff effective date of July 9 and as well as due to expected 301 tonnage fees on Chinese bill vessels beginning in Q4 of this year.\nI'll now cover the full year 2025 guidance ranges on Slide 10. We Net sales guidance is between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion, which includes an unchanged range of U.S. manufactured volumes sold. The high end of the range, we assume a reduction of $300 million from the removal of 0.7 gigawatts of International Series 6 volumes sold as well as a lower ASP associated with approximately 0.8 gigawatts of India produced Series 7 volume moving from being sold in the U.S. market back to being sold in the India domestic market. At the lower end, we assume an additional reduction in international volumes sold as a function of the reinstatement of reciprocal tariffs. Gross margin is expected to be between $1.96 billion and $2.47 billion or approximately 44%, which includes $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion in Section 45X tax credits, and $95 million to $220 million of ramp and unutilization costs.\nSG&A expense is expected to total $180 million to $190 million and R&D expense is expected to total $230 million to $250 million. SG&A and R&D combined expense is expected to total $410 million to $440 million and total operating expenses, which include $60 million to $70 million of production start-up expense expected to be between $470 million and $510 million. Operating income is expected to be between $1.45 billion and $2 billion, implying an operating margin of approximately 35% is inclusive of $155 million to $290 million of combined ramp and utilization costs, fund start-up expense $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion of Section 45X credits. This results in a full year 2025 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $12.50 to $17.50.\nIn summary, the upper end of our EPS guidance range is reduced by $2.50 per diluted share, which includes approximately $1 per share of direct tariff cost impact, approximately $1 per share of indirect tariff impact to volumes sold in ASPs approximately $0.50 per share of indirect tariff impact, increasing underutilization and logistics costs. The EPS guidance range from high to low of $5 per diluted share driven by a volume sold impact of approximately $3 per share and incremental underutilization costs of approximately $2 per share.\nFrom an earnings cadence perspective, we anticipate module sales of 3 to 3.9 gigawatts for the second quarter, $310 million to $350 million in Section 45X credits and expected earnings per diluted share of between $2 and $3. Capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to range from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, including $25 million to $50 million of tariff effect. Our year-end 2025 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $0.4 billion and $0.9 billion. As a reminder, our net cash guidance does not account for the sale of our 2025 section 45X credits, but as in prior years, we will continue to evaluate options and valuations for potential earlier monetization.\nTurning to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages on today's call. Q1 earnings per diluted share came in below the low end of our guidance range of $1.95 per share, primarily due to a change versus forecast in the mix of U.S. versus international products sold within the quarter. Our forecast for U.S. produced volumes sold remains unchanged for the year. In the near-term policy uncertainty, especially relating to the newly announced tariff regime has introduced significant challenges to the year that were not known at the start of the year. We've updated our guidance to reflect a range of Universal to reciprocal tariff impacts known as of today. For the full year 2025, we're forecasting earnings per diluted share of $12.50 to $17.15.\nIn the longer term, we remain confident in the long-term prospects of both the U.S. solar and intergeneration demand broadly and the first follow specifically through leveraging our unique profile and competitive differentiators, including fully vertically integrated manufacturing, domestic supply chain, the manufacturing base and the proprietary cat cell-based semiconductor technology.\nWith that, we conclude our remarks and open the call for questions.

Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from 2024. From a commercial perspective, 2024 saw us sustain a highly selective approach to contracting, which we foreshadowed at the start of the year, securing full year net bookings of 4.4 gigawatts at a base ASP of $0.305 per watt, excluding adjusters, India domestic sales and terminations. This led to a year-end contracted backlog of 68.5 gigawatts. We are pleased to have sold a record 14.1 gigawatts of modules in 2024. Our record net sales of $4.2 billion, in line with our prior earnings call guidance represented a 27% increase year-on-year. Our full year diluted EPS, which included an after-tax impact of approximately $0.42 per share from the December sale of 2024 Section 45X tax credits, which was not included in our October guidance, came in below the low end of our guidance range at $12.02 per share. Alex will provide more detail regarding our 2024 financial results later in the call.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, we produced 15.5 gigawatts in 2024, including 9.6 gigawatts of Series 6 modules and 5.9 gigawatts of Series 7 modules. We began producing and selling our first cure modules from our lead line in Ohio in Q4. And we progressed our technology road map in 2024, commissioning a new dedicated R&D innovation center in Ohio, featuring a high-volume manufacturing scale production pilot line and began ramping a new perovskite development line capable of producing small form factor modules at our Perrysburg campus. Our growth continued during 2024 as we exited the year with approximately 21 gigawatts of global nameplate manufacturing capacity, an increase of over 4 gigawatts over 2023, driven by the addition of our new Alabama facility and throughput optimization in Ohio. Additionally, we continue to construct our $1.1 billion in Louisiana manufacturing facility over the course of 2024, which remains on track to begin commercial operations in the second half of this year. Once ramp is expected to increase our global nameplate manufacturing capacity to over 25 gigawatts by 2026.\nTurning to Slide 4. I will discuss our most recent shipments and bookings. At the end of 2023, our contracted backlog reached 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion or approximately $0.298 per watt. In 2024, we recognized sales of 14.1 gigawatts and contracted an additional 4.4 gigawatts of net bookings, resulting in a year-end contracted backlog of 68.5 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $20.5 billion or approximately $0.299 per watt. Since our previous earnings call, we have contracted a net 0.5 -- 0.4 gigawatts of new volume. This includes 0.3 gigawatts in India, approximately 40 megawatts of inventory below our current contracted backlog minimum bin requirement, the sale was through a nontraditional revenue sharing contracting arrangement with a module distributor. The residual net bookings include 0.6 gigawatts of sales to our traditional U.S. utility scale customer base and an ASP of $0.305 per watt, excluding adjusters or up to $0.314 per watt, assuming the realization of adjusters were applicable, partially offset by 0.5 gigawatts of terminations. For the full year 2024, including our 4.4 gigawatts of net bookings were approximately 5.1 gigawatts of gross bookings to our traditional U.S. utility scale customer base at an ASP of $0.309 per watt, excluding adjusters, or up to $0.328 per watt, assuming the realization of adjusters were applicable A 0.1 gigawatt of lower in module sales through the aforementioned distributor, 0.6 gigawatts of domestic India volume and 1.4 gigawatts of module agreement terminations. In addition, we saw contract determinations in India, which were included in our contracts subject to conditions precedent number but not in our bookings backlog for total 2024 module contract terminations of 2.4 gigawatts. A substantial portion of our backlog includes opportunities to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters if we realize achievements within our current technology road map as of the expected time and the delivery of the product. By the end of Q4, we had approximately 37.1 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which we estimate could generate up to an additional $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, a majority of which would be recognized between 2026 and 2028. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog for both the ultimate been delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards, and for increases in sales trade or applicable aluminum and steel commodity price changes.\nAs reflected in Slide 5, our total pipeline of potential bookings remain strong, with bookings opportunities totaling 80.3 gigawatts and a decrease of approximately 1.1 gigawatts from the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities decreased by approximately 2.5 gigawatts to 21 gigawatts and now includes 18.5 gigawatts in North America and 2.3 gigawatts in India. Within our mid- to late-stage pipeline, our approximately 3.9 gigawatts of opportunities that are contract subject to conditions precedent. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as a booking until we have received full security against the offtake. As stated on previous earnings call, given the long-dated time frame into which we are now selling, we need to align customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, payment security and other key contractual terms. And the uncertainty related to the policy environment from the recent U.S. elections, we will continue to leverage our position of strength in our contracted backlog and be highly selective in our approach to new bookings this year. We intend to continue forward contracting with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and appropriately value our points of differentiation.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2024 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Beginning at Slide 6. In Q4, net sales were $1.5 billion, a $0.6 billion increase from the prior quarter. For the full year, net sales were $4.2 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion compared to the previous year, driven by higher volumes sold. Our Q4 net sales were benefited by $20 million from customer contract terminations, and our full year net sales results were benefited by $115 million from customer contract terminations and reduced by warranty charges of $56 million due to the Series 7 manufacturing issues discussed on our prior earnings call.\nGross margin was 37% in the fourth quarter compared to 50% in the prior quarter. Full year gross margin increased 5 percentage points from 2023, leading to a full year but gross margin of 44%. Our Q4 and full year gross margin was lower than forecast due to several factors. Firstly, in December of 2024, we entered into a transaction with Visa, resulting in a sale of $857 million of Section 45X tax credits. In Q4, we discounted the carrying value of these credits by $39 million, which impacted Q4 gross margin by 3 percentage points and full year gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point to reflect the cumulative discount from the transaction. We received $616 million in cash proceeds in Q4, with the remaining $202 million expected to receive in Q1 of 2025. Secondly, warranty charges relating to manufacturing issues affecting the initial production of Series 7 modules as discussed on our prior earnings call, are estimated to result in total charges ranging from $56 million to $100 million, $50 million of which was recognized in the third quarter and $6 million of which was recognized in Q4, primarily driven by additional impact in modules sold during the fourth quarter. Separate but related, we have taken corrective actions following the identification of the manufacturing issues in our initial Series 7 production that led to this warranty charge, which we believe has remediated these issues. While we continue to collaborate with customers to advance resolution, there is the potential that formal disputes arise. In addition, certain shipments to customers on product identified as impacted prior to shipment have been delayed as part of this remediation process. This resulted in the deferral of the sale of approximately 250 megawatts of modules from Q4 of 2024 into 2025. In aggregate, the $6 million warranty charge, the 250-megawatt module sale delay, the aforementioned sale of approximately 40 megawatts of low-bin inventory through a module distributor and the aforementioned contract termination payments in aggregate, negatively impacted the fourth quarter gross margin by approximately $16 million relative to our forecast. In addition, shipment delays both within the quarter and from Q4 2024 into 2025 and in large part due to the aforementioned manufacturing issues, resulted in approximately $36 million of incremental demurrage retention, grounding, warehousing and other logistics costs in Q4. Note, as of year-end, we held approximately 0.7 gigawatts potentially impacted Series 7 modules in inventory. Thirdly, our newest operating facility in Alabama experienced higher-than-anticipated ramp-related charges including material usage and spare parts consumption amounting to approximately $4 million. Despite these unforeseen costs, the plant continues to exceed the ramp-up pace of all previous Series 7 facilities in achieving its full production capability, underscoring our commitment to supporting the rapid growth trajectory of U.S. manufacturing. In Ohio, we incurred approximately $18 million in unforecasted underutilization charges, yield losses and other ramp-related expenses associated with the conversion to our CuRe technology on a high-volume manufacturing line. And lastly, in India, we incurred an unforeseen cost of $5 million due to a recent clarification of import regulations that imposed a specific duty on cover glass entering India, which applied to our 2024 cover glass imports.\nSG&A, R&D and production started expense totaled $111 million in Q4, a decrease of approximately $12 million relative to the prior quarter. Now, Q4 production start-up was $9 million above the midpoint of our guidance range, largely related to our Alabama and Louisiana expansions. For full year 2024, operating expenses totaled $465 million, an increase of $14 million compared to the prior quarter -- prior year. This includes a $39 million increase in R&D expense, primarily driven by higher depreciation and maintenance costs, employee compensation due to head count growth and increases in material and module testing costs in each case related to our significant investments in our R&D facilities and equipment. Additionally, start-up expense increased by $20 million, mainly due to the ramp-up of our Alabama and Louisiana facilities and the implementation of the lead line for our CuRe program. These increases were partially offset by a $9 million reduction in SG&A expense attributable to lower performance-based compensation expense as well as the nonrecurrent $36 million litigation loss from the prior year. Our fourth quarter operating income was $457 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $124 million, ramping and utilization costs of $39 million, production startup expense of $15 million and share-based compensation expense of $6 million. For the full year 2024, our operating income was $1.4 billion, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $423 million, ramping on the utilization cost of $82 million, production start-up expense of $84 million and share-based compensation expense of $28 million.\nInterest income, interest expense, other income and foreign currency losses totaled $10 million in expense in Q4 and $12 million of income for the full year. We recorded income tax expense of $53 million in Q4 and $114 million for the full year. Our tax expense in Q4 and full year 2024 included a reserve of approximately $6 million for state taxes in jurisdictions that do not follow the federal tax provisions of the tax exemption of Section 45X credit sales. Residual increase in our tax expense was mainly due to a shift in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings towards higher tax jurisdictions and adjustments to our tax provision based on differences between estimated and actual tax liabilities. Q4 earnings per diluted share were $3.65 compared to $2.91 in the previous quarter. For the full year 2024, earnings per diluted share were $12.02 compared to $7.74 in 2023.\nTurning to Slide 7, I'll review select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. aggregate balance of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities, was $1.8 billion at the end of the year, an increase of $0.5 billion from the prior quarter, and a decrease of $0.3 billion from the prior year. Our year-end net cash position, which includes the aforementioned balance left debt was $1.2 billion, an increase of $0.5 billion from the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.4 billion from the prior year. The increase in our net cash balance in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the collection of $0.6 billion in proceeds from the sale of Section 45X tax credits and positive module segment operating cash flows, partially offset by capital expenditures associated with our Alabama and Louisiana facilities. The decrease in our net cash balance for the full year 2024 was primarily due to capital expenditures, partially offset by module segment operating cash flows. Cash flows from operations were $1.2 billion in 2024 compared to $0.6 billion in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of Section 45X tax credits, partially offset by an increase in payments made to suppliers compared to the prior year and lower cash receipts from module sales in the current year. Capital expenditures were $314 million in the fourth quarter compared to $434 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2024 compared to $1.4 billion in 2023.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Mark who'll provide an update on technology and policy.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Alex. Turning to Slide 8. I will now provide a brief overview of our technology strategy. As we'll further discuss in a moment, we believe that the age of electrification is upon us, where electricity is the lifeblood of the modern economy and the way of life. While meeting this unprecedented demand for electricity is going to require diverse sources of energy generation, we believe that solar will be a key part of the solution mix. providing the opportunity to develop and commercialize the next generation of solar technologies. Optimizing across efficiency, energy and cost, we believe the future of solar has a dependency on thin film technologies. As a result, we have embarked on a focused technology strategy concentrated on 3 core pillars. The first pillar centers around improvements to our core single-junction CadTel semiconductor technology. As previously noted in Q4 2024, we commenced a limited commercial production run of modules, employing our cure technology, which we expect will be completed in Q1 of 2025 and have deployed the first of these modules in the field.\nUpon successful field performance validation to confirm the results of our accelerated life testing, we intend to permanently convert the Ohio lead line to CuRe. Previously forecasted in Q4 of 2025, we now expect to convert the Ohio lead line back to CuRe in Q1 of 2026 to address the key manufacturing learnings from the initial production run and to allow further time for field validation and intend to begin a phase replication of the technology across our fleet in early 2026. The second pillar relates to developing the next generation of thin film semiconductors able to be deployed at commercial scale. This research is focused on perovskite technology and performed at our California Technology Center, also supported by the associates brought over through the volar acquisition. We expect the effort to benefit from our new dedicated perovskite development line in Ohio which is expected to be fully operational by Q2 of this year. To date, we have been able to achieve reliability results that we believe are comparable with best-in-class R&D efforts and we continue to advance our work on improving efficiency and stability and the race to develop a viable and commercially scalable perovskite product. Our third pillar centers around the next-generation Tandem device, combining 2 semiconductors, which optimize to a different range of solar spectrum to create a very high efficiency module. While Tandems can utilize a range of available PV semiconductors, we believe at least one needs to be thin-film and that the optimal solution will require that both semiconductors are thin-films. In other words, our view is there is no tandem without thin-film. While we previously explored the possibility of a crystalline silicon CadTel Tandem product, we believe the energy and efficiency benefits of a fully thin-film approach provides a more likely path to a future transformative device and are therefore prioritizing our research into the structure. We believe this 3-pillar framework enables us to compete in the near term with best-in-class crystalline silicon technology through advancing our CuRe technology platform. And in the long term, we believe our thin-film technology and manufacturing leadership and expertise positions us as well as it positions us well in the race to commercialize and scale of perovskite based thin-film semiconductor.\nI would like to take a moment to address the intellectual property issues that continue to challenge the crystalline silicon industry. Since our last earnings call, during which we shared a sustainable overview of the IP landscape, we continue to see leading manufacturers assert patent-related claims against one another. Most recently, Trina Solar, Canadian Solar's China subsidiary, CSI Solar, for patent infringement in China. JinkoSolar sued LONGi in Australia, China and Japan and [indiscernible] in a California court and LONGi sued JinkoSolar in the U.S. As we disclosed in 2024, First Solar also possesses a Topcon patent portfolio through our acquisition of TetraSun in 2013. Our top [indiscernible] portfolio includes issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, United Air Emirates and Vietnam with validities extending to 2030 and beyond. The portfolio also includes patent pending applications in the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, United -- are Emirates and Vietnam. We continue to enforce our rights under this patent portfolio. Earlier today, following numerous commercial engagement efforts, we filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against various JinkoSolar entities, alleging infringement on one of our U.S. TOPCon patents. This lawsuit is consistent with our previous statements that we intend to actively enforce our intellectual property rights against companies that exploit infringing TOPcon technology. At the same time, we continue to advance our discussion with certain other companies that have expressed interest in resolving the issue commercially. For example, earlier today, we announced that we entered into our first agreement for the licensing of our U.S. TOPCon patents with Talend PV, a U.S. manufacturer of solar cells, which recently announced a 4-gigawatt TOPCon cell manufacturing facility scheduled to commence operations in the first quarter of 2026. The Jinko lawsuit combined with our commercial discussions with companies that have expressed interest in securing a license to First Solar's TOPcon's patent portfolio as well as the decision by some manufacturers to pivot to the PERC node from TOPCon, give their own and their customers' potential exposure to lawsuit risk reinforces our belief that developers, project owners and PPA off-takers as well as debt and tax equity financing parties must evaluate the risk of procuring TOPCon solar products that could be subject to IP-related legal challenges. Once again, this environment underscores the benefits of First Solar's unique, highly differentiated CAD tel semiconductor technology over highly commoditized crystalline silicon panels.\nTurning to Slide 9. A word about the overall market conditions and our policy environment. Beginning with the macro environment, President Trump has defined an expansive economic mandate that could reshape the U.S. economy over the next 4 years, particularly in terms of electricity production and consumption, as administration's goals of accelerating economic growth, reducing inflation, establishing global energy dominance bringing American manufacturing jobs back and Champion innovation, including artificial intelligence, require abundant, stable power generation. Forecast showed that the U.S. will need 128 gigawatts of new capacity by 2029 to meet high summer peak demand. And while President Trump is expected to preside over the first meaningful growth in electricity demand this century, it will not be without challenges. The most significant of which is the time it takes to expand power generation capacity and grid infrastructure. Consider the new natural gas capacity could take half a decade to come online and cost twice as much as it did 5 years ago, thanks to supply chain constraints, including the shortage of turbines, large-scale nuclear power plants will take more than a decade to permit, construct and commission. While decommissioned nuclear plants are an option, reportedly, only 3 assets can be economically recommissioned by 2028. -- and while hiked and anticipated to be quicker to deploy, small modular reactors are not expected to operate commercially at gigawatt scale before 2035. Quite simply, in order to avoid potential energy price-related inflation, maintained its economic and innovation competitiveness and secure its energy independence, the country cannot wait that long. Given its attributes of low cost and speed to deployment relative to other sources of energy generation, solar should clearly be a significant part of the near-term solution mix. The administration and Congress must ensure that this unprecedented growth in power generation capacity is not deep in the country's dependence on China and that American manufacturers have access to a level playing field. The threat from China is existential and cannot be addressed through market factors, economics and innovation alone. Given this backdrop, we continue to advocate for decisive actions to address China's dominance of the global solar supply chain and weaponization of subsidy fueled overcapacity to undermine American manufacturing, energy security and enduring middle-class jobs. This includes establishing more in entities of concern or fee laws that exclude companies tied to the Chinese communist party from assessing U.S. tax other funded incentives. Considering the large number of Chinese manufacturers that have set up low value-added U.S. assembly shops, importing high-value oversea components to secure billions and incentives. [indiscernible] legislation not only prevents China from unfairly accessing U.S. taxpayer-funded incentives, but it also impactfully reduces the cost of programs like 45X, advanced manufacturing tax credit, while ensuring that value created by domestic manufacturing is retained in the U.S. and not remitted to China.\nMoving to trade. Southeast Asia AD/CVD case filed in April of 2024, has made significant progress since our last earnings call. In November, the Department of Commerce released its preliminary antidumping determination establishing higher-than-anticipated cash deposit rates for Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, while issuing affirmative critical circumstances findings for Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, this past month, Commerce revised certain preliminary CVD rates upon examining the cross-border subsidies tied to Chinese wafer, glass and solar space. In Cambodia, as a result of this examination, 4 solar manufacturers imports now have post preliminary CVD rates of 729% and a total AD plus CVD preliminary rate of nearly 850%, up from a rate of around 150% prior to this examination. We expect to see determinations from commerce in respect -- as such, Chinese cross-border subsidizations concerning Malaysia and Vietnam in the near term, which may increase the CVD rates applicable subject crystalline silicon manufacturers in those countries. Overall, the trade committee is pleased with the results related to Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand and continues to monitor import data and trade practices relative to all countries including Loss and Indonesia, among other countries, and all trade remedy options remain on the table.\nI will now turn the call back to Alex, who will discuss our 2025 outlook and items.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before discussing our financial guidance, I'd like to reiterate our growth in important thesis and our approach to backlog and bookings. Continue to focus on differentiation and are guided by an approach that bounces growth, profitability and liquidity. This framework informs our long-term strategic decision-making. It guided our strategy to exit the systems business at the end of the last decade and to significantly expand our domestic U.S. R&D and manufacturing base. It also drives our approach to forward contracting volume where we built a significant contract backlog totaling 68.5 gigawatts of volume at year-end 2024 at an ASP of nearly $0.30 per watt. Our reported backlog, which includes U.S. and Rest of World bookings with our typical contractual security provisions but excludes contracts signed in India and less backed by 100% security is made up of 2 sites of contracts. Those related to a specific asset or project and frameworks, which are typically larger multiyear and therefore, often have less certainty over specific delivery timing with customers having more flexibility to shift volume within and across delivery years. Common across these structures is a fixed price structure, which may include adjusted for technology improvements and which typically include adjusters for in-class freight risk and commodity risk.\nAs of December 31, 2024, over 90% of our backlog had some form of steel and/or aluminum commodity cost protection and substantially all of our backlog had some form of freight protection. This long-term approach to our business model and customer contracting is especially important during periods of macro and industry uncertainty, such as we face today. As Mark discussed, we believe there are a number of drivers of sustained long-term growth in the demand for the energy generation. With its relatively low cost profile and speed to power, Solar is well positioned to be a fixture of the energy mix in advanced economies as we progress to the next decade. However, at present, continuing a trend that increased throughout 2024, there remains significant near-term uncertainty largely driven by the still unresolved policy environment following the U.S. elections in November. This uncertainty is also driving a pour in at least some domestic manufacturing expansions. As but one example, earlier this month, Indian solar manufacturer of Premier Energy's announced that is pausing plans to build a cell plant in the U.S. citing policy uncertainty. Given the multiyear lead time required to build and commission a cell manufacturing facility, the uncertain policy environment also has the potential delay and increased presence of domestic high-value manufacturing competition. This uncertainty, however, is also driving customer caution, particularly as it relates to new procurements and a lack of clarity as to project time lines in 2025. This uncertainty is further reflected in our 2025 allocation position.\nExcluding India, we remain cumulatively oversold through 2026. As previously discussed, this oversold position is deliberate and in addition to providing us with revenue visibility in an industry that has historically experienced volatile pricing conditions provides us resilience to the uncertain timing of delivery inherent in some of our larger framework contracts, the natural tendency for delay in the project development process as well as the potential for incremental supply as we start up in revenue factories. To further out the delivery time frame, the more comfortable we are with overallocation. The closer we get to delivery dates and as we enter any given year and undertake our annual planning process, the more we look to ensure demand can be met with available buying. Therefore, whilst beneficial in the longer term, providing us with flexibility the trade-off is that this allocation must be resolved in the near-term delivery window.\nAs we progress through 2024, and as discussed on our previous earnings call, we saw increasing requests from customers to push out delivery schedules as a function of project development delays. We also saw 0.6 gigawatts of termination for convenience and 1.8 gigawatts of terminations for default, including 1 gigawatt of termination for default for India domestic contracts which were signed but not included in our bookings backlog, the majority of which incurred after the initial supply and demand allocation balancing for the year was completed. As mentioned in our third quarter earnings call for terminations or we have not received the termination payment entitlement, we will litigate or arbitrate seeking to enforce our full termination payment rights under the respective contracts. While we enter 2025 in a strong position with respect to our U.S. production, we are in an underallocation position for our Series 6 Malaysia and Vietnam production. This is driven in large part by 2 factors: one, customers employing module delivery shift rights; and the other, the previously mentioned contract terminations that occurred in 2024.\nAs it relates to module livery shift rights, as previously mentioned, multiyear framework contracts typically have less certainty of a specific delivery timing. As we enter the year, approximately 1 gigawatt of contracts with shift rights allowing product to move out of 2025 have had this option exercised. In addition, customers with intra-year flexibility in many cases, requesting deliveries in the second half of the year, which we expect will drive a back-end weighting of our full year revenue and shipment results. Additionally, due to the aforementioned contract terminations in 2024, we are not delivering international product that we intend to deliver in 2025 under those terminated contracts. While typically, we would seek to mitigate the impact of these factors by reallocating shifted or terminated deliveries to other customers. Our ability to do so in the near term as it relates to our Southeast Asia produced product is constrained by the policy environment in Europe, India and the U.S. In Europe, the combination of China's strategy of product dumping and oversaturation with the aim of capturing the European market, combined with the lack of EU block fiscal action to employ responsive trade remedies to level the playing field. has resulted in the EU market becoming a less attractive destination for our international production. As a consequence of this environment, in Q4, we made the decision to shut down our EU-based sales ratio, for which we incurred approximately $3 million in severance charges in Q4. We -- in India, while we applaud the efforts of the Indian government to address China's efforts to dominate its domestic market and are encouraged by its tariff and nontariff measures, including the expected 2026 expansion the existing approved list of models and manufacturers to cover cells as well as modules. These measures have the effect of largely eliminating the Indian market as a destination from Malaysia and Vietnam product. Finally, in the U.S., there is uncertainty relating to the postelection policy environment, including the increased prospect of tariffs and potential revisions to the IRA currently subject to a reconciliation process, which -- according to public reporting is not expected to be resolved until the second half of 2025. In this environment, our customers generally view our domestic modules as advantaged relative to our international process. While taken together, these items create near-term headwinds for our international production, assuming current policy remains unchanged, we continue to see long-term opportunities to place international products in the U.S. and optimize our allocation position. The IRA domestic content bonus provisions create significant economic value for our customers. This is enabled by way of the more recently issued points-based domestic content bonus guidance. We believe the point-based guidance provides our customers with a clearest route to enable and finance their domestic content bonus qualification efforts.\nFor First Solar, we expect the points-based guidance will provide us with greater supply chain flexibility in the U.S. and greater opportunity to optimize allocation across our entire fleet while maintaining the ASP and the original module sale agreement. In summary, while we're encouraged by the long-term opportunities to optimize the entirety of our global production fleet, the near-term combination of increased project delays and uncertainty experienced by our customers, promoting the utilization of module delivery shift rights, both inter and intra year and the termination in 2024 of contracts have included modules expected for delivery in 2025, together with the imbalanced demand of domestic versus international product, given the current policy environment in key markets, leads to a challenging full year and quarterly supply-demand allocation and balancing position as we enter 2025.\nSo with this context in mind, I'll next discuss the assumptions included in our 2025 financial guidance. Please turn to Slide 10. As it relates to growth in production, our factory expansions and upgrades remain on schedule to increase our expected global nameplate capacity to 25 gigawatts by 2026. In Ohio, we completed our footprint expansion in Q1 of 2024. In Alabama, our factory is expected to exit the ramp phase at the end of Q1 2025. Our newest facility in Louisiana forecast to be in start-up into Q3 of 2025 and to begin ramping production in the second half of this year. Combined, this leads to a forecast domestic production of 9.2 to 9.7 gigawatts. A Internationally, given the supply-demand imbalance of that Southeast Asian product just detailed, the impact of the current Europe, India and U.S. policy environment, we've made the decision to reduce output of Series 6 international product from our Malaysia and Vietnam factories by a combined total of 1 gigawatt this year for a total forecast production of 5.8 to 6.1 gigawatts.\nIn India, we're forecasting 3 to 3.2 gigawatts of production approximately 70% destined for the U.S. market and the remainder for domestic sales. This leads to a combined full year 2025 production forecast of 18 to 19 gigawatts.. Growth related costs are expected to impact operating income by approximately $110 million to $130 million. This comprises startup expense of $60 million to $70 million, substantially all in connection with our new factory in Louisiana, an estimated ramp and on utilization costs of $50 million to $60 million across our factories in Alabama, Louisiana, Malaysia and Vietnam. Note, in connection with the aforementioned 1 gigawatt reduction in Southeast Asian production, we are temporarily deploying a portion of our experienced engineering and manufacturing associates to our new U.S. facilities. While contributing to growth-related costs, this is expected to support the startup and ramp of these factories.\nCombined with inventory drawdown, including India volume shipped to the U.S. in late 2024, we forecast module sales of 18 to 20 gigawatts, of which 9.5 to 9.8 gigawatts is produced in the U.S. and approximately 1 gigawatt is assumed to be domestic sales in India. For the full year, we expect to recognize an ASP of approximately $0.29 per watt, including domestic India sales and the value of certain technology, commodity and freight adders. Included in our ASP assumption and within the guidance range, it's approximately 1.4 gigawatts of international product approximately evenly split between Series 6 International and Series 7 India domestic product, which is forecast to book and bill within the year at an ASP below the current backlog average.\nFrom a cost perspective, full year 2025 cost per watt produced is forecast to be approximately $0.20 per watt, an approximate $0.01 per watt increase over 2024, driven by 6 key factors: Firstly, in Ohio, following on from the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate ongoing under utilization and yield loss impacts from our CuRe technology run on a high-volume manufacturing line, which is expected to conclude by the end of the first quarter. Secondly, in Alabama, as the factory exits the ramp phase forecast to occur in Q1 but continues to produce at less than normal expected production capacity as is forecast for the remainder of 2025. We expect to see an increase in cost but produced capitalized into inventory until such normal production capacity is reached. Thirdly, as it relates to our India factory, product testing for the U.S. market is made with a tracker mounting structure and a higher production cost point relative to the fixed toll structure used for India domestic sales. In 2025, approximately 2/3 of our India production is destined for export versus approximately half in 2024 leading to higher expected blended production cost at this factory. Fourthly, the scheduled reduction of 1 gigawatt in total production at our Vietnam and Malaysia factories is expected to increase fixed cost per watt at these sites as a function of lower throughput. Fifth, on a combined basis, we anticipate a negative impact of fleet cost per watt from the relative mix of higher cost U.S. versus lower cost international production, which increases both as a function of the 1 gigawatt aggregate Malaysia, Vietnam production decrease as well as the increased U.S. capacity coming online. And lastly, we expect to see a cost headwind from the recently announced Section 232 tariffs imposed on aluminum imports into the U.S. at a rate of 25%. Given the aluminum frame rails for our U.S. Series 6 products are imported from the Malaysian supplier, after which they undergo a manufacturing process in our domestic machinery to produce the ultimate frame. The administration also really announced that is assessing the implementation of reciprocal tariffs for items from countries currently applying import duties to American products. Note, our module sale contracts for international product deliveries typically have some form of tariff protection if new tariffs are imposed on the importation of modules into the U.S., whether in the form of First Solar [indiscernible] rate or tariff absorption that is either shared with the customer were exclusively borne by the customers.\nRelated to the topic of tariffs, the word on the export control concerning 5 critical minerals including products containing tellurium announced by China's Ministry of Commerce earlier this month. Although tellurium and products containing tellurium, including among the cadmium telluride, our key raw materials used in our module production process, we have, over the past decade employed a strategic sourcing strategy to diversify our tellurium supply chain to mitigate a sole sourcing position in China and are undertaking additional measures to mitigate dependencies on China for certain products containing to tellurium. While we continue to evaluate that there will be any operational impact from China's decision, this latest development emphasizes the urgent need for the United States to accelerate the strategic development of copper mining and processing of its byproduct materials, including tellurium.\nMoving to cross what sold, we're forecasting fleet average sales freight, warehousing, ramp underutilization and other period costs of approximately $0.04 per watt, a reduction from 2024 but above our previous long-term cost assumptions. So it relates to sales rates, although we've seen some increase in freight rates, we are largely contractually protected from these impacts. However, we do expect some incremental freight charges as we increase our volumes sold from India to the U.S. We have seen an increase in our warehousing and storage needs driven by our increase in production capacity as well as the allocation balancing challenges referenced earlier in the call, which are expected to result in a back-ended shipment and sales profile in 2025. At the same time, warehousing rates have increased, given capacity constraints driven by a combination of increases in domestic manufacturing fit a surge of imports of manufacturers seek to mitigate the expected tariff risk following the November election. As it relates to the aforementioned Series 7 manufacturing issue, we've estimated warranty losses of $56 million to $100 million. As noted, as of year-end, we held approximately 0.7 gigawatts to potentially impacted Series 7 modules in inventory. Combination of production and period costs results in a forecasted full year 2025 cost was sold approximately $0.24.\nFrom a capital structure perspective, our strong balance sheet has been and remains a strategic differentiator, enabling us to both weather periods of volatility as well as providing flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, including funding our Series 6 and Series 7 growth. We ended 2024 in a strong liquidity position, and with forecasted operating cash flows from module sales, coupled with residual operating cash flow from the sale of 2024 Section 45X tax credits in December of 2024 and advanced payments from module orders, we expect to be able to finance our currently announced capital programs without requiring external financing. So it relates to our 2025 Section 45X credits, we are not forecasting the sale of these credits in 2025, and therefore, assuming no discount to the value of these credits for a sale to a third party. But as in previous years, we'll continue to evaluate options and valuations for earlier monetization.\nI'll now cover the full year 2025 guidance ranges on Slide 11. Net sales guidance is between $5.3 billion and $5.8 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between $2.45 billion and $2.75 billion or approximately 47%, which includes $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion of Section 45X tax credits and $50 million to $60 million of ramp on underutilization costs. SG&A expense is expected to total $180 million to $190 million versus $188 million in 2024, demonstrating our ability to leverage our largest fixed operating cost structure, while expanding production. R&D expense is expected to total $230 million to $250 million versus $191 million in 2024. R&D expenses increasing primarily due to commencing operations at our R&D innovation center and perovskite development line. and the expectation of adding head count to our R&D team to further invest and advance research initiatives.\nSG&A and R&D expense combined is expected to total $410 million to $440 million and total operating expenses, which includes $60 million to $70 million of production start-up expense are expected to be between $470 million and $510 million. Operating income is expected to be between $1.95 billion and $2.3 billion, implying an operating margin of approximately 38% and is inclusive of $110 million to $130 million of combined ramp costs and plant startup expense and $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion of Section 45X credits. Selling to nonoperating items. We expect interest income, interest expense and other income to Net Zero. Full year tax expense is forecast to be $100 million to $120 million. This results in full year 2025 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $17 to $20. Note from an earnings cadence perspective, we expect between 2.7 and 3 gigawatts of module sales in the first quarter at a gross margin similar to the full year average, resulting in first quarter earnings per diluted share of between $2.20 and $2.70. Capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to range from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Approximately half of our CapEx is associated with capacity expansion, majority of which relates to our Louisiana plant with the remainder driven by R&D programs, technology replication and maintenance. Our year-end 2025 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion.\nTurn to Slide 12. I'll now summarize the key messages from today's call. With respect to 2024, while our full year diluted EPS came in below our expectations, this result was largely attributable to the incurrence of discrete costs in the pursuit of achieving the growth and liquidity principles of our strategic decision-making framework. Growth in the case of ramp costs associated with our Alabama facility as we expand U.S. manufacturing as well as lower throughput and higher yield losses connected to our initial conversion to high-volume cure manufacturing and liquidity in connection with the sale of $857 million of Section 45X tax credits as we significantly strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet. The other cost driver impacting 2024 margin with similarly discrete resulting from increased logistics costs associated with delayed shipments, largely in connected with the manufacturing issues affecting the initial production of Series 7 modules. That said, from a revenue perspective, full year 2024 net sales came within our guidance range for the year. We exited the year maintaining a significant contracted backlog, totaling 68.5 gigawatts, with an average ASP of $0.30 per watt. In addition, our full year 2024 diluted EPS result represents a 55% increase over the prior full year results. For the year 2025, we are in a position of strength with respect to our U.S. production, although together with the rest of the industry, we are confronted with uncertainty in the grand policy environment in key markets, leading us to an underallocated position with respect to our international products and increased costs associated with the reduction in our Southeast Asian production. That said, assuming the current construct of the domestic content provisions remains unchanged, we are encouraged by the long-term opportunities to optimize the insight of our global production fleet. For full year 2025, we're forecasting an earnings per diluted share guidance range of $17 to $20, the midpoint of which would represent an approximately 50% increase over 2024.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2024 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide business, strategy, technology and policy updates, Alex will discuss our bookings, pipeline, quarterly financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions.\nPlease note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Reflecting on the first half of 2024, we are pleased with our ongoing efforts to strengthen the fundamentals of our business. With solid operating and financial performance, selective incremental bookings, robust pipeline of demand, including a near -- a recently signed 620-megawatt module supply agreement subject to the achievement of conditions [indiscernible] President with a new U.S. customer that will be supplying power to a hyperscaler. And investment in technology, R&D infrastructure and manufacturing expansions, we continue to solidify our market position through strong execution.\nOur balanced approach to growth, profitability and liquidity, combined with multiple technological and business model points of differentiation enable us to deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights for the second quarter.\nFrom a commercial perspective, we continued our disciplined approach to bookings. Since our last earnings call, we have secured a net 0.9 gigawatts of bookings with an ASP of $0.316 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable or $0.334 per watt, assuming the realization of adjusters where applicable and in each case, excluding India domestic sales.\nThis includes a 0.4 gigawatt debooking related to a termination for convenience exercised by one of our European power and utilities customers [ who ] are selling a portfolio of U.S. development assets as referenced on our last earnings call and who is obligated to pay the associated contract termination payment.\nThis brings our year-to-date net bookings to 3.6 gigawatts. Our total contracted backlog now stands at 75.9 gigawatts with orders stretching through 2030. From a technology perspective, since our Q1 earnings call, we have established a new world record CadTel research cell with a conversion efficiency of 23.1%, commission new critical R&D infrastructure in Ohio, and remain on track to launch our CuRe program in Q4 of this year. Our CuRe program is expected to increase energy production in real world conditions through improved module temperature coefficient, bifaciality and degradation rate. Additionally, we have announced the ownership of certain issued and pending patents related to the manufacturing of Topcon crystalline silicon solar cells. And while Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of our second quarter 2024 results, I would like to highlight our ability to deliver financially with second quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.25 and a quarter end net cash balance of $1.2 billion.\nDespite this strong execution and our success, delivering on the manufacturing technology, customer and financial commitments, we must acknowledge that our industry faces varying degrees of increasing external uncertainties, particularly related to policy, supply conditions and evaluations of strategic direction and capital allocation by certain large multinational companies. These will be discussed later during the call.\nTurning to Slide 4. Our growth plans remain on track. The expansion of our Ohio manufacturing footprint has been completed and commercial shipments began as scheduled at the end of the second quarter. The completion of this phase expands our manufacturing capacity into the state by almost 1 gigawatts to nearly 7 gigawatts. In Alabama, we expect to complete the installation of tools, complete plant certification and commence production this quarter with the first commercial shipments from the plan expected in Q4 of 2024. We are pleased with the speed at which we're able to construct, equip and commission the 2.4 million square foot facility, achieving this in approximately 24 months from the investment decision.\nOur new Louisiana facility is also on track with the start of commercial operations expected in the second half of 2025. Furthermore, we commissioned the Jim Nolan Center for Solar Innovation earlier this month. This new research and development innovation center in Ohio is the largest facility of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. The 1.3 million square foot facility includes a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, which we expect will allow us to produce full-size prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules in a manufacturing sandbox, freeing up our commercial production lots.\nIn addition, we are on track to commission our new perovskite development line at our Ohio campus in the second half of 2024. Combined, these new facilities represent an investment of nearly $0.5 billion in American R&D infrastructure. We believe that thin-film research is critical for commercializing multi-junction tandem devices, which are anticipated to be the next disruptive innovation in the solar industry. While the U.S. leads the world in thin-film PV under First Solar's stewardship, China is racing to close the innovation gap, and we expect that our strategic investment in R&D infrastructure will help us maintain our nation's strategic advantage in thin-film technology and position the next generation of disruptive, transformative solar technologies to be American-made.\nTurning to Slide 5. We continue to progress our technology road map and during the quarter, established a new world record CadTel research cell conversion efficiency of 23.1%. This achievement certified by the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory was accomplished at our California Technology Center. We remain on track to incur at our lead line in Ohio in Q4 of this year. And following the pull-in of CapEx discussed at our previous earnings call, intend to accelerate replication across the fleet beginning in late 2025, with our Vietnam and third Ohio facility.\nAdditionally, we announced the ownership of issued and pending patents related to the manufacturing of Topcon crystalline silicon, photovotaic solar cells earlier this month, which we continue to leverage as we pursue multiple pathways towards our goal of developing the next transformative disruptive tandem solar technology.\nThis portfolio, which includes issued patents across various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and pending patents in the EU and Japan has validity extending to 2030. We are mindful that there have recently been a number of TOPCon patent ownerships announcements and several litigation claims related to particular aspects of TOPCon cell production. Based on thorough and ongoing analysis, including the engagement of third-party legal and technology experts, we firmly believe in the value and strength of our patents and are investigating several leading crystalline silicon cell manufacturers for potential infringement. If infringement is discovered, we intend to challenge the ability to manufacture, assemble and sell infringing TOPCon technologies by pursuing enforcement, licensing and other measures to safeguard our rights.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss our bookings pipeline and finances.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Moving on to Slide 6. As of December 31, 2023, our contracted backlog totaled 78.3 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion. Through June 30, 2024, we contracted 2.7 gigawatts of incremental volume, reduced our bookings by 0.4 gigawatts due to the aforementioned contract termination by a European customer and recognize 6.1 gigawatts of volume sold. This brings our total backlog to 74.6 gigawatts at quarter end with an aggregate value of $22.3 billion implying an ASP of approximately $0.299 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable. Since the end of the second quarter, we've entered into an additional 1.3 gigawatts of contracts, resulting in a total backlog of 75.9 gigawatts. Substantial portion of our backlog includes opportunities to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters if we realize achievements within our current technology road map as of the expected timing for delivery of the product.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 38.4 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which if fully realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately [ $0.7 million ] or approximately $0.02 per watt, majority of which will be recognized between 2025 and 2028. This increase in adjusters relative to the prior quarter is a function of the opportunity discussed on our prior earnings call, to accelerate the expected replication of CuRe across the fleet.\nThis amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog. Both the ultimate module being delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP in the [ sales ] contract upwards or downwards and for increases in sales rate where applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes.\nAs reflected on Slide 7, our total pipeline of potential bookings remained strong, with bookings opportunities totaling 80.6 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 7.8 gigawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities decreased by approximately 0.8 gigawatts to 28.6 gigawatts, now includes 24.6 gigawatts in North America and 3.7 gigawatts in India. Within our mid- to late-stage pipeline, our 4.1 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracted [ subject ] to conditions precedent, including 1.2 gigawatts in India. And in the U.S., a 620-megawatt module supply agreement with a new customer who will be supplying power to our hyperscaler, which Mark noted earlier.\nAs a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we've received full security against the offtake. Note that we anticipate reducing our opportunities on a contract subject to conditions [ precedent for ] India by 0.4 gigawatts as a result of an expected termination of a defaulted module supply agreement with an Indian affiliate of a European oil major who is in the process of selling this business. As stated on previous earnings calls, given our diminished available supply through 2027, and the long-dated time frame into which we are now selling and the need to align customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, payment security and other key contractual terms. And given the uncertainty related to the policy environment due to the upcoming U.S. election, we will continue to leverage our position of strength in our contracted backlog and be highly selective in our approach to new bookings this year.\nWe intend to continue forward contracting with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and appropriately value our points of differentiation.\nSlide 8, I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $1 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the first quarter. Increase in net sales was driven by a 24% increase in the volume of megawatts sold and the aforementioned contract termination payment obligation of one of our European customers. Gross margin was 49% in the second quarter compared to 44% in the first quarter. This increase was primarily due to a higher mix of modules sold from our U.S. factories, which led to $255 million in the Section 45X tax credits in the second quarter, the aforementioned contract termination payment obligation, reduction in warehousing and logistics costs and continued reductions in production costs.\nSG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $126 million in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $22 million compared to the first quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher start-up expenses for our Alabama factory, higher R&D expenses associated with the development of next-generation solar technologies and higher professional fees.\nOur second quarter operating income was $373 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $97 million, ramp costs of $6 million, production start-up expense of $27 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. Second quarter other income was $5 million. Tax expense for the second quarter was $28 million compared to $19 million in the first quarter. This increase was driven by higher pretax income during the period and a change in our position related to reinvesting the accumulated earnings of a foreign subsidiary, which allows us to repatriate certain offshore funds to support our strategic investments in the U.S. and show that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in [ which it's ] needed. The combination of the aforementioned items led to second quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.25.\nNext turn to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.8 billion compared to $2 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures associated with our new U.S. factories in Alabama and Louisiana, along with the repayment of working capital loans in India partially offset by operating cash flows from our modules business. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $559 million, a decrease of $61 million from the first quarter driven by the repayment of certain working capital loans in India, which helped support the ramp of our new plant in the region. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.2 billion to $1.2 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows from operations were $193 million in the second quarter, and capital expenditures were $365 million during the period.\nContinuing on Slide 10. Our full year 2024 guidance remains unchanged. Note following the aforementioned termination for convenience of 0.4 gigawatts in Q2, one of the limited number of contracts that have such a right, we expect volumes sold, revenue and net cash to be toward the bottom of our guidance range. From a second half earnings cadence perspective, we expect our net sales and cost of sales profile, excluding the benefit of Section 45X tax credits to be approximately 40% in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth quarter. We forecast Section 45X tax credits of approximately $240 million in the third quarter and $335 million in the fourth quarter with an operating expense profile roughly evenly spread across the remainder of the year. This results in a forecasted earnings per diluted share profile of approximately 40% in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth quarter.\nNote, while a third quarter event, we, like many companies were impacted by the recent defective software update issued by Crowdstrike that resulted in IT outages around the world. First Solar's corporate and manufacturing operations were briefly impacted, including the temporary idling of our fleet, which was gradually restored over a period of approximately 2 days. This incident did not impact our full year 2024 guidance.\nI'll now hand the call back to Mark to continue the business update.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Alex. As reflected by remarks at the beginning of the call, we are pleased with our financial and operational execution for the second quarter. We have continued to deliver on our commitments and have largely advanced our planned initiatives throughout the year thus far, such as progressing our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion on schedule, commissioning our research and development infrastructure build-out on plan, and maintaining a disciplined approach to new bookings opportunities. That said, we are also mindful of several externalities, which may impact the industry as a whole, including First Solar. Among these externalities, we are most frequently encountering are the uncertainties related to politics and policies, irrational global supply conditions and the evaluation of strategic directions and capital allocation by certain large multinational companies. Firstly, with the November election fast approaching, the solar industry is again facing an uncertain policy environment. The impact of this uncertainty became more apparent as the second quarter progressed. We have observed increasing constraints on access to capital, both for early-stage solar technology companies seeking to finance the next stage of their growth as well as for the established companies looking to build domestic manufacturing capacity, our financing parties wait to make investment decisions until they have a clear view of the policy picture.\nThis uncertainty has also impacted developers, evaluating risk and returns within project pro formas and which comes at a time when, as mentioned earlier, some oil and gas and power and utility developers are contemplating the pivot from renewables to prioritizing fossil projects. The potential for Republican control of the Presidency and both Houses of Congress has given rise to concern over the prospect of a legislative reconciliation process or use of the Congressional Review Act adversely impacting the Inflation Reduction Act legislation or its related regulations.\nA change in the executive administration alone regardless of the results of the Senate and House elections, has raised similar concerns of the potential use of executive orders to block or delay implementation of IRA-related guidance and the administration of both published and unfinalized regulations. While we cannot predict the outcome of the November election or [ what the ] Republican suite would mean for renewable energy industry and trade policies, we can help inform policymakers across the political spectrum of the significant economic and strategic benefits of promoting and securing a robust domestic solar energy manufacturing base and how policies such as 45X of the IRA significantly contribute to the economic life of our nation's communities, particularly those located in traditionally red states.\nAccording to an economic analysis commissioned by First Solar and conducted by the University of Louisiana Lafayette, our investments are already delivering tangible value by creating jobs and raising wages for American workers. Our existing facilities, combined with our expansions in Ohio and new facilities in Alabama and Louisiana, are expected to see us support over 30,000 direct, indirect and induced American jobs by 2026 and $2.8 billion annually in labor income. Our growth trajectory and long-standing commitment to investing in local supply chains is estimated to support 7.3 jobs nationally for every First Solar job created and is expected to add over $10 billion annually to the country's economic output by 2026.\nWe are demonstrating that investing in American solar manufacturing, innovation and supply chains delivers enduring job creation and economic value, solidifying solar's manufacturers role in Americas, all of the above approach to energy security. We believe our model of high-value domestic manufacturing is the towering example of what are the art of the possible is when the nation follows through on bipartisan goals of countering China's ambition to dominate critical supply chains.\nOur manufacturing and domestic sourcing is also an example of capturing and retaining maximum value in the U.S., leveraging it to spur cycles of innovation to advance American technological leadership and attract and retain an enduring workforce. This is, however, a relatively unique example. While intended to enable the growth of domestic renewable manufacturer, and value chains, we believe Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 can and must be strengthened by establishing guardrails and prevent companies controlled by owned or subject to the jurisdiction of [indiscernible] governments such as China from receiving U.S. taxpayer dollars. We believe that any legislation that establishes these guardrails will help reinforce the IRA's intent of encouraging true value in job creation and retention across the Solar Valley chain; a message we believe resonates with policymakers across the political spectrum.\nDespite the political uncertainties ahead, a look back on the quarter reflects several positive developments in the trade environment. Over the past quarter, we have seen the United States government continue to address to seminate overcapacity in China by leveraging the tools and the trade policy toolbox. Recently, the Biden-Harris administration acted to close a loophole in trade law by removing the Section 201 bifacial module exemption, which the Trump administration had also attempted to remove and announced plans to double the Section 301 tariffs on solar cells and modules imported from China, another trade measure initiated by the Trump administration. In addition, the 2-year anticircumvention SolarBridge moratorium expired in the second quarter, and the administration pledged to crack down on stockpiling through \"vigorous enforcement\" announcing that importers, which brought product and tariff free during the moratorium will be required to certify as to module installation by the December 2024 deadline with detailed information about the imported modules being deployed or pay the required tariff.\nIn June, the U.S. International Trade Commission by unanimous and notably bipartisan decision, issued a preliminary determination finding a reasonable indication of material injury caused by the dumping of solar cells and modules by Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Material injury caused by subsidies by Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam and a threat finding caused by subsidies in Cambodia. The unanimous bipartisan vote supports the petition of the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which First Solar is a member and underscores the harm caused by the unfair trade practices of China solar companies and their affiliates in Southeast Asia.\nThe alliance is currently evaluating filing critical circumstances petitions in response to the surge of [indiscernible] solar imports from the subject countries in the wake of the Department of Converse's initiation of the trade investigation. For example, [indiscernible] data suggests import increases of more than 60% from Malaysia and Vietnam and approximately 19% from Thailand. The [indiscernible] petitions are filed with the United States Department of Commerce determines that critical circumstances exist, cash deposit requirements can be imposed retroactively on solar cells and panels entering the country up to 90 days prior to the date of the Commerce's preliminary determinations. Critical circumstances can be alleged at any point until just before Commerce's final determination. Based on the Republican campaign platform, which has expressively contemplated employing tariffs to increase trade imbalances, we believe it is reasonably foreseeable that administration were to change could result in incremental tariffs on the Chinese crystalline silicon supply chain operating from Mainland and through its Southeast Asia and other satellite countries. While broadly beneficial to us given our significant and expanding U.S. manufacturing base, any new universal tariffs on imports could adversely impact the gross margin related to our Malaysia, Vietnam and India production sold into United States. Finally, it is also important to note that regardless of the outcome of the November election, utility scale demand for renewables is expected to continue to grow. The sources of this projected substantial demand are varied, including from data center, the resort of manufacturing, cryptocurrency mining, the heating and cooling, to name a few. Critically, such demand is generally not dependent on policy-enabled drivers. Solar continues to demonstrate that in many U.S. locations, it is the lowest cost source of energy and there are a few other generation sources that can be expanded at scale or notably deployed as quickly as solar, a critical attribute for end users who place a priority on time to power.\nIn addition, given the presence of long-term fixed price PPAs, relatively predictable degradation, few moving parts and an unlimited free fuel source in the form of sunlight solar and by nature, is deflationary energy generation asset, further contributing to the nation's economic growth.\nMoving on from political consideration. The second externality, a long common theme in the solar industry is irrational oversupply, driven almost exclusively by China's well-documented ambitions to dominate solar supply chains. The unsustainable market conditions resulting from this behavior continue to be an adverse macro condition confronting module manufacturers like First Solar that are committed to competing on a level playing field and on the basis of their merits and undertaking growth that is underpinned by demand. These market-distorting practices have resulted in a 2024 year-end projected U.S. oversupply position of approximately 40 gigawatts. Oversupply conditions in the EU continued unabated as policymakers struggled to provide a coherent policy response to ensure sustainable manufacturing conditions with the -- in the European block.\nIn India, a challenged ASP environment is a large part, a consequence of Chinese cell dumping, that is artificially lower pricing and challenges the country's aspiration to end its reliance on an adversarial by developing a domestic manufacturing base that serves a domestic market. Despite several of our crystalline silicon competitors publicly reporting significant financial losses for the first half of the year as they work to shed excess inventory and rationalize capacity, the Chinese solar industry continues its race to the bottom through overbuilding capacity, ignoring clear indications that the market cannot sustain such levels of production, this results in continued dumping of products into key markets at depressed prices. Despite the recently published proposal by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology seeking to raise the minimum capital ratio for new PV capacity and impose intellectual property ownership criteria related to capacity expansion, there is skepticism that such measures will be effective in curtailing production expansions and reshoring supply and demand balance.\nParticularly as a consequence, we see China capacity expansions -- excuse me, particularly as we see -- continuously see China capacity expansion plans announced. In a market challenged by irrational oversupply, and in sharp contrast, the results recently announced by some of our Chinese competitors. We have continued to deliver strong performance as reflected by our year-to-date earnings, recent bookings and total backlog. And while the crystalline silicon industry faces potential obstacles to innovation due to weakening fundamentals and pending legal challenges to its freedom to operate, including as it relates to First Solar's recently announced of TOPCon technology patents. During the quarter, we established a new record CadTel research cell, remain on track related to our CuRe launch and fleet replication schedule and commissioned our new R&D facility.\nThe third externality we have observed relates to certain multinational companies, strategic direction and capital allocation. As referenced on our prior earnings call and during this call, we're observing some multinational oil and gas and power and utility companies, particularly those based in Europe, considering pivots from renewable project development back to fossil projects in an effort to increase returns. For example, we've been made aware that a U.S. affiliate of a European-based multinational oil and gas customers evaluating their strategic direction with regards to renewable project development. Notwithstanding, we believe the underlying fundamentals of solar remain robust. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are seeing the potential for a significant increase in demand as the decade advances, driven in part by data center load growth. Ten of our largest customers have ongoing and future projects that are serving the nation's largest hyperscalers, deploying our technology for the balance of the decade.\nAccording to an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, data center-driven energy demand expected to increase by 15% to 20% annually through 2030. Total U.S. power consumption is expected to increase by 3% per year through the end of this decade, with data centers alone expected to contribute more than 60% of the total growth. We believe that this potential hyperscale related demand, coupled with their publicly stated commitments to address their energy needs through clean generation, along with our strong track record of partnering with developers to provide solutions for these off-takers, places First Solar in a strong position to have an important role in powering the industry of the future.\nAs demonstrated by our recently signed, 620-megawatt module supply agreement subject to additional [ conditions president ] with a new U.S. customer that will be supplying power to a hyperscaler. Underlying fundamentals related to fossil fuel retirements, the movement towards electrification, utility and corporate demand for clean energy, scrutiny of environmental impact and social consciousness of supply chain providers and load growth, especially related to AI-driven data center demand, aligned with First Solar's position as a leading provider of eco-efficient modules and its approach to responsible solar. We're also seeing increased demand driven by the modified domestic content bonus safe harbor guidance issued by the Department of Treasury and IRS in May of 2024. The updated guidance sets out a more practical points-based calculation rather than a cost-based calculation for a renewable energy project to qualify for the bonus, placing a high value on vertically integrated manufacturing that utilizes domestic procured components, a profile exemplified by First Solar's growing domestic manufacturing operations.\nGiven the high domestic content embedded in our U.S. produced Series 6 and Series 7 modules, which critically feature a domestically manufactured cell and incorporate domestic components for either all or almost all of the points eligible components specified in the elective safe harbor in the May 2024 updated guidance, our customers' projects can satisfy key aspects of the domestic content bonus criteria just by procuring First Solar modules. On the new elective safe harbor, there are opportunities for First Solar to blend its deliveries to customers with modules produced across its global fleet, potentially increasing the optimization of all of our factories while enabling our customers to qualify more projects for the domestic content bonus.\nIn summary, while external factors such as the outcome and impact of the forthcoming election and the continued impact of the global Chinese-driven overcapacity on supply-present challenges. First Solar continues to focus and deliver on our planned initiatives. Through continued execution, active policy engagement, utilizing our balanced approach to growth, profitability and liquidity and leveraging our points of differentiation. We believe we remain well-positioned to navigate these challenges.\nTo conclude, Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call on Slide 11.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nDemand continues to be robust, 3.6 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, including 0.9 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, leading to a resilient contracted backlog of 75.9 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 3.7 gigawatts. Alabama and Louisiana factory expansions remain on schedule. The expansion of our Ohio manufacturing footprint has been completed and commercial shipments began as scheduled at the end of the second quarter. From a technology perspective, we've established a new world record CadTel research sale, commissioned our new R&D facility in Ohio. We expect our [indiscernible] line launch in Q4 of this year, announced the ownership of certain issued and pending patents related to the manufacturing of TOPCon crystalline silicon cells. Financially, we earned $3.25 a diluted share, and we ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $1.8 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. We're maintaining our full year 2024 guidance, including forecasted full year earnings per diluted share of $13 to $14. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call to questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2024 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on our website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide business, strategy and policy updates. Alex will discuss our bookings, pipeline, quarterly financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note, this call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our start to 2024 with good operating performance, selective year-to-date bookings of 2.7 gigawatts with an ASP over $0.31 per watt, excluding adjusters or $0.327 per watt assuming the realization of technology adjusters, and solid financial performance.\nWe're also pleased with the developing foundations to enable our long-term goal of exiting this decade in a stronger position than we entered it. From increasing production of our most advantaged Series 7 module to expanding our manufacturing footprint, to the building of an R&D innovation center and perovskite development line that is expected to enable development of the next generation of disruptive solar technology, we are focused on the future of differentiation and sustainable growth.\nBut while we continue to play the long game, we must acknowledge the current environment in the solar manufacturing industry, which remains in a state of heightened volatility driven by intentional structural overcapacity in China. As we previously said, our ability to play this long game is a direct result of our differentiated technology and business model.\nFrom a technological perspective, the contrast is clear between our unique proprietary cadmium telluride semiconductor technology and highly commoditized crystalline silicon modules. This difference has become increasingly apparent in light of the recently announced disputes concerning alleged infringement of TOPCon cell technology and intellectual property rights, which cast out some numerous crystalline silicon producers having the freedom to legally manufacture and sell this technology.\nFrom a business model and growth perspective, we are once again reminded of the value of our balanced approach to growth, liquidity and profitability. According to reporting, large Chinese solar companies have warned a potential quality and reliability issues as manufacturers cut corners and the impact of the current oversupply environment and associated financial stress on R&D and innovation.\nBy contrast, we continue to invest. We are on track to commission our R&D innovation center and a perovskite development line in Ohio in the second half of this year, representing a combined investment of nearly $0.5 billion. And we continue to optimize our products for energy efficiency and cost.\nIn the face of overcapacity, the average large Chinese solar manufacturing facility reportedly had a record-low capacity utilization rate of 23% in February of this year. In contrast, supported by our large contracted backlog, our facilities were operating near nameplate capacity in the first quarter of this year.\nThe Chinese solar industry has engaged in a race to the bottom with a rationally low market-distorting pricing that has caused even Chinese companies to call for intervention by the Chinese government to manage the pricing environment and send the financial hardship this is causing them. By contrast, we remain focused on a highly selective approach to forward contracting that provides optionality and healthy ASPs.\nWe are not immune to the broader ramifications of the Chinese solar business model. However, we continue to focus on our points of differentiation, which aim to provide some resiliency in light of current industry challenges. We're also focused on policy and trade drivers that can encounter anticompetitive and abusive market behaviors. There should be no doubt, we invite competition and free trade. All we continue to seek is that the competition and trade are practiced on a fair and level playing field. We believe this approach will help us to drive growth, navigate industry volatility and deliver enduring shareholder value.\nOn Slide 3, I will share some highlights from the first quarter. From a commercial perspective, we continued our selective approach to building backlog underpinned by our cumulatively oversold position through 2026. Since our last earnings call approximately 9 weeks ago, we have booked 854 megawatts with an ASP of $0.301 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 2.7 gigawatts with an average ASP of $0.313 per watt excluding adjusters or $0.327 per watt assuming the realization of technology adjusters.\nOur total contracted backlog now stands at 78.3 gigawatts with orders stretching through 2030. From a manufacturing perspective, we are pleased with our solid Q1 performance, including producing a record 3.6 gigawatts of modules as a result of our relentless focus on manufacturing excellence.\nFrom a technology perspective, we are pleased with our CuRe module field test and have completed the UL and IEC certification process. We continue to anticipate launching CuRe at our lead line factory in Ohio in Q4 of this year. In parallel to preparing for launch, we continue to make progress on technical solutions that could enable accelerating CuRe's replication across our factories at a lower CapEx than assumed at our recent Analyst Day.\nNow Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of our first quarter 2024 financial results. I would like to highlight our ability to deliver strong performance in a market challenged by Chinese oversupply, which, in our view, validates our approach to long-term forward contracting. This led to first quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.20 and a quarter end net cash balance of [ $1.4 ] billion.\nMoving to Slide 4. Our growth plans remain on track. The expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing footprint is expected to be completed, and commercial shipments are expected to begin before the end of the second quarter. Construction activity at our new facility in Alabama is complete, and the first tools are now being installed in preparation for the expected start of commercial shipments in the second half of this year. Our new Louisiana facility is also on track with the start in commercial operations expected in late 2025.\nIn Ashley, our India facility is continuing to ramp. And we're proud that the first Indian-made Series 7 modules have been deployed in the field. We therefore expect to exit 2024 with over 21 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity and 2026 with over 25 gigawatts of nameplate capacity. All of this capacity is available to serve the U.S. market with over half of our capacity physically located in the U.S.\nAdditionally, we are on track to commission the previously mentioned R&D projects in Ohio in the second half of this year, which will comprise a perovskite development line and a new R&D innovation center at our Perrysburg campus. The innovation center features a high-tech CadTel pilot line, which we expect will accelerate our development activities and bring capabilities for full-size prototyping of thin-film and tandem PV modules.\nAt our Analyst Day in September 2023, we talked about the need to create a disruptive, transformative technology platform that balances energy efficiency and costs. We believe that these investments in R&D will help accelerate our cycles of innovation, optimize our technology road map and reinforce our position of strength through technology leadership.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss our bookings, pipeline and financials.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Moving on Slide 5. As of December 31, 2023, our contracted backlog totaled 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion. to March 31, 2024, we entered into an additional 2.7 gigawatts of contracts and recognized 2.7 gigawatts of volume sold, resulting in a total backlog of 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.4 billion, which implies an ASP of approximately $0.299 per watt excluding adjusters.\nAs we previously stated, given our diminished available supply, the long-dated time frame into which we're now selling, the need to align customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, payment security and other key contractual terms and uncertainty related to the policy environment and the upcoming U.S. election cycle, we expect to take advantage of our position of strength in our contracted backlog and be highly selective in our approach to new bookings this year. We will continue to forward contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and appropriately value a point of differentiation.\nThe substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters if we are able to realize achievements within our current technology road map as of the expected timing of delivery for the product. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 40.2 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which if fully realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.5 billion or approximately $0.01 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized between 2025 and 2027. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog, both the ultimate module being delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upward or downwards, and for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes.\nAs reflected on Slide 6, our total pipeline of potential bookings remained strong with bookings opportunities of 72.8 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 6.3 gigawatts in the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities decreased by approximately 2.6 gigawatts to 29.4 gigawatts and now includes 25.8 gigawatts in North America and [ 3.2 ] gigawatts in India.\nIncluded within our mid- to late-stage pipeline are 3.7 gigawatts of opportunities that are connected subject to conditions, which includes 1 gigawatt in India. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake.\nWe're seeing meaningful increases in demand expectations driven in part by data center load growth. According to McKinsey, U.S. data center power consumption is expected to reach 35 gigawatts annually by 2030, and much of this growth is supplied by renewable energy given that hyperscalers like Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are committed to 24/7 use of carbon-free energy. We believe that First Solar is strongly positioned to supply this emerging sector given our advantaged technology and more sustainable product.\nSlide 7, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter. Net sales in the first quarter were $794 million, a decrease of $365 million compared to the fourth quarter. Decrease in net sales was driven by an expected historical seasonal reduction in the Q1 volume of modules sold. Gross margin was 44% in the first quarter compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of modules sold from our U.S. factories, which qualify for Section 45X tax credits, partially offset by higher warehousing and logistics costs in India and the U.S.\nSG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $104 million in the first quarter, a decrease of approximately $7 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees as we incurred certain costs to facilitate the sale of our 2023 Section 45X credits during the prior quarter, lower incentive compensation and the receipt of an R&D granted our factories in Ohio. These reductions were partially offset by higher production start-up expenses for our Alabama factory and Ohio manufacturing footprint expansions as well as the reversal of certain credit losses in the prior quarter due to improved collections for our accounts receivables.\nOur first quarter operating income was $243 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $91 million, ramp costs of $12 million, production start-up expense of $15 million and share-based compensation expense of $7 million. The increase in other income expense was primarily driven by the prior quarter impairment of our strategic investment in CubicPV.\nWe recorded tax expense of $19 million in the first quarter compared to $27 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease in tax expense was largely driven by excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards and lower pretax income. Combination of the aforementioned items led to first quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.20.\nNext, turn to Slide 8 to discuss the next balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures associated with our new U.S. factories in Alabama and Louisiana and our Ohio capacity expansion, partially offset by operating cash flows from our module segment.\nTotal debt at the end of the first quarter was $620 million, an increase of $60 million from the fourth quarter as a result of additional working capital facilities to support the ramp of our new India plant. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.2 billion to [ $0.4 ] billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows from operations were $268 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $413 million during the period.\nContinuing on Slide 9. Our full year 2024 volumes sold and P&L guidance is unchanged from our previous earnings and guidance call in late February. We're increasing our capital expenditures forecast by $0.1 billion with the intention of accelerating the CuRe conversion at our Vietnam facilities as well as at our third Perrysburg facility and with a view to advancing global fleet replication by more than 1 year from our assumptions at our recent Analyst Day, which could drive incremental upside to the current estimate of additional revenue realizable through technology adjusters referenced earlier in the call.\nOur year-end 2024 net cash balance guidance range has been revised due to 4 factors: our selective accommodation of customer schedule shift requests, potential sale by a customer of a U.S. project development portfolio, our strategic approach to new bookings, and higher CapEx.\nFirstly, as noted on our previous call, we have seen some requests from customers to shift delivery volume timing out as a function of project development delays. We continue to work with our customers to optimize delivery schedules for their contracted volumes to the extent we are able to accommodate.\nSecondly, consistent with the reports that some energy project developers are coming under investor pressure to pursue returns commensurate with those currently prevalent in fossil project development, who may therefore be examining their renewable procurement positions, we have indications that a customer is expecting to sell their U.S. solar development portfolio. And we understand that the potential purchase of these assets, they first sold a customer with an existing module framework agreement. We expect that the development time lines for the projects within this portfolio will be delayed, including as a result of the sales process, pushing construction schedules out of 2024.\nBecause the potential pursue of these assets in an existing customer with a framework agreement covering the revised construction schedules and a portion of our backlog the selling customer is among unlimited contracts with a termination for convenience rights, we expect that this right will be exercised in connection with this portfolio sale.\nAs discussed on previous earnings calls, if this termination for convenience right is exercised, we will be owed a termination payment. We'd look to reallocate or resell these modules. Between selectively accommodating customer timing optimization requests and the expected termination for convenience by the aforementioned portfolio selling developer customer, we now expect a greater concentration of the shipments and sold volume in the second half of the year to be in Q4 versus Q3. As a result of this back ending of deliveries, we expect the timing of some cash collection previously assumed in Q4 2024 to now occur in Q1 of 2025.\nThirdly, relating to the revision of our year-end 2024 net cash balance guidance range, as a function of our highly selective approach to bookings, we're forecasting a reduction in assumed cash deposits associated with new bookings in 2024.\nAnd fourthly, as previously mentioned, we're forecasting higher CapEx associated with our intention to accelerate CuRe conversion at our Vietnam and our third Perrysburg facilities. So taken together, the combination of higher year-end accounts receivable balance due to accommodating customer timing optimization requests, the expanded termination for convenience by the aforementioned portfolio selling developer customer and reduced deposits from new bookings due to our highly selective approach to bookings as well as the increased CapEx due to the CuRe conversion in Vietnam and Perrysburg, results in an updated year-end 2024 net cash balance guide of $600 million to $900 million.\nFrom an earnings cadence perspective, we expect our net sales and cost-of-sale profile, excluding the benefit of Section 45X tax credit, to be approximately 35% to 40% in the first half of the year and 60% to 65% in the second half of the year. We forecast Section 45X tax credits of approximately $400 million in the first half of the year, approximately $620 million in the second half of the year, then operating expense profile roughly evenly split across the year. This results in a forecasted earnings per diluted share profile of approximately 35% to 40% in the first half of the year and 60% to 65% in the second half of the year.\nNow I hand the call back to Mark to provide an update on policy.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nOkay. Turning to Slide 10. As we stated in the past, we believe the Inflation Reduction Act represents America's first durable solar industrial strategy and if implemented with the whole of government commitment to onshoring, together with strong and consistent enforcement of trade laws, it also has the potential to dismantle China's dominated influence over solar manufacturing value chain. Quite simply, the IRA paves a viable pathway for the U.S. to secure supply of critical clean energy technologies, enabling America's energy independence while capturing the value of our economy and creating well-paying enduring jobs.\nAt the same time and also as previously stated, while we are not the only American solar manufacturer to come in existence at the end of the last century, the grim reality is that as a consequence of China's strategic objective to dominate the solar industry, we're the only one at scale to remain today. For the IRA to achieve one of its intended purposes, which is to spur U.S. manufacturing to the scale required to support the country's energy independence and climate goals, we must ensure that more companies that are aligned with the U.S. ambitions and are committed to fair competition and innovation can scale, compete and prosper.\n;\nThe purpose of the IRA will not be achieved under current unsustainable market conditions. The relentlessness of the Chinese subsidization and dumping strategy have caused a significant collapse in cell and module pricing and threatens the viability of many manufacturers who may never be able to get off the ground or have the ability to finance and start up the growth of their operations.\nGiven this unfortunate reality, together with our role as a market leader in the Western Hemisphere's largest solar module manufacturer, we have joined an alliance of 7 solar manufacturing companies, comprising the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Committee, which last week filed a set of antidumping and countervailing petitions with the U.S. International Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Commerce to investigate unfair trade practices from factories in 4 belt and road initiative countries in Southeast Asia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, that are injuring the U.S. solar industry.\nThis action takes place against the backdrop of growing momentum on the part of current U.S. administration to broadly address structural overcapacity across a range of industries in China. The administration's leadership in tackling this wide-ranging issue is remarkable. And in the past few weeks, we have heard senior members of the administration, including Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen; and White House Climate Adviser, John Podesta, state in no uncertain terms that the President intends to act to level the playing field for American manufacturing.\nWe welcome the actions focused on solar supply chains, including the reported potential withdrawal of the Section 201 bifacial exemption and the pending expiration on the moratorium on tariffs related to and in circumvention findings. These are clear actions that deliver on the President's intent.\nThe context of our decision to support the petition starts with China's role in the global solar market. That country's long history of egregious subsidies, dumping of modules at prices believed to be below their cost, creation of structural overcapacity, engagement and circumvention of measures designed to address these factors and other unfair trade practices have intentionally distorted markets around the globe, causing a significant decline in solar prices and denying international competitors access to a level playing field.\nAs Secretary Yell and herself has recently said, \"China's overcapacity distorts global prices and production patterns hurts American firms and workers.\" China ended 2023 with more than twice the solar manufacturing capacity that was deployed worldwide last year, had record-low factory capacity utilization rates in the first quarter of 2024 and despite these market-distorting factors, is still expected to add 500 to 600 gigawatts of new capacity this year with China expected to exit 2024 with sufficient capacity to meet global demand through 2032. It appears that the overcapacity is not a miscalculation but an intentional feature of the Chinese government strategy to dominate clean energy supply chains.\nNotably, the 4 Southeast Asian countries in question account for 75% of U.S. solar imports in 2023 and were responsible for an approximately 140% increase in exports to the U.S. in the 18 months following the passage of the IRA compared to the 18 months preceding August of 2022.\nWhile the current environment, if allowed to persist, will provide a short-term pricing benefit to developers, allowing these practices to continue denies non-Chinese solar manufacturers the opportunities to scale and compete on a level playing field while multiplying installers and developers exposure to the risk of over-concentrated supply chains.\nA word about the impact on the potential tariffs resulting from this case on module pricing. While some may choose to reference triple-figure tariff rates and claiming that these types of rates will cause severe disruption in achieving our deployment goals, the reality is far different. Currently, Chinese AD and CVD rates range from 15% to 50% for most cooperating compare.\nSecondly, projects should not be affected as historical module pricing has already been baked into those project economics. Finally, from a supply standpoint, there is, contrary to the view expressed by some industry participants, more than sufficient product available to service current and anticipated U.S. demand through the combination of currently warehouse modules, fairly traded imports and the capacity of Western manufacturers such as First Solar.\nAs noted earlier, we expect to exit 2024 with over 21 gigawatts and 2026 with over 25 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity, all of which is available to serve the U.S. market. Time and again, we have heard about the detrimental effects of enforcing trade laws on the books of -- on deployment. And yet time and again, we see annual records set for solar deployment in this country. In our view, the real risk for U.S. solar deployment comes from the long-term detrimental effects of allowing China's unfair trade practice to continue, which could result in a decimated domestic solar manufacturing base, ceding all pricing power and a complete control of supply chain distribution to a highly adversarial nation. This represents a strategic risk to developers of solar assets, a clean energy transition and the U.S. energy independence economic prosperity.\nU.S. energy independence isn't just about producing electricity at home. It's about having the supply chain and R&D for future advancements at our nation's disposal as well. Historic once-in-a-lifetime policies like the IRA, while transformative of our country's energy transition and our industry, are not enough to deliver independent due to China's unfair trade practices. We believe the IRA must work in conjunction with strong and effective trade measures that level the playing field for investments it catalyzes.\nWe must think of government policy in terms of a 3-legged stool. The first leg is industrial policy. In the U.S., demand continues to grow. But the domestic content bonus enhances this growth by creating a crucial parallel demand side driver to incentivize purchasing the output of these American factories. Through the introduction of a bonus to the investment or production tax credit accessed by solar generation asset owners if projects procured domestically made on, including solar panels.\nThe third leg is a level playing field that addresses anticompetitive market-distorting behavior, such as dumping and circumvention. While industrial policies such as IRA has the power to incentivize domestic investment and significantly growing this industry, the ability of those investments to endure is enabled by a corresponding trade policy. This level playing field ensures that domestic manufacturing investments incentivized by American taxpayer dollars are incubated as they scale.\nTake away any one of the legs and you render the whole apparatus unusable. Look no further than Europe as but one example of an unsustainable environment for clean energy manufacturing, not just in solar but wind as well due to the lack of effective trade measures to support policies that seek to incentivize the growth of the domestic supply chain production base.\nThere can be no doubt that trade policy is intrinsic to the efforts to build a resilient American solar value chain, and we believe this view has bipartisan support. This dynamic goes well beyond being just a risk to our company. It threatens the viability of all aspiring U.S.-based manufacturers who may never be able to finance the start-up of growth of their operations. Our support for the petition is founded on the thesis that we believe a level playing field, one that allows manufacturers to compete on the basis of their own merits, is essential for driving American innovation and competitiveness, promoting quality and enabling technology diversification that enhances developer choices.\nWe also believe that everyone benefits from a thriving, resilient domestic manufacturing industry, enabled by a level playing field and free of dependency on China. Apart from the positive impact on -- of domestic investment, job creation and economic value, which is reflected in the economic impact study commissioned by us and conducted by the University of Louisiana Lafayette that was released in February, domestic manufacturing also insulates developers and their pipelines against the risk of disruption resulting from global supply chain issues or potential geopolitical crisis.\nAs validated by our customers and our order book, domestic manufacturing supply chain, build resiliency into development pipelines, providing certainty of pricing and supply and ensuring continuity even in the face of widespread international supply chain disruption.\nAgain, I want to be clear, we invite competition and free trade. All we seek is that the competition and trade is fair, enabled by a level playing field where all companies can compete on the basis of their own merits. This petition is about enforcing the rule of law and holding rule-breakers to account, enabling a level playing field for domestic manufacturing and supporting the efforts to scale American solar value chains. Importers of solar panels from manufacturers playing by the rules and operating in compliance with U.S. trade laws have little to fear from this petition and any potential investigation.\nInternationally, oversupply and dumping of modules at prices below cost also adversely impacts the Indian and European markets, both of which are seeking -- are seeing record levels of imports and low pricing.\nReferring to my earlier comments about thinking of policy as a 3-legged stool, the principle also applies to India, which offers supply-side drivers in the form of production-linked incentive programs, deployment targets that offer demand drivers and nontariff barriers such as the Approved List of Module and Manufacturers, or ALMM. We are pleased that the government has decided to revive the mandate of its ALMM program, and First Solar was added to this list on April 29.\nWe believe that enforcing this vital nontariff barrier will support the effort to level the playing field for domestic manufacturers, especially if combined with a similar program focused on cell manufacturers that could materialize as more domestic cell capacity comes online in the country.\nHowever, we remain concerned about the level of dumping in India and its potential to undermine the country's manufacturing ambitions. While ALMM applies to fully assembled modules, it does not safeguard the market against the dumping of solar cells or other upstream components, which undermine efforts to scale vertically integrated domestic manufacturing in the country.\nWith this in mind, we are seeking an investigation into the dumping of solar cells in the India market. We believe that investigation is necessary to unfair, market-distorting behavior that denies domestic manufacturers in India a level playing field on which to compete as the industry scales.\nFinally, moving to Europe, which lags the U.S. and India in its response to dumping and consequently continues to deepen its near total dependency on Chinese-made solar panels. While Europe currently appears to not have the political will to consider trade barriers that could address dumping, we are encouraged by decisions to EU's foreign subsidies regulations to investigate potentially illegal subsidies to Chinese solar and wind manufacturers. We continue to monitor developments in Europe and engage with stakeholders there as we seek out opportunities to advocate for a level playing field in that market.\nTo conclude, Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call on Slide 11.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nDemand continues to be robust with 2.7 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date with an ASP of $0.313 per watt before adjusters, leading to a resilient contracted backlog of 78.3 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 3.6 gigawatts, and our Alabama and Louisiana factories and our R&D innovation center perovskite development line remain on schedule.\nWe continue to anticipate launching CuRe at our lead line factory in Ohio in Q4 of this year. In addition, we're increasing CapEx by $0.1 billion this year to accelerate CuRe conversion at our Vietnam facilities as well as at our third Perrysburg facility with a view to advancing global fleet replication by more than 1 year from our assumptions at our recent Analyst Day.\nFinancially, we earned $2.20 per diluted share, and we earned -- ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $2 billion or $1.4 billion net of debt, maintaining our full year 2024 volumes sold and P&L guidance, including forecasted full year earnings per share -- per diluted share of $13 to $14.\nAnd with this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results as well as its guidance for 2024. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business update and outlook for 2024. Alex will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 as well as our financial guidance for 2024. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by noting that this month marks the 25th anniversary of First Solar's founding, making us 1 of the oldest and most experienced solar module manufacturers in the world. This is a remarkable milestone in a journey that has positioned us as the Western Hemisphere's leading solar module technology and manufacturing company.\nWhile we're not the only American solar manufacturer to come into existence at the end of the last century, we are the only one at scale to remain today. However, this is not simply a story of survival, but one about the value of long-term strategic decision-making underpinned by a differentiated technology and business model, driving value creation for our shareholders and our partners. Ours is a story of innovation, values, competitiveness and perseverance, and we are proud of our work towards leading the world's sustainable energy future.\nAs our journey continues, few years have been as consequential to our long-term growth strategy as 2023. Over the past year, we expanded manufacturing capacity, mobilized at our latest announced facility in Louisiana, produced and shipped a record volume of modules, expanded our contracted backlog to historic levels, and increased R&D investment, and continue to evolve our technology and product road map.\nLet's review the key accomplishments in 2023, beginning with Slide 3. From a commercial perspective, 2023 continued the momentum established in 2022 as long-term multiyear procurement continue to drive demand. We added 10 new customers and secured 28.3 gigawatts of net bookings at a base ASP of over $0.30 per watt. Despite industry macro challenges, such as global oversupply and pricing volatility, we continue to see strong mid- to long-term demand, especially in the United States, as shown with 2.3 gigawatts of net bookings since the previous earnings call at an ASP of $0.318 per watt excluding adjusters or $0.334 per watt, assuming the realization of our technology adders. Our total contracted backlog now stands at 80.1 gigawatts with orders stretching to the end of this decade.\nWhile Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of our 2023 financial results, our full year EPS came in at $7.74, which is above the midpoint of our initial and Q3 2023 guidance ranges and included the impact of the sale of our Section 45 tax credits and the impairment of our investment in Cubic PV. These items, neither of which were included in our Q3 2023 guidance ranges, adversely impacted our full year EPS by approximately $0.48 per watt.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, we produced a record 12.1 gigawatts in 2023, representing a 33% increase in production over 2022. As a result, we have now surpassed 60 gigawatts of cumulative production since we first began commercial manufacturing in 2002. This growth was driven by manufacturing excellence at our Series 6 factories, which produced 9.7 gigawatts in 2023, an increase of 600 megawatts compared to 2022, and the successful ramping of our new Series 7 factories in the U.S. and India, which combined to produce more than 2.4 gigawatts in 2023. Our top production bin for Series 6 was 475 watts, and our top production bin for Series 7 was 545 watts.\nWe remain committed to progressing our technology and product road map in 2023, having recently achieved a 22.6% world-record cattail research conversion efficiency based on our CuRe technology and launched the first bifacial thin-film solar panel. In addition, we successfully completed our manufacturing readiness trial under our CuRe program in the fourth quarter of 2023 and expect to begin manufacturing modules powered by this technology at our lead line in Perrysburg in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIt's vital that our supply chain and logistics operations keep pace with our manufacturing expansion plans, and we've made meaningful progress on this front in 2023. Key achievements including entering into agreements with Vitro to supply American-made front and back glass for our manufacturing operations in the U.S. and with Onco and ICE industries to supply steel back rails for our facilities in Alabama and Louisiana. We also signed agreements with Single Bain to supply the back glass for our modules in India.\nRegarding growth, we exited the year with 16.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity. This marks an increase of 6.8 gigawatts from 2022 driven by the commencement of operations at our Series 6 factories in Ohio and Indiana. In -- excuse me, in India. In 2023, we announced a $1.1 billion investment in a new manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts to our nameplate capacity in 2026.\nWhen combined with our Alabama facility and our Ohio manufacturing footprint expansions, both of which are in progress, we expect 2026 year-end nameplate capacity of approximately 14 gigawatts domestically with another 11 gigawatts internationally for a global nameplate capacity of approximately 25 gigawatts.\nWe also continue to invest in our technology with our R&D innovation center and our perovskite development line, both on construction and Ohio. These facilities are expected to commence operations in the first half and second half of 2024, respectively. Additionally, in 2023, we acquired Evolar, a European leader in perovskite technology, and has since transitioned its laboratory in Sweden to become our first R&D facility allow us to accelerate the cycles of innovation, we believe are necessary to extend our leadership in thin-film solar technology.\nTurning to Slide 4. As of year-end 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion or approximately $0.288 per watt. Through year-end 2023, we entered into an additional 28.3 gigawatts of contracts at an average ASP of $0.305 per watt. After accounting for sales of 11.4 gigawatts in 2023, we began 2024 with a total contracted backlog of 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion or approximately $0.298 per watt.\nSince the end of 2023, we have entered into an additional 1.8 gigawatts of contracts, resulting in a total backlog of 80.1 gigawatts. These most recent bookings have an average ASP of $0.319 per watt pre-adjuster or $0.339 per watt if contract technology adjusters are realized. Additionally, we have received security against 206 megawatts of previously signed contracts in India, which now move these volumes from contracted subject to conditions precedent grouping within our future opportunities pipeline to our bookings backlog. A substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase base ASPs through the application of adjusters, if we're able to realize achievements within our current technology road map as to the expected timing for delivery of the product.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 39.1 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which if fully utilized -- realized, excuse me, could result in additional revenue of approximately $0.5 billion or approximately $0.01 per watt, the majority of which would be realized between 2025 and 2027. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to total contracted backlog, both related to the ultimate module being delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upward or downward, or for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2023 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 5, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion, an increase of $0.4 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net sales was driven by higher volumes sold, including higher net sales of Series 7 modules that we continue to ramp production at our new facility in Ohio.\nFor the full year 2023, net sales were $3.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the prior year. This increase was driven by $0.9 billion of higher module net sales resulting from increases in both volumes sold and ASPs, which was partially offset by $0.2 billion of lower revenue from our residual business operations primarily related to the sale of our Luz del Norte project in the prior year.\nBased on our vertically integrated differentiated manufacturing model and the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify the Section 45X tax credits of approximately $0.17 per watt to each module produced in the U.S. and sold to a third party, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the period of sale.\nIn December, we entered into an agreement with Fiserv, which resulted in the sale of approximately $687 million of the 2023 Section 45X tax credits for expected aggregate cash proceeds of $659 million. We received an initial $336 million of cash proceeds in January with the remainder expected by the end of April 2024. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a valuation adjustment of $28 million within cost of sales during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of the credit to the amount expected to be received from the transaction.\nFor the fourth quarter and full year 2023, we recognized $229 million and $659 million, respectively, of Section 45X tax credits, including the effect of the aforementioned adjustment.\nGross margin was 43% in the fourth quarter compared to 47% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to the adjustment associated with the sale of our Section 45X tax credits; a higher mix of modules sold from our non-U.S. factories, which do not qualify for Section 45X tax credits; and the write-off of certain legacy production materials, partially offset by continued module cost reductions.\nFor the full year 2023, gross margin was 39% compared to 3% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the recognition of Section 45X tax credits, a decrease in sales rates to merge and detention charges, an increase in module ASPs, continued module cost reductions, and the net impairment and sale of our Luz del Norte project in the prior year, partially offset by increased underutilization costs charged in the period in which they are incurred associated with the factory ramp in 2023.\nThe ramp charges were $16 million in the fourth quarter compared to $25 million in the third quarter. Our ramp costs for the full year 2023 were $89 million compared to $7 million in the prior quarter. Our 2023 ramp costs were primarily attributable to our new Series 7 factories in Ohio and India.\nSG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $111 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately $7 million relative to the prior quarter. This increase was primarily driven by fees associated with the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits and an increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by lower-than-expected credit losses resulting from improved collections of our accounts receivable.\nFor the full year 2023, SG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses, along with litigation losses, were $450 million compared to $351 million in the prior year. As a reminder, we recorded a litigation loss of $36 million during the second quarter related to our legacy systems business. The remaining operating expense increase of $63 million was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation due to additional head count, higher professional fees associated with litigation, the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits, and higher material and module testing costs for our research and development activities.\nOur fourth quarter operating income was $398 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $90 million; ramp costs of $16 million; costs associated with the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits of $35 million; legacy systems-related income of $7 million; production startup expense of $10 million; and share-based compensation expense of $11 million.\nOur full year 2023 operating income was $857 million, which includes depreciation, amortization and accretion of $308 million, ramp costs of $89 million, costs associated with the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits of $35 million, legacy systems business-related costs of $7 million; production start-up expense of $65 million, and share-based compensation expense of $34 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, we took a $23 million impairment associated with a strategic investment in Cubic PV. Our investment thesis is anchored to their continuing development work on perovskites and tandem technologies. Outside of our investment thesis, they had planned to develop domestic silicon wafer manufacturing capacity. This plan was recently abandoned due to surge in construction costs and declining wafer prices, which triggered impairment.\nInterest income in the fourth quarter was $24 million, roughly the same as the prior quarter. And interest income for the full year 2023 was $98 million, an increase of $64 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest rates on our cash and marketable securities. We recorded an income tax expense of $27 million in the fourth quarter and $61 million for the full year.\nFourth quarter income per diluted share was $3.25 compared to $2.50 in the prior quarter. For the full year 2023, income per diluted share was $7.74 compared to a loss of diluted share of $0.41 in 2022.\nLet's turn to Slide 6 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. The aggregate balance of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities, was $2.1 billion at the end of the year, an increase of $0.3 billion from the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.5 billion from the prior year.\nOur year-end net cash position, which includes the aforementioned balance less debt was $1.6 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion from the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.8 billion from the prior year. The increase in our net cash balance in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by module segment operating cash flows, including advanced payments received from future module sales, partially offset by capital expenditures associated with our new plants under construction in Alabama, Louisiana and India. The decrease in our net cash balance for the full year 2023 was primarily due to capital expenditures, partially offset by module segment operating cash flow.\nCash flows from operations were $602 million in 2023 compared to $873 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by higher operating expenditures in support of our ongoing manufacturing expansion and lower advanced payments received for future module sales, partially offset by higher cash receipts from modules sold during the year. Capital expenditures were $347 million in the fourth quarter compared to $286 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in 2023 compared to $0.9 billion in 2022.\nNow I turn the call back to Mark to provide the business and strategy update.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Alex. A word about overall market conditions in the policy environment. As we enter 2024, while we continue to operate from a position of strength, leveraging our points of differentiation and strong contracted backlog, the continuation of Chinese subsidization and dumping practices has caused a significant collapse in cell and module pricing.\nLast month, Meyer Burger, a European module and cell manufacturer, announced that deteriorating market conditions in Europe resulting from such practices as forcing them to prepare for shutting -- shuttering module assembly in Germany, exemplifying the challenges to the stated goal of creating a self-sustaining renewable manufacturing industry.\nIn India, a sudden and significant reduction in cell pricing in the nondomestic content market segment has blunted the efficacy of the country's measures to address Chinese supply chain imports, distorting market pricing in the country and disincentivizing the ability of local suppliers to help achieve India's ambition to create broad domestic manufacturing to serve its domestic market.\nAnd here in the U.S., notwithstanding the U.S. Department of Commerce's general determination of antidumping and countervailing duty circumvention by [ 4 ] Southeast Asia countries, the continued record level of cell and module imports from these regions poses a threat to the current administration's ambitions of scaling and securing a robust onshore solar manufacturing base.\nIn light of the current and forecasted state of oversupply in these markets and the resulting headwinds to the ability of domestic manufacturers to scale, we call upon governments and policymakers to either reinforce the measures already enacted or move expeditiously to take action. For instance, here in the U.S., we have long taken the position that the Section 201 safeguard bifacial exemption simply opened the door for a multi-gigawatt scale crystalline silicon product to have unfettered access to the American solar market, threatening U.S. solar manufacturing.\nIndeed, a recent report released by the U.S. International Trade Commission noted that a number of commenters cited the bifacial exclusion along with the 2022 executive order temporarily blocking the U.S. Department of Commerce for imposing new tariffs on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam as leading to increased availability of foreign-made solar panels. We therefore advocate as the administration undergoes its current evaluation of the 201 tariffs that it closes this market-distorting bifacial exemption, which has been exploited to eviscerate the intent of these measures to safeguard the domestic industry.\nIn addition, with respect to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which addresses the scourge of utilizing forced labor within the solar supply chain, we similarly advocate for Custom and Border Protection to utilize all of the tools in its toolbox to ensure a comprehensive enforcement strategy of law already on the books and to ensure that regardless of which port product is shipped into, the legal requirements in place are consistently enforced.\nIn India, while the approved list of module manufacturers, or ALMM, has been effective in incentivizing domestic manufacturing investment, pauses in the application of this law and the related impacts to domestic pricing have put progress at risk. We are heartened that the ALMM waivers currently in place are expected to expire at the end of Q1 and would encourage the federal government of India to not grant such waivers in the future and to also consider expanding the ALMM equivalent requirements to sell manufacturing. These actions we believe will foster India's ambitions of reducing their dependency on the Chinese solar supply chain and, in our view, incentivize further capital investment in this country.\nTurning to the EU. While we are pleased with this month's recent development to establish the Net Zero Industry Act, which will prioritize permitting and funding for technologies deemed necessary to help the EU achieve its goal of making the region climate-neutral by 2050, much work remains to be done. As we have continuously stated, investment in local manufacturing can only scale when sufficient measures are in place to ensure a long-term, consistent, level playing field. Such measures require addressing loopholes in trade policies that create the current situation, where an oversupply of Chinese modules is being sold at artificially low prices as well as the harmful impacts of the use of forced labor.\nFirst Solar has demonstrated the benefits to domestic economies and communities of establishing local solar manufacturing. This is illustrated by an economic impact study commissioned by us and conducted by the University of Louisiana and Lafayette that was released yesterday. This study found that First Solar supported over 16,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the U.S. in 2023. This excludes an additional 5,800 construction-related jobs tied to our capital investments in 2023.\nAs we scale to an expected 14 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity in the U.S., the analysis forecasts that First Solar's operations alone will support approximately 30,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the country by 2026, representing approximately $2.8 billion in annual labor income and $10 billion in total economic output to the 2026 U.S. economy. This study estimates that every First Solar job, excluding construction, supported 6 jobs in 2023. And this ratio is forecasted to increase to 7.3 jobs by 2026.\nWe believe this data defines in tangible terms the value that domestic solar manufacturing delivers to the U.S. economy and should provide a basis for bipartisan political support to establish and maintain the policies and trade measures necessary to provide a domestic solar supply chain in a level playing field.\nWe now turn to Slide 7 to examine our pipeline. Despite the current oversupply of Chinese modules and loopholes and trade policies in our key markets, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust as reflected on Slide 7. Total bookings opportunity stands at 66.5 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 600 megawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities decreased by approximately 500 megawatts to 32 gigawatts and includes 23.2 gigawatts in North America, 8.5 gigawatts in India and 0.3 gigawatts in the EU.\nIncluded within our mid- to late-stage pipeline are [ 3.8 ] gigawatts of opportunities that have contracted subject to CP precedents, which includes [ 1.1 ] gigawatts in India. Given the shorter time frame between contracting and product delivery in India relative to other markets, we would not expect the same multiyear contracted commitments that we are currently seeing in the United States. As a reminder, signed contracts in India are not recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake.\nTurning to Slide 8. We are pleased with our progress of our Ohio capacity expansions and new Alabama manufacturing facility, which are expected to be completed and begin commercial shipments in the first and second halves of the year, respectively. Once these projects are completed, we expect to exit 2024 with over 21 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity, approximately half of which is forecasted to be local in the U.S. Our new Louisiana facility is also on track and is expected to commence commercial operations in late 2025, bringing our expected total nameplate capacity to over 25 gigawatts by the end of 2026 with 14 gigawatts in the U.S.\nAs a reflection of this expansion road map and continued optimization of the existing fleet, we have summarized our expected exit nameplate capacity in production for 2024 through 2026 on this slide.\nOur strategic expansion of manufacturing capacity in the U.S., which is supported by an extensive domestic value chain, enables our customers' efforts to begin from -- to benefit from the ITC and Production Tax Credit domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act. The resulting demand for First Solar's American-made solar technologies, combined with the eligibility of our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities for Section 45X tax credits, is expected to contribute significantly to our financial performance in the coming years.\nIn addition to progressing our manufacturing expansion plans, we expect 2024 to be a foundational year from the point of view of accelerating our R&D efforts in pursuit of our goal to develop and commercialize the next generation of photovoltaics. As previously noted, in addition to a new perovskite development line, we expect to commission our Ohio R&D innovation center this year.\nLocated near our existing Perrysburg manufacturing facility and covering an area of approximately 1.3 million square feet, it will feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line allowing for the production of full-size prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules. This center will allow us to create an R&D sandbox separate from our manufacturing operations, which we expect will accelerate without taking manufacturing mission-critical tools off-line, which would impact throughput and cost.\nTo close, as I've mentioned at our recent Analyst Day, we established a goal to exit this decade stronger than we entered it. Reflecting on our progress, we entered -- we ended 2023 in a stronger position than we began it with a record contracted backlog, a significant pipeline of booking opportunities and continued robust demand in our core markets despite some of the current policy landscape challenges.\nWe entered 2024 with new capacity of our most advantaged Series 7 product coming online, increased R&D investment and capabilities, and continued momentum across the business driven by a focus on our points of differentiation and a balanced business model focused on growth, liquidity and profitability.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our 2024 outlook and guidance.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before discussing our financial guidance, I'd like to reiterate 3 themes from our recent Analyst Day related to our growth and investment thesis, our approach to our backlog and bookings and our expansion into India.\nFirstly, from a growth and investment thesis perspective, we continue to focus on differentiation and are guided by an approach to our business model that balances growth, profitability and liquidity. This decision-making framework informs our long-term strategic direction. It guided our strategy to exit the systems business at the end of the last decade and significantly expand our module manufacturing business, evidenced in a doubling of nameplate capacity from 2021 to 2023 and the forecasted increase in nameplate capacity of over 50% from 2023 to 2026.\nThe scaling capacity is supported by optionality in our R&D road map across energy attributes, including efficiency, degradation, temperature coefficient and bifaciality. We've gone from deploying prototypes of early bifacial CadTel modules at a test facility in 2021 to converting our lead line at the end of 2023 with commercial deployment across a significant portion of our fleet plan for 2024. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to begin production of our first commercial CuRe modules on our lead line in Ohio.\nAs it relates to contracting this volume, we continue to prioritize certainty. Our reported backlog, which includes U.S. and rest of world bookings with our typical contractual security provisions but excludes contracts signed in India and [ leasebacks ] by 100% liquid security, is made up of 2 types of contracts: those related to a specific asset or project; and frameworks, which are typically larger, multiyear and often have less certainty over delivery timing.\nCommon across these contracts is a fixed price structure, which may include adjustments for technology improvements and which typically include adjusted for ben class, freight risk and commodities. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 95% of the megawatts in our backlog had some form of freight protection and approximately 85% had some form of steel and aluminum commodity cost protection.\nAs a reminder, a limited number of our contracts contain a termination for convenience provision, often related to customer regulatory requirements or has a portion of large multiyear framework committed. We generally require substantial advanced notice to be invoked and features a contractually acquired termination payment to us. This payment is generally set at a substantial percentage of the contract value and backstopped by some form of security.\nAs of today's call, the percentage of megawatts in our contracted backlog that had a termination for convenience clause with an associated termination payment obligation is roughly equivalent to that given at our Analyst Day in September of 2023. Note, given this provision is one of many deal terms that are negotiated with our customers in the process of a module sale, we do not expect to provide updates on this metric.\nOn our earnings call in February of 2022, we stated that as we significantly increased our nameplate capacity, we believe that this anticipated growth will generate significant contribution margin to drive operating margin expansion. In 2023, that thesis was validated as we saw significant year-over-year operating margin expansion. As we continue our capacity growth, we expect to continue to see operating margin expansion in 2024 as reflected in our guidance provided today.\nSecondly, as it relates to our contracted backlog, excluding India, we remain cumulatively oversold through 2026. This overallocation position is deliberate. It provides our resilience to the uncertain timing of delivery inherent in some of our larger framework contracts, a natural tendency for delay in the project development process as well as the potential for incremental supply as we start up and ramp new factories.\nThe further out the delivery time frame, the more comfortable we are with overallocation. The closer we get to delivery dates and as we enter any given year and undertake our annual planning process, the more we look to ensure that demand is able to be met with available supply. As of late Q4 2023, we have not seen significant customer requests for schedule changes beyond the typical daily and weekly balancing that occurred in our supply-demand forecasting.\nAs we conclude our planning process for 2024 through the first 2 months of the year, we have seen some requests from customers to shift delivery volume timing out as a function of project development delays. As we stated previously, including at our Analyst Day, we will work with our customers to optimize their project schedules, including moving delivery dates in the short and medium term where possible, balanced by the constraints of our production and shipment needs, including selling our full production in 2024, which we continue to expect to do.\nOur contractual business underlie and govern these relationships and discussions. In certain situations, our approach to overselling could expose us contractually should we be unable to manage our overallocated position. This is where the strength of our long-standing customer relationship is key, providing flexibility not just for our customers but also often to First Solar delivery time lines.\nGiven our supply-demand balancing so far and our ability in the near term to supply modules from India to the U.S., we do not forecast any damages associated with overallocation in 2024. Contractual provisions also protects us in the event of long-term customer issues or disputes. For example, we were recently notified by a corporate customer that they are experiencing significant delays to their project. And based on this and their current position of financial distress, we do not intend to take delivery of 381 megawatts of modules scheduled for delivery in 2024. We are working with this customer to optimize the outcome for both the customer and First Solar, but in this and other similar circumstances, we will continue to enforce our contractual rights to termination penalties or other damages in the event of their contractual breach.\nAs previously discussed on recent earnings calls and at our Analyst Day, we believe our approach to forward contracting has been validated in the past through multiple pricing and supply-demand cycles in the industry. We've also previously stated that we expect the pace of bookings to slow after 2 record contracting years.\nOur current backlog, cumulatively oversold through 2026 and with bookings extending to the end of the decade, provides us optionality in periods of pricing and policy uncertainty. Put simply, if we did not book any more deals by the end of the year, we would remain sold out 2 years forward through 2025 and 2026. We do not expect this to be the case, and we will continue to contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and value our differentiation as reflected in our 2.3 gigawatts of bookings since the previous earnings call.\nBut given the significant variables in the policy environment that Mark discussed earlier as well as the uncertainty around the 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections and their potential impact on the renewable sector, we expect to take advantage of this position of strength and be highly selective in our contracting in 2024.\nFinally, as it relates to India, from a contracting perspective, as of our Q3 earnings call in October, we had 1.7 gigawatts of signed contracts with our mid- to late-stage pipeline. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. As of today's call, that number is 1.1 gigawatts following a 600-megawatt default by a customer who has recently delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. We are seeking to enforce our contractual rights under this contract and are currently seeking to recover the contractual termination payments owed to us.\nFrom an ASP perspective, the temporary suspension of the ALMM policy that Mark discussed earlier is having a short-term negative impact on domestic market ASPs and gross margin, which is reflected in our 2024 guidance. We believe the expected reinstatement of the ALMM at the end of Q1, together with the ability to serve the domestic content market segment, which we are uniquely positioned to address given our vertical integration, provides a market opportunity with a gross margin profile, excluding the Section 45X tax credit benefit, comparable to the fleet average given the lower production costs in our Chennai facility.\nSo with this context in mind, I'll next discuss the assumptions included in our 2024 financial guidance. Please turn to Slide 9. As referenced in 2023, we have effectively completed the transition back to a module-only company. We continue to have certain remaining risks, liabilities, indemnities, warranty obligations, accounts payable, accounts receivable, earn-outs, cash collection to seat resolution and other legacy involvement related to our former systems business.\nConsistent with 2023 reporting, we no longer provide segment-specific guidance but shall in the future note any significant impact from the other segment to our consolidated financials.\nAs it relates to growth, our factory expansions and upgrades remain on schedule to increase our expected global nameplate capacity to 25 gigawatts at year-end 2026. In 2024, growth-related costs are expected to impact operating income by approximately $125 million to $155 million. This comprises start-up expenses of $85 million to $95 million primarily incurred in connection with our new factory in Alabama and estimated ramp costs of $40 million to $60 million at our factories in India, Ohio and Alabama. The anticipated expansion of upgrades will contribute meaningfully to our production plans in 2025 and beyond.\nOperationally, in 2024, we're expected to produce 15.6 to 16 gigawatts of modules. From a sold perspective, we expect to sell 15.6 to 16.3 gigawatts, of which 5.8 to 6.1 gigawatts is produced in the U.S., and 2 to 2.2 gigawatts is seemed to be domestic sales in India.\nFor the full year, we expect to recognize a fleet ASP sold of approximately $0.282 per watt. This includes India domestic sold volume, a non-India base ASP roughly in line with our expectations from our September Analyst Day and the benefit of certain technology, commodity and freight adders. From a cost perspective, full year 2024 cost watt produced is forecast to be in the range of $0.187 to $0.189 per watt, an approximately 2% to 3% improvement versus 2023. This is driven by expected improvements in throughput, yield and reduced inbound freight and variable costs as well as the benefit of an increased mix of lower-cost India production, partially offset by increased costs related to the rollout of our bifacial product.\nAs it relates to cost watts sold, we are forecasting fleet average sales rate, warehousing ramp and other period costs of approximately $0.03 per watt, resulting in a full year 2024 cost watt sold reduction of approximately 7% versus the prior year.\nAs mentioned at our Analyst Day, approximately 3/4 of the cost of our module is derisked given approximately 1/3 of the cost is fixed, and approximately 2/3 of the variable costs are subject to forward contracting, long-term agreements or have contractual mechanisms to pass costs through to our customers in the event that these costs change materially. Additionally, over 95% of our backlog has some form of sales rate protection, leading to significant gross margin visibility.\nFrom a capital structure perspective, our strong balance sheet has been and remains a strategic differentiator, enabling us to both weather periods of volatility as well as providing flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, including funding our Series 6 and Series 7 growth.\nWe ended 2023 in a strong liquidity position and coupled with forecasted operating cash flows from module sales, cash from the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits and anticipated module of prepayments, we expect to be able to finance our currently announced capital programs without requiring external finance.\nAs it relates to our 2024 Section 45X credits, we are forecasting to elect direct payments and are therefore assuming no discount to the value of these credits for a sale to a third party. But we'll continue to evaluate options and valuations for earlier monetization.\nI'll now cover the full year 2024 guidance ranges on Slide 10. Our net sales guidance of between $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion or approximately 46%, which includes $1 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits and $40 million to $60 million of ramp costs. SG&A expenses are expected to total $170 million to $180 million versus $197 million in 2023, demonstrating our ability to leverage our largely fixed operating cost structure while expanding production.\nR&D expenses are expected to total $200 million to $210 million versus $152 million in 2023. R&D expenses are increasing primarily due to commencing operations at our R&D innovation center and perovskite development line and the expectation of adding head count to our R&D team to further invest in advanced research initiatives. SG&A and R&D expense combined is expected to total $370 million to $390 million. Total operating expenses, which include $85 million to $95 million of production start-up expense, are expected to be between $455 million to $485 million.\nOperating income is expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, applying an operating margin of approximately 34% to 35% and is inclusive of $125 million to $155 million of combined ramp costs and plant start-up expenses and $1 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits. Compared to an operating margin of $0.26 in 2023, this year-over-year increase demonstrates how we expect to leverage our business model against a largely fixed SG&A cost structure, which shows the value of growth in driving incremental contribution margin and operating margin expansion.\nTurning to nonoperating items. We expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net to $35 million to $50 million. Full year tax expense is forecast to be $135 million to $150 million. This results in a full year 2024 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $13 to $14. So from an earnings cadence perspective, we're expecting net sales and cost of sales profile, excluding the benefit of Section 45X tax credits, of approximately 15% in Q1, 25% in Q2 and 60% in the second half of the year. We forecast Section 45X tax credits of approximately $190 million in Q1, $230 million in Q2 and $600 million in the second half of the year.\nWith an operating expenses profile roughly evenly split across the year, this results in a forecasted operating income and earnings per share profile of approximately 15% in the first quarter, 25% in the second quarter and 60% in the second half of the year.\nCapital expenditures in 2024 are expected to range from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as we progress the construction of our Alabama and Louisiana Series 7 factories, element throughput upgrades to the fleet and invest in other R&D-related programs. Approximately 2/3 of our CapEx is associated with capacity expansion, and 1/4 relates to our R&D center and technology replication with the remainder mostly related to maintenance and logistics. Our year-end 2024 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion.\nTurning to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand has been solid with 2.3 gigawatts of net bookings since the previous earnings call, leading to a contracted backlog of 80.1 gigawatts. Our opportunity pipeline remains strong with a global opportunity set of 66.5 gigawatts, including mid- to late-stage opportunities of 32 gigawatts.\nWe continue to expand our manufacturing capacity, exiting 2023 with 15.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity and expect to exit 2026 with approximately 25 gigawatts of nameplate capacity, including approximately 14 gigawatts of nameplate capacity in the U.S. We are, as previously announced, adding a new dedicated R&D facility in Ohio, projected to be operational in the first half of 2024, which we believe will allow us to optimize technology improvements with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing models.\nEarnings diluted share was $7.74 in 2023, including the impact of selling our 2023 Section 45X tax credits and the impairment of our investment in Cubic PV, above the midpoint of our initial and Q3 updated guidance. We're forecasting full year 2024 earnings per diluted share of $13 to $14.\nFinally, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion net of debt and expect to end 2024 with a cash balance of $0.9 million to $1.2 billion net of debt. This net cash position, together with optionality around monetizing our 2024 Section 45X tax credits, places us in a position of strength, much to expand our capacity, invest in research, development and technology improvements and a few other strategic opportunities as we march forward on our journey to lead the world's sustainable energy future.\nWith that, that concludes our prepared remarks and over the for questions.

[indiscernible] Website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar, Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2023 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business update. Alex will discuss our financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. There are many factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement as contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At our recent Analyst Day in September, we outlined our goal to exit this decade in a stronger position than we ever did.\nWe believe the future belongs to thin film, and we described our long-term intent to be positioned to serve all addressable markets and commercialize the next generation of PV technology balancing and optimizing across efficiency, energy cost and environmentally and socially responsible way. This long-term aspiration aligns with our near-term growth which is underpinned by our points of differentiation and solid market fundamentals, including continued strong demand for our products, proven manufacturing excellence, a uniquely advantaged technology platform and crucially, a balanced business model focused on delivering value to our customers and our shareholders.\nSince our last earnings call, we have continued to make steady progress on this journey. And I will share some key highlights related to continued strong demand and ASPs, manufacturing, operational excellence and expansion.\nBeginning on Slide 3, we will continue to build on our backlog with 600 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call at an ASP of $0.30 per watt, excluding India. This base ASP excludes adjusters, applicable to approximately 70% of these bookings, which we litaligned with our technology road map may provide potential upside to the base ASP. These bookings bring our year-to-date net bookings to 27.8 gigawatts and our total backlog to 1.8 gigawatts.\nOur total pipeline of future bookings opportunity stands at 65.9 gigawatts, including 32.5 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. As it relates to manufacturing, we produced 2.5 gigawatts of Series 6 modules in the third quarter with an average loss per module of 4.69, a top in class of 4.75 and manufacturing yield of 98%.\nOur third factory, which establishes the template or high volume Series 7 manufacturing continues to ramp, demonstrating the manufacturing production capability of up to 15,000 nodes per day, which is approximately 97% of nameplate throughput. Our third factory produced a total of megawatts in Q3. Total year-to-date production of Series 7 modules in the U.S. has surpassed 1 gigawatt. As noted on our Analyst Day, the factory recently demonstrated a tool lives produced of 550 watts as part of a limited production run. While still undergoing commercial quality qualification testing, this implies a record cattail production module efficiency of 19.7%.\nOur India plant started production in Q3 and is continuing to ramp, recently demonstrating a manufacturing production capability of approximately 12,000 modules per day, which is approximately 77% of the nameplate throughput. Factory 3 produced a total of 154 megawatts in Q3 and recently demonstrated a top module wattage produced of 535 watts.\nIn terms of technology, our Series 6 plus [indiscernible] modules completed rigorous field and laboratory testing. We recently converted our first Series 6 plus plants in Perrysburg, Ohio, to commercially produce the world's first bifacial solar panel utilizing an advanced in film semiconductor\nThe technology features an innovative, transparent back contact pioneered by First Solar's research and development team, which, in addition to enabling by facial energy gain allows infrared wavelengths of light passed through rather than be absorbed as heat, and is expected to lower the operational temperature of the bifacial module and result in higher specific energy yield. Upon successful demonstration of operational metrics and high-volume manufacturing, such as yield and throughput, we plan and to convert more plants in the future, which will enable us to capture incremental ASP through our existing contractual adjusters.\nTurning to Slide 4. Our focus on delivering value extends to our manufacturing expansion strategy. And we are making tangible progress towards achieving our forecasted 25 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity by 2026. And Construction of our India facility is completed and production has commenced. Commercial shipments are expected to begin once the factory receives the Bureau of India Standard certification, remaining government, which is expected by year-end.\nIn September, we mobilized on our new Louisiana manufacturing facility, our fifth fully vertically integrated factory in the United States. At a ceremony attended by the Governor of Louisiana, we set in motion that we're expected to deliver 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, which is anticipated to commence operation at the end of 2025. When completed, we expect $1.1 billion facility is projected to take us to approximately 14 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity in the United States, further enhancing our ability to serve the market with domestically made modules.\nMeanwhile, we continue to make steady progress on the construction of our new Alabama facility, which is expected to commence operation in the second half of 2024 and our Ohio manufacturing expansion, which is projected to commence operation in the first half of 2024.\nAdditionally, our new R&D innovation center and our First [indiscernible] development line announced at Analyst Day are also on track, representing an expected combined investment of $450 million. The prospect development line and R&D center are expected to commence operation in the first half of 2024, and reflect our determination to the lead the industry in developing the next generation of PV technologies, optimizing across efficiency, energy and costs.\nCrucially, as our manufacturing footprint continues to grow, so does our supply chain. In the U.S., we recently expanded our agreement with Vitro Architectural Glass, which is investing in upgrading existing facilities in the United States to produce glass for our solar panels. The expanded capacity commitment from Vitro to First Solar is expected to commence production in the first quarter of 2026.\nToday, First Solar is 1 of the largest consumers of flow glass in the United States. As TV manufacturing continues to scale in the U.S. and the premium that is placed on domestically produced components, including glass, our early work to build a resilient domestic supply chain, which began in 2019, gives us a significant head start over the competition.\nSimilarly, we expect Onco Solar to manufacture and supply Series 7 module back rails through a new facility in Alabama. This reflects our efforts to derisk our supply chain with strategic localization. Onco only uses American make steel, which aligns with our intent to maximize the domestic economic value created by our U.S. manufacturing plan. Generally, our high facility also served by steel value chain that is located within a 100-mile radius of our factors.\nBefore handing the call over to Alex, I would like to discuss our policy environment. In the United States, with regards to the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to await guidance from the Department of Treasury on the Section 45x manufacturing tax credits. We also remain engaged with the administration and continue to work with our customers to ensure that the IRAs domestic content bonus guideline reports the as intent to sustainably grow U.S. solar manufacturing and its supply chains.\nAs we have previously noted, we share our commitment to the current guidance with the administration and are working with our customers to enable their ability to benefit from the bonus credit for using U.S.-made content. We are featured with the work done by the Biden administration to provide a solid legislative foundation or domestic solar manufacturing. ARA has supplied a catalyst for growth, and our goal is to leverage it to help create a position of strength for the country, both now and after the term of the incentives.\nBeyond the ARA, we are also aware of new and dumping and contributed duty positions filed against importers of aluminum extrusions from 15 countries. Consistent with our views on fair trade and the importance of conforming with rules governing trade issues, We will comply with any request for information from the United States Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, while we work to understand the potential implications.\nMoving abroad, we remain engaged with policy measures across Europe as the block attempts to tackle serious challenges to its solar manufacturing ambitions. For example, Chinese module inventory in Europe stored in warehouses across the region and estimated by analysts to reach 100 gigawatts by the end of the year is reportedly being sold at prices below its cost to manufacture.\nThis alleges company behavior driven by our capacity in a Chinese Christmas silicon industry that has estimated international competition over the past decade represents a serious threat to non-Chinese manufacturer and to ambitions of diversifying solar supply chains away from the dependency on China. It also represents a policy threat by underlining the political willingness to deliver the comprehensive trade and industrial legislative solutions necessary to both level the playing field and incentivize domestic manufacturing.\nWe continue to allocate for a comprehensive legislation to safeguard any domestic manufacturing ambitions. Our view is that industrial policy related CapEx benefits alone are inefficient, and that absent sufficient trade policy support to ensure a level playing field, Europe will find it challenging to achieve what the U.S. and India have been able to do in a relatively short period of time.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our bookings, pipeline and third quarter results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Moving on Slide 5. As of December 31, 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion. For September 30, 2023, we entered into an additional 23.6 gigawatts of contracts. We recognized 7.4 gigawatts of volume sold, resulting in a total contracted backlog of 77.6 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23 billion, which equates to approximately $0.296 per watt.\nSince the end of the third quarter to date, we've entered into an additional 4.3 gigawatts of contracts contributed to our record total backlog of 81.8 gigawatts. Improving our backlog since the previous earnings call are contracts approximately 1 gigawatt or more with returning customer long-road energy and new customers, including a new IPP and an asset manager with multiple companies in this portfolio.\nAdditionally, we have received full security against 141 megawatts in previously signed contracts in India, which now moves to these volumes from the contracted subject to conditions precedent grouping within our future opportunities pipeline to our bookings backlog. As noted at Analyst Day, while the ASP associated with these India bookings are lower than those associated with the 6.6 wants of U.S. bookings since the prior earnings call. Gross margin profile, excluding the 45x benefits is comparable to the fleet average given the lower production costs at our TI facility.\nSince the announcement of the IRA, we have amended certain citing contracts to provide U.S. manufactured products as well as to supply domestically produced Series 7 module [indiscernible] Series 6. Consequently, of the past 5 quarters to the end of Q3 2023 plus approximately 11 gigawatts, we've increased our contracted revenue by approximately $354 million, an increase of $42 million from the prior earnings call.\nAs we previously addressed, the substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase base ASP through the application of adjusted if we're able to realize achievements within our technology road map, as the required timing of delivery of the product.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 40.3 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which if fully resized could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.4 million. or approximately $0.01 discussed. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog.\nBoth the ultimate been produced and delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards and the sales increase in sales rate replicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. Our contracted backlog [indiscernible] was production from our India facility is expected to be used to support U.S. deliveries in 2024 or 2025.\nAs regards to Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remains plus, total bookings opportunities of 65.9 gigawatts decrease of approximately 12.4 milliwatts at the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities decreased by approximately 16 gigawatts to 32.5 gigawatts and includes 27.1 gigawatts in North America, 3.8 gigawatts in India, 1.3 gigawatts for the EU and 0.3 gigawatts across all other geographies.\nDecreases in our total mid- to late-stage pipeline in Q2, Q3 results, both by converting certain opportunities to bookings as well as the removal of certain other opportunities given our sold-out position diminished available supply.\nAs we previously stated, given the diminished available supply, the long dated time frame into which we are now selling and aligning customer project visibility with our balance approach to ASPs, deal security and other key contractor terms. We would expect to see a reduction in new booking volumes in upcoming quarters. We will continue to forward contracts with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and value-add differentiation, given the strength and duration of our contracted backlog, we will be strategic and selective in our approach to future contracts.\nIncluding with our [indiscernible] pipeline of 5.1 gigawatts of opportunities that are contract is subject to conditions present, which includes 1.7 gigawatts in India. Given the shorter time frame between contracting and product delivery in India relative to other markets, we would not expect to say multiyear contract commitment recurrence in the U.S. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security in [indiscernible]\nNow on Slide 7, I'll cover our financial results for the third quarter. Net sales in the third quarter were $801 million, a decrease of $10 million compared to the second quarter. Decrease in net sales were primarily driven by lower non-volume revenue associated with project earnouts from our former Systems business, as well as within the module segment, a slight reduction in volumes sold, partially offset by an increase in ASPs as we continue to see favorable pricing trends.\nGross margin was 47% in the third quarter compared to 38% in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher module ASPs, lower sales rate costs with higher volumes of modules produced soley in the U.S., resulting in additional credits from the inflation reduction.\nPreviously mentioned, based on our differentiated vertically integrated manufacturing model, the current [indiscernible] of our modules, we expect to qualify for an IRA credit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module produced in the U.S. and sold to a third party, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the period of sale.\nDuring the third quarter, we recognized $205 million of such credits compared to $155 million in the second quarter. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation the risks related to our receiving the full amount of the benefits we believe we are entitled to under the IRA.\nContinued reduction in our sales rate costs during the quarter reflected improved ocean land rates along with a beneficial domestic versus international mix of volumes sold. Lower sales rate costs reduced gross margin by 7 percentage points during the third quarter and 8 such points of [indiscernible] utilization costs, which include costs associated with operating a new factory, the lower target utilization and performance levels were $25 million during the third quarter compared to $29 million in the second quarter. Costs reduced gross margin by 3 percentage points during the third quarter compared to 4 percentage points during the second quarter.\nOur year-to-date ramp costs are primarily attributable to our Series 7 factory in Ohio, which is expected to reach its initial target operating capacity and this year and our new Series 7 factory in India, which commenced production during the quarter.\nSG&A and R&D expenses totaled $91 million in the third quarter, an increase o $8 million compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expected credit losses associated with our higher accounts receivable balance additional investments in our R&D capabilities, costs relating to the implementation and support of our new global [indiscernible] resource plants.\nProduction starts expense, which is included in operating expenses was $12 million in the third quarter, a decrease of approximately $11 million compared to the second quarter. This decrease was attributable to the start reduction in our factory in India, partially offset by certain start-up activities for our new Series 7 factory in Alabama.\nOur third quarter operating results did not include any significant nonmodule activity. However, the year-to-date operating loss impact from the legacy Systems business related activities remains approximately $22 million. Our third quarter operating income was $273 million, which included depreciation and amortization and accretion of $78 million, round cost of $25 million, production stage expense of $12 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. We recorded tax expense of $22 million in the third quarter, that's tax to $18 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by higher pretax income. Combination of the format items led to third quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.50 per to $1.59 in the second quarter.\nNext turn to Slide 8. discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow commission. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.8 billion [indiscernible] was $9 million at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new facilities in Ohio, Alabama and India, along with a higher accounts receivable balance, partially offset by advanced payments received from the future model sales.\nTotal debt at the end of the third quarter was $499 million, an increase of $62 million from the second quarter as a result of the final loan drawdown and credit facility for our factory in India. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.2 billion to $1.3 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows from operations were $165 million in the third quarter.\nGlobal liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet remains one of our key differentiating factors. However, as discussed at our Analyst Day, the majority of our cash is offshore, while the majority of our forecasted future CapEx spend between 2024 and 2026 is in the United States.\nAs we invest significantly in the U.S. manufacturing ahead of any IRA cash proceeds, we continue to evaluate options on to balance is expected temporary jurisdictional cash imbalance, which include cash repatriation, use of our existing undrawn revolving credit facility or other sources of cap. Whilst we expect our $1 billion of revolver capacity to provide sufficient liquidity, we continue to evaluate other options to optimize cost of capital for any bridge financing.\nOn Slide 9, turn to our guidance update. Our volumes sold and net sales guidance remains unchanged. Within gross margin, we are reducing the high end of our forecasted ramp under the utilization expenses by $10 million between $110 million and $120 million, and narrowing the range of our section 45x tax credit guidance by $10 million, both the low and high end to between $670 million and $700 million. Given their size, these combined changes do not impact our guided gross margin range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.\nWe've reduced our production startup expenses guidance to $75 million to $85 million, which implies operating expenses guidance of $440 million to $470 million Combining these changes provide some resilience to the line of both the operating income guidance range, which is updated to $770 million to $870 million and the earnings per share guidance range, which is updated to $7.20 to $8. Net cash and capital expenditures guidance remained unchanged.\nTurn to Slide 10, I'll sum the key messages from today's call. Demand continues to be robust with 27.8 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, including 6.8 gigawatts of net bookings with our last earnings call at an average ASP $0.30 per watt including India.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing the second quarter 2023 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business update. Alex will discuss our financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With half of 2023 behind us, we continue to see strength in commercial, operational and financial foundations both in 2023 and in the coming years as we continue to grow.\nThe second quarter of the year continued the steady progress established in the first as we ramped up production and delivery of our next-generation Series 7 modules, reinforced our global leadership in thin-film PV with a strategic acquisition and continued our strong bookings and ASP momentum.\nMoreover, continuing our commitment to sustainable long-term growth, earlier today, we announced that we will invest up to $1.1 billion in building a new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in the United States, our fifth in the country. Driven by compelling market fundamentals, supportive trade and industrial policies and robust customer demand, as reflected in our year-to-date bookings total contracted in both backlog and pipeline of mid- to late-stage opportunities, we are pleased to continue to expand and invest in domestic manufacturing in the United States.\nThis new facility is anticipated to be completed and begin production in the first half of 2026 and along with our Alabama facility currently under construction will produce our Series 7 module, which is expected to be a fully domestic product and is determined by the current guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury. This new investment puts us on track to grow our manufacturing footprint to approximately 14 gigawatts in the U.S. and 25 gigawatts globally by 2026, reaffirming the growth thesis we established in November of 2016.\nAs noted on previous earnings call, the position we are in today is enabled by our point of differentiation. Our unique CadTel semiconductor technology, vertically integrated manufacturing process, decision to locate manufacturing close to demand and develop robust local supply chains, and unwavering commitments to Responsible Solar makes us a partner of choice for large sophisticated developers both in the U.S. and internationally. As reflected by our continuing bookings progress since the previous earnings call, this differentiation continues to be a driver of long-term growth and competitiveness, placing us in a position to exit this decade in a stronger position than we entered it.\nBeginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from the second quarter. We continue to build on our backlog with 8.9 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call at ASP of $0.293 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable. Note, for approximately half of this volume, the customer is responsible for the associated freight costs, which are therefore not reflected in booked ASPs. Including typical freight costs, the average ASP across these bookings would increase to over $0.30 per watt. These bookings bring our year-to-date net bookings to 21.1 gigawatts. Our total backlog of future bookings now stands at 78.3 gigawatts, including 48.5 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities.\nAs it relates to manufacturing, we produced 2.4 gigawatts of Series 6 modules in the second quarter with an average watts per module of 4.68, a top bin class of 475 watts and manufacturing yield of 98%.\nAs noted in Q1 earnings call, our third Ohio factory, which establishes the template for high-volume Series 7 manufacturing, began operations in January and is continuing to ramp, demonstrating a manufacturing production capability of up to 13,000 modules per day, which is approximately 84% of nameplate throughput. The factory has produced a total of 425 megawatts in Q2 for a total first half 2023 production of 595 megawatts. The factory recently demonstrated a top module wattage produced of 540 watts, which implies a record production efficiency of 19.3%.\nWe sold 215 megawatts of Series 7 modules in Q2 and are pleased to note that the product is already being deployed in 3 projects: in Arkansas, Arizona and Mississippi.\nStaying on technology. We also announced during the quarter a limited production run of our first bifacial module panels, utilizing an advanced thin-film semiconductor. The module, which is undergoing field and laboratory testing, builds on the track record and energy-advantaged attributes of First Solar successful Series 6 monofacial module platform, and we expect to begin lead line commercial production by Q4 2023.\nNotably, the bifacial model features an innovative transparent back contact. Pioneered by First Solar's research and development team, the transparent back contact in addition to enabling bifacial energy games, allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through rather than be absorbed as heat. This is expected to lower the operational temperature of the bifacial module resulted in higher specific energy yield. We believe that the transparent back contact is a foundational step towards the development of future tandem products.\nSimilarly, our acquisition of Eolar, the European leader in thin-film Synteract technology is also expected to accelerate the development of next-generation PV technology, including high-efficiency tandem devices, by integrating new OR's know-how with First Solar's existing research and development streams, intellectual property portfolio and expertise in developing and commercially scaling thin-film PV.\nMoving to Slide 4. We continue to make steady progress at our manufacturing and R&D facility expansions. Starting with India. Construction of the factory is now complete and preproduction testing of the installed tools is ongoing with the first complete module having been produced in June. We expect this facility to begin production by the end of August this year and when fully ramped, had 3.4 gigawatts of annual nameplate manufacturing capacity for our moat.\nWe're also on track to expand and upgrade our Ohio Series 6 factories to achieve an additional aggregate annual throughput of 0.9 gigawatts with the additional capacity expected to come online in 2024. Similarly, our new Alabama facility is also on schedule for completion by the end of 2024 with commercial operations ramping through 2025. This facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity once fully ramped, increasing our annual nameplate capacity in the U.S. to over 10 gigawatts by 2025.\nAs it relates to our fifth U.S. manufacturing facility announced earlier today, we continue to evaluate exciting options based on the availability of suitable land and related infrastructure, proximity to our supply chains, access to skilled labor and other factors, including the availability of state-level incentives. We expect to announce our location decision shortly.\nOur dedicated R&D facility is also on track with construction well underway and tool sets ordered. As previously noted, this facility will feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, allowing for production of full-size prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules. This, we believe, will allow us to optimize our R&D efforts and progress on our technology road map with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lines.\nNote, since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act approximately 1 year ago, we have committed over $2.8 billion in capital investments into United States across our existing Ohio manufacturing facilities, a new manufacturing plant in Alabama, a new research and development center in Ohio and most recently, our fifth U.S. factory announced today. We expect this will result in the creation of approximately 700 new direct jobs as well as multiples of this number in incremental indirect jobs, including across our supply chain.\nBefore we go to the next slide, I would like to take a moment to discuss the policy environment in our key markets. Starting in the United States. We are appreciative of the work done by the Biden administration to issue IRA-related guidance on Section 48C, direct pay, tax credit transfers and domestic content. We are pleased with the direct pay regulations issued during the quarter, clarifying that a 5-year direct pay period under Section 45x may be elected on a facility-by-facility basis, which will benefit our previously announced factory in Alabama as well as our new facility announced earlier today.\nWe are actively engaged with the administration and working with our customers to ensure that the guidance, particularly with regards to domestic content, will deliver on the IRA's intent to sustainably grow U.S. manufacturing and reshore a vital clean energy supply chain.\nBefore -- more specifically on domestic content, we have shared our comments on the current guidance with the administration and are working to provide our customers with the direct cost information needed to enable their ability to benefit from the bonus credit for using U.S. main content.\nOur U.S.-produced modules are well positioned to enable our customers to qualify for the domestic content bonus credit due to both our vertically integrated manufacturing process for the entire module, including the cell, is manufactured in America and our commitment to investing in domestic supply chains. Today, our U.S. operations use 100% U.S.-made glass and steel among other components.\nAs it relates to trade, we are awaiting the Department of Commerce's final determination in its investigation of Chinese manufacturers accused of circumventing U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties. We believe that the department's investigation is a step in the right direction and sends a clear signal that the United States remains committed to the rules of international trade law and to trade that is both free and fair.\nRelatedly, we applaud the role of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act and its transparency in reporting statistics through a public dashboard. Given the significant undertaking required to execute its mandate under the act, we believe the agency needs to be more adequately resourced to ensure the enforcement is extended beyond the handful of high-profile Chinese solar manufacturers currently being scrutinized. The relatively narrow scope of enforcement would effectively allow lesser-known solar panel manufacturers who may source their polysilicon from the Xinjiang region of China to freely export their products into the U.S. without risk of attention.\nInternationally, we continue to follow policy developments in Europe, where the EU is working towards a path to energy self-sufficiency. While we are cautious in that the market given the recent collapse in polysilicon pricing and the impact that irrationally cheap solar panels driven by oversupply and dumping into Europe may have on the political wellness to deliver a comprehensive legislative solution that both levels the playing field and incentivizes domestic manufacturing.\nWhile we remain engaged with the EU, we are pleased to see its member states move forward with their own plans to reshore solar manufacturing. Most notably, Germany's Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection recently launched a request for expression of interest and a plan to build approximately 10 gigawatts of vertically integrated solar manufacturing capacity in the country. The industry launched the initiative under the Europe's temporary crisis and transition framework, and we intend to submit a nonbinding expression of interest.\nHowever, we continue to hold the position that manufacturing CapEx incentives alone are not an adequately sustainable solution with Europe's challenges. If mechanisms are not put in place for domestic manufacturers to have a sustained level playing field for their capital investments, Erik will find it challenging to achieve what the U.S. and India have been able to do in a relatively short period of time.\nMoving to Slide 5. As of December 31, 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion. Through June 2023, we entered into an additional 13.6 gigawatts of contracted and recognized 4.7 gigawatts of sold volume, resulting in total backlog of 70.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of [ $20.20 ] billion, which equates to approximately $0.296 per watt, an increase of [ $0.08 ] compared to end of year 2022 and $0.028 per watt compared to June 30, 2022.\nSince the end of the second quarter to date, we have entered into an additional 7.5 gigawatts of contracts, bringing our total backlog to date to a record 77.8 gigawatts. Included in our backlog since the previous earnings call are contracts of approximately 1 gigawatt or more with new customers, Capital Power Development and Matrix Renewables USA as well as with a large European customer.\nWe also signed and announced on Geologic Team a follow-on 5-gigawatt deal with Energex Renewables, a leading Israeli developer and repeat customer, 4 gigawatts of which sits within our bookings and 1 gigawatt of which is contract subject to conditions precedent. In addition, we concurrently amended a previously booked deal with Energex, increasing the module ASP and committing to providing U.S. modules for 850 megawatts of their projects.\nSince the announcement of the IRA, we have amended certain existing contracts to provide U.S. manufactured products as well as to supply Series 7 modules in place of Series 6. As a consequence, over the past 4 quarters up to the end of Q2 2023, we have increased our contracted revenue by $312 million across 9.2 gigawatts or approximately $0.034 per watt. Note, we are still progressing additional amendments associated with providing U.S.-manufactured and Series 7 product, which we expect to be reflected in our Q3 contracted revenue backlog.\nAs we previously addressed, a substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters, if we're able to realize achievement within our technology road map as of the required timing for the delivery of the product. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 36.4 gigawatts of contracted volume. With these adjusters, if fully realized, would result in additional revenue of up to $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which would be recognized between 2026 and 2027.\nAs previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog both for the ultimate module bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards, and for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or sales commodity price changes. Finally, this amount does not include any remaining potential higher-rate domestic content price adjustments in excess of the already amended 9.2 gigawatts referenced above.\nOur contracted backlog extends into 2030, including our most recent bookings. And excluding India, we are sold out through 2026. Note some production from India is expected to be used to support U.S. deliveries in 2024 [ and 2029 ].\nAs reflected on Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remains robust with total booking opportunities of 78.3 gigawatts, a decrease of approximately 34 gigawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities decreased by approximately 24 gigawatts to 48.5 gigawatts and includes 41 gigawatts in North America, 5.5 gigawatts in India, 1.8 gigawatts in the EU and 0.2 gigawatts across all other geographies.\nThe decreases in total and mid- to late-stage pipeline from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023 are the result of both converting certain opportunities to bookings as well as the removal of certain other opportunities given our sold-out position and diminished available supply. They also reflect a removal of one large multi-gigawatt, multiyear opportunity, where we were unable to come to terms with the customer. As we previously stated, we will continue to forward contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and value our differentiation. And given the strength and duration of our current contracted backlog, we will be strategic and selective in our approach to future contracting.\nIncluded within our mid- to late-stage pipeline are 6.7 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracts subject to conditions precedent, which include 1.9 gigawatts in India. Given the shorter time frame between contracting and product delivery in India relative to other markets, we would not expect to save multiyear contracted commitments that we are currently seeing in the United States. As a reminder, [ 5 ] contracts in India will now be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake.\nMoving to Slide 7. While we will release our annual sustainability report in the coming weeks, we'd like to take this opportunity to preview a few highlights with you. As we have consistently noted, our commitment to Responsible Solar is not a tagline but our way of doing business. This commitment is underpinned in -- by the belief that solar should never come at the expense of the environment or human rights and drives our company's environmental, social and governance strategy and differentiation. It is this commitment that has driven down our greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced and increased the percentage of women in our workforce in 2022 relative to the preceding year.\nOur achievements build on previous year successes, and we have developed a road map with additional initiatives to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 34% by 2028 and achieve net-zero emissions relative to 2020 by 2050.\nCrucially, we also recognize that we cannot get to net zero without a circular economy. And we continue to make progress on building circularity into our next-generation modules and manufacturing processes from raw material sourcing to high-value recycling with closed-loop semiconductor recovery. This is reflected in the fact that the Series 7 modules designed with sustainability in mind and is our most eco-efficient product to date. It's also reflected in the fact that our new facility in India, which is located in a region of high baseline water stress, is designed to be net-zero water withdrawal PV manufacturing facility, which we believe to be the world's first.\nAs a purpose-driven company, we consistently hold ourselves to a higher standard and proudly set new benchmarks from the hope that by leading by example, others in the solar industry will follow.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q2 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 8, I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $811 million, an increase of $262 million compared to the first quarter. Increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong market demand that led to higher volumes sold, commencement of sales of our next-generation Series 7 modules and an increase in module ASP.\nGross margin was 38% in the second quarter compared to 20% in the first quarter. This increase is primarily driven by the increase in module ASPs, lower sales rate costs and higher volumes of modules produced and sold in the U.S., resulting in additional credits from Inflation Reduction Act.\nBased on our differentiated picture manufacturing model of the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a Section 45x credit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module sold, which is recognized as a reduction in cost of sales in the period of sale. During the second quarter, we recognized $155 million of such credits compared to $70 million in the first quarter. I encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation and risks related to our receiving the full amount of tax benefit we believe we are entitled to under the IRA.\nThe reduction in our sales freight costs during the quarter reflected improved ocean and land rates, the significant reduction in nonstandard charges of container detention and demurrage as well as a beneficial domestic versus international mix of volumes sold. The lower sales for costs reduced gross margin by 8 percentage points during the second quarter compared to 15 percentage points in the first quarter.\nRamp costs, which include costs associated with operating a new factory below its target utilization and performance levels, were $29 million during the second quarter compared to $19 million in the first quarter. Ramp costs reduced gross margin by 4 percentage points in each of the first and second quarters. Our year-to-date ramp costs are fully attributable to our new Series 7 factory in Ohio, which is expected to reach its initial target operating capacity later this year. We also began to expect incurring ramp costs on our new Series 7 factory in India in the third quarter.\nSG&A and R&D expenses totaled $83 million in the second quarter, an increase of $8 million compared to the first. This increase was primarily driven by additional investments in our R&D workforce, our R&D testing costs, additional share-based compensation expense and higher professional fees.\nProduction started expense, which is included in operating expenses, was $23 million in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $4 million compared to first quarter. This increase is attributable to higher preproduction costs at our new factory in India, which will be prepared to start production this quarter.\nOur second quarter operating results included approximately $8 million of nonmodule revenue associated with project earn-out payments from our former systems business. We also recorded a litigation loss of $36 million associated with the dispute with the Southern Power Company related to legacy EPC brings [ to 5 for ] projects in the United States for which we served as the EPC contractor. We are evaluating our options in relation to this litigation. Year-to-date operating loss impact from legacy systems business-related activities was approximately $22 million.\nOur second quarter operating income was $169 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $72 million, ramp costs of $29 million, production start-up expense of $23 million, legacy systems business-related impact of $28 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million.\nWe recorded tax expense of $18 million in the second quarter compared to a tax benefit of $7 million in the first quarter. The increase in tax expense was driven by higher pretax income and lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards with the majority of these awards vest during the first quarter of each year.\nThe aforementioned items combined led to a second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.59 compared to $0.40 in the first quarter. And note growth-related start-up and ramp costs have impacted Q1 and Q2 by $38 million and $53 million, respectively, for a cumulative first half 2023 operating income impact of $91 million.\nNext on to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.9 billion that's $2.3 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new facilities in Ohio, Alabama and India, payment for our acquisition of Vol, partially offset by advanced payments received for future module sales and additional drawdown by India credit facility.\nAs it relates to advanced payments, for substantially all contracts in our backlog at the time of booking, we typically require payment security in form cash deposits, bank guarantees, surety bonds, [ less of ] credit, commercial after credit, parent guarantees, targeting up to 20% of the contract value. Cash deposits, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, totaled approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter and provide a meaningful portion of the financial resources required to fund our existing expansion meters.\nTotal debt at the end of the second quarter was $437 million, an increase of $117 million from the first quarter as a result of the loan drawdown under our credit facility for our factories in India. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors.\nCash flows used in operations were $89 million in the second quarter primarily due to expansion-related activities. Capital expenditures were $383 million during the period. During the quarter, we secured a 5-year revolving credit facility for $1 billion. We're focused on exiting this decade in a stronger position than we entered it, and liquidity is a crucial differentiation we intend to maintain. This facility provides us with the financial headroom and flexibility we need while also balancing our military to grow in response to demand for our technology.\nTurning on Slide 10, I'll discuss full year 2023 guidance. As noted on our February guidance call, given the declining impact of our other segments, we stated that we are no longer providing segment-specific guidance but would note any significant impact to our consolidated financials. As it relates to our legacy systems business, year-to-date, we have seen approximately $20 million of revenue, $14 million of gross profit, $36 million of litigation losses within operating expenses. Direct to our module business, we expect to see approximately $40 million improvement in gross profit relative to our prior guidance.\nGiven their size, these combined numbers do not impact our forecasted revenue and gross margin guidance changes, which remain unchanged. Note, our full year Section 45X benefits forecast of $660 million to $710 million is also unchanged.\nOur operating expenses guidance has increased to $450 million to $475 million to reflect the aforementioned litigation losses. Operating income and earnings per share guidance remain unchanged.\nLike the highlighted in terms of earnings cadence over the second half of the year, we anticipate that volumes sold, revenue, IRA Section 45x benefits will be distributed approximately 40% in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth quarter. With operating expenses approximately evenly split between Q3 and Q4, this implies an expected second half 2023 EPS split of approximately 1/3 in Q3, 2/3 in Q4.\nIncremental capital expenditures of approximately $100 million in 2023 associated with our newly announced U.S. factory are offset by a pushout from the timing of approximately $300 million of CapEx associated with equipment upgrades previous assumed in 2023 into early 2024. Our full year 2023 capital expenditures forecast is therefore reduced to $1.7 [ million ] to $1.9 [ million ]. This reduction in forecasted capital expenditures, combined with an expected increase in deposits associated with future bookings, results in an expected $0.3 billion increase of our forecasted year-end net cash balance, which is now $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.\nDirect our longer-term outlook beyond '23, we plan to hold an Analyst Day at our Ohio campus on September 7 of this year, which from a live webcast.\nTurn to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand continued to be robust with 21.1 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, including 8.9 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, leading to a record contracted backlog of 77.8 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 2.8 gigawatts. Our India, Ohio and Alabama expansions remain on schedule, and we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion in a new U.S. factory office in the country, which is expected to begin production in the first half of 2026.\n[indiscernible] $2.8 billion of capital spending plus manufacturing and R&D in the United States, which we expect will result in the creation of 1,700 direct new jobs and multiples of this number in new indirect jobs.\nFrom a technology perspective, we completed a limited production in a first bifacial solar panel, utilizing our advanced thin-film semiconductor and acquired Evolver, the European leader in thin-film for osg6Itechnology. These investments are expected to accelerate our development of next-generation PV technology, including high-efficiency tandem devices.\nFinancially earned $1.59 per diluted share, inclusive of a legacy systems business-related litigation loss, and we ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of [ $1.9 million ] or $1.5 billion net of debt with additional debt capacity of $1 billion under our new revolving credit facility. We are maintaining our revenue and EPS guidance, including forecasted full year earnings per diluted share of $7 to $8.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks and the call for questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Romero, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2023 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and strategy update Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and including risks and uncertainties related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we noted on our last earnings call, we entered 2023 and its initially stronger commercial and operational and financial position than the previous year, setting the stage for growth and improved profitability in 2023 and beyond.\nThe first quarter of the year reflects this direction as we commission our latest factory in the United States. It started production of our next-generation Series 7 modules. Secured a manufacturing incentive award in India, progressed our technology road map with a new cell efficiency record and continued our strong bookings and ASP momentum. It imports that are pointed to gain from our unique CadTel technology and vertically-integrated manufacturing process to our commitment to responsible solar, continue to set First Solar apart from the competition and are the primary enablers of our long-term competitiveness.\nBeginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from the first quarter. This quarter, we strategically built on our backlog with 4.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call at an average ASP of $0.318 per watt, excluding adjusters were applicable. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 12.1 gigawatts. While at the same time, our total pipeline for future bookings opportunities has grown to 113 gigawatts and includes 73 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. From a Series 6 manufacturing perspective, we produced 2.36 gigawatts of product in the first quarter, with an average [indiscernible] module of [ 467 ], a top [ bin ] class of 475 watts and a manufacturing yield of 98%.\nThis solid performance is the result of a relentless focus on manufacturing excellence. Regarding Series 7, the ramp at our third Ohio facility, which began production in January is progressing well. We produced 170 megawatts in the quarter and recently both demonstrated high-volume manufacturing production capability of up to 10,000 miles per day, which is approximately 60% of nameplate throughput and achieved a production top bin of 535 watts. Developed in close collaboration with EPCs, structured and component providers, Series 7 reflects First Solar's ethos of competitive differentiation.\nResponsibly manufactured in America, largely using domestically sourced components, including American Made glass and steel, and entirely produced under 1 roof. It is optimized for the utility scale market and features a large form factor and an innovative new back rail mounting system. This design is expected to deliver improved efficiency, enhanced installation velocity and unmatched lifetime energy performance for utility scale projects. We are tracking to begin customer shipments as early as June of 2023, and towards that goal, we are pleased to have recently received Series7 IEC and UL product certifications.\nFrom a technology perspective, in Q1, we certified a new world record CadTel cell with a conversion efficiency of 22.3%. Most importantly, this was achieved in our CuRe technology platform, which provides a significantly improved energy profile. In addition, we recently received an award from the U.S. Department of Energy related to our tandem module development.\nMoving to Slide 4. We are pleased with production progress at our manufacturing and R&D facilities expansions. In India and our new Series 7 factory in Chennai, final building and facility works are nearly complete, and the factory has been energized. Tool installation is ongoing, and we received our first incent to operate and expect to begin production and ramping activities during the quarter -- second half, excuse me, of 2023.\nOnce fully ramped, this facility is expected to add 3.54 gigawatts of annual nameplate manufacturing capacity to the fleet. As previously announced, the facility has also been allocated financial incentives under the Indian government's production linked incentive program. First Solar was 1 of only 3 manufacturers selected to receive the full range of incentives, which are reserved for a fully vertically-integrated manufacturing.\nThe incentives are subject to the facility meeting product efficiency and domestic value creation thresholds, which we will evaluate on a quarterly basis beginning in the second quarter of 2026 through 2031. In Ohio, our project to upgrade and expand the annual throughput of our Series 6 factories by an aggregate of 0.7 gigawatts is also advancing. Tools have been ordered and the additional capacity is expected to come online in 2024.\nIn Alabama, our fourth U.S. factory has received its environmental permits and foundation that early factor construction is underway. Tools have been ordered and the facility remains on schedule for completion by the end of 2024, with commercial operations ramping through 2025. When fully operational, these expansions in [indiscernible] Alabama are expected to increase our annual nameplate capacity in the U.S. to over 10 gigawatts by 2025.\nOur dedicated R&D facility has also commenced construction and will feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, allowing for the production of full-size prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules, and we'll provide a means to optimize our technology road map with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lines.\nThis facility is expected to commence operations in 2024. Looking forward, we continue to evaluate the opportunity for further investments in expanding our production capabilities to best serve our key markets.\nMoving to Slide 5. I would first like to draw your attention to a change in the way we present our contract backlog. In the past, we have shown expected module shipments. Going forward, we will show expected module volumes sold, which takes into account the timing of revenue recognition and aligned with volumes sold in contracts with customers for future sales disclosures represented in the 10-K and 10-Q quarterly fillings.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion. Through March 31, 2023, we entered into an additional 9.9 gigawatts of contracts and recognized 1.9 gigawatts of [ volume ] sold resulting in a total backlog of 69.4 gigawatts, with an aggregate value sold of $20.4 billion, which implies approximately $0.293 per watt, an increase of approximately $0.05 per watt from the end of the prior quarter.\nSince the end of the first quarter, we entered into an additional 2.2 gigawatts of contracts bringing our total year-to-date backlog to a record 71.6 gigawatts. During the first quarter, certain amendments to existing contracts associated with commitments to provide U.S. manufactured product as well as commitments to supply domestically produced Series 7 modules in place of Series 6, increased our contracted revenue backlog by $35 million across 8.8 gigawatts or approximately $0.045 per watt.\nSince the second quarter of 2022 and up to the end of Q1 2023, cumulative amendments to existing contracts associated with commitments to provide U.S. manufactured product as well as commitments to supply Series 7 versus Series 6 modules, increased our contracted revenue backlog by $157 million across 4.1 gigawatts or approximately $0.039 per watt.\nSo we are currently processing additional amendments associated with providing U.S. manufactured product, which will be reflected in our Q2 contracted revenue backlog when reported. As we previously addressed, A substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through our application of adjusters, we're able to realize achievements within our technology road map as of the required timing for delivery of the product.\nAs of the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 34.5 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which are fully utilized or realized could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $27 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized between 2025 and 2027. As previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments for the ultimate [indiscernible] in delivered to the customer, which may adjust ASP under the sales contract upward or downward.\nIn addition, this amount also does not include potential adjustments for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or still commodity price changes. Finally, this does not include potential price adjustments associated with the IT and domestic contract provision under the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act. As a reminder, not all contracts include every adjuster described here. To the extent that such suggesters are not included in a contract, we believe that baseline ASP reflects the appropriate risk-reward profile.\nAnd while there can be no assurance that we'll realize adjusters in those contracts when they are presented, to the extent that we are successful in doing so, we could expect a meaningful benefit to our current contracted backlog ASP. Our year-to-date contracted backlog extends into 2029. And excluding India, we are now sold out through 2026.\nRegarding future deliveries. As a reminder, our contracts are structured as firm purchase commitments. In limited circumstances, often related to customer regulatory requirements, or a portion of a large multiyear framework commitments, our contracts may include a termination for convenience provision, which generally requires substantial advanced notice to invoke and features a contractually required termination payment to us.\nThis fee is generally set at a substantial percentage of the contract value and backed up by some form of security. Termination for convenience provisions apply to approximately 1/10 of our entire contracted backlog, with the majority of the applicable megawatts scheduled for deliveries between 2024 and 2025. Should the customer fail to perform under our contract, the ensuing default would in addition to their incurring potential dispute resolution and project financing complications, entitle us to remedies that could include the receipt of the termination of the would include the receipt of termination payment.\nThat said, we and our customers, including many of the largest, most respected developers and utilities in the industry, have long taken a relationship base versus transactional approach to contract. As a result, this year alone, we have booked multi-gigawatt deals with peak customers, including EDP renewables, Lightsource BP and Leeward Renewal Energy. We signed a 2-year 2 gigawatt order announced prior to the call, further expanding our long-standing relationship with us.\nAnd choosing the contract with First Solar, our customers value and prioritize initially more than just the module ASP, including contract integrity, product availability, uncertainty, ethical and transparent supply chain. For First Solar, this approach provides the opportunity to partner with customers who share our values and also provides greater offtake visibility, which helps support our long-term capacity expansion plans. There's a lot bit of interest, which has been validating the path through multiple pricing and supply demand cycles in this industry, inform guys, our commercial strategy of continuing to enter into long-term multiyear contracts.\nAs reflected in Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust with total bookings opportunities of 112.7 gigawatts, and an increase of approximately 20 gigawatts since the previous call. Our mid- and late-stage opportunity increased by approximately 15 gigawatts to 72.6 gigawatts and includes [ 65 ].6 gigawatts in North America, 4 gigawatts in India, [ 2 ] gigawatts in the EU and 0.3 gigawatts across all other geographies. Included within our mid- to late-stage pipelines are 4.7 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracts subject to conditions precedent, which included 1.9 gigawatts in India, as a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our research and development efforts have continued to be the driving force in the enhancement of our technology. In Q1, we established a new world record Research conversion agency for CadTel, achieving 22.3% efficiency, as certified by the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The representing research cell was constructed at our California Technology set.\nNotably, this new record is based on our CuRe technology, which in addition to increase in efficiency as meaningful lifetime energy improvements in real-world conditions, driven by a superior temperature coefficient, best-in-class cell stability, while maintaining First Solar's industry-leading quality and reliability. Our CuRe technology provides or an up to 6% increase in expected lifetime energy relative to our previous record cell technology.\n[indiscernible], the U.S. Department of Energy recently provided 2 grants associated with our industry-leading point of differentiation efforts. These include a $7.3 million award to First Solar to support the development of CadTel tandem module for the residential rooftop segment and a $1.3 million award to the University of Kansas, which is collaborating with First Solar and the Idaho National Laboratory to develop a low-cost next-generation method to optimize solar module recycling.\nBefore turning the call over to Alex, I would like to take a moment to discuss the policy environment in our key markets. In the United States, with respect to the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to await guidance related to the domestic content bonus provision.\nWe believe it is imperative that the United States Treasury Department issued guidance consistent with the congressional intent of the IRA, which is to nurture true domestic solar manufacturing, ensuring a robust domestic supply chain for American [ net ] solar bodies. It is critical to guidance recognized that to qualify for the bonus. At a minimum, the manufacturing of solar cells must occur in the United States. This is not only consistent with clear objective of the IRA, but it's also supported by the legal framework under the Buy America Act Regulations expressly referenced by Congress and the inactive.\nWhile the attend of the IRA and regulations governed and are clear, it is unfortunate that sections of the industry are advocating that treasury grant some form of waiver that would allow bonus credits for solar panels assembled using 4 subcomponents, such as solar cells. We believe that any such waiver runs contrary to the letter of the law and congressional intent. The purpose of the bonus credit is to incentivize domestic manufacturing and the creation of a domestic solar supply chain and not to create an entitlement simply to support foreign manufacturers.\nWith regards to international policy, we are seeing some progress in the EU, which has released its new state aid guidelines in the form of the temporary prices and transition framework, and a draft [indiscernible] this net zero law. The guidelines create the framework for allowing EU member states under certain conditions to match [ aid ] received by clean energy technology manufacturers elsewhere, including under the IRA.\nThe net zero law will establish new ambitions to meet regional needs with domestically produced content, prioritize net zero projects and technologies and address existing issues such as permitting. As previously mentioned, policy, among other considerations continues to influence our evaluation of potential additional manufacturing expansion. Such expansions would require further clarity including in the U.S., satisfactory treasury guidance with respect to domestic content and in Europe, further clarity on EU member states incentives for domestic manufacturing. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q1 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nChief Financial Officer, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. We on Slide 8, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter. Net sales in the first quarter were $548 million, a decrease of $454 million compared to the fourth quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by an expected shift in the timing of module sales as we increased shipments to our distribution centers, both to mitigate logistics costs as well as to align future shipments to customers with contractual delivery schedules, along with the completion of sale of our Luz del Norte project in the quarter.\nThese decreases were partially offset by an expected increase in module ASPs and certain earn-outs on legacy systems projects. Gross margin was 20% in the first quarter compared to [indiscernible]. This increase was primarily driven by expected benefits from Inflation Reduction Act of $70 million and lower sales rate, partially offset by $19 million of ramp costs of our new Series 7 factory in Ireland. Although logistics costs decreased during the quarter, they continue to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. During the first quarter, they reduced gross margin by 15 percentage points. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect to see a reduction in logistics costs [indiscernible].\nAs further described in our 10-Q and most recent 10-K, Inflation Reduction Act of a certain tax benefits for solar modules and solar module components, manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties. As of components, the benefit is equal to $12 per square meter for a PV wafer, $0.04 per watt for a PV cell and $0.07 for a PV module. Based on the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a benefit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module. We recognize these benefits of a reduction to cost of sales in the period of modules of some customers.\nIn the first quarter, 158 megawatts of the U.S. produced volumes sold was produced in 2022 and was not eligible for any of these [indiscernible]. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $75 million in the first quarter, an increase of approximately $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Production sales expense, which is included in operating expenses was $19 million in the first quarter decreased approximately $13 million compared to the fourth quarter, drove by the start of the plant qualification process, a new Series 7 factory in Ohio. Our first quarter operating income was [ $18 ] million, which included depreciation and amortization and accretion of $69 million, production started expenses of $19 million and share-based compensation expense of $7 million.\nWith regard to other income and expense, our first quarter interest income increased by $8 million due to higher interest rates and cash and time deposits. As a reminder, other resumes the fourth quarter included a gain of $30 million in connection with the sale of our Luz del Norte project as far is lenders agreed to give a portion of the outstanding loan balance as part of that transaction. We recorded a tax benefit of $7 million in the first quarter, a tax expense of $1 million in the prior quarter.\nThe increase in tax expense driven by excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards divested during the period, partially offset by higher pretax income. Combination of the aforementioned items led the first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.40 compared to a fourth quarter net loss per share of $0.07. Next on Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $2.3 billion, at $2.6 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new plants in Ohio, Alabama and India and payments for operating expenses, partially offset by a drawdown in our India credit facility and advanced payments received on future module sales.\nAs relates to advance payments, substantially all our contracts in our backlog at the time of booking we typically require payment security and for cash deposits, bank guarantees, surety bonds, letters of credit or [indiscernible] to 20% of the contract value. During 2022, as we start contracting further into the future, we generally started requiring a higher percentage of cash deposits. Reflects our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, these deposits totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of quarter end and are providing a significant portion of the financial resources required on renting expansion efforts.\nTotal debt at the end of the first quarter was $320 million, an increase of $136 million from the fourth quarter as a result of the low drawdown on our credit facility related to the development and construction of a manufacturing facility in India. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.4 billion, $2 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flow use in operations were $35 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $371 million during the period.\nGiven the recent uncertain the banking sector, I would like to note that our investment policy and approach to managing liquidity focused on preservation of investment principle, the media availability of adequate liquidity, followed by return on capital. [indiscernible] this policy, we place our investments for the group of high-quality financial institutions focused on -- creditworthiness and diversification. We do not have cash invested in regional or super regional banks. And in the quarter, we increased our holding in U.S. traders.\nIn addition, we continue to evaluate putting in place our revolving credit facility spot traditional cash management as well as provide short-term optionality. Turn to Slide 9, our full year 2023 guidance is unchanged from previous earnings and guidance call in late February. Let's reiterate that from an earnings payment perspective, as previously noted on our February earnings guidance call, we anticipate our earnings profile will be higher in the second half of the year due to contractual delivery schedules, timing of first sales of our Series 7 products and the timing of recognition of Section 45 [ tax ] benefits, driven by both the timing of volumes sold as well as the inventory lag when my product sold in the early part of 2023 may have been manufactured in 2022.\nFor Series 6, following on the sale of 158 megawatts in Q1 that was not eligible for the Section 45X Tax benefit, we have approximately 50 megawatts of U.S. manufactured product remaining in inventory that is not eligible to Section 45X, substantially all of which is expected to be sold in the second quarter. Regards to Series 7, we expect to begin shipping products from our third Perrysburg factory in June, and therefore, expect to its revenue and Section 45X benefit recognition in the second half of the year. From a volume perspective, we expect first half volumes sold 1.9 gigawatts of sales in Q1, totaled 4.3 to 4.5 gigawatts, flying second half volumes sold of between 7.3 and 8 gigawatts.\nFrom a Section 45x perspective, based on the aforementioned factors, we expect to recognize approximately 25% of our full year guidance in the first half of the year and approximately 75% in the second half. As it relates to our longer-term outlook beyond 2023, we plan to hold an Analyst Day in our Ohio campus on September 7, 2023, which will include a live broadcast. So on Slide 10, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand continues to be robust with 12.1 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, driven 4.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, with average ASP of $0.318, leading to a record contracted backlog of 71.6 gigawatts.\nOur continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 2.5 gigawatts, and our EMEA, Ohio, Alabama expansions remain on schedule. We also achieved a record cash sale conversion efficiency of 22.3% based on our CuRe technology platform. Financially worth $0.03 per share. We ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $2.3 billion or $2 billion net of debt. We are maintaining our 2023 guidance in full, including full earnings diluted share of $7 to $8.\nWith that, we conclude our remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

This call is being webcast live on the investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as its guidance for 2023. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business update, Alex will then discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Following these remarks, Mark will provide a business and strategy outlook. Alex will then discuss our financial guidance for 2023. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We began 2022 with the expectation that it would be challenging from an earnings perspective as we face unprecedented logistics and commodity costs. But we also expected it to be a year of transition, setting the stage for growth and profitability into 2023 and beyond. We entered this year in a significantly stronger commercial, operational and financial position with increased R&D investment, new domestic and international capacity coming online and a new Series 7 product. We also began the year with a record contracted backlog, a significant pipeline of bookings opportunity and a robust demand in our core markets.\nThis momentum is driving our points -- driven by our points of differentiation, including a unique CadTel technology, vertically integrated manufacturing process, domestic production, strong balance sheet and commitment to responsible solar, placing us in a position to respond to emerging opportunities, particularly those enabled by the rapidly evolving policy environment. This momentum is also due to the hard work, commitment and passionate of our associates.\nBeginning on Slide 3, I will highlight some of our key 2022 accomplishments. From a commercial perspective, in 2022, we saw perceptible shift towards long-term multiyear module procurement. This record volume of multi-gigawatt deals spanning multiple years has -- was driven by a combination of competitive pricing, competitive technology, agile contracting, shared values and trust in our ability to deliver the certainty that our customers are looking for.\nAs a result, we had an excellent year from a bookings perspective, securing a record 48.3 gigawatts of net bookings in 2022. This was an increase of 30.8 gigawatts from our prior annual record of 17.5 gigawatts set in 2021. Our total backlog of future deliveries as of today's earnings call now stands at a record 67.7 gigawatts.\nFinancially, while Alex will provide a more comprehensive overview of our 2022 financial results, our full year EPS results came in towards the high end of the guidance range we've provided at the time of our third quarter earnings call.\nWe ended the year with a gross cash of $2.6 billion, or $2.4 billion net of debt, which is an increase to gross and net cash of $800 million versus the prior year. This puts us in a position of strength to expand our capacity, invest in research and development and technology improvements and pursue our strategic opportunities.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, we produced a record 9.1 gigawatts in 2022. Additionally, at the start of 2023, we achieved a significant milestone, producing our 50th gigawatts since commercial production began in 2002. Average watts per module produced in 2022 increased to 462 watts, an increase of 14 watts. And we increased our top production bin from 465 watts in 2021 to 475 watts in 2022.\nWe exited 2022 with 9.8 gigawatts of nameplate manufacturing capacity and last month commenced initial production at our next-generation Series 7 factory in Ohio, which will continue to ramp through 2023. We are also on track to complete the construction and commence the ramp of our Series 7 factory in India during 2023.\nFurthering our manufacturing expansion program, in 2022, we announced a new 3.5-gigawatt Series 7 factory in Alabama and a 0.9-gigawatt increase to nameplate capacity at our Ohio factories. By 2026, we expect U.S. nameplate capacity of approximately 10.7 gigawatts and global nameplate capacity of approximately 21.4 gigawatts.\nWe also announced in 2022 an additional investment and a dedicated $270 million research and development facility to be located near our existing Perrysburg manufacturing plant in Ohio. We expect that this investment will improve cycles of learning and innovation and reduce downtime on our commercial production lines, while allowing us to produce full-size prototypes of both thin film and tandem PV modules.\nStrategically, we were able to largely exit our legacy systems business in 2022, which enables us to focus on our greatest technology and competitive advantages. Alex will discuss potential remaining legacy costs and opportunities related to this business when he provides guidance later in the call.\nLooking forward, we continue to evaluate the opportunities for further investments in incremental manufacturing capacity, including both greenfield expansion and throughput optimization at our currently planned capacity. This evaluation will require, among other things, an understanding of the anticipated IRS and treasury IRA guidelines, including the respect to domestic content as well as confidence in the presence of robust supply chain that supports our expansion objectives. Therefore, no expansion decisions have been made at this time.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'll next discuss our most recent shipments and bookings in greater detail. We shipped approximately 2.3 gigawatts and 9.3 gigawatts for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, respectively, which was within the guidance range that we provided during the third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, we generally define shipments as when the delivery process to a customer commences, whereas revenue recognition or volumes sold occurs at a transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which is commonly upon arrival at destination port or project site.\nWith regards to bookings, we have sustained our recent momentum with 12 gigawatts of net bookings since the third quarter earnings call at an average base ASP of $0.308 per watt. As previously noted, we are seeing a perceptible shift in procurement behavior as evidenced by the volume of multiyear, multi-gigawatt orders placed by our customers.\nSince the beginning of 2022, large developers such as Intersect Power, Lightsource BP, National Grid, Origis Energy, Savion, Silicon Ranch and Swift Current, among others, have placed orders for at least 2 gigawatts. The fact that many of these transactions are with repeat buyers is an indication of the trust and shared values that underpin our customer relations. And it is a clear differentiator from the most -- more transactional approach taken by many of our competitors.\nAfter accounting for shipments of approximately 2.3 gigawatts during the fourth quarter, our future expected shipments, which now extend into 2029, are 67.7 gigawatts. Excluding India and including our year-to-date bookings, we are sold out through 2025. We have, in recent months, pivoted from negotiating solely for 2026 volume to work with customers who are looking to secure multiyear contracts over the remainder of the decade.\nAs a result of this commercial shift, we have not as previously expected as of the third quarter earnings call, fully sold out of our non-India production in 2026. We have sold more volume than previously expected for deliveries in '27 and beyond. In total, we now have 25.5 gigawatts of planned deliveries in 2026 and beyond, an increase of 12.3 gigawatts from our prior earnings call.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2022 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 5, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to the prior quarter. Our module segment net sales were $846 million, an increase of $226 million from the prior period. The increase in module revenue is driven by higher volumes sold, partially offset by a slight reduction in ASPs. The remaining increase in our net sales was attributable to the completion of the sale of our Luz del Norte project in Chile.\nFor the full year 2022, net sales were $2.6 billion compared to $2.9 billion in the prior year. This decrease was driven by $0.4 billion of lower revenue from our residual business operations due to the divestitures of our project development businesses in the United States and Japan, along with the divestitures of our North American and international O&M businesses. The decrease in our Other segment revenue was partially offset by a $0.1 billion increase in our module segment revenue due to higher volumes of modules sold, partially offset by a reduction in ASPs. Gross margin was 6% in the fourth quarter compared to 3% in the third quarter, primarily due to lower module and freight costs, partially offset by a reduction in ASPs.\nFor the full year 2022, gross margin was 3% compared to 25% in the prior year. The full year gross margin was negatively impacted by reductions in module ASPs, the sale of certain projects in the prior year, higher sales rate and demurrage charges and the net impairment in sale of our Luz del Norte project, partially offset by lower module costs.\nSales rate and logistics costs adversely impacted our financial results, reducing gross margin by 19 percentage points in 2022 compared with 11 percentage points in 2021 and 6 percentage points in 2020. Given the recent decline in spot rates and the reversion of the shipping market towards pre-pandemic conditions, we expect sales rate and logistics charges to be less of a headwind in 2023. As a reminder, many of our module manufacturing peers report sales rate as a separate operating expense outside of gross margin. For comparison purposes, we encourage you to consider this factor when benchmarking our module gross margin percentage with our peers.\nSG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $107 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately $11 million relative to the prior quarter. This increase was driven by a $13 million increase in production start-up expense, primarily related to the addition of our third factory in Ohio, which was partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense.\nOur fourth quarter operating loss was $46 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $71 million, production start-up expense of $33 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. Our full year 2022 operating loss was $27 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $270 million, production start-up expense of $73 million, net losses of $48 million associated with the sale of our Luz del Norte project and share-based compensation expense of $29 million, partially offset by a $254 million net gain from the sale of certain businesses.\nWith regard to other income and expense in connection with the sale of our Luz del Norte project in the fourth quarter, the project's lenders agreed to forgive a portion of the outstanding loan balance, which resulted in a gain of $30 million recorded within other income.\nSeparately, interest income in the fourth quarter was $18 million, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior quarter. And interest income for the full year 2022 was $33 million in leases to $27 million compared to the prior quarter. Both increases were driven by higher interest rates on our cash and marketable securities balances.\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $1 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we recorded tax expense of $53 million, primarily attributable to the sale of our Japan project development platform and due to certain losses in Chile for which we no -- which no tax benefit could be recorded.\nFourth quarter loss per diluted share was $0.07 compared to $0.46 in the prior quarter. For the full year 2022, loss per diluted share was $0.41 compared to earnings per diluted share of $4.38 in 2021. Our 2022 EPS result came in above the midpoint of the guidance range that we provided during the third quarter earnings call.\nLet's turn to Slide 6 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. The aggregate balance of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities was $2.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of $0.7 billion from the prior quarter and $0.8 billion from the prior year. Our year-end net cash position, which includes the aforementioned balance less debt, was $2.4 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion from the prior quarter and $0.8 billion from the prior year. The increases in our net cash balance were primarily driven by module segment operating cash flows, including higher advanced payments received for module -- future module sales, partially offset by capital expenditures associated with our new plants under construction in the United States and India.\nCash flows from operations were $873 million in 2022 compared to $238 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were $327 million in the fourth quarter compared to $223 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $904 million in 2022 compared to $540 million in 2021.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Mark to provide a business and strategy update.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Alex. Looking forward to 2023, we are pleased to enter the year with solid fundamentals, including a record backlog of orders and a manufacturing capacity growth plan that is well underway. We are on track to add 6.2 gigawatts of global nameplate manufacturing capacity this year as our new Series 7 factories come online in the U.S. and India. We expect to exit 2023 with 16 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity. We also expect 2023 to be a pivotal year as we build on the foundations established in 2022 to scale manufacturing, invest in R&D and evolve our technology and product road maps.\nIn addition, we expect to begin benefiting from the advanced manufacturing production tax credits provided for under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act. We await IRS and Treasury guidance that we expect will reflect the statute's language and intend to incentivize the domestic production of modules and the related components. Given our fully integrated thin film manufacturing process, we expect that this guidance will entitle us to integrated tax credits for wafers, cells and module assembly, which we estimate will equal approximately $0.17 per watt for modules produced in the United States and sold to a third party.\nFinally, we expect to host an Analyst Day event at our manufacturing facility in Ohio later this year, on a date to be announced, to deliver an overview of our technology, product and manufacturing road maps as well as to highlight our newest Ohio factory.\nTurning to Slide 7. As previously noted, our new Series 7 factories remain on schedule. The U.S. factory commenced initial production in January of 2023 and will continue to ramp over the remainder of 2023. Our India factory is forecast to begin production in the second half of 2023 and ramp into 2024. Once fully ramped, these factories are expected to lead the fleet in terms of module wattage and efficiency and regionally on a cost-per-watt basis.\nBased on our current technology road map, we see the potential for meaningful improvement in our module performance, with a midterm goal of achieving a 570-watt monofacial Series 7 module. As we significantly increase our nameplate capacity, we believe this anticipated growth, when balanced with liquidity and profitability, will drive earnings accretion as contribution margin expansion is leveraged against a largely fixed operating expense structure. As a reflection of this expansion road map and continued optimization of the existing fleet, we have summarized our expected exit nameplate capacity in production for 2023 to 2026 on this slide.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our total bookings opportunities of 93.1 gigawatts remain robust with 58 gigawatts in mid- to late-stage customer engagement. When combined with our current record backlog of 67.7 gigawatts, we believe we are well positioned for growth with a solid foundation of demand visibility. As it relates to converting the pipeline into future bookings, our record bookings in 2022 were driven by the favorable balance of near- to midterm available supply, aligned with customer demand for large volume multiyear procurement. The time line into which we are now selling is longer-dated than historic U.S. sales cycles. As a consequence, this could result in year-on-year reduction in bookings volume as we look to sell long-term forecasted supply in 2026 and beyond.\nOur commercial strategy remains largely focused on supporting long-term multiyear customers who prioritize price and product availability certainty as well as ethical and transparent supply chains. Furthermore, this demand environment supports the rationale of evaluating future capacity growth, subject to the aforementioned considerations related to expansion, including those related to IRA domestic content guidance and the assessment of our supply chain.\nBefore turning the call back to Alex, I would like to take a brief moment to touch on the global policy environment. Broadly speaking, 2022 placed us on the cusp of significant growth in domestic solar manufacturing within our core markets. As policymakers here in the United States and leading democracies abroad demonstrates they are serious about tackling the unhealthy overconcentration of solar supply chains in China and the vulnerabilities that come with it. In fact, 2022 saw industrial policy designed to spur investment and create jobs at scale. The year saw a tangible progress in the U.S. with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, in India with the production-linked incentive program and movement towards spurring domestic manufacturing within the European Union with the introduction of the Green Deal Industrial Plan.\nFurthermore, we've also seen a significant uptick in legislation focused on tackling the issue of forced labor with the passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the United States and similar laws and initiatives, either implemented or under consideration, in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Japan. These significant recent and ongoing policy developments demonstrate that governments around the world are supportive of solar technologies that can be scaled in a sustainable manner for both people and the planet.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Alex, who will discuss our financial outlook and provide 2023 guidance.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before discussing financial guidance, I'd like to reiterate our approach to growth and gross margin expansion. As discussed on our second quarter earnings call, this strategy includes our approach of contracting out our capacity several years in advance of production. The anticipated reduction of our cost per watt produced, the expected benefits from capacity expansion through scaling a largely fixed overhead structure in order to generate incremental contribution margin and our agile contracting approach, both provides the potential realization of incremental revenue and is expected to mitigate freight and certain commodity risks.\nAs we look to 2023 guidance, we continue to see this approach benefiting our forecasted financial results relative to 2022. For the full year, we expect to recognize an average ASP sold of $0.285 per watt, approximately $0.01 higher than in 2022. Looking across the horizon, as is showed in the 10-K filing, as of December 31, 2022, we had a total contracted backlog of 61.4 gigawatts with expected future revenue of $17.7 billion for a portfolio average base ASP of $0.288 per watt, before the application of potential adjusters.\nAs it relates to cost per watt and our contracting approach and their impacts on both the potential value of the technology adjusters, which are reflected in the 10-K filing and our 2023 financial guidance, I'd like to provide a brief update on the timing of our technology and cost road maps. From a technology road map perspective, we continue to work to prove out both bifaciality and our copper replacement or cure program and are progressing well with both initiatives. However, even if ready for high-volume manufacturing deployment, we expect to elect to push out implementation of these technologies across the majority of the fleet for 2 reasons. Firstly, technology implementations typically necessitate manufacturing downtime, both to make tooling and process changes and to conduct preproduction trials. And as we're sold out through 2025 with limited ability to delay shipments, significant downtime would be suboptimal to executing on our delivery commitments.\nSecondly, we typically roll out technology improvements at our Perrysburg facilities and then, once fully optimized, across the remainder of the fleet. This leads to a potential for greater downtime in Perrysburg during initial rollout, which has the highest opportunity cost given the anticipated value of domestically produced modules, both from an IRA domestic content and Section 45X perspective.\nOur new dedicated R&D facility, projected to be operational in mid-2024, is expected to alleviate the need for choosing between downtime and implementation by providing a means to optimize these technology improvements with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lines.\nWith respect to the potential value of the adjusters related to potential future technology improvements, as reflected in the 10-K, the push out of these technology programs will result in a reduction in the supply of products with these technology improvements, leading to an expected reduction in technology adjusters, particularly in 2024 and early 2025. We have correspondingly reduced our estimate for these adjusters from $0.7 billion across 31.4 gigawatts in Q3 to $0.5 billion across 31.5 gigawatts in Q4.\nFrom a cost reduction road map perspective, as it relates to cost per watt produced, we ended Q4 2022 5% lower than Q4 of the previous year, at the midpoint of our original forecasted production range of 4% to 6%. This was due to throughput, yield and efficiency improvements and reductions in variable costs, slightly offset by increases in fixed costs. We've been able to achieve a sustained cost per watt reduction road map over the last several years, having reduced our cost per watt produced by 18% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2022.\nOn a full year 2022 to 2023 basis, we expect a 1% to 2% reduction in cost per watt produced, driven by improvements in throughput, yield, efficiency and inbound freight, partially offset by higher fixed costs and a headwind from the conversion of all production to high mechanical load modules in 2023 to optimize order fulfillment management and logistics. With regards to high versus standard mechanical load modules, we may reintroduce the stand-alone product in future years. And in doing so, we would expect to see a cost per watt benefit.\nAs it relates to exit rates, comparing Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, we're forecasting a cost per watt produced increase of 4% to 6% or approximately $0.01 per watt. This is driven by several factors, including costs driven by the expected implementation of bifaciality at our lead line in Perrysburg in Q4 of 2023, which results in a reduction in front side watts, offset by a higher energy production profile; planned downtime associated with our Series 6 throughput optimization in Ohio; and a headwind associated with our Series 7 factory in Perrysburg, exiting its ramp phase in mid- to late 2023, but not yet operating at full scale by year-end.\nAs it relates to cost per watt sold, we ended Q4 2022 with a 2% year-over-year increase over Q4 2021, in line with our most recent forecast. This was largely due to higher sales freight and logistics costs. In 2023, we expect sales freight and logistics costs to trend back towards pre-pandemic levels throughout the year. Several key metrics, including reliability of schedule, transit times and congestion are currently trending positively. However, transit time volatility generally and labor relations in West Coast ports post potential headwinds. We are working to mitigate these issues through shipping route and port-of-entry optimization and through further utilization of our warehousing network.\nIn addition, as part of our contracting strategy, approximately 67% of our volumes sold in 2023 has some form of sales freight risk coverage. Although given the forecasted reduction in sales freight and logistics costs, we expect limited excess recovery in 2023. On a cents per watt basis, we expect our full year sales freight and logistics costs to be approximately $0.027 per watt, with international transit costs remaining above pre-pandemic norms.\nTaken together, we forecast cost per watt produced, ramp, underutilization and sales freight and logistics costs to combine to yield a Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 net reduction in cost per watt sold of 9% to 11% and full year 2022 to 2023 cost per watt sold reduction of 7% to 9%. On a full year basis, expected ramp and underutilization costs impact our cost per watt sold reduction by approximately 4 percentage points.\nWith respect to other commodities, we continue to largely mitigate exposure to glass costs through strategic long-term, predominantly fixed price agreements with domestic suppliers that have economic benefits to us as we achieve high levels of production. We do expect the near-term volatility in glass pricing, given that the contractual provisions in our supply contracts relating to input cost adjustments operates on a backward-looking basis. And therefore, we are seeing a slight increase in cost in the first half of 2023, which is expected to then reduce in the second half of the year.\nFrom a frame perspective, there's been a reversion of aluminum and steel rates back to historical levels. We expect these costs to be less of a headwind in 2023. Related to framing costs, we have hedged 90% of our aluminum exposure for our Series 6 U.S. plants in 2023, which is approximately 1/3 of our Series 6 production. In addition, substantially all of our Series 7 production, which utilizes a steel back rail, is subject to contractual steel adjusters.\nAnd lastly, with respect to operating expenses, despite a forecasted increase in operating expenses in 2023, particularly related to research and development, we continue to scale manufacturing capacity at a greater rate than operating expenses, leveraging our fixed cost structure to reduce operating expense per watt and increase operating margin.\nSo with this in mind, I'll next discuss (inaudible) 2023 financial guidance. Please turn to Slide 9. Strategically, in 2022, we completed the sales of our Japan project development business, our Japan O&M business and our Chilean Luz del Norte asset. In January of this year, we completed the sale of our 10-megawatt Marikal operating asset in India, bringing our PV solar power systems balance on our balance sheet, as of today, to 0.\nWith these sales, we have effectively transitioned back to a module-only company. We do have certain remaining risks, liabilities, indemnities, warranty obligations, accounts payable, accounts receivable, earn-outs, cash collection, dispute resolution and other legacy involvements related to our former systems business.\nGiven the declining impact of our other segment, we will no longer provide segment-specific guidance, but shall in the future note any significant impact from the other segment to our consolidated financials. As it relates to capacity expansion, our factory expansion and upgrades remain on schedule and are expected to impact operating income by approximately $195 million to $220 million in 2023. This is comprised of start-up expenses of $85 million to $90 million primarily incurred in connection with our new factories in Ohio and India; an estimated ramp and underutilization costs of $110 million to $130 million. We anticipate these expansions and upgrades will contribute meaningfully to our production plans in 2024 and beyond.\nOperationally, in 2023, we're expecting to produce 11.5 to 12.2 gigawatts of modules, and after taking into account reductions in inventory, fell 11.8 to 12.3 gigawatts. From a capital structure perspective, our strong balance sheet has been and remains a strategic differentiator, enabling us both to weather periods of volatility as well as providing flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, including self-funding our Series 6 and Series 7 transitions.\nWe ended 2022 in a strong liquidity position. And coupled with strong forecasted operating cash flows, modular advance payments and our existing India credit facility, we expect to be able to finance our current capital programs without acquiring external financing. We are evaluating putting in place our revolving credit facility to support jurisdictional cash management as well as to provide short-term optionality and expect to address more details on our capital structure and liquidity outlook at our Analyst Day.\nAnd finally, a few words on the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA offers, amongst other incentives, production tax credits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the U.S. and sold to third parties. Although we continue to await guidance from the IRS and Treasury regarding these credits under Section 45X of the statute, based on our view of both the intention of the credit and the language of the legislation, we intend to begin recording a corresponding benefit in our financial statements in Q1 of 2023. Following consultation review with outside advisers, our auditors and the SEC, we expect to recognize these credits as a reduction to cost of sales in the period such modules and the integrated eligible components are sold to customers.\nIn addition, these credits will also be shown as government grants receivable on our balance sheet. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for the risks related to our receiving the full amount of tax benefits that we believe we are entitled to under the IRA.\nI'll now cover the full year 2023 guidance ranges on Slide 10. Our net sales guidance is between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion; gross margin is expected to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, which includes $660 million to $710 million of advanced manufacturing production tax credits under Section 45X of the IRA and $110 million to $130 million of ramp and underutilization costs. SG&A expense is expected to total $175 million to $185 million compared to $165 million in 2022 and $170 million in 2021. R&D expense is expected to total $155 million to $165 million compared to $113 million and $99 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nThe 2023 expense is increasing primarily due to our expectation of adding headcount to our R&D team to further invest in advanced research initiatives. SG&A and R&D expense combined is expected to total $330 million to $350 million. And total operating expenses, which includes $85 million to $90 million of production start-up expense, are expected to be between $415 million and $440 million. Operating income is expected to be between $745 million and $870 million, as inclusive of $195 million to $220 million of combined ramp and underutilization costs and plant startup expenses and $660 million to $710 million of Section 45X credits.\nTurning to nonoperating items. We expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net to $60 million to $75 million, which is predominantly driven by higher expected interest rates for deposits. Full year tax expense is forecast to be $60 million to $85 million. Tax expense for 2023 is largely driven by the U.S. blended tax rate of approximately 25%. However, we also expect a significant loss in the year as we begin manufacturing for which we will not receive a current benefit, leading to a higher effective tax rate. This results in a full year 2023 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $7 to $8.\nNote from an earnings cadence perspective, we anticipate our earnings profile will be higher in the second half of the year, both due to contractual delivery schedules as well as the timing of first sales of our Series 7 products, which are forecast to begin shipping in Q3 of this year. This is forecasted to result in an increase in inventory at our distribution centers in the first half of 2023, which is expected to reverse in the second half of the year. Additionally, Section 45X credits, recognized, will increase after Q1, driven by both the timing of volumes sold as well as the inventory lag, whereby products sold in the early part of 2023 may have been manufactured in 2022.\nCapital expenditures in 2023 are expected to range from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion as we complete the construction of our Ohio and India Series 7 plants, commence construction on our Alabama Series 7 plant, implement throughput upgrades to the fleet and invest in other R&D-related programs.\nOur year-end 2023 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The decrease from our 2022 year-end net cash balance is primarily due to capital expenditures, which we expect will be partially offset by financing proceeds and customer advance payments.\nTurning to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand has been robust with 12 gigawatts of net bookings since the prior earnings call, leading to a record contracted backlog of 67.7 gigawatts. Our opportunity pipeline remains strong with a global opportunity set to 93.1 gigawatts, including mid- to late-stage opportunities of 58 gigawatts.\nOn the supply side, we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to exit 2026 with approximately 21.4 gigawatts of nameplate capacity, including approximately 10.7 gigawatts of nameplate capacity in the U.S. We are, as previously announced, adding a new dedicated R&D facility in Ohio, projected to be operational in mid-2024, which we believe will allow us to optimize technology improvements with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lens.\nWe ended the year with a gross cash balance of $2.6 billion or $2.4 billion net of debt, which is an increase to both gross and net cash of $800 million versus the prior year. We believe this puts us in a position of strength to expand our capacity, invest in research, development and technology improvements and pursue other strategic opportunities. And finally, we're forecasting full year 2023 earnings per diluted share of $7 to $8.\nAnd with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator?"

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2022 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and policy update. Alex will discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier this afternoon, we announced net sales of $629 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.46 for the third quarter of 2022. As noted in our original guidance for the year, 2022 was projected to be challenging from an earnings standpoint, but we continue to maintain an unwavering focus on the future, setting the stage for long-term growth and profitability.\nBeginning on Slide 3. Our strong bookings momentum has continued into the second half of the year. With 16.6 gigawatts of new bookings since our last earnings call, which have a base ASP of $0.316 per watt before the application of potential adjusters and total year-to-date bookings of 43.7 gigawatts, our total backlog of future deliveries now stands at a record 58.1 gigawatts and includes orders for delivery as far into the future as 2027.\nThe continued long-term demand for our products and the fact that our technology is expected to serve as the backbone for many of our customers' long-term growth plans is a testament to First Solar's strong fundamentals, [grounding] our commitment to the principles of responsible solar, our differentiated technology platform, our balanced approach to growth, liquidity and profitability, and our ability to provide a U.S. technology and manufactured product.\nIn the third quarter, our manufacturing facilities produced 2.4 gigawatts of modules, and we shipped 2.8 gigawatts. Although showing signs of recent easing, the overall shipping and logistics environment remains challenging. Alex will later discuss the impact of this on our Q3 results and full year guidance.\nManufacturing performance metrics remain consistent across our existing fleet, and construction of our third manufacturing facility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India remains on schedule. During the quarter, we announced 4.4 gigawatts of additional U.S. manufacturing capacity. And today, we announced an additional investment into a dedicated R&D research facility to be located here in the U.S., near our existing manufacturing facility in Perrysburg, Ohio.\nFinally, as it relates to our legacy systems business, we have completed the previously disclosed sale of our operations and maintenance platform in Australia and Japan. And this week, we signed a sale and purchase agreement for our Luz del Norte project in Chile.\nTurning to Slide 4. With regards to our manufacturing capacity and as announced in August, we are investing approximately $1.2 billion in scaling our U.S. manufacturing footprint. Driven by robust demand for our module technology as well as U.S. manufactured product, we expect this will expand our domestic nameplate capacity to approximately 10.7 gigawatts in 2026. Up to approximately $200 million will be spent to upgrade and expand our Ohio manufacturing footprint at both our current operating facilities as well as our third factory, which is currently under construction and scheduled to come online in the first half of 2023.\nAs a result of this expansion, we believe our Ohio nameplate capacity will increase by almost 1 gigawatt to just over 7 gigawatts by 2025. Approximately $1 billion will be invested to build a new factory, our fourth in the United States, representing an additional 3.5 gigawatts of Series 7 nameplate capacity. This facility is expected to commence operation in 2025. We continue to evaluate several possible sites across the Southeast and expect to announce the location in the coming weeks.\nBeyond this, we continue to evaluate the opportunity for further investments in incremental manufacturing capacity, including throughput optimization of our current planned capacity. In addition, we are evaluating capital investments to support the advancement of our R&D initiatives. In the United States, the enhancement -- the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act with both supply side manufacturing and production tax incentives as well as demand drivers, including the expansion of investment and production tax credits for solar and clean hydrogen, provides the long-term clarity necessary to support investments in manufacturing.\nIn India, we continue to see a supportive policy environment given the decisive decisions by the government to diversify and grow domestic capabilities to avoid deeper dependencies on an unreliable, volatile and high-risk supply chain.\nIn Europe, we continue to work with stakeholders to advocate for long-term manufacturing and supply chain strategies that would enable us to support the energy needs of America's allies with local manufacturing, responsibly produced solar technology.\nWe recently joined other leaders in the European Union to provide high -- to highlight the PV supply chain, the need for decisive actions from the EU if it wishes to deliver on its goal to scale manufacturing across the block by 2025. While our immediate focus on scaling our announced factories in the U.S. and India, we remain committed to exploring the long-term potential for further geographical diversification, contingent upon a supportive local policy and demand environment.\nWith regard to research and development, today's announcement of an approximately $270 million investment will support a 1.3 million square foot dedicated R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio, which pending final approval of various state, regional and local incentives, is expected to be completed in 2024.\nCurrently, our R&D programs require transferring potential product advancements developed on specialized product development lines located in our California and Perrysburg laboratories to high-volume manufacturing conditions by running engineering test authorizations, or ETAs, on our existing commercial production lines in Ohio. Using these production lines increases operational complexity as well as limit cycles of learning. In addition, the combination of a larger form factor module, increased module throughput and a recently enhanced production-based policy incentives has significantly increased the opportunity cost of the downtime required to run ETAs on existing high-volume manufacturing lines.\nThis new facility will feature a pilot manufacturing line allowing for the production of full-size prototypes of both thin film and tandem PV modules. Creating a sandbox separate from commercial manufacturing operations is expected to reduce operational complexity, reduce costs, allow us to accelerate our rate of learnings, solidify our leadership in current and next-generation technologies.\nTurning to Slide 5. As previously mentioned, we booked 16.6 gigawatts since the July earnings call, bringing our year-to-date bookings to 43.7 gigawatts. With respect to future shipments, after accounting for shipments in the quarter of 2.8 gigawatts, which was in line with our expectations, our total contracted year-to-date backlog is 58.1 gigawatts.\nNote, while we have contracted volume for India, we have not recognized this volume in our backlog. Excluding our new India manufacturing facility, we are sold out for 2024 as of the July earnings call. As of now, we are sold out for 2025 and close to selling out for 2026. Note, we anticipate having '26 sold out by the end of the year as we have a number of contracts in late-stage negotiations.\nAs we transact further into the future, we are pleased with the pricing trajectory of our technology. The 16.6 gigawatts of bookings since our prior earnings call in July have a base ASP, excluding adjusters where applicable, of $0.316. Note, approximately 40% of this volume is reflected in the Q3 backlog number in the 10-Q.\nDuring the third quarter, certain amendments to existing contracts associated with commitments to provide U.S. manufacturing products as well as commitments to supply Series 7 versus Series 6 modules increased our contracted revenue backlog by $52 million across 1.4 gigawatts or approximately $0.037 per watt. As of Q3, the average portfolio base ASP reflected in the revenue from contracted footnote in the 10-Q increased approximately $0.012 versus the second quarter end.\nAs we previously addressed, a substantial portion of the overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through applications of adjusters if we're able to achieve certain achievements within our technology road map. As of the end of the third quarter, we have approximately 31.4 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which, if realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized between 2024 and 2026.\nAs previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments for the ultimate module being delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards. In addition, this amount does not include potential adjustment for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. Finally, this does not include potential price adjustments associated with the ITC domestic content provision under the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act.\nAs a reminder, not every contract includes every adjuster described here. To the extent that such adjusters are not included in a contract, we believe the baseline ASP reflects an appropriate risk/reward profile. And while there can be no assurances that we will realize adjusters in those contracts where they are present, to the extent we are successful in doing so, we would expect a meaningful benefit to our current contracted backlog ASP.\nOur recent bookings, which include large headline numbers ranging from 0.7 to 2 gigawatts, including a number of significant transactions with existing customers, such as Arevon, Silicon Ranch and Swift Current Energy in the United States. The same is true where Azure Power, who has worked with First Solar for over a decade, signed an agreement for 600 megawatts as the first customer to contract for offtake from our new facility in Chennai.\nNote, as mentioned during our prior earnings call in July, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. As such, deals signed but not fully secured included in this agreement with Azure Power will be reflected within the confirmed but not booked portion of our pipeline graph in the earnings presentation.\nAs reflected on Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust. Even at year-to-date bookings of 43.7 gigawatts, we retain total booking opportunities of 114 gigawatts. Our 71 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities include 62.5 gigawatts in North America, 4 gigawatts in India and 3.3 gigawatts in the EU. Even with our 16.6 gigawatts of bookings since our prior earnings call, our pipeline of mid- to late-stage opportunities has expanded by 52.8 gigawatts since the prior quarter.\nIn addition to previously noted demand drivers, including customers' need for certainty around technology, supplier integrity and our ability to stand behind our contracts and deliver on our commitment, demand has been further catalyzed by the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act. For many customers, this legislation has provided visibility into supportive long-term policy environment through the extension of the solar investment tax credit, the introduction of the production tax credit for solar and similar incentives with respect to green hydrogen.\nAs a consequence, we are seeing increased demand from both existing and potential new customers and included in our pipeline are several opportunities with multiyear, multi-gigawatt volumes.\nTurning to technology. We continue to make steady progress with our current road map as we worked on the operational and market readiness of our next-generation Series 7 modules. Our new Ohio facility, which will be the first in our fleet to produce this product, is on track to commission in the first half of 2023. Early test runs of the semiconductor deposition equipment performed as anticipated with full-size Series 7 samples delivering efficiency equivalent to the currently lined modules. The Series 7 module has been developed in close collaboration with EPCs, structure and component providers, and the product has benefited from working over the past year with our partners, including Array Technologies and Nextracker, to develop mounting solutions.\nTheir work, along with the support of our customers' EPC partners, is expected to help ensure the product ecosystem is ready and optimized for install costs once Series 7 enters the market. Additionally, we have continued to make progress advancing our CadTel bifacial modules based on our Series 6 platform and expect to launch a pilot production scale run before the end of this year and a small-scale infill deployment with a strategic customer as early as the first quarter of next year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q3 2022 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 7, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the third quarter. Net sales in Q3 were $629 million, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior quarter. On a segment basis, our module segment net sales in Q3 was $620 million compared to $607 million in the prior quarter. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher module volumes sold from our plants in Malaysia and Vietnam. .\nGross margin was 3% in Q3 compared to negative 4% in the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impairment of the Luz del Norte project in the prior quarter. Our Q3 module segment gross margin of 4%, down from 5% in Q2 2022, was negatively impacted by 2 key sales freight logistics items, partially offset by lower module costs and reductions to our warranty and module collection recycling liabilities.\nFirstly, with respect to sales freight, while spot rates have begun to ease significantly in recent weeks, higher sales freight charges under shipping contracts entered into at the beginning of the year continued to put pressure on our costs to deliver products during the quarter.\nSecondly, with respect to logistics, we experienced an unforeseen demurrage charge of approximately $30 million. But what about this charge, which is a discrete variable cost outside of the freight rate paid for transoceanic shipping? Demurrage charge are excess storage fees charged as a result of containers and modules remaining in port beyond a contractually agreed period. Whilst the shipping environment over the past 2 years has largely been characterized by container shortages and transit times well above prepandemic norms, the recent significant reversal in vessel waiting times and container turnaround times, though welcomed on a long-term basis if sustained, has created near-term logistical challenges.\nIn particular, during the third quarter, dramatically improved transoceanic transit times resulted in product delivered to port significantly ahead of both our expectations and contracted customer delivery dates, which drove a significant increase in demurrage charges as we waited for the customer site delivery window to open. Long term, we believe our strategy of increasing manufacturing capacity approximate to demand reduces the need for and risks associated with transoceanic shipping.\nIn total, total sales freight and unforeseen logistical costs included in our cost of sales reduced our module segment gross margin by 23 percentage points in Q3 compared to 16 percentage points in the prior quarter.\nSG&A and R&D expenses totaled $76 million in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $12 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher share-based and incentive compensation and higher legal expenses.\nProduction start-up, which is included in operating expenses, totaled $20 million in the third quarter, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased start-up costs associated with our third Ohio factory. Q3 operating loss was $68 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $67 million, production start-up expense totaling $20 million and share-based compensation of $12 million, partially offset by a $6 million gain on the sale of our Australia and Japan operations and maintenance platforms.\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $13 million in the third quarter compared to tax expense of $84 million in the prior quarter. Decrease in tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in our pretax income, certain losses in Chile in Q2, for which no tax benefit can be recorded, and a Q2 discrete expense related to the reevaluation of Vietnam deferred tax assets due to receipt of a high-tech incentive certificate. Combination of the aforementioned factors led to a Q3 loss per share of $0.46 compared to a Q2 earnings per share of $0.52 on a diluted basis."

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin.\n\nRichard Romero\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing a second quarter 2022 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter, provide a guidance update and also provide some insight into our pricing strategy and our vision for gross margin expansion. Mark will then provide perspective on the domestic and international policy environment. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions.\nPlease note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. To begin, we are pleased with our second quarter results, including earnings per share of $0.52. This result was benefited by the previously announced closing of the sale of our project development platform in Japan, partially offset by an impairment of the legacy system business project in Chile, which will be discussed later during the call.\nWe've also continued our booking momentum, further strengthening our backlog of future expected deliveries, which now stands at a record 44.3 gigawatts. The 10.4 gigawatts of new bookings since our prior earnings call in April are mostly for deliveries in 2024 to 2026 timeframe and have a base ASP, excluding adjusters of $0.301. These new deals bring our total year-to-date bookings to 27.1 gigawatts. From an ASP perspective, we are encouraged by the pricing trajectory of our bookings as we continue to transact for deliveries as far out as 2026. On an overall portfolio basis, the profile of our annual base contracted ASPs remained effectively flat from 2022 through 2025 with the potential to grow with the application of technology, sales freight and commodity price adjusters applicable to many of these bookings.\nFirstly, as it relates to technology adjusters, if we are able to realize the achievements within our technology road map, the ASP has potentially increased to reflect the value associated with the enhanced product and energy profile. As of June 30, we had approximately 20.5 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which, if realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.4 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which would be recognized in 2024 and 2025.\nAs previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments for the ultimate module bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards or for those contracts in the United States that include sharing related to potential upside for U.S. main modules under the extension of the investment tax credit.\nSecondly, the ASP may increase to offset incremental costs as it relates to sales freight. Thirdly, the ASP has also potentially increased to offset incremental costs as it relates to aluminum.\nWith regards to our Series 7 product to be produced at our new factories in Ohio and India, featuring a glass area of approximately 14% larger than our Series 6 Plus modules and utilizing the steel as opposed to aluminum frame, we have also begun to introduce adjusters to offset potential increased steel costs.\nAs a reminder, not every recent contract includes every adjuster described here. To the extent that such adjusters are not included in the recent booked contract, we believe the baseline ASP reflects an appropriate risk/reward profile. For example, some of these contracts have delivery terms where the customer is responsible for the cost of sales freight from the factory gate.\nIn summary, we continue to leverage our value proposition of providing our customer and partners with long-term supply certainty, lower political and compliance risk and access to our best available technology. These critical points of differentiation, together with our differentiated CadTel technology, have allowed us to continue to expand our record backlog and an overall pricing that we believe is both encouraging and competitive and with appropriate risk mitigation.\nTurning to Slide 3. I'd like to review our highlights and some updates from our second quarter. Our manufacturing facilities produced 2.2 gigawatts of modules in Q2. The result was benefited by higher throughput due to faster-than-expected upgrades of certain equipment at our Vietnam manufacturing facilities.\nAs previously disclosed, we have completed the sale of our project development platform in Japan. As we seek to divest our remaining power plant assets, we are evaluating potential buyers for our Luz del Norte project in Chile. Alex will discuss the timing and financial impact of this potential transaction.\nConstruction of our third manufacturing facility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India remains on schedule. To date, we have seen increased -- increases associated with steel and freight costs. Looking forward, as we continue to explore further manufacturing expansion opportunities, inflationary pressures on building equipment and freight costs are expected to remain a concern.\nFinally, we've entered into a $500 million debt facility with our new -- for our new manufacturing facility in India, with the first disbursement expected in the third quarter.\nBefore turning to shipments, I would like to say a word about the current sales freight environment. While there are reports that suggest supply chains are beginning to trend towards normalization on a macro basis, global sales freight conditions remain challenging. Although spot rates for ocean freight have fallen quarter-over-quarter, these benefits were partially offset by increased fuel costs. In addition, we are approaching the peak period in terms of delivery of goods ahead of the year-end holiday season, which represents a potential headwind that may render the recent easing in the shipping rates a temporary phenomenon.\nFrom a logistics perspective, we are still experiencing the impact of port congestion. In the United States, after a brief reprieve, we have seen a continuous buildup of congestion on the East Coast as some shippers divert away from the West Coast port to avoid the potential impacts of ongoing labor negotiations.\nFor example, the queue of ships looking to berth at the Port of Savannah has recently increased to 30 vessels, up from 0 in the previous quarter. While transit times from Asia to the United States have improved, they remain well above the prepandemic averages. In fact, combined with challenges such as port congestion and blank sailings, has led to an estimated 12% reduction in global shipping capacity.\nNotwithstanding these challenges, we continue to execute on our strategy of employing freight risk-sharing mechanisms in our customer contracts, with nearly all of our recent bookings, either featuring contractual adjusters designed to offset incremental sales freight cost. We're allocating all ocean freight responsibility to the customer, in either case mitigating gross margin erosion.\nAs of today, we have 32.7 gigawatts of contracts in our backlog that with either sales freight coverage or no sales freight exposure. As you may expect, contracts where customers take on responsibility for the transport have lower ASP than those where we are responsible for shipping. By way of example, one such contract, which is included in the revenue from contracts from customers' footnote in the quarter's 10-Q, is a 2.3 gigawatt sale to a highly valued long-term partner. This volume targeted for low-bid inventory is contracted to supply from our international factories, with the customer being responsible for transportation, which is currently estimated to be $0.04 to $0.05 per watt. Therefore, the ASP for this transaction is lower than the average of the ASP for other sales contract entered into in the period.\nNote: 4.9 gigawatts of the 11.9 gigawatts, increase in contracts from customers for future sales, includes -- included in the revenue from contracts from customers' footnote in this quarter's 10-Q requires that customers take on the responsibility for shipping. Had First Solar had the shipping responsibility, we estimate that the implied ASP of this 10 -- 11.9 gigawatts volume increase would have risen by approximately $0.02 per watt.\nOf note, we expect the majority of our India factory output to be contracted on an ex works basis, with the customer picking up modules at the factory gates and assuming all transportation costs. Accordingly, we believe headline ASPs in India will be lower than in other markets where we include an assumption of sales freight within the ASP. That said, Alex will address why we expect gross profit per watt for the India factory to be equal or higher than the fleet later in the call.\nTurning to Slide 4. We address our recent shipments. As just mentioned, we booked 10.4 gigawatts since the April earnings call. With respect to future shipments after accounting for shipments in the quarter of approximately 2.5 gigawatts, which is in line with our expectation, our total contracted to-date backlog is 44.3 gigawatts.\nWe are sold out for 2022 and '23 as of April's earnings call and now sold out for 2024, excluding our new India manufacturing facility. We have 12 gigawatts for planned deliveries, excluding India, in 2025 and have 2.6 gigawatts of planned deliveries in 2026 and beyond.\nAs it relates to our India factory, we have seen significant near- and longer-term demand from domestic customers as we anticipate entering into first contracts for the output of this factory within the coming months. Under our bookings policy, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. As such, deals signed but not fully secured will be reflected with confirmed but not booked portion of our pipeline graph in the earnings presentation.\nThe 10.4 gigawatts booked since April's earnings call include an order for 2.4 gigawatts of modules of one of the largest -- one of our largest standing customers, U.S. headquarter, Intersect Power, announced earlier today. These modules are scheduled for delivery in 2025 to 2026, further expanding the horizon for our backlog.\nThis booking is reflective of a broader trend among long-standing U.S.-based customers to strengthen their commitment to First Solar's CadTel thin film technology as they seek long-term pricing security, supply certainty and value for their project pipeline.\nWe are seeing greater geographical diversity in our bookings and among customers negotiating long-term framework supply agreements. Notably, European developers are increasingly recognizing the risk of relying on supply chains that are concentrated in China.\nAs just one example, the French developer, Akuo, which has placed an order for 500 megawatts for its project portfolio in the U.S. and in Europe. Our bookings momentum demonstrates the growing recognition of the risk of pursuing a solar at any cost strategy. Developers that have built excessive dependencies on China state-subsidized solar industry are grappling with an increasing volatile pricing and supply environment. A prime example of this increased risk profile is a recently reported lawsuit filed against a top-tier Chinese solar manufacturer, alleging breached delivery obligations, fraud, fraudulent actions and breached agreements related to product traceability information.\nThis direct contrast with the experience of our customers who have benefited from our emphasis on durable partnerships has enabled long-term growth and our ability to stand behind our contracts and deliver on our commitments. Our customers have also benefited from an industry-leading approach to sustainability, transparency and traceability.\nWe believe that our focus on long-term partnerships and our focus on basing of an enduring strategic customer that seeks to partner with First Solar for a large-scale multiyear procurements have been key drivers of our success, and it enabled a solid foundation for growth. We also believe that these strategies set us up for enduring success, differentiating ourselves from the highly volatile transactional environment that some of our competitors may operate in and providing longer-term stability and visibility, not just for our customers, but for our shareholders.\nAs reflected on Slide 5, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust. Even at the year-to-date bookings of 27.1 gigawatts, we retain long-term total bookings opportunities of 52.5 gigawatts. Our 17.8 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities include 9.7 gigawatts in North America, 3.9 gigawatts in India and 4.2 gigawatts in the EU.\nIn India, we continue to see meaningful potential as it relates to demand from domestic developers, foreign owned IPPs operating in the country and the Indian government's efforts to boost demand certainty for domestic manufacturers. Similarly in Europe, we are seeing growing demand where geopolitics and the war in Ukraine have led to an urgent effort to deploy more renewables as the EU works to diversify its energy portfolio.\nTurning to technology. We are pleased with the progression of our current road map. As previously stated, our road map provides us with a high level of optionality, allowing us to pursue enhancements to our product design and energy profile as well as the path to potentially offer a true next-generation solar module for the residential market.\nOn the last earnings call, we had announced that our R&D teams are continuing to make progress on developing the bifacial attributes of our CadTel semiconductor as we reaffirm the commercial, financial and operational thesis of the bifacial product. As our bifacial program evolves from the research level to large preproduction runs, our R&D team is working to achieve field validation, including operational and reliability data. This is necessary to ensure a viable path to large-scale commercial manufacturing.\nIn parallel, we are working to stand up the supply chain necessary to help support the eventual introduction of a bifacial CadTel module. While we expect manufacturing line modifications to be minor, a bifacial CadTel module will have different material requirements necessitating adjustments to our supply chain.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss Q2 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before reviewing our Q2 results, on Slide 6, I'd like to provide an overview of 2 events, which impact both this quarter's results as well as our full year outlook. Both relate to our legacy systems business and impact our non-module or other business segment.\nThe first is the recently completed sale of our Japanese project development platform and the pending sale of our Japanese O&M platform. This was first discussed in our Q4 2021 earnings and guidance call. In late 2021, we received an unsolicited offer to acquire our Japanese project development and O&M platforms. And our full year 2022 guidance assumed a gain on the sale of these businesses of $270 million to $290 million.\nOn our Q1 2020 earnings call in April, we indicated that negotiations towards the sale were progressing well. In May of this year, we entered into definitive agreements to sell these businesses to PAG Real Assets, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAs previously disclosed and mentioned by Mark earlier in the call, in June, the conditions related to the sale of the project development platform were met. And accordingly, we closed the sale of that business for gross proceeds of JPY 66 billion, including a gain on sale of JPY 33 billion. These results were in line with the assumptions included in our full year guidance. However, due to the sudden and significant weakening of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar that has taken place in 2022 largely as a function of the contrast between the Bank of Japan's continued commitment to economic stimulus and the tightening of U.S. monetary policy, the U.S. dollar gain on sale of $245 million was $35 million lower than the midpoint of our previous forecast.\nFrom a cash perspective, we received net cash proceeds in Q2 of [$262] million with an additional [$164] million forecasted to be received within the calendar year. And note, the remaining conditions precedent to close the sale of the Japan O&M platform, including regulatory approvals, receipt of third-party consents and other customary closing conditions, are expected to be met in the second half of 2022.\nThe second event impacting both Q2 results and full year guidance relates to our 141-megawatt Luz del Norte project located in Chile. As disclosed since last year's second quarter 10-Q filing, we've continued to evaluate whether to hold or pursue a sale of the project. We also noted that should we be unable to recover our net carrying value in the project, any future sale could result in an impairment charge. Given that no decision had been made with regards to a sale, no impact from any potential sale was included in our 2022 guidance.\nIn cooperation with the project lenders, we've recently begun a sale process, and in Q2, received multiple nonbinding bids to acquire the Luz del Norte project. Based on analysis of these bids, in Q2, we recorded a pretax impairment in cost of sales of $58 million and additional tax expense of $23 million associated with the Luz del Norte project.\nAs it relates to the full year, assuming a sale is completed later this year, in line with the bids received to date, we expect revenue of $150 million to $200 million from the sale, a reduction in gross profit of $40 million to $50 million, including the Q2 impairment net of future proceeds from the sale, a $30 million to $35 million benefit to nonoperating income from debt forgiveness and reduced interest expense, and $30 million to $40 million of tax expense due to the generation of net operating losses, which no future benefit we received and the jurisdictional mix of the income amongst our Chilean entities.\nThe total net impact from the expected sale of Luz del Norte, which was not previously assumed in our guidance for the year, is a $10 million to $15 million loss before taxes and a $40 million to $55 million loss on a post-tax basis, equivalent to an implied loss per share of $0.38 to $0.52. Note that given the early stages of the sale process and uncertainty around the ultimate structuring of any potential sale, although we believe the forecasted range for revenue, pretax losses, tax expense and after-tax losses to be appropriate, there remains significant uncertainty related to the impact of the gross profit and nonoperating income lines of the P&L.\nWith this background, starting on Slide 7, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the second quarter. Net sales in Q2 were $621 million, an increase of $254 million compared to the prior quarter. On a segment basis, our module segment revenue in Q2 was $607 million compared to $355 million in the prior quarter. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher module volumes sold and also benefited by sales freight recoveries.\nGross margin was negative 4% in Q2 compared to positive 3% in the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impairment of the Luz del Norte project, which impacted gross margin by 9 percentage points. Q2 module segment gross margin of 5%, up from 3% in Q1, was positively impacted by increased volumes sold. Additionally, sales freight included in our cost of sales reduced module segment gross margin by 16 percentage points in Q2 compared to 14 percentage points in the prior quarter.\nSG&A and R&D expenses totaled $64 million in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter. Production startup, which is included in operating expenses, totaled $13 million in the second quarter, an increase of $6 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased startup costs associated with our third Ohio factory.\nWe recorded the aforementioned $245 million gain on sale associated with the closing of the sale of the project development platform in Japan. Q2 operating income was $145 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $67 million and the utilization of production startup expense totaling $17 million, share-based compensation of $6 million, gain on the sale of the Japan project development platform of $245 million and an impairment of $58 million associated with the Luz del Norte project in Chile.\nWe recorded tax expense of $84 million in the second quarter compared to a tax benefit of $19 million in the prior quarter. The increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to an increase in pretax profit from the sale of our Japan project development platform and an increase in tax expense related to the Luz del Norte project. A combination of the aforementioned items led to second quarter earnings per share of $0.52 compared to a Q1 loss per share of $0.41 on a diluted basis.\nI'll next turn to Slide 8 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash flows generated from operations were $88 million, and capital expenditures were $199 million in the second quarter. Our cash, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Module segment operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of our Japan project development platform were partially offset by other operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with our new Ohio and India factories.\nTotal debt at the end of the second quarter was $175 million, a decrease of $77 million from the end of Q1, primarily due to the repayment of a credit facility before transferring the associated project with the sale of the Japan project development platform. All of our outstanding debt is nonrecourse project debt and will come off the balance sheet if the Luz del Norte project is solved.\nOur net cash position, which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, increased by approximately $372 million to $1.7 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors.\nContinuing on Slide 9. Our full year 2022 guidance is updated as follows: Our previous revenue guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion was predominantly module segment revenue, which remains unchanged. We are adding other segment revenue guidance of $150 million to $200 million for total revenue guidance of between $2.55 billion and $2.8 billion to reflect the expected sale of the Luz del Norte project in the second half of the year.\nWith half year behind us, we have greater clarity into our full year module segment performance. Whilst the midpoint of our module segment gross profit guidance remains unchanged, we've revised the range from $165 million to $225 million to $175 million to $215 million.\nOur other segment, which previously was forecast to reduce gross profit by $10 million, is now forecast to reduce gross profit by $50 million to $60 million due to the anticipated Luz del Norte sale, resulting in total forecasted gross profit of $115 million to $165 million.\nWithin gross profit, assumptions related to underutilization losses of $10 million to $15 million and a sales freight impact of 18 to 20 points of gross margin remain unchanged. Additionally, our forecasted cost of watt produced reduction from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 of 4% to 6%, and our forecasted flat year-over-year cost of watt sold forecast both remain unchanged.\nNote, the midpoint of our full year module segment gross margin guidance of approximately 8% remains unchanged from our previous forecast. Following a 3% and 5% module segment gross margin result in the first and second quarters of 2022, module margin improvement is expected to continue in the second half of the year.\nSG&A and R&D expenses are forecast to total $270 million to $280 million, down from $280 million to $290 million in our previous guidance. In addition, our forecast startup expense of $80 million to $85 million is down from $85 million to $90 million previously for a total forecast operating expenses forecast of $350 million to $365 million.\nThe gain on sale of businesses previously forecast at $270 million to $290 million is now forecast to be $245 million given the aforementioned currency impact.\nOperating income is estimated to be between $5 million and $70 million, down from previous guidance of $55 million to $150 million as a function of the reduction in the U.S. dollar value of the Japan business sale and the inclusion of the expected Luz del Norte sale in guidance, partially offset by SG&A, R&D and startup expenses savings.\nOther income and expense guidance moves from $20 million to $30 million of expense in prior guidance to $25 million of income in current guidance is a function of increased interest income and forecast debt forgiveness upon the anticipated sale of the Luz del Norte project.\nFull year tax expense increases from $35 million to $55 million previously to $55 million to $70 million, following the inclusion of the expected sale of the Luz del Norte project this year, partially offset by a lower-than-forecast gain on sale of the Japan development platform. This results in full year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance range of negative $0.25 to positive $0.25.\nCapital expenditures guidance of $850 million to $1.1 billion and shipments guidance of 8.9 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts remain unchanged. Our year-end 2022 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, an increase of $200 million following the assumed sale of Luz del Norte and the corresponding reduction in project-level debt.\nBefore handing the call back to Mark, given our record backlog and significant recent bookings, I'd like to provide some insight into our pricing strategy and our vision for gross margin expansion for the next 3 years and beyond. The components of this strategy include our approach of contracting out our capacity several years in advance of production. The anticipated reduction of our cost per watt produced, the expected benefits from capacity expansion, including through scaling a largely fixed overhead structure, and our agile contracting approach, which provides for the potential realization of both incremental revenue and is expected to mitigate freight and certain commodity cost risk.\nNow with respect to our agile contracting structure, every contract is different, and not every recent contract includes every technology and commodity adjuster we've been describing. Accordingly, while we anticipate seeing some incremental revenue contribution and gross margin protection from these adjusters in 2023, the majority of these potential revenue and gross margin benefits, if we're able to achieve our technology road map, are expected to be recognized in 2024 and 2025.\nFirstly, as it relates to ASPs, between the pricing reflected in the current contracted backlog and the pricing for the bookings realized in July, we expect the profile of our annual base contracted ASPs will remain effectively flat, and therefore, not decline for 2022 through 2025. Against this pricing backdrop, we anticipate a reduction in cost per watt produced from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 of between 4% and 6%. Even making the highly conservative assumption of no further reductions to cost per watt produced beyond this point, we expect cost per watt produced exiting 2022 to provide an annual gross margin benefit in 2023 and beyond.\nOn a cost mitigation basis, as it relates to sales freight as well as steel and aluminum costs relative to 2022, we would expect future years to see either a reduced cost profile or should costs remain elevated relative to prepandemic norms, the inclusion of adjusters would provide for an increase in ASP to offset such costs. Under either scenario, we would see an expansion of gross profit relative to 2022.\nAs mentioned on the April earnings call, indicatively, assuming today's sales freight in aluminum environment, a contract with sales freight aluminum adjusters is expected to increase ASPs by approximately $0.03 per watt above the baseline.\nFrom a growth perspective, relative to today, we expect the announced Series 7 factories in Ohio and India will add approximately 6 gigawatts of annual production starting in 2024. That additional volume is anticipated to provide significant incremental gross profit.\nIn addition, we see the benefit of scale from our largely fixed operating cost structure as we anticipate adding this capacity with limited incremental OpEx. Assuming the midpoint of our current full year 2022 R&D and SG&A guidance of $275 million, this incremental production reduces combined R&D and SG&A cost per watt by approximately $0.01.\nAs it relates to our Indian manufacturing facility, while ASPs in that market are anticipated to be lower than those in the U.S. and other markets, we expect gross profit per watt for the Indian factory to be equal to or higher than the fleet average. This is due to a combination of factory scale, domestic CapEx incentives and other incentives, lower labor costs and the elimination of ocean freight to deliver the domestically produced product.\nThe combined impact of flat ASPs, cost per watt reduction, sales freight and commodity adjusters and capacity expansion against a largely fixed operating cost base provides a compelling case for gross margin expansion over the period we've been discussing. Moreover, this potential for gross margin expansion is further enhanced to the extent that we're able to make achievements within our technology road map.\nAs described on the April earnings call, under our updated contracting approach, we forward-sell today's technology. To the extent we accomplish future module technology improvements, including new product designs and energy-related enhancements, we have the opportunity to realize incremental revenue under sales contracts that include technology adjusters. As Mark noted earlier, this does not include either potential adjustments to the ultimate bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards, or for those contracts in the United States that include sharing related to a potential upside for U.S.-made modules and an extension of the investment tax credit.\nAnd finally, the gross profit opportunity described here is within the context of our current capacity plan. Additional capacity would be expected to be gross profit accretive to the above scenario. And while we're not making a new additional [plant] announcement today, I'll now turn the call back over to Mark, who will provide an update on policy and our current thinking with respect to capacity expansion.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Alex. To conclude, I would like to discuss the rapidly evolving policy environment both at home and abroad. Beginning in the United States, like many in the energy sector, we were pleasantly surprised by yesterday's joint announcement from Senators Manchin and Schumer regarding the Inflation Reduction Act. We are encouraged that yesterday's announcement made a clear reference to investment in energy security and technology-neutral climate change solutions, and we are supportive of the balanced approach to corporate taxation.\nWhile we are still reviewing the full legislative text released last night, we are hopeful that the advanced manufacturing production credit, if passed, helps deliver the incentives required to boost domestic solar manufacturing and secure our nation's energy independence.\nAs the legislative process moves forward, we urge both chambers to move quickly to pass this critical legislation, which represents the first real step to designing a clean energy industrial policy that addresses climate change while simultaneously codifying American energy security.\nWith respect to 45X, the advanced manufacturing production credit, we urge Congress to ensure that the manufacturing tax credit designed to incentivize domestic solar supply chains are fully refundable in order to deliver the intended result. This legislation's extension of the solar investment tax credit appears to enable crucial demand-side policy certainty. We're hopeful that, if passed, legislation maintains the domestic content incentive that will help further ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are used to help expand manufacturing here at home.\nTurning to our considerations to further expand our manufacturing footprint, our criteria for investment remains unchanged. These include geographic proximity to solar demand, the ability to export cost competitively into other markets, access to cost-competitive labor, low energy and real estate costs, access to or the ability to build a cost-competitive supply chain to support the sourcing of raw materials and components, and as we've repeatedly stated, the domestic policy environment.\nWe agree wholeheartedly with Senator Manchin that the United States needs to remain a global superpower through innovation. As it relates to the potential for our own manufacturing expansion in the U.S., we had previously stated that we were evaluating the potential for future capacity expansion but noted that we first required clarity on domestic solar policy. In light of these latest developments and should the Inflation Reduction Act get passed with consistent language on solar-related tax credits, we plan to pivot quickly to reevaluate U.S. manufacturing expansion.\nMoving ahead, we continue to be optimistic about the policy environment in Europe and in India. Over the last 10 months, we have met productively with Prime Minister Modi of India and attended the Investment Conference hosted by President Macron of France in addition to having numerous constructive meetings with members of their cabinets. These governments, along with others that are -- we are engaged with are seeking to diversify and grow domestic capabilities.\nAs calls for resilient domestic supply chains grow louder in solar markets around the world, we believe First Solar is uniquely well positioned to offer a viable alternative based on a proven repeatable vertically integrated manufacturing template.\nBefore I turn the call back to Alex to summarize today's key messages, I would like to note that we have issued our 2022 sustainability report. The report highlights our continued progress across a range of environmental, social and governance metrics, detailing among other accomplishments how we have successfully lowered our environmental footprint while advancing our diversity inclusion goals. These achievements demonstrate the strength of our commitment to the principles of responsible solar, placing at the heart of our business as we invest in innovation and scale.\nWe are proud that First Solar is an example of how solar can be competitive without compromising on principles and purpose. We have shown that solar technologies can be sustainably scaled without people and the planet paying a high price.\nAlex will now summarize the key messages from today's call.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nTurning to Slide 10. From a financial perspective, we're pleased with our Q2 earnings per share of $0.52. We updated our full year guidance to reflect the impact of 2 discrete legacy systems events. The midpoint of our full year module revenue and gross margin guidance remains unchanged. Operationally, we'll produce 2.2 gigawatts and ship 2.5 gigawatts of modules.\nAdditionally, Series 6 demand remains extremely robust with 27.1 gigawatts of year-to-date net bookings, leading to a record contracted backlog of 44.3 gigawatts. The 10.4 gigawatts of new bookings since our prior earnings call in April had a base ASP, excluding adjusters of $0.301.\nAnd finally, we're encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act proposed legislation and are currently reviewing this development and its potential impact on our business and capacity expansion plans.\nAnd with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mitch, you may begin.\n\nMitchell Ennis\n\nManager of IR, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2022 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. .\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter. Following the remarks, we'll open the call for questions.\nPlease note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations, including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mitch. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. To begin, while our $0.41 loss per share results came in within our internal expectations for the quarter, it is reflective of what is projected to be a challenging 2022 from an earnings standpoint due to the factors that we highlighted during our call in March, and which we will address further today.\nThat said, we are encouraged by our strong bookings progress as we booked 11.9 gigawatts in less than 60 days since the prior earnings call, bringing our year-to-date bookings total to 16.7 gigawatts, further setting ourselves up for 2023 and beyond. An important feature of many of these recent bookings, as previously discussed, is that they include adjusters to potentially increase ASPs based on the realization of our technology road map achievements and sales risk sharing mitigation.\nIn addition, we have begun to employ a similar ASP adjustment mechanism related to aluminum exposure. Later in the call, we will provide an indicative view of how these pricing adjustments could result in an ASP potentially significantly greater than the baseline reflected at the time of our bookings.\nIn short, while these contracts have a baseline ASP that is reflective of the value of the product we are manufacturing today, that ASP has the potential to increase to capture the value of our product or technology enhancements or to offset sales freight and aluminum margin erosion risk.\nWe believe this agile approach to contracting will continue to attract customers looking for long-term certainty and value. The combination of reliable, competitive pricing and supply certainty, lower political and compliance risk, and access to our best available technology is a tremendous value driver for sophisticated customers who may be fatigued with the volatility uncertainty that can be experienced transacting in this industry, particularly in the current environment.\nIt's worth noting that many of these recent bookings are with long-term repeat customers with relationships that span hundreds of megawatts of previously installed capacity. In addition, our most recent bookings include significant volumes from customers new to First Solar. These decisions to work with First Solar and our technology speaks volumes not just about the trust in the company, the value of our differentiated CdTe semiconductor and our adherence to principles of responsible solar, but also the risk of pursuing a solar at any cost strategy, by which we mean an approach that would otherwise compromise values and ambitions for projects powered by truly low carbon and environmentally superior solar.\nThis trust is in part built upon the company's dependability and its ethos of honoring its commitments. Some argue that the current volatility in the industry in general and the module availability and pricing specifically, at this particular moment in time provides the company with an opportunity to pursue repricing of legacy contracts, contracts that we are delivering on today, but which were entered into and priced several years ago.\nWe take a different view. We are continuing to build for solar for the long term, and our partnerships with our highly valued customers is critical -- is a critical aspect of that ambition. We believe the benefits that come with continuing to serve a base of enduring strategic customers that seek to partner with a company for large-scale multiyear procurements outweighs the potential long-term adverse impacts that could result from taking a transactional versus relationship-based approach in the short term.\nTurning to Slide 3. I'd like to review some highlights and provide some updates from the quarter. As just mentioned, we booked 11.9 gigawatts since the March earnings call. After accounting for shipments of approximately 1.7 gigawatts a which was in line with our expectation, this brings our total contracted backlog to 36.4 gigawatts. Manufacturing metrics remained strong despite some planned downtime for upgrades in Vietnam in February and March and our Q1 production of approximately 2.1 gigawatts.\nWith regards to supply chain and logistics, as mentioned on our earnings call in March, we have no direct Tier 1 suppliers in the Russia-Ukraine conflict area. However, volatility in various supply markets such as metals, lumber and fuels, is further exasperating the current inflationary environment. In addition, we have some indirect exposure through our equipment vendors as it relates to the timing of manufacturing and delivery of tools for our new factories in Ohio and India.\nMoreover, the conflict and current inflationary environment have contributed to dislocations in certain currency markets. Alex will discuss the impact to First Solar later in the call.\nRegarding freight, while pricing in the transoceanic freight market continues to be at historic highs as to represent a headwind in 2022, we have briefly seen increased container availability, which we believe is a result of China's pursuit of its zero COVID policy with its associated lockdowns. That said, transportation costs and transportation duration continue to be significantly higher than historic note.\nFor example, in Q1, shipments from Southeast Asia to the West Coast averaged over 130 days compared to approximately 60 days in 2020. Transit times have been exasperated by the Russia-Ukraine war as several global logistics and shipping companies announced cessations of shipping to Russia, further stranding equipment and vessels, and intensifying backlogs and delays in global shipping industry.\nTurning to Japan. As we noted during our March earnings call, in late 2021, we received an unsolicited offer to acquire our Japan project development and O&M platform. Negotiations related to this potential sale are progressing well, and we expect in Q2 to enter into definitive agreements to sell these businesses with closing taking place following satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As previously noted, should this transaction not be completed for any reason, we would expect to either continue our approach of selling down our contracted projects over time or consider an alternative buyer for the platform.\nFinally, construction of our third manufacturing facility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India remain on track, although with the aforementioned risks related to equipment manufacturing and delivery schedules. Beyond these facilities, we continue to evaluate further expansion efforts and opportunities.\nAs we have discussed before, with our new factories anticipated to represent the lowest cost of production in the fleet, their proximity to demand and given our large fixed operating cost structure, growth is expected to provide significant incremental contribution margin.\nAs we consider options for growth, we have increasingly been approached to consider further expansions with various financing, ownership and offtake structures as industry participants continue to embrace the value of entering into long-term partnerships with reliable module suppliers.\nWhile we have made no decisions at this time, we are receptive to enabling the ambitions of our partners seeking dedicated supply. To this end, we continue to engage with our tool and equipment vendors to ensure they have visibility into and the ability to support any potential expansion.\nTurning to technology. We are pleased with the opportunity -- optionality, excuse me, our current road map provides both in terms of enhancing our form factor, product design and energy profile in utility-scale markets as well as providing a potential route to scale into the residential solar market.\nWith regard to form factor, we expect our Series 7 module which is to be produced at our new factories in India -- Ohio and India, will feature a glass area that is approximately 14% larger than our Series 6 Plus modules. Unlike crystalline silicon modules, which are constrained by the industry standard cell sites and risks such as cell cracking, CdTe has no such form factor or size limitation. A larger form factor benefits our cost per watt produced and allows our customers to install more watts with less balance of system cost.\nIn terms of design, we expect the melting system to be regionally optimized in the U.S. to a tracker application and in India to a fixed tilt application. We believe the redesigned structure will combine lower cost to produce with greater installed speeds in the field, benefiting both for solar and our customers.\nAs it relates to energy, in addition to benefits associated with irrigation, temperature coefficient, spectral response and shading, our R&D team continues to make progress on developing the bifacial attributes of our CdTe semiconductor. We are continuing to run test that we expect will enable us to commercialize the technology across our model platforms and have recently produced another set of preproduction prototypes for additional field and product testing as we work to reaffirm the commercial, financial and operational thesis of bifacial CdTe.\nLooking at the residential market, we recognize the value of high efficiency, aesthetically pleasing and domestically manufactured product. To that end, we continue to evaluate the prospect of leveraging the high-band gap advantage of CdTe and the disruptive high-efficiency, low-cost tandem or multi-junction device.\nWe believe that a thin-film semiconductor is essential to achieving the highest performing tandem PV module, and that CdTe is well placed to enable this leap forward in high performance, with a path in the midterm to achieve a 25% efficient multi-junction PV module. As we seek to grow our presence and competitive position in the residential and C&I space, this type of module has the potential to be disruptive and provide us with a competitive advantage.\nIn that spirit, we are in discussions with SunPower to potentially develop and eventually introduce an advanced residential solar panel, a stack tandem module platform that combines our advanced thin-film CdTe semiconductor with responsibly sourced crystalline silicon cells. We do not intend to disclose further any developments with respect to this discussion except to the extent an agreement is reached.\nFinally, as highlighted in our last earnings call, our technology team has been conducting extensive testing to measure the full performance entitlement of CuRe in high-volume manufacturing conditions. Since our last update in March, we have concluded that while the potential for CuRe remains, its implementation will be delayed beyond 2022.\nWe will prioritize other aspects of our R&D stack in the near term,to ensure a focus on the 3 current technology pathways that we believe can be commercialized in the near term: Series 7; bifacial CdTe; and Tandem multi-junction devices. The success of these 3 pathways is not contingent on CuRe, which will continue to be developed in parallel.\nWe have continued to advance progress on our previously discussed amendments and advanced stage negotiations to amend certain customer contracts utilizing CuRe technology by substituting our enhanced Series 6 product. We maintain our expectation that these amendments will impact 2022 revenue gross margin by approximately $60 million, which is reflected in our guidance.\nMoving to Slide 4. With the aforementioned 11.9 gigawatts of bookings since the prior earnings call, bringing our total year-to-date bookings to 16.7 gigawatts and factoring in shipments of 1.7 gigawatts in the first quarter, our future expected shipments, which extend into 2026 are 36.4 gigawatts.\nIncluding in our year-to-date bookings, we are sold out for 2022 and 2023, have 9.6 gigawatts for planned deliveries in 2024, and have 7.6 gigawatts for planned deliveries in 2025 and beyond. Included in these bookings, our gigawatt-sized deals entered into over the past several weeks with, among others, Silicon Ranch, Innergex Renewable Energies and Leeward Renewable Energy for delivery in North America and internationally.\nTurning to Slide 5. I'd like to take a moment to walk through the recent changes in our contracting structure. This change in approach provides product certainty today and our baseline ASP is reflective of today's technology. It further provides ASP upside to the extent we realize future module technology improvements, including new product designs, which deliver a better energy profile for our customers.\nAnd finally, it provides greater logistics and commodity gross margin risk mitigation through ASP adjusters linked to aluminum and sales freight costs. Every contract is different, and not every recent contract includes every adjuster described here. To the extent that such adjusters are not included in a contract, we believe that baseline ASP reflects a commensurate risk and opportunity profile.\nAs it relates to technology and product adjusters, we have previously and will continue to have both upward and downward adjustments to ASPs to reflect the bin class delivered, reflective of the baseline bin committed under the contract. As it relates to other technology road map and product features, under our previous structure, we would forward sell assumed improvements with no upside and a downside risk in the event these were not achieved, as represented by the red circles on the slide.\nUnder our updated structure, we forward sell today's technology with upside for technology improvements as shown by the green circles.\nAs shown by the dotted box on the slide and as we have reflected in the 10-Q filing, as of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 9.8 gigawatts of contracted volumes with these adjusters, which is, if realized, could result in additional revenue up to $0.3 billion or approximately $0.03 a watt. Note, of our 4.8 gigawatts of calendar quarter bookings, 1.4 gigawatt did not include technology adjusters, but was priced with an approximately 10% premium to the remainder of the calendar quarter bookings.\nAs it relates to standard versus high load modules, our previous structure assumed a certain mix and any deviation from that mix could imply greater high-load modules, which have a higher cost per watt produced could have resulted in reduced gross margin. Under our updated structure, we have received an increased ASP to offset this additional cost, therefore, preventing gross margin erosion as represented by the blue circle on the slide.\nAs it relates to sales freight in aluminum, we have -- we were previously exposed to incremental costs in logistics and commodity markets. Under our updated structure, we have contractual adjusters designed to offset such incremental costs and prevent gross margin erosion.\nAs of today, we have 23.2 gigawatts of contracts with either sales freight coverage or no sales freight exposure. An aluminum coverage clause was introduced after Q1 quarter end and is present in 11 gigawatts of our most recent bookings. Indicatively, assuming today's sales freight and aluminum environment, a contract with these sales freight and aluminum adjusters would increase ASPs by approximately $0.03 per watt above the baseline.\nFinally, as it relates to policy, many of our updated contracts in the United States now specify sharing related to a potential upside for U.S.-made modules under an extension of the investment tax credit.\nAs reflected on Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust. Even after booking 11.9 gigawatts in less than 60 days, our total bookings opportunity of 54.1 gigawatts. Our 23.7 gigawatts of mid-to-late stage opportunities include 16.1 gigawatts in North America, 5.4 gigawatts in India, 1.7 gigawatts in the EU, and 0.5 gigawatts across other geographies.\nWe are especially encouraged by the continuing growth in our India pipeline, which we believe positions us well to realize multi gigawatts of bookings over the next several quarters. The global sustaining market demand is driven by the fact that we are on the edge of a new age of electrification, one in which essentially everything that can be electrified will be. It is our next big evolutionary leap and our best bet at fighting climate change as we power transportation and virtually every aspect of our lives, including power producing fuel cells with electricity.\nBefore turning over the call to Alex, on Slide 7, I would like to address recent policy developments in the United States, Europe and India. Trade and industrial policy decisions and the upending of the global geopolitical status quo both play a significant role in impacting market dynamics as well as continuing to inform our growth strategy.\nStarting with the U.S. in late December 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which received widespread bipartisan support in Congress. This act's rebuttable presumption against the importation of goods produced in the Xinjang region, assumed to be produced with forced labor, is set to go into effect in June this year.\nThere exists practical solutions to reduce the risks of purchasing modules associated with forced labor. For instance, the Responsible Business Alliance, the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain offers the leading standard for on-site compliance verification and effective shareable audits in the form of a validated assessment program. Yet this established model has not been widely adopted by the solar industry with First Solar being the first and at this point, only large solar manufacturer to join RBA. In our view, transparency and traceability are crucial to reinforcing our industry's social license operate.\nThe transition to a sustainable energy future and the fight against climate change must not come at the price of human rights. Turning our focus to domestic and trade policy. The Biden-Harris administration has the opportunity to deliver a meaningful and durable long-term solar industrial policy through the use of a manufacturing incentive. We remain fully engaged in advocating for legislation that would revive climate and clean energy investment, including the framework for manufacturing tax credits established by the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act introduced by Senator Ossoff.\nOn the trade front, in response to petition by Auxin Solar, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated circumventing inquiries against crystalline silicon imports to the United States that undergo minor processing, if any, at 4 Southeast Asia countries. We believe this is a positive step towards addressing the problem of mainly crystalline silicon Chinese modules and cells that are completed in Southeast Asia in an attempt to avoid tariffs.\nFor too long, the American solar manufacturing industry has been under siege from the Chinese headquartered and subsidized companies that have been violating the rules of free and fair trade. The data shows that since the underlying antidumping and countervailing duties on Chinese cells and modules were put in place, the value of Chinese imports to the United States decreased by 86%. During the same period, the value of imports from 4 Southeast Asia countries that issued increased by 868%.\nPrior to the underlying antidumping and countervailing orders, there was virtually no crystalline silicon cells and modules produced in these 4 Southeast Asian countries. There is still a very limited polysilicon in ingot or wafer production in these nations. Instead, they source the high-value wafers from China, which controls 99% of global crystalline silicon wafer production. Additionally, China is the dominant supplier of the other key imports inputs such as aluminum, silver paste, UVA sheets, backsheets, aluminum frames and junction boxes. Simply, the data truly speaks for itself.\nWe've heard the sky is falling narrative push by lobbyists advocating for China to have free rein in the U.S. market. Their doom and gloom is telling. It suggests that they are afraid that the Department of Commerce will find that the Chinese solar manufacturers, in fact, engaged in circumvention and will hold them accountable for their unfair and unlawful trade practices.\nWhile the lobbyists characterize Auxin as a single company seeking to inappropriately exploit the law, it is precisely cases like this that the law are designed for. Indeed, Commerce has conducted 85 circumvention inquiries covering all types of industries and of these, approximately 80% have been decided and then affirmed.\nWe also reject the false narrative that Commerce investigation and pursuit of the rule of law will adversely impact the administration's climate ambitions. Trading away responsible ultra-low carbon solar manufacturing for dependency on China is deeply misguided because China polysilicon is heavily reliant on coal produced electricity. When the price of coal goes up, so does the price of polysilicon and crystalline silicon solar panels. Whether produced in Xinjiang or in the United States, emissions exasperate the global climate crisis. Smoke stacks not visible from Pennsylvania Avenue are no less harmful to the environment.\nTo be clear, the circumvention investigation is not about prohibiting imports, but about ensuring the imports compete fairly in the U.S. market. We welcome the robust international competition and it's fair and rules-based backdrop. The problem today is that dumped and subsidized imports distort competition and cycles of innovation with the Chinese government warping investment decisions and dictating outcomes.\nIf the rules are enforced, we are confident that the U.S. solar demand will be met and that we will have a stronger American solar manufacturing industry, serving as a secure, environmentally responsible source of supply. More broadly, we firmly believe that the United States needs a combination of durable industrial policy, smart trade policy and the enforcement of the rule of law in order to build back American solar manufacturing and innovation.\nAt no point should this vital transition to a sustainable energy future come at the cost of American Jobs, investment, innovation and national energy security.\nMoving to Europe. We are seeing 3 pivotal shifts in the policy space. The first is the growing momentum around accelerating renewable energy deployments and bringing forward targets. The second is the recognition that dependencies on authoritarian states are strategic vulnerabilities and the last is the rapid strengthening of bilateral transatlantic relationships. All 3 factors are being driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.\nWith regards to renewable deployment, faced not just with the risk and uncertainty of gas supplies, but also the prospects of continuing to funnel billions of dollars to Russia through gas purchases, European leaders are working to speed up the region's energy transition. The European Union's REPowerEU initiative aims to cut dependency on Russian gas by deploying more renewables and accelerating R&D and future fuels such as hydrogen.\nIndividual European countries are accelerating their transition plans. For instance, Portugal aims to have 80% of its electricity come from renewables by 2026, up from an original target of 60% in the same time frame. Germany is also moving forward with the goal to double renewable energy generation from 40% today to 80% by 2030, an increase of 15 percentage points over the previous target. Significantly, the coalition government in Berlin included a clause in the renewable energy legislation package acknowledging that renewable energy deployment is in the best interest of country security.\nWith regards to strategic vulnerability, there is growing concern in the EU about replacing energy dependency on 1 authoritarian state with another, including and especially China, which supplies virtually all the solar panels to the region. European leaders are underscoring China's position as a systematic rival and threat that operates in an opposition to Europe's social and democratic model, liberal values and recognition of international law.\nFinally, we are encouraged by strengthening bilateral relationships between the EU and the United States. Near-term cooperation is focused on the immediate needs to alleviate gas shortages in Europe, longer-term shared climate sustainability and energy security goals can lead to more collaboration on clean energy technologies and their deployment.\nAs both the United States and Europe work through their challenges of rapidly scaling domestic solar manufacturing capacity, they should consider the template that India has established. There are a few better examples of how a combination of trade safeguards, manufacturing incentives, and tangible clean energy goals, can spur domestic manufacturing than India. Today, India is expected to have 40 gigawatts of new cell capacity and 50 gigawatts of new module capacity come online by 2025. If all of this new capacity does materialize, it would not only make India self-sufficient, but it would also create a significant amount of export capacity.\nThis is a direct result of the effective combination of tariffs and nontariff barriers to level the playing field. The Indian government's production linked incentive scheme for domestic manufacturing and government clean energy targets that would see 25 gigawatts of new capacity deployed every year until the end of the second. India's all-government approach is clearly working and is perhaps one that we can all learn from.\nIt's now my opportunity to turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss Q1 results.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 8, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the first quarter. Net sales in Q1 were $367 million, a decrease of $540 million compared to the prior quarter. Decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a lower module volume sold, reflective of seasonality and increased transit times and lower average module ASPs as well as a decrease in revenue from our residual business operations following the sale of 3 projects in Japan in Q4 of 2021.\nOn a segment basis, our module segment revenue in Q1 was $355 million compared to $690 million in the prior quarter. Gross margin was 3% in Q1 compared to 27% in Q4 of 2021. Q1 module segment gross margin was 3%, down from 21% in Q4 of 2021, and was negatively impacted by $4 million or 1 percentage point of gross margin of underutilization expense, stemming from planned downtime for throughput and technology upgrades.\nAdditionally, sales freight and warranty expense included in our cost of sales reduced module segment gross margin by 14 percentage points in Q1 compared to 13 percentage points in Q4 of last year.\nSG&A and R&D expenses totaled $64 million in the first quarter, a decrease of approximately $4 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower R&D testing expense. Production startup, which is included in operating expenses totaled $7 million in the first quarter, an increase of $2 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased start-up costs associated with our third Perrysburg factory.\nIn Q1, we closed the sale of certain international O&M contracts in Chile and recorded a gain on the sale of the business of $2 million. Q1 operating loss was $58 million, which includes depreciation and amortization of $65 million, under utilization and production start-up expense totaling $11 million, share-based compensation of GBP 4 million and a gain on the sales of certain O&M contracts of $2 million.\nWe recorded a tax benefit of $19 million in the first quarter compared to tax expense of $36 million in the prior quarter. Decrease in tax expense attributable to the pretax loss in Q1 compared to pretax income in Q4 of 2021. Combination of the aforementioned items led to a first quarter loss of share of $0.41 compared to Q4 2021 earnings per share of $1.23 on a diluted basis.\nNext, turn to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion at the end of the prior quarter.\nModule segment operating cash flow was offset by ongoing project spend in Japan, other operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with our new Perrysburg and India factories.\nTotal debt at the end of the first quarter was $252 million, an increase of $12 million from the end of Q4, primarily associated with loan drawdowns in Japan. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project-related and will come off our balance sheet when the corresponding projects are sold.\nOur net cash position, which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt decreased by approximately $285 million to $1.3 billion, as a result of the aforementioned factors. And in the first quarter, cash flow used in operations were $139 million, and capital expenditures were $155 million.\nContinuing on Slide 10. Our full year 2022 guidance is unchanged from our call in early March. However, I'll provide some context around some of the risks, uncertainties and opportunities within the year.\nFirstly, as Mark mentioned, negotiations related to the potential sale of our Japan project development and O&M businesses are progressing well, and we expect in Q2 to enter into definitive agreements to sell these businesses. The anticipated value in local currency has remained in line with our expectations when we gave guidance in March.\nDue to the global macro environment and the Bank of Japan maintaining a commitment to economic stimulus, in contrast to tightening U.S. monetary policy, the Japanese yen has, in the last 2 months experienced a sudden and significant devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. While we continue to anticipate U.S. dollar pretax gain on sale of $270 million to $290 million, timing of sale and the state of the currency markets at closing may adversely impact that value.\nSecondly, as it relates to commodities, we continue to see volatility and increased pressure in major commodity markets, including aluminum and lumber. As mentioned in our previous guidance call, we continue to face challenges and to evaluate pathways towards mitigating our aluminum exposure, particularly as it relates to hedging supply from Malaysia and Vietnam batteries.\nThirdly, the global sales freight environment remains challenging. With Q1 freight costs tracking largely as expected, we continue to see full year sales freight approaching $0.05 per watt or approximately 18 to 20 percentage points of gross margin.\nAnd lastly, we maintain our forecasted cost awards produce reduction from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 of 4% to 6%, our flat year-over-year cost awards sold for that.\nTurning to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from the call. From a financial perspective, our Q1 loss per share of $0.41 is in line with our internal expectations, and we reiterate our full year guidance. Operationally, production of 2.1 gigawatts and shipments of 1.7 gigawatts were in line with expectations, and we continue to advance our technology road map across Series 7 bifaciality and tandem multi-junction devices. Finally, Series 6 demand has been robust with 16.7 gigawatts of year-to-date bookings, which includes 11.9 gigawatts since the previous earnings call, leading to a current contract backlog of 36.4 gigawatts, and this includes recent bookings with our updated contracting structure, providing ASP upsides and gross margin risk mitigation.\nAnd with that, we'll conclude our compared remarks and open the call for questions.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin.\n\nMitchell Ennis\n\nManager of IR, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as its guidance for 2021. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.\nWith me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Following these remarks, Mark will provide a business and strategy outlook. Alex will then discuss our financial guidance for 2022. Following the remarks, we'll open the call for questions.\nPlease note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark?\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mitch. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the entire First Solar team for their hard work and perseverance in a year where much of the solar PV manufacturing industry face supply chain, logistics, cost and pandemic-related challenges. Despite these dynamics, we have continued to scale our manufacturing capacity and adapt our business model in a constantly evolving market through our point of differentiation, which include our CadTel thin-film module technology; a vertically integrated continuous manufacturing process; a strong balance sheet; and a commitment to the principles of responsible solar. We have created a growth-oriented business model, which we believe positions us to be successful over the long term.\nWhile Alex will provide a more comprehensive review of our 2021 financial results, I would like to highlight that our full year EPS results of $4.38 per diluted share came in above the midpoint of our guidance range we provided at this time during our third quarter earnings call. Of note, this EPS result, despite an unprecedented challenging freight environment, is also solidly within the original guidance range we provided last February.\nBeginning on Slide 3, I will highlight some of our key 2021 accomplishments, which we believe positions us for sustainable growth. To begin, we had an excellent year from a commercial perspective, securing a record 17.5 gigawatts of net bookings in 2021, more than double our prior annual record. This momentum has carried into 2022 with 4.8 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, which brings our total since the previous earnings call to 11.8 gigawatts. As we secure this very significant volume for delivery into the future, we have been employing a contracting strategy which enables our customers to benefit from the evolution of our product and technology platform while also partially derisking our position around sales strategy. I will discuss this approach later in the call.\nWe produced 7.9 gigawatts in 2021, delivering against our near-term commitments despite pandemic-related challenges. Moreover, we reduced our cost per watt produced by 6% between the end of 2020 and 2021 despite inflationary pressures, rising commodity costs, and as a result of the COVID-19, the inability to implement as planned several module cost-reduction programs.\nExpansion has been an important theme in 2021 as we set the foundation to reach approximately 16 gigawatts of capacity in 2024. We added our sixth Series 6 factory, our second factory in Malaysia in early 2021, and announced plans for new factories to produce our next generation of solar panels, which we are calling Series 7 in India and Ohio. As a reminder, the 2 Series 7 factories are expected to come online in 2023 and combined with the benefit of locating supply near to demand, reducing the cost of sales rate are expected to increase gross profit per watt by approximately $0.01 to $0.03 relative to our existing Series 6 fleets.\nOn the technology front, we increased our top Series 6 production bin to 465 watts, which represents a 21% increase year-over-year and is in line with our guidance provided last February. We reduced our 30-year warranted power output degradation rate from 0.5% to 0.3% per year. This meaningful improvement can result in the module yielding up to 4.4% more energy on a life cycle basis. And finally, we completed the sale of our U.S. project development and North American O&M businesses. In summary, each of these achievements are the results of our intent to focus on our greatest competitive advantage, which includes our differentiated technology and manufacturing process.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'll next discuss our most recent shipments and bookings in greater detail. We shipped approximately 2.1 gigawatts and 7.7 gigawatts for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, respectively, which was within but towards the lower end of our guidance range that we provided during the Q3 earnings call. As a reminder, we generally define shipments as when a delivery process to a customer commences and the module leaves one of our facilities. Whereas revenue recognition or volume sold occurs as transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which is commonly upon the arrival of the destination port on the project site. Note extended transit times and container availability constraints contributed to our full year 2021 shipments being towards the lower end of our guidance range.\nThe global freight market continues to experience record levels of scheduled delays and reliability issues, which has worsened since the previous earnings call. Due to these challenges, we ended the year with 1.2 gigawatts of inventory on hand and 675 megawatts of shipments in transit not recognized as revenue. While the volume in transit declined quarter-over-quarter, it was meaningfully above the trailing 4-quarter average.\nSeveral logistics challenges trended unfavorably in Q4. Firstly, total transit times for transoceanic freight increased by a factor of weeks between Q3 and Q4, reaching levels nearly double historic norms. Secondly, congestion continues to be challenging at U.S. ports, which are further exacerbated in advance of the holiday season. Thirdly, reliability was a significant issue as 3 and 10 planned sailings were canceled around the turn of the year. Finally, over-the-road trucking is constrained from a capacity perspective with low-to-truck ratios at the highest level in several years. In summary, we are experiencing a 2-front impact related to freight in terms of both higher cost and worse carrier performance.\nWith regard to bookings, momentum has accelerated with 11.8 gigawatts of net bookings since the November earnings call. We continue to see an increase in multiyear module sales agreements driven by our customers' need for certainty in terms of the technology they're investing in and the suppliers' integrity and ethics. Representative of this, we have executed an agreement with our highly valued long-term partner, SP Energy, to supply 1.5 gigawatts of deployment in projects in 2023, 2024 and 2025.\nAfter accounting for shipments of approximately 2.1 gigawatts during the fourth quarter, our future expected shipments, which extended into 2025, are 26.2 gigawatts. Including our year-to-date bookings, we are sold out for 2022 and have 10.7 gigawatts, 3.4 gigawatts and 2.4 gigawatts for planned deliveries in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nNext, I would like to provide an update on our project development and O&M platform in Japan. Today, our remaining offerings outside of our core module business includes project development in Japan, O&M outside of North America and our continued ownership of certain power-generating assets. Of these remaining businesses, our Japan platform is the most prominent in terms of prospective scale and profitability.\nIn late 2021, we received an unsolicited offer to acquire our Japan project development and O&M platform. We believe a potential purchaser strategy to scale a leading solar platform in Japan, coupled with their participation in complementary asset classes, could unlock the full potential of our Japan platform. Accordingly, we are in advanced stage negotiations to sell our Japan project development and O&M platform. While there is no certainty that we will execute a definitive agreement with this counterparty, we believe that the contemplated transaction value is compelling. Note, if we do not deplete this transaction, we expect to either continue our approach of selling down our contracted projects over time or consider an alternative buyer for the platform.\nI'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2021 results. Alex?\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before discussing our financial results for the quarter and full year 2021, I'll first provide an update on our segment reporting. With potential sale of our Japan project development and O&M platform, the revenue and margin opportunity outside of our core modules business lie largely with a relatively small pool of existing O&M contracts outside of Japan and North America, power-generating assets or projects that we previously developed and any legacy obligations as a result of our prior systems activities.\nAccordingly, we've changed our reportable segments to align with our internal reporting structure and long-term strategic plans. Going forward, our module business will represent our only reportable segment. But for comparison purposes, the prospective module segment is fully comparable to prior periods. Any revenue or margin associated with activities of historically categorized with our systems business are now presented as Other in our segment reporting.\nStarting on Slide 5, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the first quarter and full year 2021, which were presented in this manner. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $907 million, an increase of $324 million compared to the prior quarter. This was primarily a result of the sale of 3 projects in Japan and increased module volumes sold in Q4. For the full year 2021, net sales were $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion in 2020. Relative to our guidance expectations, net sales were within or towards the lower end of our guidance range due to delays in module sales revenue recognition as a result of the aforementioned freight and logistics challenges.\nGross margin was 27% in the fourth quarter compared to 21% in the third quarter. For the full year 2021, gross margin was 25%, which is unchanged from the prior year. Our 2021 guidance assume the completion of 2 project sales in Japan as a result of completing 3 project sales in Q4, and Q4 gross profit for our residual business operations was $102 million, approximately $25 million above the high end of our guidance range for Q4 and full year '21. Module segment gross margin was 21% in the fourth quarter, which is unchanged from the prior quarter.\nFor full year 2021, our module segment gross profit came in below the low end of our guidance by approximately $12 million. Additionally, full year 2021 module segment gross margin of 20% was down 5 percentage points from 25% in 2020. This was due to several items. Firstly, sales rate continues to adversely impact our financial results, reducing gross margin by 6 percentage points in 2020, 11 percentage points full year 2021 and 13 percentage points in Q4 of 2021. Note, as a reminder, many of our module peers report freight costs as a separate operating expense. For comparison purposes, we encourage you to consider the fact that we're benchmarking our module gross margin percent relative to our peers.\nSecondly, 2021 volumes sold us below our full year expectations due to the aforementioned ocean freight reliability issues, port congestion and over-the-road trucking capacity constraints. Year-end 2021 modules in-transit number of 675 megawatts remains above historic norms.\nThirdly, factory upgrades in 2021 resulted in higher downtime and utilization and lower production. The full year 2021 ramp and utilization-related expense of $19 million or 1 percentage point gross margin.\nFinally, while we reduced our cost work produced by 6% between the end of 2020 and 2021, we faced a cost for produce headwind in '21 as a result of higher inbound freight and aluminum costs. In light of these circumstances, although the module segment gross profit and gross margin came in below our 2021 expectations, we are pleased with how we navigated the current environment and delivered solid module segment performance.\nSG&A, R&D and production staff and expenses totaled $73 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately $1 million relative to the third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a $1 million increase in production start-up expense from the addition of our third factory in Ohio, a $4 million increase in R&D expense predominantly related to CuRe testing, which were partially offset by impairment charge related to a certain development projects that occurred in the prior period.\nSG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $290 million in 2021 compared to $357 million in 2020. Overall, we're pleased with our operating expense result of $290 million, which was within our full year guidance range, $285 million to $300 million and represents a significant year-over-year reduction.\nOperating income was $173 million in Q4 and $587 million for the full year 2021. Income tax expense was $103 million for the full year 2021. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.23 compared to $0.32 in the prior quarter. For full year 2021, earnings per share was $4.38 compared to $3.73 in 2020. Our 2021 EPS result came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided on the third quarter earnings call and is also within the original range we provided last [year]. While there are several unexpected challenges and benefits we faced last year, our overall performance reflects the strength of our business model and ability to navigate a challenging environment over the course of the year.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities balance at year-end was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $109 million from the prior quarter. Our year-end net cash position, which includes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities less debt was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $71 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance which is higher than our guidance range is a lower-than-expected project spend on Japanese development project and the timing of cash payments for capital expenditures were delayed 2022. Cash flows from operations were $238 million in 2021 versus $37 million in 2020. The fourth quarter compared to [$165 $540 million] in.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Mark.\n\nMark R. Widmar\n\nCEO & Director, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alex. Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to begin by providing an update on our CuRe program. manufacturing process and significantly increased our module outage. While the outcome of the Series 6 program has been a great success as reflected by our record 2021, it is easy to lose sight of the initial challenges we face when scaling high-volume manufacturing with respect to module wattage, throughput and manufacturing yield.\nThrough persistence, resilience and ingenuity, our manufacturing associates methodically resolved these challenges, enabling Series 6 to be the success it is today. Looking forward, CuRe represents an anticipated enhancement to our module performance, which is expected to increase efficiency in life cycle energy.\nOn the November earnings call, at setting and are working to realize the entitlement and high-volume manufacturing schedule to lead line implementation by the end of Q1 2022, with fleet-wide replication timing to be determined upon completion of the lead line. Since the previous earnings call, we have conducted a series of CuRe runs on high-volume production lines in Ohio. And while the trends are for improving module waters and degradation appear favorable, we are still working to realize the full performance entitlement and high-volume manufacturing conditions.\nOver the coming weeks, we intend to conduct further testing, which we believe will inform our views on lead line implementation timing. Again, this implied implementation timing will in turn inform fleet-wide replication timing.\nAs highlighted on our Q2 2021 earnings call, our technology team continues to create new optionality in our technology road map. This optionality enabled us to partially mitigate the effects of CuRe delays through the enhancement of our current Series 6 technology with our top production bin reaching 465 watts at our Ohio and Malaysia factories. In addition to this improved efficiency in module wattage, Series 6 now has a significantly improved long-term degradation rate.\nUsing the improvement metrology to measure degradation at our test sites and further validated by third-party analytic methods and customer site data, the current Series 6 platform now has a 30-year warranted power output degradation rate of 0.3% per year, which is 40% below our previous warranted and represents a potential 4.4 increase in life cycle energy.\nWhile the improved Series 6 nameplate wattage allows us to achieve our targeted exiting 2021 with a top production bin of 460 to 65 watts, the expected overall lifetime energy performance of the current Series 6 program remains under that of CuRe, primarily due to differences in warranted degradation rate and temperature coefficient. That said, looking into 2022, we believe there is a path for our Series 6 module to increase the top production bin to 470 watts with an upside potential of 475 watts exiting the year.\nFurthermore, we are also working on our Series 6 modules produced under the current program to achieve a temperature coefficient similar to what is expected under our CuRe program. I'll discuss additional optionality on our technology road map, including bifaciality and opportunities to drive to higher levels of efficiency later in the call.\nWhile pure implementation has been delayed, the significant improvements in efficiency and degradation of Series 6 has been beneficial to more closely meet our customers' expectations. In connection with our CuRe obligations this year, as discussed on the November earnings call, we have either amended or in an advanced-stage negotiation to amend certain customer contracts utilizing CuRe technology by substituting our enhanced Series 6 product. We expect these amendments to impact 2022 revenue and gross margin by approximately $60 million, which is reflected in our guidance.\nNote, we are still working to finalize certain CuRe-related contract amendments. Relative to our contracted backlog disclosure, approximately 40% of the $60 million is in our contracted backlog disclosure as of December 31, 2021. The balance will be reflected once the remaining contract amendments are completed. These amendments, coupled with the existing and forecasted improvements to our current Series 6 program related to efficiency, module wattage, degradation rate and temperature coefficient as well as other potential enhancements under our technology road map, which I will discuss momentarily, have reduced the requirements to implement our CuRe program by a particular deadline.\nLooking into 2022, we are pleased to end the year with a record backlog on our growth plan well underway with capacity expansions in the U.S. and India. However, 2022 is expected to be a challenging year from an earnings standpoint, both due to external factors and the near-term impact of factory start-up costs associated with our growth plans.\nThe most significant driver impacting the year is the freight market. Ocean freight costs for contracted volumes have risen 200% to 300% from pre-pandemic levels. With our recently concluded carrier negotiations, we expect our 2022 contracted freight rates to increase by more than 100% year-over-year. This compares to a pre-pandemic historic annual percentage increase in the mid- to upper single digits.\nAt the same time, transit times have significantly increased and reliability and availability have significantly worsened, pushing more volume into a higher-priced spot market. Despite record profitability across the shipping industry, this situation currently shows no sign of improvement in 2022. We increasingly are monitoring the growing call for accountability, in particular, from Georgia Senator Warnock, who has demanded an investigation into the apparent price gouging of ocean carriers.\nWe expect sales rate for 2022 to increase to approximately $0.05 a watt. This is a combination of contracting and premium rates. Year-on-year, we expect a better mix of contract to premium rates. But with a substantial increase in contract rates, we expect sales freight costs to increase by approximately $200 million to $240 million year-on-year. Note, our anticipated 2022 shipments were largely booked prior to the shocking increase in freight rates. Relative to our expectations at the time of the negotiation, the module ASP freight rates have more than doubled.\nExternally, there have been a number of events that have adversely impacted our module cost-reduction road map. Firstly, the aforementioned freight market disruption has resulted in higher shipment costs for inbound raw materials. Secondly, the increase in inflation in commodities has both directly and indirectly affected our bill of materials and cost of production. The cost of aluminum, which has increased over 40% between the start and end of 2021, has been a strong headwind against our module costs. We have partially offset this headwind by implementing our Series 6 Plus at our Malaysia and U.S. factories, which reduced the aluminum content of our frames by 10%.\nThirdly, COVID-19 constraints, including travel quarantine restrictions for both First Solar associates and third-party equipment installers, have impacted the timing of our Series 6 Plus and throughput upgrades in Vietnam. While we expect to see a loosening of travel restrictions this year, this uncertainty presents ongoing risk to the timing of upgrades of our last factory in Vietnam to Series 6 Plus, which is expected to be completed in early Q2.\nCOVID-related constraints has also delayed the fleet rollout of our glass optimization program.\nAs mentioned previously, our 2021 cost per watt declined by 6% versus our target of 11%. The shortfall reflective of the items noted above resulted in us missing our cost per watt target reduction by approximately $0.01 per watt. While we expect to continue to improve our cost per watt in 2022, we will not be able to offset a number of the headwinds experienced in 2021, and therefore, our module cost will be higher than our road map by approximately $0.01 per watt. This is expected to negatively impact 2022 gross margin by approximately $100 million.\nWhile there are better sources for perspectives on the most recent activities in Ukraine and Russia and the resulting implication on geopolitics, from our perspective, we are watching closely the tragic events unfold. As of today, our supply chain has not been impacted by the crisis, and we have no current Tier 1 suppliers in the conflict area. It is reasonable to anticipate natural volatility in various supply markets such as metal or fuel should the conflict continue to escalate. We will continue to monitor the situation daily. Internally, the CuRe implementation delays and the expected module wattage improvements will adversely impact our expected cost per watt reduction.\nAnd finally, capacity growth decisions made in 2021 will provide long-term benefits in 2023 and beyond, but provide a headwind to the 2022 P&L start -- due to start-up expenses of $85 million to $90 million. We will continue to navigate these headwinds with a focus on the future.\nAs we invest in realizing the full value of our differentiated thin-film technology, this pivotal year will evolve around continuing significant investments in R&D, new products, manufacturing expansion and employing new contracting strategies, all of which we believe will set the stage for sustained growth in 2023 and beyond.\nAs it relates to R&D, our team has been cultivating optionality and our road map across energy attributes, including efficiency, degradation, temperature coefficient and bifaciality, along with product attributes, including Series 7. More specifically, on the Q2 2021 earnings call, we highlighted that we are deploying prototypes of early-stage bifacial CadTel modules at our test facility, and we're pleased with the initial results. Since then, we have continued to run performance tests on both our current and CuRe device platforms and have gathered more field data, with the results implying the potential for an increase in specific energy.\nAdding bifaciality of CadTel adds to the well understood and valued temperature coefficient, spectral response and partial shading and long-term degradation energy advantages. With a midterm target of a 490-watt bifacial module, we are working diligently to commercialize this technology across our future platforms. We believe the commercial and financial prospectives -- prospects of bifacial CadTel are compelling due to the anticipated higher energy yield with limited CapEx and retooling required in order to integrate a transparent back contact across the fleet.\nTurning to Slide 8. As it relates to expansion, construction of our Series 7 factories is underway, and the schedules are on track with the U.S. factory expected to commence initial production in the first half of 2023 and the India factory by the end of 2023. Once scaled, these factories are expected to lead the fleet in terms of module wattage, efficiency and cost per watt. With a midterm goal of 570-watt monofacial Series 7 module, we see the potential for a meaningful improvement in our module performance.\nAs we significantly increase our nameplate capacity, we believe this anticipated growth, when balanced with liquidity and profitability, will drive contribution margin expansion given our operating expense cost structure is 80% to 90% fixed. As a reflection of this expansion road map and continued optimization of the existing Series 6 suite, we have summarized our expected exit nameplate capacity in production for 2022, 2023 and 2024 on Slide 9.\nAs it relates to our contracting strategy, a feature of our newer framework agreements is the customers entering into a contract today can benefit from the potential utilization of our technology road map. For approximately 7.3 gigawatts of bookings secured prior to the end of the calendar year, we have structured the ASP and product expectations on a baseline wattage and energy performance road map without the full anticipated benefits of our technology road map.\nTo the extent we realize future module technology improvements, including new product design and energy enhancements beyond what is specified in the baseline agreement, the incremental value is expected to result in a corresponding increased ASP. Our ability to contract in this manner provides our customers with clarity of pricing, product availability and delivery timing, enabling them to underwrite PPAs from a position of strength with lower risk to their expected project returns.\nFrom our perspective, there is also strategic rationale to contract in this manner as it provides us confidence in our ability to sell through our expected supply and provides visibility into an expected profit per watt with the potential for meaningful upside to the extent we realize these anticipated technology improvements. This framework allows us to understand the price certainty, the value of our investments across different product enhancements.\nBased on these potential technology improvements, the approximately 7.3 gigawatts of contracted module volumes as of December 31, 2021. Such adjustments if realized could result in additional revenue of up to $0.2 billion, the majority of which would be recognized in 2023. Note this contracting approach has been incorporated in our 2022 bookings year-to-date.\nFrom a sales rate contracting perspective, last year, we began employing module contract structures, which mitigated our exposure to sales freight. As we continue to so bookings 2 to 4 years into the future, these arrangements provide a balanced risk profile for us and our customers, where we are incentivized to minimize sales freight costs that generally provide a cap above which customers are obligated to pay. We started employing these structures in Q2 2021, and approximately 1/3 of our expected 2022 volume includes these provisions.\nIn 2023 and beyond, we anticipate a significant majority of volume will include these types of provisions. Across our contracted backlog, these contracts provide greater clarity into an expected gross profit per watt by providing freight relief through a higher ASP if rates remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn addition to our contracting approach, our expansion strategy, including our third Ohio plant and our new India plant are expected to further derisk our exposure to transoceanic freight costs by bringing manufacturing closer to demand. As these factories scale, our production mix exposed to transoceanic freight risk is expected to decrease by approximately 30 percentage points between 2022 in 2024.\nOverall, from a pricing perspective, the strong demand we are witnessing for our demonstrated CadTel module has enabled us to secure 10.7 gigawatts of bookings for planned deliveries in 2023 at a baseline DSP that is only $0.03 below our planned deliveries in 2022.\nIt is important to note the ASP is essentially composed of 2 components: the module plus sales freight. The baseline ASP generally assumed sales rate will be approximately $0.025 per watt. To the extent that the actual sales rate is above the baseline, the ASP will increase to cover most of, if not all of, the incremental sales rate. When including this variable pricing adjustment and assuming 2022 sales trade environment, we expect our 2023 sales rate adjusted ASP to be approximately $0.01 higher than 2022 on a like basis.\nIn addition, as we secure the significant volume for delivery in 2023, we have been employing a contracting strategy, which enables our customers to benefit from the evolution of our technology and product platform. Realizing the entirety of the benefit of this platform would increase our baseline '23 ASP by up to $0.02 a watt.\nTurning to Slide 10. We continue to see active customer engagement and high levels of interest in both individual projects as well as a multiyear and multi-gigawatt agreements across key markets in the United States and India. Our total bookings opportunities of 53.6 gigawatts remain very robust with 27.7 gigawatts in the mid- to late-stage customer engagement. This opportunity set, coupled with our contracted backlog, is as confident as we continue scaling our manufacturing capacity.\nIncrementally, we continue to evaluate the potential for future capacity expansion. As referenced on the Q3 earnings call, we have started to engage with certain suppliers to ensure we have line of sight on critical path tools for further expansion. We believe strong demand for our CadTel modules, a dynamic technology road map, a strong balance sheet and largely fixed operating expense cost structure are each catalyst as we evaluate expansion.\nWhile this potential expansion may be in the U.S., India or beyond, we are seeking clarity on domestic solar policies to ensure such expansion is well positioned. Note, we have made no such decision at this time, and any capacity expansion are unlikely to contribute to our 2023 production plan.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Alex, who will discuss the financial outlook and provide 2022 guidance.\n\nAlexander R. Bradley\n\nCFO, First Solar, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Before discussing 202 financial guidance, let me provide an update on our cost road map. As initially presented in our February 2021 guidance call, we forecasted a year-end 2020 to year-end 2021 cost for produced reduction of 11%. In November, we revised our reduction assumption to 5% based on increased inbound freight, copper, glass, aluminum and adhesive costs. Our final year-over-year reduction came in at 6%. So of note, the 5% difference between our original assumption and our year-end result remains a headwind in 2022 and is expected to impact full year 2022 cost per watt by approximately $0.01.\nOn a cost watt sold basis, our original year-over-year forecast reduction of 8% was revised to 3% in November, and our final full year results cost per watt sold remained flat year-over-year. This was despite a year-over-year increase in sales rates per watt of 70%. Excluding the effect of sales rate, our cost per watt sold declined by approximately 8% over the same period.\nLooking to 2022, from a glass perspective, we've largely stabilized this cost through long-term predominantly fixed price agreements with domestic suppliers that have economic benefits as we achieve high levels of production. On the Q3 2021 earnings call, we highlighted rig-related delays impacted the start-up timing of a new glass facility to support our Malaysia and Vietnam sites. In addition to competitive pricing, this facility is expected to reduce the cost of inbound freight for our international focus. Given recent improvement in the COVID situation in Southeast Asia, we anticipate this new facility will commence production and begin benefiting cost per watt in the first half of this year.\nAs it relates to aluminum, we anticipate framing costs will be elevated relative to historical norms. We highlighted during our Q3 earnings call that we had a commodity swap contract in place, which covered the majority of our U.S. consumption in 2021. Note many of our aluminum contracts supply our Malaysia and Vietnam factories referenced aluminum date on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, which makes hedging a challenge given foreign investors cannot access the market without a registered local entity in China.\nWhile aluminum pricing remains above pre-pandemic levels, going forward and for both our domestic and international sites, we have several strategies in process to reduce framing costs in the near to midterm: firstly, by differentiating the frame design and reducing cost to modules installed in certain geographies of parts array that are exposed to standard versus high mechanical loads; secondly, by opting the mounting interface for our Series 7 module; and finally, by evaluating alternative materials for the construction of our frame, including a steel back rail for our Series 7 modules in Ohio and India.\nAs it relates to logistics, outbound sales rate is expected to be approximately $0.05 per watt in 2022. For context, prior to the recent dislocation of the global freight market, sales freight cost was generally between $0.02 and $0.025 per watt in 2020.\nNote the aforementioned sales freight contract provisions are expected to provide approximately $0.5 spread evenly on a fleet-wide basis from 2022, which is reflected in our guidance. On a fleet-wide basis, relative to where we acted in 2021, we anticipate reducing our cost per watt produced by 4% to 6% and by the end of 2022. Despite an expected 25% to 40% increase in sales rate per watt, we anticipate our cost per watt sold will be flat between the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nExcluding the effect of sales rate, we anticipate our cost per watt sold will decline by approximately 5% to 8% over the same period. Note, the expected 25% to 40% increase in sales freight per watt in 2022 is expected to be partially offset by contract provisions for sales rate recovery to cover approximately 1/3 of our shipments in the year. By 2023, similar sales rate recovery provisions are expected to cover a significant majority of our shipments.\nTurning to Slide 11. Looking forward, despite near-term inflationary pressure around certain commodity and logistics costs, we believe our revised midterm road map will enable us to continue reducing our Series 6 cost per watt. Starting with efficiency. Our midterm goal is a 490-watt bifacial and 500-watt monofacial module. As a reminder, improvements in module washers generally provided a benefit to each component of cost per watt, including our variable, fixed and sales freight costs.\nSecondly, we're tracking to increase throughput by 9% to 11% in the midterm on our existing manufacturing base, resulting in a fixed cost solution benefit. Thirdly, we continue to see a positive increase our Series 6 manufacturing yield to 98.5% in the midterm. Fourthly, we see opportunities to reduce our bill of material costs by 10% midterm, primarily across framing and glass. And finally, we believe the combination of fitting our module profile, transport optimization and employing risk-sharing mechanisms in our customer contracting could lead to a 40% to 50% reduction in net sales for freight cost. Now this expected reduction includes a combination of cost recapture through the aforementioned sales rate customer contracting strategy and increased module for shipping container.\nSeparately, as it relates to Series 7, we anticipate both our India and Ohio factories may cost per watt fully ramped lower than our current lowest-cost factories in Vietnam. Combined with the benefit of locating supply near to demand and reducing the cost of sales rate, Series 7 is expected to reduce cost per watt and net sales freight costs in total by approximately $0.01 to $0.02 relative to Series 6.\nWith that context in mind, I'll discuss the assumptions including our 2022 financial guidance. Turn to Slide 12. Starting with legacy systems items. We're pleased with the potential value and long-term benefits of selling our Japan development and O&M platform. While there's been no assurance that we will enter into an agreement for a transaction, our guidance assumes a gain of approximately $270 million to $290 million, which would be recognized as a gain on sale of businesses, which lies between gross margin and operating income on the P&L.\nAs we previously assumed ongoing asset sales from the development portfolio, which benefit gross margin, this change in assumption is a headwind to gross margin in 2022. Furthermore, until any sale is closed, overhead costs associated with the Japan platform will also continue impacting operating expenses.\nIn addition, we signed an agreement to sell our remaining international O&M contracts outside Japan. Upon closing, which is expected in the first half of 2022, we expect to recognize a pretax gain on sale showing the income statement between gross margin and operating income of approximately $10 million.\nAs it relates to power-generating assets, we're evaluating whether to continue holding our Luz del Norte asset in Chile where the pursue sale of this project. The purchase sale would require coordination with the project lenta previously discussed on our November earnings call could result in an impairment charge in the future if we are unable to recover our net carrying value in the project. No impact from any possible sales of this project is included in our guidance for 2022.\n2022 shipments are expected to be between 8.9 and 9.4 gigawatts, which exceeds our production plan for the year of 8.2 to 8.8 gigawatts due to higher-than-expected inventory levels in year-end 2021. Our factoring and factory expansion -- our expansion of factory upgrade road maps are expected to impact operating income by approximately $95 million to $105 million. This comprised of start-up expenses of $85 million to $90 million, primarily in turbine factories in Ohio and India. As previously mentioned, we're planning to implement Series 6 Plus upgrades in Vietnam and other upgrades in 2022. These upgrades will require downtime resulting in estimated underutilization losses of $10 million to $15 million. We anticipate these improvements will contribute meaningfully to our 2023 production plan.\nOur liquidity position has been a strategic differentiator in an industry that's historically fires growth without results long-term capital structure. For example, we're one of the few solar companies that both entered and exited the last decade. And our strong balance sheet enable us to weather periods of volatility and also pursue growth opportunities.\nAdditionally, we were able to self-fund our Series 6 transition whilst maintaining our strong liquidity position, ending 2021 with $1.6 billion of net cash. Based on our existing liquidity position, cost was expecting operating cash flow from our existing Series 6 factories, we believe we can self-finance our expansion road map. However, based on the opportunity to secure a competitive terms and strategic benefits to the partner when entering into a new market, we may raise debt financing to support the construction of our new factory in India.\nAnd now kind of 2022 guidance ranges on Slide 13. Our net sales guidance is between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, which is predominantly module segment revenue. Gross margin is expected to be between $155 million and $215 million, which includes $165 million to $225 million of module segment gross margin and negative $10 million impact from other legacy activities. Module segment gross margin includes underutilization losses of $10 million to $15 million.\nAs discussed, we anticipate sales rate will be a significant headwind in 2022, and we anticipate sales rate will reduce our module segment gross margin by 18 to 20 percentage points for the full year 2022. SG&A expense is expected to total $170 million to $175 million compared to $170 million in '21 and $223 million in 2020. As indicated on the guidance call last February, we anticipated the sale of our U.S. project development business to result in annualized savings of approximately $45 million to $50 million, of which approximately 60% sits in the operating expense line. We track well relative to this cost-reduction plan and pleased with the expected savings on a go forward.\nR&D expense is expected to total $110 million to $115 million compared $99 million and $94 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We continue to grow our manufacturing capacity was to intend to add additional headcount for our R&D team to further invest in advanced research initiatives. SG&A and R&D expense combined, we expect to total $280 million to $290 million, and total operating expenses of $85 million to $90 million of production start-up expense are expected to be between $365 million and $380 million.\nOperating income is expected to be between $55 million and $150 million and is inclusive of an expected approximately $280 million to $300 million gain on sale related to the aforementioned Japan project development and international O&M transactions and $95 million to $105 million of combined underutilization cost plant start-up expense.\nSo the nonoperating items, we expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net to negative $20 million to $30 million, which is predominantly driven by FX and interest expense related to the Japanese project development. Full year tax expense is forecast to be $35 million to $55 million. This results in full year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance range of 0 to [$0.50]. Note from an earnings cadence perspective, we anticipate our earnings profile will improve gradually over the course of the year, a significant impact in the quarter in which any sale of the Japan development platform was closed.\nCapital expenditures in 2022 are expected to range from $850 million to $1.1 billion as we advance the construction of our Ohio and India plant and upgrades to the fleet and invest in other R&D-related programs. Our year-end 2022 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.1 billion and $1.35 billion. The decrease from our 2021 year-end net cash balance is primarily due to capital expenditures associated with the building of our Ohio and India manufacturing plants, which we expect will be partially offset by financing proceeds.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand has been robust with 11.8 gigawatts of net bookings in the previous earnings call. Our opportunity pipeline continues to grow with a global opportunity set of 53.6 gigawatts, including mid- to late-stage opportunities of 27.7 gigawatts.\nOn the slide side, we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to exit 2024 approximately 16 gigawatts of capacity. We see significant midterm opportunity for improvements on module efficiency cost in energy tricks. We ended 2021, with full year EPS of $4.38 and are forecasting full year 2020 earnings per share of [$0.60].\nWith that, I'll conclude our prepared remarks and over the call for questions. Operator?"

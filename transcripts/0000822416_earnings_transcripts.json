Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer. You may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call as we look forward to discussing PulteGroup's third quarter operating and financial results. With me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Jim Ossowski, Executive Vice President and CFO; and David Carrier, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nAs always, a copy of our earnings release this morning's presentation have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today.\nI would highlight that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining this morning's call. I look forward to updating you on PulteGroup's strong Q3 financial results and underlying business strategies that have positioned our operations for ongoing success.\nSpecific to the company's third quarter results, our homebuilding operations successfully closed over 7,500 homes, which helped to drive another quarter of overall strong financial results. As Jim will expand on shortly, I am pleased to highlight that PulteGroup generated third quarter home sale revenues of $4.2 billion, operating margins of 16.8% and earnings of $2.96 per share. And given our focus on returns, I would also highlight that the company has delivered a return on equity of 21% for the trailing 12 months. These results reflect the strength of our diversified operating model, which continues to serve us well in a U.S. housing market where home buying demand has been challenging.\nGeographically, our diversified operating platform that spans across 47 major markets remains a key strength. While our broad reach across buyer groups, first-time move up and active adult provides unique strategic advantages that are helping us to successfully navigate today's demand dynamics. Specifically in today's market, weaker consumer confidence and stretched affordability are limiting opportunities with first-time buyers, while demand has been more resilient within the active adult segment, where we, through our Del Webb brand, are a recognized leader. For those of you that have not had the opportunity to visit the Del Webb community, think Disney Cruise ship for those 55 and older.\nAt 500 to 1,000 homes, Del Webb communities are larger and offer amenity packages that can include everything from tennis, pickleball, fitness, spa, to social activities, food and dining. But more than anything, Del Webb communities offer personal connections in a place to belong. As we highlighted on previous calls, we are capitalizing on the brand recognition and power of the Del Webb name through our new Del Webb Explorer communities. Our new Del Webb Explorer brand is designed to serve today's GenX buyers looking for the amazing luxury lifestyle but without the age restriction. We are in the early stages of planning a get to no Del Webb event in 2026, and we will keep you posted on the timing.\nGetting back to our results, in the third quarter, traffic to our communities was higher than last year. Although conversion rates fluctuated from week to week, based on feedback from our sales associates, consumers remain engaged in the home buying process, but they are proceeding with caution given concerns, which I think range from economic weakness and job stability to stretch affordability. I think that is why by a response to the decrease in interest rates was more muted than we experienced in other periods of recent rate declines.\nWe have always said that interest rates are a positive, lower interest rates are a positive for housing demand, but rates don't operate in a vacuum. There is a clear offset if rates are coming down because the economy is slowing and people are worried about their jobs. I believe that is the scenario we are experiencing right now. That being said, I would note that our Q3 absorption rate of 2.2 homes per month was consistent with our pre-COVID average, although down from last year's third quarter absorption rate of 2.4. Again, while demand conditions differ by market and buyer segment, we would characterize U.S. housing demand as good, albeit competitive and with some challenges. But one in which our size and scale allow us to compete effectively.\nAs discussed on prior calls, earlier in the year, we proactively made decisions to better align production levels with sales volumes. In the third quarter, we started 6,557 homes, which effectively equaled our Q3 sales pace. This pace is consistent with our strategy to match starts with sales as we work toward an appropriate level of inventory relative to current market demand. When setting our starts pace, our goal is to have the right level of inventory to meet core demand while avoiding excess finished spec production, thus allowing our sales team to sell through a position of strength.\nWith our average build cycle now down to just 106 days, we can carry less inventory and still be responsive to any demand acceleration in Q4 or as we enter 2026. Along with adjusting our pace of production, earlier in the year, we moderated our planned land spend for 2025 and remain on track to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development. At over $5 billion, our land spend would be down 5% from last year, but we remain in a strong position with a healthy land pipeline. A pipeline that can enable us to grow the business when home buying demand increases.\nLet me finish my comments by recognizing and saying thank you to the entire Pulte team. They have truly done an outstanding job navigating 2025's evolving market conditions, while staying focused on delivering outstanding quality and service to our home buyers. You've done an amazing job team.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim for a detailed review of our third quarter results. Jim?\n\nJames L. Ossowski\n\nVice President-Finance & Controller, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to review PulteGroup's Q3 financial results.\nIn the third quarter, Pulte's net new orders totaled 6,638 homes to 6% lower than the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in Q3 net new orders reflects a 10% decrease in absorption pace, partially offset by a 5% increase in our average community count to 1,002 communities for the quarter. As a percentage of starting backlog, our cancellation rate for the third quarter was 12%, which is modestly up from 10% last year.\nOn a sequential basis, the Q3 cancellation rate was up 60 basis points from the second quarter, which tells us that most home buyers once under contract remain committed to their own purchase. As Ryan noted, our third quarter absorption pace is 2.2 homes per month compared with 2.4 homes per month in Q3 of last year. Higher demand in the quarter reflected a typical seasonal pattern, although core demand in 2025 has been below what we experienced in 2024.\nBroken down by buyer group, Net new orders among first-time buyers were down 14% from last year, and our move-up business was down 3%. As has been the case throughout 2025, our active adult business remains our strongest buyer group, as net new orders increased 7% over Q3 of last year. In the third quarter, net new orders within our active adult business benefited from both an increase in community count and absorption base. Active adult sales represented 24% of Q3 net new orders. And as we have shared on previous calls, most of these homes will be delivered in 2026.\nHome sale revenues in the third quarter totaled $4.2 billion, which is down 2% from last year's Q3 revenues of $4.3 billion. The decline in home sale revenues reflects a 5% decrease and closing volumes to 7,529 homes, partially offset by a 3% increase in average sales price of $564,000. Closing ASP benefited from the geographic mix of deliveries realized in Q3 of this year. By buyer group, closings in the third quarter were comprised 39% first-time, 39% move-up and our active adult business represented 22%. This is generally in line with our mix in the third quarter of last year when our closings were 40% first-time, 40% move-up and 20% active adult.\nReflective of Q3 orders and closing volume, we ended the third quarter with a backlog of 9,888 homes valued at $6.2 billion. In the third quarter of last year, our backlog was $12,089 homes with a value of $7.7 million. We ended Q3 with 15,096 homes in production, of which 7,369 or 49% were spec homes. In absolute numbers, our quarter-end inventory of spec homes was down 1% from the third quarter of last year and down 16% for almost 1,400 houses from the start of this year. Our field teams have done an excellent job managing starts as they work to balance inventory levels with consumer demand.\nGiven current sales trends, and specifically the number of built-to-order contracts we are executing, specular likelihood remain closer to 50% of production for the next several quarters, which is higher than our targeted range of 40% to 45%. Since spec homes continue to make up a large percentage of overall sales, we are comfortable with our strategy for managing our spec position. Based on sales activity and a number of homes in our production pipeline, we expect to close between 7,200 to 7,600 homes in the fourth quarter. Given this guide for expected Q4 closing, the math tells you that we could exceed our previous guidance, this full year closings likely end up in the range of 29,000 to 29,400 homes.\nWe still have homes to sell close to achieve these numbers who are focused on converting spec inventory into closing and finishing the year strong. Given our backlog, production pipeline and recent order trends, we are still guiding to our average sales price of closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000 in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2025. Looking at our land pipeline. We continue to expect our community count for the fourth quarter to be 3% to 5% higher than the comparable prior year period. In line with our previous guidance, we reported a third quarter gross margin of 26.2%, which on a sequential basis is down 80 basis points from Q2.\nPulte's third quarter gross margin is inclusive of higher incentives incurred during the period resulting from demand conditions and local competitive dynamics. Incentives in the third quarter were 8.9% of gross sales price, which compares with 7.0% last year and 8.7% in the second quarter of this year. While incentives move slightly higher, team is doing an excellent job controlling build costs, which at $79 per square foot were consistent with the prior year and with the second quarter of 2025.\nLet me just add a quick update here to our prior comments regarding the impact of tariffs. At this time, we estimate that tariffs will effectively have little to no impact on our closings in Q4 of 2025, but they could increase build costs by roughly $1,500 per home starting in 2026. We will provide a more definitive estimate on tariffs when we report our fourth quarter earnings in January.\nFactoring in current demand conditions, the generally competitive local market dynamics and our goal of reducing excess finished spec inventory, we now expect fourth quarter gross margins in the range of 25.5% to 26.0%. For the third quarter, SG&A expense was $401 million or 9.4% of wholesale revenue. This is comparable to prior SG&A expense of $407 million and 9.4% of home sale revenues. In the face of current market dynamics, we remain focused on appropriately controlling our overhead spend and finding opportunities to lower expenses while still delivering fulfill quality and buying experience for which Pulte has known. Given the success of our efforts, we are maintaining our previous guide for full year 2025 SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.5% to 9.7% of wholesale revenues.\nOur financial services operations reported third quarter pretax income of $44 million, which is down from $55 million Q3 of last year. Pretax income for the quarter was impacted by lower closing volumes in our homebuilding operations and a lower capture rate in the period. Our mortgage capture rate in the third quarter was 84% [ to ] 87% last year. For the third quarter, PulteGroup's reported pretax income was $768 million. In the period, our tax expense was $182 million or an effective tax rate of 23.7%. Our effective tax rate in Q3 benefited from the purchase of renewable energy tax credits. For the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, assuming no discrete period specific tax events.\nWe reported third quarter net income of $568 million or $2.96 per share. In the third quarter of last year, company reported net income of $698 million or $3.35 per share. PulteGroup's third quarter earnings per share was calculated based on 198 million diluted shares outstanding. Our share count is down 5% from the prior year as we continue to execute our stock repurchase program. In this year's third quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares for $300 million. Through the first 9 months of 2025, the company repurchased 8.2 million common shares for a total of $900 million or an average price of $109.81 per share. At quarter end, we have $1.3 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.\nConsistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition [indiscernible] in the third quarter with 54% deployed towards the development of our existing land set. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.8 billion in land acquisition and development as we work to maintain a reliable pipeline of near and long-term [ billable ] bonds. We ended the third quarter with approximately 240,000 lots under control. On a sequential basis, down 9,000 lots in the second quarter as we elected to walk away from certain option deals that were years out and early in the impediment process. These actions are consistent with our disciplined land underwriting practices and capital allocation process. Our ability to proactively manage our land pipeline demonstrates the importance of our differentiated approach to rolling critical land assets.\nAs we have highlighted in the past, over 80% of Pulte's land options with the underlying land seller, the remainder structure was one-off transactions with a select and [indiscernible]. We remain disciplined in executing our option strategy and focus on enhancing project returns and mitigating market rent. Based on our operating results in the first 2 quarters of 2025 and adjustments we have made to this year's production and planned land spend, we still expect cash flow generation for the full year to be approximately $1.4 million.\nLet me close with a few comments about our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $1.5 billion of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 11.2%. Adjusting for the cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio at quarter end was 1.1%.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Before opening the call to questions, I wanted to provide some additional color as to the market conditions we are experiencing.\nGenerally, buyer demand in the third quarter reflected a typical seasonal pattern, although buyer demand at the local market level also reflected new and existing home inventories, which in a number of markets remain elevated. Seasonal demand trends remain on track through the first few weeks of October with traffic and buyer interest generally comparable to what we experienced in Q3. From a sales standpoint, we are now in the seasonally slowest part of the year, but we remain optimistic that lower rates in combination with the strong economy and higher confidence can ultimately work to energize new and just as importantly, existing home sales. For all those reasons, we focus on the new home market, but demand within existing home market remains soft, resulting in elevated levels of inventory. The extent to lower rates can revitalize existing wholesales, it will be a positive for U.S. housing.\nSpecific to PulteGroup's third quarter results, we experienced better home buying demand in parts of the Midwest, Northeast in the Southeast in markets ranging from Cleveland, Charlotte and the coastal Carolinas and Tennessee and D.C., Northern Virginia. I'm also extremely pleased to get to call out the relative strength of our Florida operations as our teams there continue to execute at a very high level. As you can see in this morning's press release, Third quarter net new orders for the state of Florida increased by 2% over the prior year. Market conditions are competitive. Our local teams are led by experienced operators who have assembled exceptional land pipelines over the years.\nAs has been the case for much of the year, consumer demand in our Texas and Western markets remained soft in the third quarter. You have heard me say before that we can't be margin proud. So when operating in more difficult market conditions, our local teams understand the importance of finding the market and turning assets while not giving away price needlessly. That is the approach we continue to take as we compete for sales and work to sell through finished inventory. I think it's fair to say that home buying demand in 2025 has been more challenging than the industry was an anticipating. And while it has been more challenging, I think PulteGroup's year-to-date results continue to demonstrate the importance of our diversified and balanced approach to the business. With a platform that extends across multiple markets and buyer groups and a business model that allows for greater operating flexibility, we continue to deliver strong cash flows and high returns.\nBefore wrapping up, I think it's appropriate to offer some thoughts about comments issued recently by President Trump regarding the need for more housing and better affordability. We agree with the President's perspective as it is consistent with industry estimates that routinely reference and underbuild in this country of 3 million to 4 million houses. While the supply deficit certainly has an impact on affordability generally, the complexities of the new home construction industry dictate that tackling a problem of this scale requires a coordinated and comprehensive approach that brings together federal, state and local leaders working in partnership with the new home construction industry.\nWe share the President's focus on housing in wanting to make the American dream more attainable for everyone. We look forward to helping address the issue of housing in America and working with the administration in developing actionable solutions that are consistent with Pulte's long-term strategic plans.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We are prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And I'll ask Rob to explain the process and open the call for questions."

My name is Jenny, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jenny. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call as we look forward to discussing PulteGroup's second quarter operating and financial results. With me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO Jim Ossowski, Executive Vice President and CFO; and David Carrier, Senior VP of Finance.\nAs always, a copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. I will highlight that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call. As always, I appreciate the opportunity to update you on PulteGroup and our work in delivering outstanding business results. PulteGroup's earnings release details another quarter of positive financial performance that the company delivered strong closings, gross margins and overhead leverage. Consistent with such results, we also continue to realize high returns as the company generated a return on equity of 23% for the trailing 12 months ended June 30. In a few minutes, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a detailed review of the numbers.\nOur results demonstrate that in an operating environment that has grown more challenging, our diversified and balanced operating model offer strategic benefits to help sustain performance. In this competitive operating environment, we are reaping the advantages of being diversified across all buyer groups, particularly our industry-leading position in serving active adult buyers. Specific to this group, I am pleased to report that we are experiencing a great response to our newest Del Webb and Del Webb Explorer communities as buyers embrace the active lifestyle at the core of [ Bols ] brand. As it relates to this part of our business, I would highlight that along with being among our higher priced homes, these homes typically represent our highest margin closings. Along with the broad customer base, we have geographic breadth and market diversity that are again proving their value.\nOur business results continue to demonstrate the benefit of having large and stable operations in the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast, as these work to offset some of the more challenging market conditions the industry is facing out West and in Texas. And I'm pleased to highlight the relative strength of our Florida operations displayed in the quarter as net new orders increased 2% over the last -- over last year.\nBeyond Florida remaining a beneficiary of long-established migration patterns in this country, we have exceptional land positions throughout the region. I would also highlight that our operating teams across Florida are second to none, and I truly believe we are seeing the importance of having such experienced leadership in place.\nAnd finally, our ability to serve both the buyer who needs the immediacy of an in-production spec home as well as the buyers seeking to build a more personalized home from scratch remains an important competitive advantage. The former allows us to effectively serve the first-time buyer and use our national rate incentive, while the latter allows the buyer to select a lot and the options that they value most, which in turn provides margin enhancement opportunities for us.\nThrough the first half of 2025, we realized an average of $109,000 of options and lot premiums which is an important driver of PulteGroup superior gross margins. The half of the year, including the important selling -- spring selling season now complete, I thought it would be useful to offer a few high-level comments on the demand dynamics we have been experiencing.\nOver the past few quarters, our industry has routinely referenced demand conditions being volatile and that remains the most accurate description of buyer activity in the first and second quarters. Within a market demonstrating a typical seasonal pattern from month to home, we do see days of strong demand followed by days displaying a step-down in sign up activity.\nFeedback from [ Wood ] beat homebuyers indicates a variety of concerns ranging from affordability and the inability to sell an existing home to a slowing economy and the fear of potentially losing their job. And some, I think consumer confidence is uncertain at best and confident that something that's difficult to solve with a lower price or higher incentive. This is where our disciplined approach to the market to the market focuses on capturing incremental volume without giving up too much price.\nIf we look beyond the day-to-day volatility, the overall demand environment isn't far off our historical pre-COVID absorption paces. Our Q1 absorption pace of 2.7 homes per month was consistent with our pre-coated averages, while our Q2 absorptions of 2.4 homes per month were just under our 2.6 pre-COVID average. In other words, our demand is reasonable, but we are happy to compete for each home sale, and we are seeing meaningful differences in demand strengths and weaknesses from market to market.\nOne of the most encouraging dynamics that I would highlight is that a drop in interest rates does stimulate traffic into our communities and a corresponding increase in sign of activity. This was clearly evident as rates dropped in the last 2 weeks of June as well as at different points during our first and second quarters. I think this supports our view that people desire home ownership and remain actively engaged in the process. They just -- they just need to value equation to work and to have confidence in their financial circumstances to feel more comfortable signing the contracts.\nGiven the demand conditions we have experienced in the first 6 months and an overall heightened sense of uncertainty among consumers, we have taken actions to adjust our operations to today's market conditions. We made the decision early in the year to slow our land spend, reduce our starts rate and we have worked aggressively to sell excess spec inventory. We have been proactive and very tactical in responding to demand conditions as they exist in each market.\nOur focus on achieving high returns doesn't change. but the approach may as we balance the primary drivers of pace and price within each community.\nBefore turning the call over to Jim, I do want to recognize and thank our incredibly talented team as they continue to deliver the highest quality homes and customer experience while still achieving exceptional financial results.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim Ossowski.\n\nJames L. Ossowski\n\nVice President-Finance & Controller, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As Ryan indicated, while there are challenges within stays as market are certainly positives to be taken PulteGroup's second quarter results and how we have positioned our business for long-term success. Net new orders in the second quarter totaled 7,083 homes, which is down 7% from last year's second quarter.\nThe year-over-year decline in net new orders for Q2 reflects a 13% decrease in overall absorption pace, partially offset by a 6% increase in our average community income for the quarter to 994. As a percentage of starting backlog, our cancellation rate for the second quarter was 11%, which is consistent with Q1 and only 1.5 point increase from Q2 of last year. Stability in the cancellation rate suggests that most homebuyers remain comfortable and confident completing their home purchase once they are under contract.\nOur second quarter absorption pace of 2.4 homes per month was down from 2.7 homes per month in Q2 of last year. The year-over-year differential of roughly 3 homes is fairly constant through the 3 months of Q2. Said another way, we experienced a typical seasonal trend and the core demand is simply running at a lower pace this year.\nLooking at our net new orders by buyer group. The first time in move-up buyers were down 9% and 14%, respectively, from last year, while our active adult business was up 9%. Specific to our active adult business, in addition to the underlying demand among these buyers, we are benefiting from new community openings coming online this year. To be clear, while these active adult orders make up 24% of the total this quarter, they will primarily deliver its 2026 closing. It is fair to say that we are pleased to see the new Del Webb communities being well received.\nSecond quarter home sale revenues of $4.3 billion were down 4% from prior year revenues of $4.4 billion. The decrease in wholesale revenues was driven entirely by lower closing volume as deliveries were down 6% to 7,639 homes. The decrease in closing was partially offset by a 2% increase in average sales price of $550 million. By buyer group, closings in the second quarter were 38% first time, 42% move up and 20% active adult.\nIn the second quarter of last year, the closings mix was 40% first time, 37% with [indiscernible] 23% active adult. Given second quarter orders and closing activities, we ended the quarter with a backlog of 10,779 homes valued at $6.8 billion. In comparable prior year period, company's backlog totaled 12,982 homes, the value of $8.1 million.\nIn the second quarter, we started 7,220 homes, which is down 11% from the 8,146 homes we started in the second quarter of 2024. Given the volatility and demand that we have experienced thus far in 2025, we continue to carefully manage our start base to better align our available inventory with current rate of sales. As such, we ended Q2 with a total of 16,105 homes in production, of which 47% were spec homes. On a sequential basis, our inventory of 7,606 spec homes under production, is down 3% from the first quarter and up 13% from the start of the year.\nBased on expected home sales and starts, we anticipate our spec inventory to be within our target range of 40% to 45% of overall units in production by year-end. In managing specs, we are trying to achieve multiple objectives including having enough units to meet higher demand, while still allowing our sales counselors to sell from a position of strength.\nAs the market evolves over the third and fourth quarters, we'll be making decisions as to how much production is start as we plan ahead for 2026. Given the recent pace of sales and stage of units under construction, we currently expect to close between 7,200 and 7,600 homes in the third quarter. As it relates to the full year, given our level of backlog and a slightly lower absorption paces we have realized over the past several months we are refining our full year 2025 closing guide to 29,000 homes.\nWe still expect the average sales price of closings to be in the range of $560,000 and $570,000 each in the remaining quarters and in turn for the full year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our Q3 and Q4 edge community count to be 3% to 5% higher than the comparable prior year period. For our second quarter, we are reporting gross margin of 27.0%, which is at the top end of our guide.\nRelative to our guidance, our Q2 gross margin reflects both the benefit of a favorable mix of homes closed as well as the headwind of higher incentives. Incentives for the second quarter were 8.7% of gross sales price which is up from 6.3% last year and on a sequential basis, up from 8.0%. As we assess the back half of 2025, we are affirming our guidance as we expect gross margins in the third and fourth quarters to be in the range of 26.0% to 26.5%.\nDuring our Q1 call, we indicated a potential impact of tariffs of approximately $5,000 per unit that could hit in the latter part of Q4. At this time, we now expect any impact from tariffs in Q4 to be lower, which will help offset the cost of elevated [ insets ]. While we have reasonable visibility into giving this gross margin guide, I will note that we still need to sell and close a meaningful number of spectrums to achieve our closings guide.\nSG&A expense in the second quarter totaled $390 million or 9.1% of wholesale revenues. In the prior year, our reported SG&A expense of $361 million or 8.1% of home sale revenues, included a $52 million pretax insurance benefit are within the period. We remain diligent in controlling our overhead costs, and we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2025 to be in the range of 9.5% to 9.7% of home sale revenues.\nFor the second quarter, our financial services operations reported pretax income of $43 million, down from $63 million in the prior year. The decrease in pretax income for the quarter reflects the impact of lower closing volumes slightly higher expenses. Capturing in the second quarter was 85% compared with 86% last year. PulteGroup's reported pretax income for the second quarter was $807 million. For the period, we recorded a tax expense of $199 million or an effective tax rate of 24.6%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, excluding the impact of any discrete period specific tax events.\nOn the bottom line, we reported second quarter net income of $608 million or $3.03 per share. In comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $809 million or $3.83 per share. Prior year results are inclusive of $0.25 per share related to an insurance benefit and favorable resolution of certainty same tax matters. Our second quarter earnings per share was calculated based on 201 million shares, which is a decrease of 5% from the prior year as the company continues to execute its share repurchase program.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares to $300 million at an average price of $100.54 per share. Through the first 2 quarters of 2025, the company has returned $600 million to shareholders through the share repurchase activities. Along with allocating excess capital back to shareholders, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the second quarter.\nThrough the first 6 months of 2025, we invested $2.5 billion in [indiscernible] acquisition and development which keeps us on track with full year guidance of investing $5 billion in land and development. Inclusive of these most recent investments, we have further advanced our land pipeline in 2 critical areas.\nFirst, we have increased the total number of [indiscernible control to approximately 250,000. And second, we continue to make progress on becoming more land [indiscernible] as option last now comprise [ 16 ]% for a total land pipeline. This is gratifying progress we are making towards achieving our target of having a land pipeline be comprised of 70% options and 30% owned lives. In just the past 12 months, we have added almost 30,000 option lots to the pipeline or reducing our old block count by approximately [ 4,000 ] months. Relative to peers, for land options are differentiated and that the vast majority of [indiscernible] options are with the underlying land seller for one-off transactions with a select number of land bankers.\nAnd assessing each and every land transaction [indiscernible] the balance in evaluating the cost versus the risk mitigation opportunities that result from optioning the land parcel.\nAs Ryan noted earlier, they're an operating environment that has become more challenging we're adhering to our disciplined business practices and making any needed adjustments consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow and high returns. On system with its focus, we continue to expect cash flow generation for 2025 to be approximately $1.4 million.\nLooking at the balance sheet, PulteGroup continues to maintain a strong and highly supportive financial position. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and debt to capital ratio of 11.4%. Adjusting for the cash balance and net debt to capital ratio at quarter end was 2.8%.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. As I discussed at the outset of this call, beyond the overall volatile demand dynamics, we are seeing meaningful differences in relative by our strength across our portfolio. More specifically, in the second quarter, we experienced very positive demand conditions in key markets in the Midwest and Southeast, including Cleveland, Chicago, Indianapolis, Charlotte and the Coastal Carolinas.\nI would also call out the positive net new order numbers realized in Florida as our operations grew orders 2% over the prior year. Within the state, gains in our Central, West and Southwest markets were partially offset by softer numbers in our Northeast and Southeast Florida operations. We fully appreciate there is inventory on the ground and builders are competing hard, but we are selling from exceptional communities following years of hard work to assemble an outstanding land pipeline.\nAs shown in this morning's press release, we are experiencing less favorable demand out West and in our Texas markets. Within these geographies, we are seeing some of our biggest challenges in Dallas, Boston and our Northern and Southern California markets, most notably among move-up buyers. While these are very different markets serving different buyers and price points, they do share some commonalities. These are markets that have realized significant price appreciation in recent years and have a meaningful tech employment component within their local economies.\nGiven the tremendous variation in market conditions, it's so important to have experienced operators who know what actions are needed. In some markets, this means raising prices starting homes and pushing aggressively to get new communities open. In other markets, it means slowing starts, focusing on selling finished inventory and taking the opportunity to retrade or even exit land deals. With an average tenure approaching 20 years among our division presidents, we have experienced leaders running our operations.\nAnd finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to note a press release issued earlier this month announcing plans for Deb Still to retire at the end of this year. Then is currently the Vice Chair of Holding Financial Services. But if you have had any involvement with monthly over the years, [indiscernible] a force in the mortgage industry.\nWe, and the entire lending industry have benefited from Deb's for decades of insightful leadership and tireless work to make the industry better and more accessible to all home buyers.\nOn behalf of our Board, the company and the shareholders of Pulte, I want to thank Deb for the success she has delivered and the foundation she established and upon which we will continue to build going forward.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible. during the remaining time of this call we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And Jenny, if you would again explain the process, we will open the call for questions."

My name is Kelvin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer portion. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Kelvin. Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to today's call. We look forward to discussing our first quarter operating and financial results. With me today are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Jim Ossowski, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nAs always, a copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today. I would highlight that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance.\nActual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with everyone today. In addition to discussing PulteGroup's Q1 results this morning, I will also share our views on the current macro environment and how our business model and execution against our strategic initiatives are helping us navigate today's evolving market conditions.\nLet me start by recognizing the incredible work our teams did in delivering PulteGroup's strong first quarter results. Given the crosscurrents the housing industry has encountered in 2025, we believe our results show the value of PulteGroup's proven operating model, balanced portfolio and the expertise of our local operating teams. In what proved to be a dynamic operating environment, we met or exceeded our guidance in delivering over 6,500 homes gross margins of 27.5% net income of $523 million and most importantly, a trailing 12-month return on equity of 25.4%.\nAs the country moves through economic cycles, the housing industry will inevitably encounter periods when we are experiencing changes in the operating environment. I truly believe that the balanced and highly diversified operating model that we have built over the past decade in combination with our strategic focus on generating high returns over the housing cycle offer important and competitive advantages.\nOur national footprint and strategy of serving all buyer groups with a targeted offering of spec and build-to-order homes, along with our broader capacity to use both price and/or pace to drive returns, give our operators more flexibility when navigating periods of economic transition.\nIn the back half of 2024, many of our meetings with analysts and investors included questions about housing demand and the state of the housing cycle. In response to these questions, we indicated that the spring selling season of 2025 would provide the best opportunity to assess the condition of today's homebuying consumer.\nHaving reached the midway point of the spring selling season I wanted to provide a few thoughts on what we've experienced and how we are responding. First and foremost, I strongly believe people still aspire to homeownership. And if you can provide the right value equation, they are excited to get into a new home.\nWe saw this as the first quarter progressed and demonstrated a typical seasonal pattern with traffic, gross orders and net new orders trending higher as we move through the quarter. Within the quarter, we also saw the level of home buying activity respond positively to the 30-year mortgage rate dropping below 7% and which allowed roughly 20% of our divisions to increase prices within many of our communities.\nConsistent with the relative strength we've seen among move-up and active adult buyers over the past few quarters, we saw the average spend on options and lot premiums per home climbed to $110,000 in Q1. This is up from the $102,000 and $107,000 in the first and fourth quarters, respectively, of last year. The financial strength of move-up and active adult home buyers is why we have purposely aligned 60% of our portfolio to serve these key buyer groups.\nHowever, the quarter also saw consumers continuing to face affordability challenges that exists for would-be homebuyers in metro regions across the country. From the high absolute selling prices of today's homes to the resulting high monthly mortgage payments, consumers are struggling with the affordability challenges when it comes to purchasing a home. These headwinds have only been exacerbated recently by growing concerns about the potential for a slowing economy.\nAs one of the nation's largest homebuilders, we have developed and deployed a variety of tools to help consumers overcome their personal homeownership hurdles. This includes offering new product designs and more efficient floor plans as well as offering meaningful incentives, including programs that can offer consumers a below-market rate on a full 30-year fixed rate mortgage.\nWe leaned into incentives a little more heavily in the first quarter as we executed on our plan to reduce excess spec inventory by actively selling our in process and finished stock inventory while also adjusting our start pace to better match current demand.\nAs a result, our incentive rate increased 8% for the period, but we lowered specs to 47% of production, down from 53% in the fourth quarter while still reporting strong gross margins of 27.5%. In sum, higher interest and activity in the first quarter were directionally in line with our planning expectations heading into the period.\nAs we've moved from March to April, however, we have seen consumers at all price points impacted by changing macro conditions and any resulting decline in overall consumer confidence. Whether it's the volatility in the stock market, concerns about tariff-induced inflation, the fluctuation in interest rates or the growing talk of recession, demand in April has been more volatile and less predictable day-to-day.\nWe can certainly empathize with our customers' concerns as our business is happy to adapt and manage through constantly changing and shifting tariff landscape and potential cost of which could be significant. While our Q1 build costs were effectively flat on a year-over-year basis, proposed tariffs has the potential to add thousands of dollars to the cost of construction.\nWe are a builder with 75 years of experience and a resilient operating model and as tariffs have been imposed or proposed our cycle-tested procurement teams have developed and began implementing response strategies.\nLet me now turn the call over to Jim Ossowski. You will recall that in February, Jim officially assumed his responsibilities as PulteGroup's Chief Financial Officer. I'm excited to have him in his new role, and I know that our organization will benefit greatly from Jim's leadership and experience. After his remarks, I will offer some additional thoughts on how we plan to manage our business given the current operating environment. Jim?\n\nJames L. Ossowski\n\nVice President-Finance & Controller, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review PulteGroup's quarterly results.\nIn the first quarter, our net new orders totaled 7,765 homes, which is a decrease of 7% from the first quarter of 2024. Lower orders in the period were driven primarily by a 10% decrease in net new orders per store, which is partially offset by the 3% increase in our average community count to 961 for the quarter.\nNotably, the cancellation rate as a percentage of starting backlog increased only slightly to 11% compared to 10% in the prior year. Specific to the quarter, we have [ stated ] that demand conditions followed a pretty typical seasonal pattern with net new orders increasing as the quarter progressed.\nOn a sequential basis, net new orders increased 26% from the fourth quarter of 2024. This increase is, however, below historic averages in [indiscernible] consumer that is carefully assessing the high cost of homeownership and more recently, concerns about the economy and overall employment conditions.\nOn a year-over-year basis, net new orders by first-time buyers were down 11%, move-up buyers were down 4% and active adult buyers declined 5%. We continue to realize meaningful relative outperformance among our move-up and active adult consumers as they have greater financial flexibility and can more easily adjust to market changes. That being said, the extreme volatility in the financial markets can cause even these consumers to pause on making a large purchase.\nMoving from orders to closings. Wholesale revenues in the first quarter totaled $3.7 billion, down 2% from the $3.8 million of revenues generated last year. Lower home sale revenues for the period were the result of a 7% decrease in closings to 6,583 homes, largely offset by a 6% increase in average sales price of $570,000.\nBy Buyer Group, the breakdown in closings in the first quarter was 39% first-time, 40% move-up and 21% active adults. In the first quarter of last year, our closings were comprised of 42% first-time, 35% move-up and 23% active adult.\nAs we have discussed on prior calls, we have experienced a modest decline in the percentage of closings from active adult buyers driven by the closeout of several mile communities over the past 12 months -- 12-plus months.\nI'm happy to report that we are extremely pleased with buyer response to recent Del Webb openings in Cleveland, Indianapolis and Southern California. We are equally excited about the additional web community openings coming later this year.\nClosings from these new web communities will be more heavily weighted towards 2026 and beyond, getting these communities open for sales is a critical first step. Based on sales and closings activities in the period, we ended the quarter with a backlog of 11,335 homes, which is down 16% from last year. On a dollar basis, our backlog was $7.2 billion, which is down 12% compared with last year's first quarter.\nAs Ryan mentioned earlier, we adjusted our starts pace as part of a process of lower spec inventory in alignment with our target range. In the first quarter, we started approximately 6,700 homes, which is down from approximately 7,500 homes we started in both Q1 and Q4 of last year. Reflective of this action, we ended the first quarter with 16,548 homes in production, of which 7,840 were spec [indiscernible].\nIn just 1 quarter, we reduced our spec count by over 900 homes while lowering our spec percentage from 53% to 47% of inventory. This moves us closer to our target range of 40% to 45% of overall units in production. Of our spec units, 1,800 were completed at quarter end, and we expect finished spec to continue trending lower in the slowdown in our star space.\nThe goal in aggressively managing our production pipeline is to more effectively balance the need to have units available to meet immediate buyer demand while still selling from a position of strength within our communities. In the current environment, we believe prioritizing price and margin over volume makes most [indiscernible].\nBased on recent sales paces and the mix of units under construction, we expect to deliver between 7,400 and 7,800 closings in the second quarter. While buyer demand over the next few months will be a key determinant given the more than 16,000 units we have under production and cycle times of approximately 110 days we currently expect to deliver between 29,000 and 30,000 homes for the full year, slightly below our prior guidance of $31,000.\nEmbedded within our updated delivery guide is our expectation that quarterly community count will be 3% to 5% higher in 2025 than in the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our first quarter results and our previous guidance, we currently expect the average sales price of closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000 in each of the remaining 3 quarters.\nContinuing down the income statement. Our gross margin in the first quarter was 27.5%, which is flat on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter, but down from a very strong Q1 of 2024. While sales incentives increased to 8% in the quarter, gross margins in the period benefited from a favorable mix of homes closed, both in terms of geography and buyer group.\nAs it relates to gross margins going forward, we continue to expect gross margins in the second quarter to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.6% and we now expect gross margins in the third and fourth quarters to be in the range of 26.0% to 26.5%, down slightly from our prior range of 26.5% to 27.0%.\nOur guide on gross margin assumes incentives remain elevated at the elevated levels experienced in the first quarter. Further, gross margins in the back half of the year reflect the estimated impact of tariffs that have been imposed which are expected to increase our house cost by an estimated 1% of average selling price.\nIn the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $393 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues which compares with prior year reported SG&A expense of $358 million or 9.4% of home sale revenues. Reported prior year SG&A expense includes a pretax insurance benefit of $27 million.\nBased on anticipated closing volumes, we now expect SG&A expense for the full year 2025 to be in the range of 9.5% to 9.7% of home sale revenue. Given the uncertainties of the current operating environment, we continue to carefully assess SG&A expenditures as we seek to maintain an appropriate overhead structure.\nOur financial services operations reported first quarter pretax income of $36 million compared with $41 million in the prior [indiscernible]. Lower pretax income primarily reflects the impact of lower closing volumes within the company's homebuilding operations.\nCapture rate in the quarter increased to 86%, up from 84% last year. For the first quarter, our reported pretax income was $68 million, and we recorded a tax expense of $158 million or an effective tax rate of 23.2%. Our first quarter effective tax rate was benefited by renewable energy tax credits and stock compensation reductions reported in the period.\nAt this time, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24.5% excluding the impact of the discrete period specific tax events. For our first quarter, we reported net income of $523 million or $2.57 per share. In the first quarter of 2024, reported net income of $663 million or $3.10 per share.\nPrior year results are inclusive of $65 million or $0.23 per share in pretax benefits related to the sale of a joint venture and the aforementioned insurance benefit. Earnings per share for the quarter was calculated based on 204 million diluted shares which is down 5% from the prior year and we continue to systematically repurchase our shares.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $300 million or an average price of $103 per share. As noted in this morning's release, we ended the first quarter with $1.9 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.\nIn addition to repurchasing our shares in the first quarter, we allocated $1.2 billion to land acquisition and development. In Q1, 52% of our spend was associated with the development of our existing land assets. As Ryan noted, given today's macro uncertainties, we are asking our land teams to review project returns and confirm they still meet our hurdle rates given changing market conditions.\nWe are confident that in this type of operating environment our disciplined underwriting process will serve as well as it has done during prior periods of [indiscernible].\nGiven our current pace of sales and start, we now expect our land investment in 2025 to be approximately $5 billion. We remain positive on the long-term outlook for housing, but we are prepared to adjust our near-term land spend in response to changes up or down in higher demand. While we are slowing projected land spend, we are still prepared to use our financial strength to capitalize on planned opportunities that could develop during these choppier market conditions.\nBased on the updated expectations for our homebuilding operations, we continue to expect operating cash flow generation for the full year to be approximately $1.4 billion. We have such flexibility because we already control a strong land pipeline that can support the future growth of our business platform.\nAt the end of the first quarter, PulteGroup had 244,000 lots under control, of which 59% are controlled via option. In just the past year, we have increased our option lot count by almost 30% while reducing our owned lot count at the same time.\nI want to underscore that whether these land options are with the underlying land seller or one-off transactions with a land banker, our ability to mitigate market risk is as important as the rate of return of assessing each transaction. On a deal-by-deal basis, we continue to strike balance in evaluating the profitability and risk management opportunities that might result from optioning to underlying land parcel.\nAnd finally, I'm pleased to say that PulteGroup remains in an exceptionally strong financial position as it ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 11.7% and with $1.3 billion of cash. Further validating the strength of our operating and financial positions, Moody's recently upgraded our senior unsecured notes to [ Baa1 ].\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for the final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Given our backlog units under production and current build cycle, we now expect to deliver between 29,000 and 30,000 homes in 2025. Assuming whole [ mine ] demand is sufficient and it aligns with our prioritizing price over pace to drive near-term returns.\nAs Jim detailed, we lowered our starts pace in the first quarter by approximately 10%. Our strategy has always been about balancing price and pace to drive high returns. Rather than try to chase the volume number, we will continue with our efforts to reduce any excess spec inventory and move closer to our target of 40% to 45%. We will remain agile and are prepared to make further adjustments up or down to our start space in response to changes in buyer demand.\nFor PulteGroup balancing price and pace with the bias towards price has resulted in gross margin being an important driver of our returns. Our Q1 gross margin of 27.5% is reflective of our approach. In addition to driving top-tier returns, our industry-leading gross margin gives our divisions more room to maneuver and managing their communities on a day-to-day basis.\nIn 2024, we invested $5.3 billion in land acquisition and development and entered 2025 with plans to increase our land spend to $5.5 billion. Given greater macroeconomic uncertainty, we are recalibrating our land spend and expect it will be closer to $5 billion.\nGiven the strength of our existing land pipeline, deferring a small percentage of our land acquisition spend will not impact our ability to grow our operating platform in the future. For any changes we will implement over the near term in response to evolving demand conditions, what won't change is our focus on delivering high returns over the housing cycle.\nAs we have demonstrated working through the myriad of facto challenges of the past 5 years, generating high returns require decision-making that is consistently in alignment with long-term goals and objectives. We have remained disciplined in our business practices while making prudent adjustments such as moderating our starch pace in response to changing market conditions as we work to successfully navigate the current environment.\nWe continue to believe in the long-term demand dynamics within the housing industry. In a country that has a growing population and has already short several million housing units, it is reasonable to expect that demand will be there in the future.\nAs Jim suggested earlier, disruptions in the marketplace can create exciting opportunities that have the potential to accelerate future performance. We certainly have the balance sheet strength to take advantage of any such opportunities should they emerge.\nIn closing, I want to highlight that we worked hard over the past decade to build a business platform that is arguably unmatched in terms of its presence across major markets and buyer groups. Our performance over time has demonstrated the competitive advantages of such a portfolio and driving high returns and navigating through market changes.\nFurther, we've shown our commitment to intelligently allocate capital to support the growth of PulteGroup, while consistently returning funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And finally, I want to again thank our entire organization for their efforts in delivering an unmatched home-buying experience to our customers.\nWe don't talk about it enough, but I want to recognize our divisions for reaching record build quality and record Net Promoter Scores, all while creating a culture that once again put PulteGroup on Fortune's Top 100 Best Companies to Work For list for the fifth year in a row. You are truly the best in the business. Now let me turn the call over to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, [indiscernible]. We're now prepared to open the call to questions, so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you, and I'll now ask the operator to open up Q&A."

My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Bob O’Shaughnessy. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year financial results. With me today are Ryan Marshall, our President and CEO; and Jim Ossowski, our incoming Executive Vice President and CFO. As always, a copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today.\nI want to highlight that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. Most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual and quarterly reports.\nWith that said, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning. We are pleased to speak with you today about how we are running the business and our outstanding fourth quarter and full year financial results. Before Bob gives you the detailed data relating to the fourth quarter, I thought it would be appropriate to summarize some of the company's many achievements in 2024. PulteGroup delivered 31,219 homes in 2024, which represents an increase of 9% over last year. We generated record home sale revenues of $17.3 billion. We once again reported industry-leading full year gross margins of 28.9% and we were able to do this in the face of increasing affordability challenge through the careful management of product offerings, pricing, incentives and absorption paces as we sought to maintain high profitability while ensuring we continue to turn our assets.\nWe continue to manage our overheads efficiently as our reported SG&A amounted to 7.6% of our home sale revenues, including the insurance benefits we recorded in 2024. And we reported strong operating results from our financial services operations which generated $210 million of pretax income compared to $133 million last year. As a result, our reported net operating margin was 21.3% for the year. No matter how you look at it, our performance this year was outstanding as we have continued to navigate the turbulence in the markets over the last few years. Our performance is a product of the disciplined and consistent manner in which we are running the business which has allowed us to quickly adjust key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success.\nOur strong operating performance also allowed us to continue to manage our capital in a manner which leaves us with considerable financial strength. In the year, we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations after investing $5.3 billion in new land. We continue to efficiently [ ease ] our land pipeline, putting approximately 43,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, we now control 235,000 lots, of which 56% are under option. In addition, we returned $1.7 billion to investors including $1.2 billion through share repurchases, the payment of $168 million in dividends and $310 million through the early retirement of senior notes. After all of that, we ended the year with $1.7 billion of cash, and our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 11.8%.\nWe are also very proud of the numerous awards recognizing our company's culture, including being named to Fortune's Top 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2024 for the fourth consecutive year. Looking to the future, it remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is positive. The U.S. economy has navigated recessionary concerns well. Employment remains strong, and the interest in new homes remains at high levels. In addition, the structural shortage of housing due to underbuilding, ever-increasing land entitlement challenges and ongoing labor availability challenges together with our expectation for continuing lower resale transactions due to a higher for longer rate environment leads us to believe that new home supply will continue to be absorbed without a significant increase in standing inventory.\nGiven our constructive views on the outlook for long-term housing demand, we are planning to continue to invest in our operations to support growing our business over time. Within our operating model, we set our starts pace to align with the sales environment rather than being based on a predetermined annual production volume. As a result, home buying demand will impact our closing volumes and resulting growth from year-to-year. While there can be resulting peaks and valleys in our deliveries, our focus remains on investing in our business to grow volume while maintaining high returns.\nAs we've demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend and return excess capital to investors, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our Board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy and conditions in the job market to remain favorable there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years. Having said that, affordability challenges and generally high cost of living are certainly impacting the American consumer.\nSpecific to homebuyers, we believe the recent volatility in mortgage rates, including the current increase back above 7% has contributed to the recent lower activity levels. Against this backdrop, we continue to carefully monitor our investment in production levels with a view towards generating high returns in our business. Consistent with how we have been managing our business in recent years, we are managing our starts activity with a view towards driving our spec inventory to be more in line with our desired levels, including targeting our total spec inventory to be between 40% and 45% of our total units under production.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Starting with our income statement, home sale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion compared with $4.2 billion in the prior year. The increase in home sale revenues for the period reflects a 6% increase in closings, 8,103 along with a 6% increase in our average sales price to $581,000. Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised of 40% first time, 40% move-up and 20% active adult. Consistent with our commentary over the last 2 quarters, the slight decline in the percentage of closings from active adult buyers reflects the timing of recent active adult community closeouts. We continue to expect a normalization of contribution from these consumers when replacement active adult communities begin opening for sales in the back half of 2025.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, closings were 40% first time, 36% move-up 24% active adult. I would note that the increase in our average selling price in the quarter relative to our guide is due primarily to the increase in the relative proportion of our closings from move-up customers. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 960 which represents a 4% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 919 communities and was in line with our prior guidance. Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders decreased 1% to 6,167 homes. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 5% decrease in sales per store and a slight increase in our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog, partially offset by the 4% increase in our community count.\nLooking at demand conditions in the quarter. As we noted during our third quarter call, the market in October demonstrated a more typical seasonal demand pattern coming out of the third quarter. This continued through the quarter as consumers faced economic uncertainty related to potential economic changes being considered by the incoming administration and the recent increase in mortgage rates. We also noted that given the macro issues consumers face that the spring selling season would offer the best assessment of fundamental housing demand. Fast forward to today, and we continue to believe that market fundamentals while still presenting affordability challenges to consumers are supportive of housing and the spring selling season will be the best barometer for how the consumer will behave in today's economic environment.\nLooking at our [ quarter ] activity by buyer group. Fourth quarter net new orders decreased 14% for first-time buyers increased 15% for move-up buyers and decreased 1% for active adult buyers. We believe these activity levels reflect the continued interest of consumers for new homes, but also show the impact of the affordability challenges consumers face particularly for first-time buyers. As a result of our sales and closings activity, our quarter end backlog was 10,153 homes, which is down 16% from last year. On a dollar basis, our backlog of $6.5 billion is down 11%. Inclusive of the 7,502 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,439 homes in production. 53% of our production is spec including 1,862 finished specs, which when combined with cycle times that are now largely in line with our historical norm, put us in a position to meet higher demand through the year.\nWith that said, in the event that the spring selling season trends towards lower absorption rates, we will reduce our pace of spec starts and communities with higher spec inventory levels so as to better match local selling conditions and help produce standing inventory. As Ryan noted, our goal is to reduce our spec inventory back down to 40% to 45% of our total production by the end of the year. Based on our current production pipeline, we expect to deliver 31,000 closings in 2025 including between 6,400 and 6,800 closings in the first quarter.\nLooking at pricing. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000 a in each of the fourth quarters of the year. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 27.5%, which is down 130 basis points sequentially, but within the guide we gave at the end of the third quarter. Consistent with recent quarters, our fourth quarter margins reflect buyer incentives, which increased 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 7.2%. Based on our backlog and current sales conditions, we anticipate that gross margins in the first quarter will be approximately 27%. For the balance of the year, we currently expect gross margin to be in the range of 25% to 27% in each of the second, third and fourth quarters. These estimates assume that incentives throughout 2025 will remain consistent with the incentive recognized in the fourth quarter.\nI would also point out that our margins beyond the first quarter will ultimately be influenced by the demand conditions during the year as we have a significant number of homes to sell and close over the balance of the year. Moving on to expenses. Our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense was $196 million or 4.2% of home sale revenues which compares with prior year reported SG&A expense of $308 million or 7.4% of home sale revenues. It should be noted that our reported results for the fourth quarters of '24 and '23 included $250 million and $65 million, respectively, of pretax insurance benefits. Based on anticipated closing volumes, we currently expect SG&A expense in 2025 to be approximately 9.5% of home sale revenues, including SG&A expense of approximately 10.5% of wholesale revenues in the first quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, our financial services has reported pretax income of $51 million increase from $44 million last year. The improvement in pretax income reflects the increase in our homebuilding closings as well as the continuation of our financial services platform. Our reported pretax income for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion compared with prior year pretax income of $947 million. In the period, we recorded tax expense of $269 million or an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate includes benefits relating to energy efficiency credits and our purchase of renewable energy tax credits. Projecting ahead, we expect our tax rate in 2025 to be approximately 24.5%, excluding the impact of any discrete tax events, including energy efficiency credits or the purchase of incremental renewable energy tax credits.\nLooking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed an income of $913 million or $4.43 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, we generated cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion in '24. Given our current expectations for operating and financial results in 2025, we expect to generate cash flows from operations of approximately $1.4 million. Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities. We invested $1.5 billion in land acquisition and development in fourth quarter, of which 53% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $5.3 billion, of which 57% was for development.\nGiven our constructive views on near and longer-term housing dynamics, we currently plan to continue investing in land at a rate design to allow us to grow over time. As a result, we expect to invest approximately $5.5 billion in 2025. I would expect that approximately 55% of that spend will be for development. Consistent with my comments about our willingness to slow starts, we would also evaluate our spend on new land assets if absorptions slow as we seek to maintain a high level of return. [ Plus ] our fourth quarter investments, we ended the year with 235,000 lots of control which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our own block count by 2,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by 14 [ lots ]. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased to 56%, up from 53% last year.\nI'm pleased to note that [ 69% ] of our new land approvals in the fourth quarter were under some form of option as we work towards a 70% option mix in our portfolio. Based on the investments we made and our anticipated community openings and closings in 2025, we expect our average community count in 2025 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Looking at our capital allocation priorities. We continued returning capital to investors in the fourth quarter, which included the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares at a cost of $320 million or $129.90 per share. As Ryan noted, our total return to investors in '24 amounted to [ $1.4 billion ], including the $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $168 million of dividends and $310 million through the early retirement of senior notes.\nBased on the actions taken, our debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the year was 11.8%, down 410 points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet, our net debt-to-capital ratio is now below 0. I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our expectations for leverage in the future. As you know, we have historically expressed that our target leverage level has been between 20% and 30% of capital on a gross basis. Due to the strength of our operations and the resulting utilization of our cash flows over the last decade or so, we are well below that target range on a gross basis. And as I noted, we are actually now net debt free.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support our capital needs. As a result, we are no longer targeting a specific leverage level. Instead, we will allocate our capital in line with our historical practice, continue to prioritize investment in the business and the payment of our dividend with excess capital being used to repurchase our stock and/or retire our debt. Our resulting leverage position will, therefore, be an outcome that is dependent on the decision to make rather than targeted to a predetermined level. With that said, we would expect to see our leverage remain flat or decline in the future unless there is a transaction where leverage augments our opportunity.\nSpecific to 2025, I would also highlight that our Board recently approved a 10% increase in our dividend per share starting in the first quarter of 2025. As Ryan noted, we also announced a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization this morning.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. At the end of last year, I spoke about our successful navigation of the many challenges we faced in recent years. 2024 was no different as we have dealt with continuing interest rate variability and affordability challenges, significant weather events and ongoing geopolitical issues. I remain extremely proud of how our entire team has responded to these events the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over time. I believe that our strategy to focus on disciplined land investment, while maintaining operational and organizational expertise has proven out as we've capitalized our market conditions and have grown earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 30% while delivering an average annual return on equity of 27.8% over the last 5 years.\nOf course, those achievements reflect what we have done as opposed to what we will do and our future share price performance will depend on what we are able to achieve in the future. To that end, I think it's important to share that we will continue to operate the business in a fashion that seeks to realize strong returns through the cycle. For the long term, we have invested in high-quality land position we believe will allow the company to grow over time. Importantly, the optionality we have achieved in our controlled lot position give us the flexibility to pivot if the market faces unexpected headwinds.\nSimilarly, in the near term, we have positioned our inventory production to be sufficient to meet projected demand. It is important to remember that we are seeking to keep all of our communities productive and have made sure that we have the inventory and planned start activity in place to meet that end. However, as discussed earlier, we have higher spec inventory than we've traditionally carried. We've often said we will not be margin proud and will find pricing to make sure our standing inventory moves. We will continue to do that and as noted earlier, we will work to adjust our pricing and inventory positioning with a view towards driving our spec inventory levels back in line with recent norms.\nI know stocks reflect performance, so we are seeking to grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low risk profile, which we believe will drive the best returns for our shareholders. With all of that said, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the change that we announced back by. As you know, Bob notified us of his retirement as our CFO, which will be effective after we file our 10-K next week. As part of our succession plan, Bob will transition to a new role for the balance of the year, in part to ensure a smooth transition of the CFO role. But during which time he will also oversee our growth and strategic partnerships platform including our land banking efforts, our asset management committee and our financial services operations.\nI'd like to thank Bob for his 14 years with us and look forward to working with me over the coming year. I would also like to more formally introduce Jim Ossowski, who will be taking over as our CFO. Jim is a 22-year veteran of Pulte, having come to us after working for a national [indiscernible] start of his career. Jim has served in many capacities for us, including a number of field and corporate leadership positions. In fact, in his current role, he has been involved in all of our significant strategy and operating initiatives over the last 13 years. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a strong understanding of the homebuilding business and has developed deep relationships with our Board, our senior leadership team and our field operating teams. He has also exhibited a great ability to work with our service providers.\nBased on the depth and breadth of his experiences and relationships, I am eminently confident in Jim's ability to seamlessly step into the CFO role. And finally, before I close, I would like to take a moment to express my continuing gratitude and thanks to each of our employees for their tireless efforts in supporting the delivering of superior homes and experiences to our homebuyers while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors. We are now prepared to open the call for questions. In order that we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We would ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Thank you. And I now ask the operator to again explain the process and to open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Rob. I want to welcome, everyone, to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our strong financial performance for our second quarter ended June 30, 2024. Here to review PulteGroup's Q2 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nA copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today.\nThe most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results, which reflect an approach to the business in which we seek to balance price, pace and investment over the long term to generate superior returns. Consistent with this strategy, our financial results continue to show the power of capitalizing on the value of each lot and home we sell.\nOur divisions work extremely hard to secure, and entitle and develop our land assets and worked equally hard to generate exceptional profitability while still turning our portfolio or rate. Specific to our second quarter performance, we realized a 2% increase in average sales price, an 8% increase in closings and a 30 basis point gain in gross margin, which in aggregate helped drive a 19% increase in earnings to a second quarter record of $3.83 per share.\nAnother quarter of overall strong financial performance, highlighted by our double-digit earnings growth resulted in PulteGroup generating a return on equity of 27.1% for the trailing 12-month period. Obviously, a key driver of our strong financial results and high returns on invested capital continues to be the company's outstanding gross margins. As Bob will discuss, gross margins in the period vetted from a favorable mix of closings but I would also highlight the pricing strength evident in our numbers.\nIn Q2, product options and lot premiums averaged $104,000 per home and represented approximately 19% of our average sales price of $549,000. As I'm sure you can all appreciate, options and lot premiums are high margin dollars and an important contributor to PulteGroup's outsized margins relative to peers. I know how hard our employees work to deliver such outstanding results, and I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts.\nAs good as our second quarter numbers are, it's fair to say that as we navigated through the period, demand was a little less consistent than we experienced in the first quarter of 2024. On our Q1 earnings call, we noted buyer traffic has slowed the first few weeks of April. While subsequent Wall Street channel checks confirmed a change in short-term demand the fact remains that we are operating in a housing market that has been underbuilt relative to population, immigration, household formation for more than a decade.\nThe resulting housing deficit of several million homes is likely a structural reality for years to come given the zoning challenges we face in most municipalities. Our country's underlying new home supply issue has been exacerbated by the lock-in effect caused by the dramatic rise in interest rates over the last 2 years. But the market continues to experience is existing homeowners who are unwilling are more likely unable to give up the low rate mortgages originated several years ago.\nAs a consequence, the inventory of quality in existing homes remains below long-term averages in any markets. The supply imbalance is 1 of the reasons that I have comment in the long-term demand trends for housing in this country, but I appreciate that buyer demand will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For example, the bump in interest rates in the second quarter caused some buyers to become more cautious while other software ability stretched beyond their financial capacity.\nWhile many cities are facing a limited supply of homes for sale, we have seen an increase in existing and new home supply in select markets in Florida and Texas. These markets are now in the process of finding the new clearing price needed to work down any excess inventory. May be more impactful than rates in inventory, the feedback we are getting points to a lack of confidence among some consumers that now is a good time to buy.\nHigh prices, higher interest rates and the resulting high monthly payments are making potential buyers more cautious in purchasing a new home. To the degree that this lack of confidence among consumers reflects affordability concerns. This isn't new. And in fact, it's something we address on a market-by-market, even community-by-community basis every day. It was more than a year ago that you first heard me say that delivering high returns requires that we turn our assets and that we won't be margin proud.\nIn an environment where market conditions are more competitive, we have worked to ensure that our products, prices and incentives are clearly meeting buyer needs. Consistent with this focus on turning our assets, we continue to build a more efficient and faster turning land pipeline. In the quarter, lots controlled via option increased to 53% of total lots. We are successfully building on our historic base of lots option directly with the land sellers by increasing our use of third-party land vendors.\nTo date, we have entered into transactions representing almost 13,000 lots and $1.5 billion of capital. As with all land-related activities, we are being disciplined in how we expand this part of our portfolio, but we are making steady progress in assembling a more efficient land pipeline. As we sit here at the midpoint of 2024, I would say that it is shaping up to be a very good year for Pulte. Relative to our expectations coming into 2024, not only did we raise our initial closing guide by 1,000 homes, we are clearly on a gross margin path well above our initial guide.\nFor various reasons, market conditions got a little tougher in the second quarter, but we continue to actively manage price, pace and starts to drive the best business outcome. Based on the current demand conditions and construction cycle times, we continue to start homes at a pace consistent with closing 31,000 homes this year as well as positioning the company to grow 5% to 10% in 2025, consistent with the multiyear outlook we have discussed previously.\nThrough the first few weeks of July, traffic to our communities has been solid. But depending on how demand conditions and absorption paces evolve up or down in each market over the balance of the year, we will adjust our start pace as needed. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results.\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup generated second quarter wholesale revenues of $4.4 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues for the period was driven by an 8% increase in closing to 8,097 homes, in combination with a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the increase in our ASP reflects modest price increases in our first-time and active adult communities, while prices in our move-up communities were consistent with last year. The increase in our average sales prices for the quarter also reflects the impact of FX, as we recorded higher closings within our move-up business, which at $650,000, carried much higher prices than our first time in -- business.\nBroken down by buyer group, closings in the second quarter consisted of 40% first time, 37% move-up and 23% active development. This compares with the mix of closings in the second quarter of last year, which was 41% first-time, 34% move-up and 5% active adult. Reflecting the headwinds caused by higher rates and other market dynamics are 7,649 net news were down 4% from last year's exceptionally strong results. In particular, I would highlight that last year's Q2 orders benefited from Del Webb brand opening and build-for-rent sales that are lumpy in nature.\nAs has been well reported, operating conditions in select Florida and Texas markets got more competitive in the second quarter as interest rates rose during the month of April. On our first quarter earnings call this year, we indicated that buyer traffic has slowed during the first few weeks of April, and this slowdown did ultimately impact orders as we move through the period. For the second quarter, our average community count was $934, which is an increase of 3% over the same period last year.\nThe resulting absorption pace of 2.7 orders per community per month in the quarter is above the pre-COVID average, but down from the 2.9% we generated last year. More granularly, our net new orders in the second quarter decreased 3% among first-time buyers, increased 4% among move-up buyers and decreased 17% among active adult buyers. While we continue to see strong demand among active adult buyers, we did report a larger year-over-year decrease in their second quarter orders.\nThat decrease primarily reflects lower community count in the current year and some impact from the timing of openings and closings of several of our Del Webb communities. Adjusting for the impact of these dynamics, our net new orders at stores that were operating consistently in both periods shows an order decrease of only 3%. Consistent with our overall order results on a unit basis, our quarter end backlog was down 4%, 12,982 homes, although backlog value was down only 1% to $8.1 billion.\nTurning to production. We started approximately 8,100 homes in the second quarter and ended the quarter with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Of the 17,250 homes under construction, approximately 6,900 or 40% of spec, including an average of 1.3 finished specs per community. These levels are in line with our targets of 40% and 1 finished spec per community and put us in a position to meet our delivery targets over the balance of the year.\nAs always, we are prepared to adjust our cadence of spec starts up or down in response to sustained changes in overall -- demand. Based on the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,400 and 7,800 homes in the third quarter and continue to expect to close approximately 31,000 homes for the full year. As noted, we realized an average sales price of $549,000 in the second quarter, which is consistent with our prior guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking ahead, we expect closings in the third and fourth quarters to be in that same range of $540,000 to $550,000.\nWhile our average price in backlog is higher than our guide, we have a lot of homes left to sell in flows this year, most of which will be spec production with our first-time buyer communities where pricing is powered. We reported second quarter gross margin of 29.9%, which represents an increase of 30 basis points over both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. As in Q1 of this year, our reported gross margins reflect a favorable mix at closing and a generally supportive pricing environment for many of the spec sales we closed in the quarter.\nSecond quarter gross margins also benefited from opportunities we've taken in prior quarters to improve net pricing in a number of communities across our portfolio. Consistent with such actions, incentives on closing in the second quarter was 6.3% selling price, which is down from 6.5% in the first quarter of this year. While recent macro data has sparked optimism about the potential for Fed rate cuts, we don't factor such expectations into our guidance.\nWhat we do know is that rates remain elevated, affordability is stretched and our delivery mix will be less favorable in the back half of the year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, in the third and fourth quarters, we will be closing more homes in our West region, where most carry a lower relative margin profile than we did in the first half of the year. These factors, combined with our need to be price competitive to turn assets points in an expected gross margin of approximately 29% in the third quarter and 28.5% to 29% in the fourth quarter.\nAs stated previously, we still have posed to sell in close to meet our full year delivery guide of 31,000 units. So demand conditions over the next few months can have an impact on the results build. In the second quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $361 million or 8.1% of home sale revenues. Reported SG&A includes a $52 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In Q2 of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $315 million or 7.8% of wholesale revenue, which includes a $65 million pretax insurance benefit.\nExcluding the impact of the insurance benefits recorded in the first 2 quarters of this year, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of wholesale revenues. Turning to our financial services operations. We reported pretax income of $63 million in the second quarter, which is up from $46 million in the same period last year. The 36% increase in pretax income reflects strong financial performance across all business lines, including mortgage, title and insurance.\nOur performance also benefited from an increase in capture rates across all business lines including a mortgage capture rate of 86% in the quarter, up from 80% last year. In total, reported pretax income for the second quarter was $1 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the last year. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $239 million for an effective tax rate of 22.8%.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter includes the benefit of energy tax credits and a $13 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain state tax data. For the remaining quarters this year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24%, 24.5%. Taken altogether, we reported net income of $809 million, $3.83 per share. This compares to prior year reported net income of $720 million or $3.21 per share.\nOn a per share basis, we continue to benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, which, on a year-over-year basis, reduced shares outstanding by 5% from last year. Capitalizing on our strong cash flows, we continue to support the future growth of our business as we invested approximately $1.2 billion in land acquisition and development in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date land spend to just over $2.3 billion, keeping us on track to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year.\nFor both the quarter and the first 6 months of 2024, the allocation of land spend was 60% development and 40% acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 225,000 lots under control, of which 53% were held via option. Given the strength of our land pipeline, we continue to forecast community count growth of 3% to 5% in the third and fourth quarters of this year over the comparable prior period last year.\nConsistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million common shares at a cost of $314 million or an average price of $113.79 per share. This brings our year-to-date share repurchase activity to a total of 5.1 million shares repurchased at a cost of $560 million, a $110.58 per share.\nIn addition to repurchasing stock, we also completed a tender offer for $300 million of our senior notes in the second quarter. As a result, our debt-to-capital ratio is now just 12.8% and our notes payable have decreased to $1.7 billion, which represents the lowest level since before we acquired Del Webb in 2001. After spending more than $1.8 billion during the quarter on land investment and the purchase of our equity and debt, we ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion of cash.\nAdjusting for our cash position, our net debt to capital ratio at the quarter end was 1.8%. I'm also pleased to report that an acknowledgment of our improved operations, strong cash flow generation and outstanding balance sheet Fitch recently upgraded our debt to BBB+, while Moody's upgraded its outlook to positive. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Through the first half of 2024, traffic to our communities was good and absorption pace rent slightly above historic norms. So I feel good about our opportunities in the back half of the year. To the degree that the Fed actually cuts interest rates in the coming months, I think that will provide a powerful tailwind both financially and psychologically as we enter 2025.\nBefore turning the call back to Jim, I would draw your attention to a release we issued a couple of weeks ago about 1 of our newest community openings and our first in Utah in more than 20 years along with representing PulteGroup's reentry into my home state, Utah is the seventh greenfield new market entry we have initiated over the past few years. Through the first half of 2024, we increased home sale revenues by 10% and grew reported earnings per share by 25% over the last year.\nOver the same period, we increased our land investment by 31% to $2.3 billion, while increasing year-to-date share repurchases and dividend payments by 37% to $645 million. We also retired $300 million of debt. PulteGroup has executed extremely well and with expectations of closing 31,000 homes for the full year, we are in an excellent position to drive strong results going forward. And finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to briefly address the press release we issued yesterday announcing our CFO succession plans.\nAfter a truly impactful 13-year career with PulteGroup, Bob O'Shaughnessy is initiated a transition toward retirement at the end of 2025. Step 1 in this process is that Bob will relinquish his title as Chief Financial Officer effective early February of next year. I'm pleased to say that Bob will then remain with us for another 10 months as Executive Vice President. During that time, he will support a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities as well as continue to oversee our financial services business, our strategic partnerships and our asset management committee.\nSince its founding, PulteGroup's greatest strength has always been the talented people who work here, reflecting this depth of exceptional people. I'm proud to announce that Jim Ossowski, currently Senior Vice President of Finance, has been named as the company's next CFO. Jim has had an outstanding 22-year career at PulteGroup during which time he has served as VP of Finance and Corporate Controller, VP of Finance Homebuilding Operations, Area VP of Finance and Director of Corporate Audit.\nIn his current role as SVP of Finance, he manages our critical asset management committee and FP&A function. Jim has been promoted to Executive Vice President and CFO effective February of 2025. At that time, Jim will report directly to me and will have responsibility for our accounting, tax, audit, risk management and treasury functions. In announcing these changes now, we ensure having plenty of time to implement a seamless transition of responsibilities. Now let me turn the call back to Jim.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions] and I'll ask Rob to again explain the process and we'll open the call for questions."

My name is Jeannie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. You may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jean. Good morning. Let me welcome everyone to today's call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding Q1 operating and financial results, the period ended March 31, 2024.\nI'm joined on the call today by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance.\nA copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today.\nI want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup reported record first quarter results across many of our key financial metrics. From top line revenues of $3.8 billion, gross margins of 29.6%, to bottom line earnings of $3.10 per share, it was an exceptional quarter. These strong first quarter results helped to drive a return on equity of 27.3% for the trailing 12-month period.\nOur strong first quarter results reflect long-term strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation process that have underpinned PulteGroup's success for more than a decade.\nI would suggest that another driver of our record Q1 results are decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year, decisions that I think are emblematic of the balanced approach we take to running our business and to delivering high returns. On our last earnings call, we talked about decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year to not lower our prices in a chase for volume. As you will recall, demand in the fourth quarter of 2023 had started slowly but improved as interest rates began to moderate. And we made the decision to push incentives aggressively as the quarter progressed, we likely could have delivered higher closing volumes in '23.\nWith demand improving in the fourth quarter, we elected to hold our pricing and have had more inventory available for the 2024 spring selling season. The result of this decision is that we were in a position to sell and close more homes in the first quarter of 2024 and at higher margins. That's what you see in our Q1 results. closings and gross margins above our guide as demand dynamics allowed us to sell more homes with better net pricing.\nWhen buyer demand is rising, we're often asked how many more homes we can sell. Given the value we place on entitled lots and our focus on driving high returns, more volume is not the only answer as we work to balance pace and price to drive high returns. Within our operating model, stronger demand provides choices. We can sell more houses or we can raise prices, or as was the case in the first quarter, we can do both.\nWhat we experienced in the first quarter is that areas of strong demand last year, such as the Southeast, Florida and Texas, continued to perform well into 2024. Even more positive is that areas that had some struggles in 2023, notably, Arizona, California and Nevada, were much improved in 2024. Consistent with the favorable conditions in the first quarter, almost all our markets displayed pricing dynamics that were stable or improving, which allowed us to raise net pricing in more than half of our communities.\nAs you've heard us say many times, our pricing decisions are made with the goal of delivering high returns and the best overall business outcomes. Depending upon the community and the buyers' wants and needs, we may have raised base prices or lowered incentives. The result being that net pricing in the quarter across many of our markets was up between 1% and 5%.\nThe impact of these actions on our business performance is powerful. As Bob will discuss, we are increasing guidance for both full year closings and gross margins. Against generally favorable demand conditions, the supply of available housing remains tight. We have the long-term structural issue resulting from a decade of underbuilding that has the country's short approximately 4 million housing units. At the same time, the available inventory of existing homes for sale continues to be low as homeowners remain locked into their low mortgage rates.\nLife happens, so we are seeing some additional existing homes come to market, but the numbers remain well below historic rates.\nAs a homebuilder, this is a great operating environment as we are supplying a product that a lot of people need and want. I appreciate, however, that our country's housing shortage can create hardships for today's consumers as the lack of supply keeps housing prices high. In fact, some of our recent buyers said that they made the decision to buy now because they couldn't wait any longer for rates to roll back.\nIn a market where home prices are high and because of limited inventory, they will likely continue moving higher. Our company's ability to offer targeted incentives, particularly mortgage rate buydowns, is a powerful tool that can help bridge the affordability gap. For example, in the first quarter, approximately 25% of our homebuyers used our national rate program. In a world where the consensus is that interest rates will be higher for longer, our interest rate incentives likely become an even greater competitive advantage, especially relative to the existing home seller.\nHigher interest rates create additional challenges for today's homebuyers, but we appreciate that rates are moving higher because of a resilient economy and a strong job market. Given these conditions, we are optimistic about 2024 and PulteGroup's ability to continue delivering strong financial results.\nNow let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our first quarter results. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan noted, the company delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter, which have us well positioned to realize outstanding financial performance throughout 2024. In the first quarter, we reported home sale revenues of $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the prior year's first quarter.\nHigher revenues in the period were driven by an 11% increase in closing to 7,095 homes, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average sales prices to $538,000. The lower closing price compared with the first quarter of last year reflects a shift in the geographic mix of homes closed as we realized relatively higher closings from our Southeast and Florida markets, with more modest increases in our higher-priced Western markets.\nClosings in the quarter came in above our guide as we had available spec inventory to meet the strong buyer demand we experienced in the period. As Ryan highlighted, by choosing not to chase volume in last year's fourth quarter, we had additional inventory in Q1 that we were able to sell and close with better margins due to the improving buyer demand activity in the quarter.\nOur spec production is predominantly within our first-time buyer communities. So on a year-over-year basis, we realized increased closings from first-time buyers.\nIn the quarter, our closing mix included 41% first time, 36% move-up, and 23% active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the mix of closings consisted of 38% first time, 36% move-up, and 26% active adult.\nReflecting the favorable demand conditions we experienced in the first quarter, net new orders increased 14% over last year to 8,379 homes. In the quarter, we realized a year-over-year increase in gross orders and a reduction in cancellation rates. Cancellations as a percentage of starting backlog fell to 10.1%, down from 12.7% in the first quarter last year.\nAverage community count for our first quarter was 931, which is an increase of 6% over the prior year and in line with our guidance for year-over-year community count growth of 3% to 5%. The resulting absorption pace of approximately 3 homes per month for the quarter was above our historic average for the period, excluding the pandemic impacted years of '21 and '22.\nI would also like to highlight that orders in the quarter were higher across all buyer groups, which is another sign of the overall strength of the market. More specifically, net new orders among first-time buyers increased 8%, move-up increased 22%, and active adult increased 12%. Consistent with earlier comments, the large increase in orders among move-up buyers was influenced by improving market conditions in the West where our business mix is much more heavily weighted towards move-up.\nGiven this strong start to our spring selling season, our quarter-end backlog increased to 13,430 homes with a value of $8.2 billion.\nWe started approximately 7,500 homes in the quarter and ended the period with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Our production pipeline includes approximately 7,000 or 41% spec homes, of which 1,337 are completed. We are operating just above our target of 1 finished spec per community, but believe carrying a few more finished specs is the right strategy given buyers' preferences and the fact that we are still in the more active spring selling season.\nGiven the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to close between 7,800 and 8,200 homes in the second quarter. With a strong start to the year in both quarters and closings, we are raising our guide for full year closings to approximately 31,000 homes. This would represent an 8% increase over 2023, which is at the higher end of our long-term goal of growing our closing volume between 5% and 10% annually.\nClosings in the first quarter had an average sales price of $538,000, which was slightly below our guidance for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Relative to our guide, pricing in the quarter was influenced by the geographic mix of closing, along with a higher volume of spec homes closed in the period. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect the mix of homes closed in each quarter will result in ASPs consistent with our prior guide of $540,000 to $550,000.\nFor the first quarter, we reported a gross margin of 29.6%, which is an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of '23 and a sequential gain of 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of '23. At 29.6%, our first quarter gross margin was also notably higher than our guide. Beyond Ryan's comments that we were achieving high returns by actively managing both pace and price, mix had an impact on our reported Q1 margins. Higher demand increased in the quarter as the quarter advanced, which allowed us to sell and close more homes in the period than forecasted. On a relative basis, more of these closings occurred in our higher-margin markets in the Southeast and Florida, resulting in a meaningful increase in reported gross margins for the quarter. Based on Q1 sign-ups and the composition of our backlog, we would expect the geographic mix of closings to be more balanced as we move through the remainder of the year.\nThat being said, we're raising our gross margin guide for the remainder of '24. We had previously guided to quarterly gross margins of 28% to 28.5%, but we now expect gross margins in the second quarter to be approximately 29.2%. Based on current backlog, we expect gross margins in the third and fourth quarters to be approximately 29%, but we still have homes to sell and close. So demand conditions over the coming months will impact the results we ultimately report.\nBeyond buyer demand and near-term pricing dynamics, the gross margin guide for the remainder of '24 also reflects expected changes in the geographic mix of homes we expect to close. Given recent sign-up trends, we anticipate closing more homes in our West region, which currently have a lower relative margin profile due to the fact that we adjusted pricing in these markets over the course of '23 to achieve appropriate sales paces.\nLooking at our costs. Reported SG&A in the first quarter was $358 million or 9.4% of home sale revenues. As noted in our press release, our reported SG&A for the period includes a $27 million pretax insurance benefit. SG&A in the first quarter of '23 was $337 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. Consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Based on normal seasonality, we expect to realize increased overhead leverage as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.\nOur Financial Services operations reported a pretax income of $41 million for the first quarter, which is an increase of almost 200% from last year's pretax income of $14 million. The increase in Q1 pretax income was driven by better market conditions across our Financial Services platform. Financial Services also benefited from higher capture rates across all business lines, including an increase to 84%, up from 78% last year, in our mortgage operations.\nAs noted in this morning's press release, in the first quarter, we completed the sale of a joint venture that resulted in a gain of $38 million. On our income statement, this gain was recorded in equity income from unconsolidated entities.\nOur reported first quarter pretax income was a period of record of $869 million, an increase of 24% over last year. Against that, we recorded tax expense of $206 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. Our reported Q1 tax rate was impacted by energy tax credits and stock compensation deductions recorded in the period. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%.\nIn total, our reported Q1 net income was $663 million or $3.10 per share, compared with prior year reported net income of $533 million or $2.35 per share. Earnings per share in our most recent quarter benefited from a 6% reduction in share count compared with the prior year as we continue to systematically repurchase our stock.\nMoving past the income statement, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the first quarter. Consistent with our recent land activity, 60% our land spend in the quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Our Q1 land spend keeps us on track with our plan to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year, of which we continue to expect about 60% will be for development, with the remainder for the acquisition of new land positions.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately 220,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The purchase of several large land positions in combinations with decisions not to move forward with option transactions during the quarter lowered our lot option percentage from the end of 2023. I would highlight, however, that 74% of the lots we have approved in this most recent quarter were under option. As our first quarter numbers in the key, we continue to work toward our multiyear goal of controlling 70% of our land pipeline via options.\nLooking at our community count, we continue to expect average community count in 2024 to increase 3% to 5% in each quarter over the comparable prior year period. Along with investing in our business, we continue to return capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million common shares at a cost of $246 million or an average price of $106.73 per share. In the quarter, we also opportunistically purchased approximately $10 million of our outstanding bonds. After allocating approximately $1.4 billion to investment in the return of funds to shareholders, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash.\nTaking all of this into account, our quarter-end gross debt-to-capital ratio was 15.4%, while our net debt-to-capital ratio was only 1.7%.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. As you would expect, given the strength of our first quarter results, buyer interest was high in the period as the order pace has increased beyond typical seasonality. That sales momentum continued into April, although we are now seeing some moderation of traffic into our communities due to the recent increases in interest rates, particularly within the Centex brand. While the change is relatively modest and based on a limited number of days, consumer feedback suggests that higher rates are causing some buyers to evaluate the timing of their activity due to the volatile interest rate environment. We'll continue to monitor how buyers respond to changes in the rate environment and are prepared to adjust pricing or incentives to ensure we are appropriately turning assets.\nDuring our last earnings call, we talked about the opportunity for PulteGroup to grow its business 5% to 10% annually. Given the lengthy land investment process, organic change in this industry takes time to accomplish, but we have been systematically planning and positioning to deliver against this goal for the past few years. I think that the company's efforts are reflected in the allocation of capital into growing our business. Including our Q1 spend since 2021, our operating teams have invested approximately $14 billion in land acquisition and development, with plans to invest another $5 billion in 2024.\nAlong with the land, we have been investing in our people and working to ensure the needed trade capacity is available to support our expanding operations. I'm proud to say that we've accomplished this while adhering to the same underwriting hurdles and investment disciplines which have been the cornerstone of PulteGroup for the past decade. Such discipline has allowed PulteGroup to more consistently grow its earnings, drive substantial cash flow from operations and deliver high returns.\nAnd we've accomplished this while maintaining the superior build quality and customer experience which PulteGroup homebuyers have come to expect.\nBefore opening the call to questions, I want to take a minute to recognize and celebrate our team for once again being named a Fortune 100 Best Company to Work For. What makes this recognition so important and gratifying is that it's based on feedback from all of our employees. This marks PulteGroup's fourth consecutive year on the list and is a testament to the culture of personal caring and professional development that we work to maintain. I am proud to lead such an organization that is committed to taking care of our customers and each other.\nLet me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions]"

We look forward to discussing PulteGroup's strong fourth quarter and full year financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023.\nI'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nA copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com.

A reconciliation of our results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. And finally, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance.\nActual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter and full year financial results. Over the past few years, we have faced macro challenges ranging from COVID to supply chain disruptions to skyrocketing mortgage rates. Through it all, we remain disciplined and consistent in running our operations. But when needed, have quickly adjusted key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success.\nThe benefits of this approach can be seen in the strength of our reported results. Bob will detail our Q4 performance, so let me highlight several of our key operating and financial achievements for the full year of 2023. By strategically increasing our spec production, we had more inventory available to meet the demand of first-time homebuyers and those consumers worried about mortgage rate volatility. Increased house inventory was a critical support to PulteGroup delivering 28,600 homes in 2023 and record home sale revenues of $15.6 billion.\nIn the face of increased cost for land, labor and materials, we carefully manage product offerings, pricing, incentives and absorption paces to maintain high profitability while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. The result, we reported outstanding full year gross margins of 29.3%, which helped drive a 6% increase in earnings per share to a record $11.72 per share and a 27% return on equity.\nWe also continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline as we completed transactions to put approximately 40,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, 53% of our total land pipeline is under option, either with the land sellers or through our expanding land banking structures.\nSince making the decision to expand our use of land banking starting 15 months ago, we have placed approximately 25 communities, representing $1.5 billion worth of future land and development spend into such structures. And finally, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $4.3 billion in the business through land acquisition and development spend in 2023 and returned $1.2 billion to investors through share repurchases, dividends and debt paydown.\nInclusive of our 2023 spend, we have repurchased almost half of the 2013 shares outstanding since initiating the program over a decade ago. By remaining consistent in our business practices and making market responsive adjustments were needed, we reported another year of exceptional financial results. I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their tireless efforts in support of delivering superior homes and experiences to our homebuyers while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors.\nConsistent with the broader housing market, we saw home buying demand being negatively impacted during the early part of the fourth quarter as 30-year mortgage rates increased toward their 2023 peak of 8%. We then saw buyer sentiment and demand improved as mortgage rates finally rolled over, ultimately dropping more than 100 basis points as we move through November and December. The decline in rates helped drive our December net new orders and absorption pace to be the highest month in the quarter.\nThe increased home buying activity in December was an important driver of the 57% increase in our Q4 net new orders and demonstrates the desire for homeownership remains high across all buyer groups. It remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is extremely positive. A structural shortage of housing caused by years under building has only been exacerbated by a lack of resale inventory as the owners are financially and/or emotionally locked into their low-rate mortgages.\nWhile the lack of existing home inventory will resolve itself over time, we believe that land entitlement and labor availability challenges mean it will be difficult to correct for the many years of underbuilding in this country. Given our constructive views on the outlook for housing demand, we are investing in our operations with the goal of growing unit volumes by 5% to 10% annually. Our decision to walk away from option lots as interest rates increased in 2022 and will impact our community openings in 2024, leading to our growth this year being closer to the lower end of this range as we expect closings of approximately 30,000 homes in 2024.\nFor those of you who have followed PulteGroup's story for the past few years, you know it's never been about growth for growth's sake. Our focus is always on investing in our business to build shareholder value so our objective is to grow our volumes while maintaining high returns on equity. To accomplish this, we must continue to intelligently invest in high-quality and high-returning projects while continuing to invest in our own assets through the ongoing repurchase of our stock.\nAs we have demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend and return excess capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our Board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization.\nWith many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy and conditions in the job market to remain favorable, there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years. Let me now turn over the call to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan mentioned in his comments, market conditions changed meaningfully as the fourth quarter progressed and as mortgage rates begin to fall. Our reported financial results for the period were influenced by these evolving market dynamics, so I'll note any important areas of impact in my prepared remarks.\nWholesale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.2 billion compared with $5 billion in the prior year. Our lower home sale revenues for the period primarily reflects a 14% decrease in closings to 7,650 homes, along with a 2% decrease in our average sales price to $547,000. I would highlight that our fourth quarter closings came in about 5% below our previous guide as sales early in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and the general softening in overall buyer demand.\nAs Ryan noted, online demand accelerated in the back half of the quarter, but sales, particularly sales of finished spec homes that would close in the quarter finished below our assumptions. We could have captured incremental sales and closing value by offering higher incentives and we didn't see that as a worthwhile trade-off. Given that buyer trends have remained positive in January, I think we made the right choices as we have inventory available to meet the stronger demand.\nOur mix of closings in the quarter were comprised of 40% first-time, 36% move-up and 24% active adult which is in alignment with our stated goal for the buyer mix for our business. In the fourth quarter of '22, closings were 36% first-time, 39% move-up and 25% active [ adult ]. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 919, which represents an 8% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 850 communities and was in line with our prior guidance.\nLooking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders increased 57% over last year to 6,214 homes. The large increase over last year reflects both improved demand in 2023, as well as the extremely difficult operating environment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As discussed previously, demand conditions grew increasingly difficult early in the fourth quarter this year as mortgage rates climbed to 8%. But we experienced a notable improvement in buying activity as rates decreased over the back half of the quarter. On a sequential basis, our absorption pace improved from November to December, and we would attribute much of this improvement to the decline in interest rates.\nAlong with stronger demand conditions, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net new orders benefited from a decrease in cancellation rate. In the most recent quarter, insulation as a percentage of beginning period backlog fell to 9%, down from 11% in the comparable prior year period.\nLooking at our order activity by buyer. Fourth quarter net new orders increased 70% for first-time buyers, 78% for move-up buyers and 15% for active adult buyers. Our order numbers indicate that demand improved across all buyer groups, which is a very positive dynamic when assessing potential housing demand in 2024.\nAs a result of our sales and closings activity, our quarter end backlog was 12,146 homes, which is effectively flat with last year. Reflective of the increased mix of first-time buyers and their lower average sales prices, our ending backlog value declined slightly to $7.3 billion.\nInclusive of the 7,128 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,809 homes in production. 44% of our production is spec, including 1,263 finished specs which puts us in a strong position to meet buyer demand as we head into the spring selling season. By the end of the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time was down to 130 days which is a sequential improvement of about 2 weeks from the end of the third quarter. Going forward, we continue to target getting our cycle time down to 100 days or below by the end of the year.\nBased on our production pipeline, we expect closings in the first quarter of 2024 to be between 6,200 and 6,600 homes. And given our units under production, we expect full year deliveries to grow by 5% to 30,000 homes. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to remain in the range of $540,000 to $550,000 for the first quarter and the full year of 2024 which is consistent with our fourth quarter pricing. At the midpoint, this would imply price stability over the course of the year.\nOur fourth quarter gross margin was 28.9%, which is down approximately 50 basis points from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year but likely remains the industry leader among the big builders. As with the entire year, our fourth quarter margins reflect higher incentive and input costs. Incentives, which primarily impact revenues, increased 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 6.5%.\nOn the cost side, lower lumber prices offset inflation and other material and labor but higher land and land development costs impacted margins in the period. Given my prior comments that we expect pricing to be flat [ in ] 2024, we anticipate that land and house cost inflation will result in gross margins to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% for each quarter during the year.\nWe reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $308 million or 7.4% of home sale revenues compared with prior year SG&A expense of $351 million or 7.1%. The 30 basis point drop in overhead leverage can be attributed to the lower closings and revenues realized in the quarter versus the prior year. It should be noted that we reported $65 billion of pretax insurance benefits in the fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022.\nBased on anticipated closing volumes, we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Given our typical seasonality of closings, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be approximately 10% of home sale revenues, with overhead leverage improving as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pretax income of $44 million, which is up from $24 million last year. The improvement in pretax income reflects more favorable market conditions across our financial services platform, coupled with higher capture rates, including an increase to 85%, up from 75% last year in our mortgage operations.\nOur reported pretax income for the most recent quarter was $947 million compared with prior year pretax [indiscernible] of $1.2 billion. In the period, we recorded a tax expense of $236 million or an effective tax rate of 24.9%. Projecting ahead to 2024 we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%.\nLooking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $882 million or $3.85 per share. For the full year of 2023, we reported net income of $2.6 billion and a record earnings of $11.72 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, in 2023, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion.\nGiven our current expectations for operating and financial results, along with our plans to increase land investment of $5 billion in the coming year, we expect 2024 cash flows from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion.\nTurning to our investment and capital allocation activities. We invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, of which 59% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $4.3 billion, of which 59% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer-term housing dynamics, as noted, our plan is to increase our land spend to approximately $5 billion in 2024. We would again anticipate a roughly 60-40 split between development and land acquisition. This increase in investment is consistent with Ryan's earlier comments regarding positioning the business to routinely grow future delivery volumes by 5% to 10% per year.\nInclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended 2023 with 223,000 lots under control, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our own block count by 4,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by roughly 16,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased and 53%, up from 48% last year. There's still a lot of runway ahead of us to achieve our goal of 70% option lots, but we're moving in the right direction.\nBased on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings of 2024, we expect our average community count in 2024 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we continue to return capital to shareholders in 2023.\nTo that end, we paid out $142 million in dividends and have increased our dividend per share by 25% starting in the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased [ 13.8 billion ] common shares at a cost of $1 billion or an average price of $72.50 per share, which included $300 million of repurchases at an average price of $83.03 per share in the fourth quarter. With the [ 13.8 billion ] shares acquired in '23, we have repurchased approximately half of the shares outstanding at the time we initiated the program back in 2013. As we repurchased these shares at an average cost of $32.16 per share, we believe it's been a great investment for our shareholders.\nIn addition to buying our stock in the fourth quarter, we took advantage of market conditions by using $35 million of cash on hand to pay down a portion of our debt. For all of 2023, we retired [ $101 million ] of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions, helping to lower our quarter end debt to capital ratio to 15.9%, down 280 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we ended the year with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 1.1%. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Successfully navigating our business through the past 12 months of rising interest rates has been challenging. The same could be said about the past 24, 36 and 48 month periods as we battle through COVID and the global collapse in supply chains. I am extremely proud of how our entire team responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over an unprecedented period.\nLooking back over the 5-year period of 2019 to the just recently completed 2023, we grew volumes 5% annually and delivered just under 135,000 homes. To support our growth during this period and for future years, we invested almost $19 billion in cumulative land acquisition and development spend.\nThrough our disciplined land investment, operational focus and organizational expertise, we capitalized on market conditions to grow earnings per share over this period at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, while delivering an average annual return on equity of just over 26%. It's this type of strong financial performance during an extended period of market volatility that has prompted increased discussion about the need to reconsider how the large homebuilders are valued. I think that if you want to be valued differently, you must demonstrate a fundamental change in how you operate the business and the results you deliver. Not just for a year or 2, but over an extended period of time.\nWhat's different about the past 5 years is that while investing $19 billion into our operation, we also generated almost $7 billion in net cash flow from operations during the sustained period of growth. In fact, we recorded only 1 year of negative cash flow from operations since shifting our focus in 2012 from just top line growth to driving high returns over the housing cycle. We paid off $1.1 billion of debt, while cutting our leverage by more than half to end 2023 with a debt-to-capital ratio of 15.9% and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 1.1%. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I'd add that the reality is we've been operating our business in just this way for really the past 10 years.\nI know stocks reflect performance. So I believe that if we can continue to both grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders, while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low-risk profile that our stock price and shareholders will ultimately be rewarded. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. [indiscernible], if you would explain the process, we'll get started."

My name is Avi and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded, [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And I will now turn the conference over to Mr. James Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Zeumer, you may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Adi. We appreciate everyone joining today's call to discuss PulteGroup's third quarter operating and financial results. As detailed in this morning's earnings release, PulteGroup's delivered another quarter of strong earnings as we continue to capitalize on our competitive strengths and balanced approach to distance. Joining me on today's call to discuss our Q3 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nA copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to inform everyone that today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. As we will discuss over the next several minutes, PulteGroup reported another quarter of outstanding and for a number of key metrics, record financial results. Our financial performance demonstrates once again the importance of PulteGroup's balanced and differentiated operating model. Leveraging our broad geographic footprint and diversified product offering, we are working to maintain significant market share among all major buyer groups. At the same time, we are successfully executing both large-scale spec and build-to-order homebuilding businesses. Our spec business allows us to more cost efficiently serve first-time buyers, while our build-to-order business caters to move up and active adult buyers looking to personalize their home location and design features.\nSpecific to our financial results, I am extremely proud of our entire organization for their efforts in delivering third quarter results that include a 43% increase in orders, industry-leading gross margins of 29.5%, record third quarter earnings of $2.90 per share and a return on equity that exceeded 30%. In the quarter, I would highlight our active adult business as an important contributor to our sign of growth and our gross margin performance. In an operating environment where rising mortgage rates are creating increasing affordability challenges, 47% of our Delaware purchasers are cash buyers. This is up from 33% just 2 years ago.\nAlong with largely being cash buyers, these are customers who can afford the premium locks and upgrades that make active adult, our highest-margin business. Just to demonstrate the brand power of the Del Webb, in June, we opened [indiscernible] on Ridge in Michigan, not a market you might consider a hotspot for retirees. In a community where base home prices range from $370,000 to north of $600,000. We have already sold 114 houses in just over 100 days. We fully appreciate that to some degree, all buyers are impacted by rising rates and macroeconomic concerns.\nThe buyer groups can absolutely behave differently over the course of a housing cycle. For Pulte Group, we believe being diversified across all buyer groups can enhance both growth and stability. Beyond our diversification across buyer groups, MultiGroup's strong third quarter financial performance also benefited from our ability to offer consumers both spec build and build-to-order homes. As we have discussed on prior calls, over the past 24 months, we have transitioned our first-time buyer communities to a spec build model to better serve these customers. Looking at our first-time business, spec building allows us to maintain a more consistent cadence of starts in those communities, which drives construction efficiencies and is important in working with our trades. More directly to our quarter, having additional inventory available was important, given 49% of our sales in the period were spec sales. I would note that 49% spec sales in the quarter is down from 58% in Q1 of this year. I think the decrease in the relative percentage of spec sales in the quarter reflects 2 interesting dynamics. On one hand, the affordability challenges caused by higher interest rates are pushing some buyers, particularly first-time buyers to the sidelines for now.\nOn the other hand, more affluent buyers who are less fearful about rates are comfortable contracting for a home where they've selected the lot, the floor plan and the design options. On the construction side, I'm pleased to say that we continue to shorten our production cycle. Just to remind people, pre-Covid, our production cycle was approximately 90 workdays. At its worst, this number ballooned to 170 days.\nBy the end of the quarter, we had reduced this number to\nnumber to about 140 days. Our teams continue to shave days and weeks off our build cycle, and we remain optimistic cutting more than a month off of our cycle time has positively impacted our cash flow. Which we continue to allocate across our key business priorities. Through the first 9 months of 2023, we have invested $3 billion in our business through land acquisition and development. Over the same period, we have returned over $800 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In this most recent quarter, we even took advantage of market conditions to retire $65 million of near-term debt at prices just below par.\nPulteGroup has delivered outstanding operating and financial performance in the quarter and throughout the first 9 months of the year as we have leveraged our strong competitive position to capitalize on buyer demand. It grows increasingly clear that Federal Reserve actions to raise interest rates are having the desired effect of slowing the economy, although the speed of deceleration has been slower than expected, given the unprecedented ramp in rates. While arguably not the most supportive economic backdrop, new home demand in 2023 has benefited from a robust jobs market and rising wages, financially resilient consumers and a continuing dearth of supply from the existing home market.\nAnd finally, as higher rates begin to bite, we responded with adjustments in product, pricing and incentive programs that successfully address consumers' biggest pain point. affordability. It's difficult to know if the Fed has done hiking rates for this economic cycle and trying to guess when they will move to cut rates is challenging. So we will remain disciplined in how we manage our business. We'll focus on serving our customers, supporting our employees, turning our assets and allocating capital appropriately while maintaining a strong and highly flexible capital position. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed analysis of our Q3 results. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. PulteGroup's third quarter results add to what has been an exceptional year for the company, as we have grown revenues and earnings, generated significant cash flow from operations, lowered our debt and generally strengthened our entire operating platform. Specific to our third quarter, Wholesale revenues increased 3% over last year to $3.9 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter reflect a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000 and in combination with a less than 1% increase in closings to 7,076 homes.\nThe 2% gain in average sales price of Homes closed in the quarter was driven by increases of 4% and 6% and for move-up and active adult buyers, respectively, partially offset by a 3% decrease among first-time buyers. The lower ASP among first-time buyer closings reflects our focus on remaining price competitive as interest rates have moved higher throughout the year. The mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed just slightly from the prior year as we continue to operate within the range of our stated mix of business. For the quarter, closings among first-time buyers represented [ 30% -- 38% ] of the business, move-up buyers totaled 37% and active adult buyers represented 25% in [ homes closed ]. In third quarter of last year, 36% of homes delivered for the first time, 38% were moved up and 26% per active adult.\nNet new orders for the third quarter increased 43% over last year to 7,065 homes as we realized year-over-year gains in both units and absorption pace across all buyer groups Orders among first-time buyers in the third quarter increased 53% over last year to 2,979 homes. Gain above move-up tiers is even greater as net new orders increased 56% to 2,524 homes. And finally, on a comparable community count, we realized a double-digit gain in sales among active adult buyers as net new orders for the quarter increased to 1,562 ones.\nIn the third quarter, we operated from an average of 923 communities, which is up 12% over last year. Adjusting for community count, the monthly absorption base in the third quarter averaged 2.5 homes, which is up from 2.0 homes per month in the third quarter of last year. As a percentage of beginning backlog, our cancellation rate in the third quarter was 9% compared with 8% in the prior year. To be clear, on a unit basis, cancellations in the third quarter were down more than 20% from last year. But the relative size of our backlog in each period results of the cancellation rates being comparable. Our unit backlog at the end of the quarter was 13,547 homes compared with 17,053 homes at the end of last year's third quarter.\nOn a dollar basis, the value of our ending backlog was $8.1 billion, down from $10.6 billion in the third quarter of last year. At the end of the third quarter, we had a total of 17,376 homes under construction. This is down 24% from the same period last year as we strategically manage starts and realize the benefits of faster cycle times. Of the homes under construction, 61% were sold and 39% were spec. As we have stated previously, we are comfortable putting spec unit into production, but we are thoughtful about aligning the pace of starts pace of sales to help to reduce the risk of putting too much inventory on the ground.\nConsistent with this measured approach to production of the 6,700 spec homes currently under construction fewer than 1,000 were finished. Given our Q3 community count of 923, we continue to impair approximately 1 finished spec per community, which is in line with our operating targets. Based on the homes we have in production and as importantly, current sales trends, we expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. Delivering 8,000 homes in the fourth quarter would put us at 29,000 for the full year which is down slightly from our previous guide for full year closings to be 29,500 homes.\nChange in our guide reflects the more challenging affordability conditions resulting from higher rates as well as the slight shift in our mix towards build-to-order homes, which won't deliver until 2024. Given the mix of homes we currently expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we expect our average sales price on closing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000 in the period. Our third quarter home sale gross margin of 29.5% continues to lead the industry as we successfully turned our assets while still achieving high levels of profitability and driving high returns on investment.\nPulteGroup's reported results benefited from strong margin performance across all buyer groups, first-time move-up and active adult. Further, as we have talked about on prior calls, our diversified product portfolio is allowing us to capture higher gross margins that are typically available within our move-up and active adult communities. As I would remind everyone, our primary focus is always on driving high returns on invested capital. but we appreciate margins are an important contributor to achieving such returns. This is why we remain disciplined in where we locate and how we underwrite our communities and how we design and build our houses and in how we strategically price our homes in the marketplace.\nGiven the ongoing strength of our margins, we continue to get questions regarding relative margin performance among the large public pillars. I want to quickly address a line of thought that our margins benefit from land positions within our older Del Webb Legacy communities. The reality is that the margins in these communities are comparable to the rest of our active adult business, but they aren't inflating our aggregate numbers. That being said, I'm pleased to say that we expect to continue delivering high margins and continue to expect wholesale gross margins to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% in the fourth quarter.\nGiven current interest rates, demand and cost dynamics, we would expect to be towards the lower end of this range. SG&A expense in the third quarter totaled $353 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $350 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues.\nBased on anticipating closing volumes for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8.8%. In the third quarter, pretax input from financial services was $29 million, up from $27.5 billion last year. While market conditions remain highly competitive for our financial services operations. The business benefited from a higher capture rate of 84% compared with 77% last year. Large increase in capture rate relates to the expanded use of rate-based incentives, which are executed through our mortgage operations.\nLooking at our taxes consistent with our prior guide. Our third quarter tax expense was $209 million or an effective tax rate of 24.6%. For the fourth quarter, we continue to guide to a tax rate of 24.5%. PulteGroup's bottom line results showed net income for the quarter of $639 million or $2.90 per share which is up from prior year net income of $628 million or $2.69 per share. Given the ongoing financial strength and cash flow generation of our business, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $300 million in the quarter. This is up from $180 million last year and $250 million in the second quarter of this year. In the third quarter, we also elected to allocate capital towards paying down a portion of our debt.\nIn total, we retired $65 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions at prices slightly below par. Inclusive of these transactions, we lowered our debt-to-capital ratio to 16.5%, which is down 220 basis points from the start of '23, down 600 basis points from the third quarter of '22. Adjusting for the $1.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, our net debt to capital ratio was less than 1%. Beyond buying back our equity and debt in the third quarter, we also invested $1.2 billion in the business through land acquisition and development, which keeps us on track to invest upwards of $4 billion in 2023. Almost 2/3 of our investment in the third quarter was for the development of our existing land assets.\nInclusive of our Q3 spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 53% are [indiscernible] . We continue to systematically rebuild the optionality of our land pipeline after having walked away from select land positions in the back half of 2022. As part of this rebuilding process and consistent with our stated strategy of getting more land line, we are expanding our use of differently land banking structures. To date, we've completed land banking transactions for approximately 5,000 lots. Going forward, we will look to use such land banking facilities in order to create optionality in situations where the underlying seller requires a bulk [indiscernible] . It's a disciplined process as we work to balance land costs, returns and risks but we are gaining momentum in our efforts.\nWe are also getting more questions on our land pipeline. So let me add that about 1/3 of the lots we have under control are developed, and we continue to develop most of the lots that we acquire. As a large homebuilder, assuming you're confident in the third party's ability to consistently deliver [indiscernible] on time. The decision to purchase finished lots versus run dirt comes down to return. Finished lots cost more but can turn faster, whereas the lower cost of undeveloped plots can drive higher margins, but the land is on balance sheet for a little long term.\nIn all of our land transactions we assess how best to drive higher risk-adjusted returns and to find opportunities and deals for finished and/or undeveloped plots. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nAs you would anticipate, given our 43% increase in net new orders, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter. Q3 displayed more typical seasonality than we have experienced in the 3 years since COVID as absorption pace eased as we moved through the quarter. Demand has been a little choppier in the first few weeks of October, with more volatility in the day-to-day sales numbers. I'm sure for some buyers, higher rates have pushed affordability just that much further away while others may be worried about their jobs.\nFor other buyers, global unrest may simply have them thinking of other things. We are fortunate to have an experienced operating team that will make adjustments if and when needed. On a year-over-year basis, for the first 9 months of 2023, we have increased net income by $156 million and increased earnings per share by 17%. Over the same period, we've increased our cash position by approximately $1.6 billion while dropping our net debt-to-capital ratio effectively to 0. And based on guidance that we've given, we look forward to delivering exceptional full year results for 2023.\nFrom population growth and demographics to supply dynamics, and the tremendous opportunity for wealth creation through homeownership, we are bullish on long-term housing demand. Over the near term, however, we fully appreciate the affordability challenges being created by higher mortgage rates and the potential impacts from an economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve is hoping to bring about. As such, we remain disciplined in how we operate our business, particularly as it relates to investing in land the pace production, the allocation of capital and the quality of homes and experience we deliver to our customers.\nWe have a clear and successful operating model against which we have been executing for over a decade. So decision-making throughout the organization is consistent and actions are implemented quickly. This strong organizational foundation along with tremendous financial strength has PulteGroup well positioned for ongoing success.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire team at PulteGroup for their tremendous efforts in delivering for our home buyers our shareholders and each other. I am so proud of what you accomplish every day. Let me turn the call back to Jim so we can begin Q&A.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Avi, we're ready to open for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG."

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nAnd I will now turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss PulteGroup's exceptional second quarter operating and financial results. Along with affirming the ongoing desire for homeownership and the strength of overall buyer demand, our second quarter numbers demonstrate the strategic value of PulteGroup's balanced and disciplined approach to the business.\nJoining me on today's call to discuss our Q2 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today.\nI want to inform everyone on today's call that today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments.

Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, Q2 was an outstanding quarter for PulteGroup as we posted strong financial results throughout our P&L, balance sheet and cash flow statement. In fact, our second quarter revenues, gross and operating margins and net income were at or are approaching all-time highs for our second quarter.\nOur record financial performance in turn drove strong cash flows that helped raise our cash position to $1.8 billion, while dropping our net debt-to-capital ratio to almost 0. I am really proud of our homebuilding and financial services teams for delivering these great results, which are even more impressive given the variable market conditions we've operated in for the past 12 months.\nWithin these complicated market dynamics, I believe PulteGroup's operating and financial success reflects the balanced and disciplined approach we take in running our homebuilding business.\nWe continue to successfully implement both a build-to-order model that serves our move-up and active adult buyers in combination with a spec-based model, primarily within our first-time buyer communities. Our spec production is most heavily weighted toward our Centex branded communities, which operate under a managed spec production model. In other words, homes are started to spec, but we have aligned the starts cadence with our sales pace. Given Centex' focus on serving the needs of first-time buyers, our long-term plan is to maintain a spec build model in these communities.\nBy being more balanced across build-to-order and spec production, we maintain a more consistent cadence of home starts, meet buyer demand more effectively, and we achieved the critical objective of turning our assets in support of higher returns. You can see the practical application of this managed approach in our Q2 numbers that specs totaled 36% of units under production at quarter end. Of these units, we averaged just over one finished spec per community, which is in line with our stated goal.\nAlong with the balance between our build-to-order and spec production, we are appropriately diversified across all the buyer groups consistent with our long-term goal of having 40% first-time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult. Why is this important? The different financial profiles associated with each buyer group can mean different responses to changing market dynamics, such as today's rising rate environment, which may hinder first-time buyers, but be less of a headwind among active adult consumers.\nBeing balanced across build-to-order, spec and buyer groups is also an important underpinning to the extremely high gross margins we've been able to maintain. More directly, we have enough production to meet buyer demand, but not so much that we are no longer selling from a position of strength.\nI think we've achieved the right mix as we increased orders and closings, all while 2/3 of our divisions were still able to raise prices in the quarter. Along these same lines, we continue to see pricing opportunities within our core build-to-order business that primarily serves our move-up and active adult buyers.\nIn our most recent quarter, options and lot premiums exceeded $100,000 per home. These are high-margin dollars that are not as prevalent among first-time buyers and certainly were an important driver of the strong 29.6% gross margin we reported in Q2. While the market started slowing in 2022, I said that we couldn't be margin proud, but rather we had to find price and turn our assets.\nDelivering 24% growth in Q2 orders, and as Bob will detail, guiding to margins of 29% or better for the remainder of the year, we are achieving both high margins and high asset turns, which drove our 32% return on equity.\nBeyond the company's specific benefits we are realizing from how we run our business, we appreciate the favorable supply-demand dynamics resulting from the limited stock of existing houses available for sale. National Association of Realtors' data for June showed seasonally adjusted existing home sales of $4.2 million, which is down a staggering 1 million homes from June of last year.\nAs has been well reported, there are millions of existing homeowners who are sitting on low rate mortgages established before the most recent cycle of Fed rate hikes. I recently saw an FHA graph that showed that more than 50% of current mortgage holders have a rate below 4%. I haven't seen any rate forecast that show the country getting back to 4% mortgages anytime soon. So it's likely that existing homes remain in short supply for the foreseeable future.\nFHA data, along with mortgage rate forecasts, suggest that there may be an extended period during which mortgage rates stay above 5%, which likely prevents an oversupply of existing homes being released into the market. Through the first 6 months of 2023, we generated $1.3 billion of net income and $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations. As a result, we increased our cash position by almost $700 million while returning almost $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I think these numbers clearly demonstrate the powerful results our company is delivering.\nWith the backlog of $8.2 billion worth of homes to be built, improving cycle times and a solid land supply, we are well positioned to deliver even stronger performance over the remainder of 2023.\nNow let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our second quarter numbers speak for themselves in terms of demonstrating the strength of our operations and in turn, overall housing demand to sell just dive right in. Our second quarter home sale revenues totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% over last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 5% increase in closings to 7,518 homes in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $540,000. Our ability to meet stronger demand in the period with available spec inventory allowed us to slightly exceed our prior closing guidance.\nFor the quarter, our mix of closings was comprised of 41% first-time buyers, 34% move-up buyers and 25% active adult buyers. The breakdown of our business remains in line with our stated targets of 40% first time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult.\nIn the second quarter of last year, our closing mix was 36% first time, 38% move-up and 26% active adult. Our net new orders in the second quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,947 homes. The double-digit increase in our orders benefited from the overall strength of market demand in the period along with our ability to capture this demand through a 14% increase in our average community count to 903 neighborhoods.\nThe strength of consumer demand is also evident in our cancellation rate. Cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog was 9% in this quarter, which is down almost 350 basis points on a sequential basis from the first quarter. The 24% increase in our second quarter net new orders reflect an increase in our absorption pace to 2.9 homes per month of 2.7 homes per month last year and resulted in higher net new orders across all buyer groups.\nIn the period, net new orders from first-time buyers increased 28% over the prior year to 3,150 homes. Orders for move-up buyers increased 33% to 2,897 homes and orders from active adult buyers increased 7% to 1,900 homes. The year-over-year increase in first-time buyer orders shows that our homes continue to offer a compelling value and meet the affordability requirements of this buyer group. At the same time, our higher net new orders among move-up and active adult buyers is a positive development and a test to the broad mix strength of housing demand.\nConsistent with our prior guidance, we have year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% in the third and fourth quarters, each as compared to the comparable prior year period. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13,588 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. In the second quarter of last year, our backlog stood at 19,176 homes valued at a record peak of $11.6 billion.\nWe ended the second quarter with a total of 16,740 homes under construction, of which approximately 6,000 or 36% were spec. We continue to closely manage spec production as total specs under construction at quarter end were down 11% from last year. Finished specs are also consistent with our historical carrier rate as we ended the quarter with about 1 finished spec per community.\nIn the second quarter, we started approximately 7,400 homes, which is up 41% compared to the first quarter of this year. Given the strength of PulteGroup's year-to-date orders and deliveries, coupled with the status of our backlog and production universe, we're establishing a full year 2023 delivery target of 29,500 homes. Of this total, we would expect to deliver between indiscernible] and 7,400 homes in the third quarter. Our third quarter and full year delivery targets are benefiting from [indiscernible] construction cycle times as our operations are realizing meaningful improvements on cycle times at homes they are starting today.\nBased on the mix of backlog loans we expect to deliver in the third and fourth quarters, coupled with the anticipated spec closings, we are protecting in those periods, we expect the average sales price on third and fourth quarter closings to be approximately $540,000.\nTurning to margins. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was 29.6%. The improvement in our margin as compared to our previous guide was due to improved pricing on spec sales and increased closings from our higher-margin markets, each as compared to a prior estimates. In addition, as we discussed on our prior earnings call, our aggregate gross margins are benefiting from our move-up and active adult business where profitability [indiscernible] better.\nBased on current market dynamics, we expect to maintain this strong margin position throughout the remainder of '23 and expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.0% to 29.5% in both the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we experienced in the second quarter, the actual weeks of deliveries, both in terms of geography and buyer groups, may impact our reported numbers.\nOur reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $315 million or 7.8% of home sale revenues and included a $65 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In the second quarter of last year, our SG&A expense was $351 million or 9.3% of home sale revenues. Based on our delivery targets for the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5% of home sale revenues in the third quarter in the range of 8% to 8.5% of home sale revenues in the fourth quarter.\nSecond quarter pretax income generated by our financial services operations increased 16% over last year to $46 million. Pricing conditions remain highly competitive in the mortgage industry, but quarterly earnings benefited from improved profitability within our title and insurance operations. Capture rate in the second quarter improved to 80% compared with 78% last year. Our reported tax expense in the second quarter was $233 million or an effective tax rate of 24.4%. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of '23 to be 24.5%. On the bottom line, our reported second quarter net income was a record $740 million or $3.21 per share. This was up from last year's reported net income of $652 million or $2.73 per share.\nCapitalizing on our outstanding financial results and resulting cash flows, we repurchased 3.7 million common shares in the quarter at a cost of $250 million at an average price of $68.31 per share. Through the first 6 months of '23, we have used $400 million to repurchase 6.4 million shares or 2.8% of our common shares outstanding.\nWe also invested $370 million in land acquisition and $523 million in related development during the quarter. In total, our land sale in the period was $893 million, which is down from $1.1 billion through the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, this year, we have invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition development, which keeps us on track to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion for the full year.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had 214,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The total number of lots we control and the percentage of lots we controlled via option both increased from Q1 of this year as we are working to rebuild our option lot supply after exiting positions in the back half of 2022.\nWe also ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 17.3%. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio is now below 3%.\nLooking briefly at our full year results, on a year-to-date basis, we have generated net income of $1.3 billion, drove the book value of our stock by 12% and returned $472 million to shareholders. At the same time, our financial performance has permitted us to reduce our financial leverage to historic lows, and we have generated a return on equity for the trailing 12 months of 32%.\nThank you, and I'll turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. As we've commented, homebuyer demand in the second quarter was strong and continued to exceed the expectation we had coming into the year. In the overwhelming majority of our markets, local pricing dynamics are stable to positive, and we continue to find opportunities to modestly increase net pricing in many of our communities. Further, at an absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month for the period, sales pace for the second quarter was above last year and generally above our pre-COVID averages.\nDemand in the second quarter was fairly consistent from month to month. And as you would anticipate, with a 24% increase in orders, we generally saw positive demand across our markets, which has continued into the month of July. That being said, on a relative basis, there are communities in our Western markets where we are still having to adjust pricing and/or incentives to entice buyers into our communities and ensure we continue to turn our assets.\nGiven the higher interest rate environment, one of the changes we have seen in the -- is the slight increase in the number of cash buyers, particularly among our active adult customers. As this buyer group moves into our plans for retirement, they are making the decision to carry less mortgage debt given today's higher rates. At the other end of the price spectrum, final purchase decisions among first-time buyers are also being impacted by higher rates. As data suggests, some first-time buyers are opting to go with less square footage or fewer options and upgrades as buyers need to purchase a home in today's dynamic market environment is why our ability to offer a significant mortgage incentive nationally is such an effective sales tool.\nWith that said, our first-time buyers remain financially resilient as personal savings remain the primary source of down payment. At the same time, we continue to see millennials are getting self-support from parents if they need help making the move into homeownership.\nOne final note as to buyer sentiment, recent feedback from our first-time buyers indicate that an overwhelming majority bought a new construction Pulte home rather than an existing home because they felt it offered the best overall value. We've been extremely thoughtful about the home designs we are putting on the ground and the incentives we are offering to help ensure we are offering a compelling value to our customers.\nThese comments in combination with our 28% increase in second quarter orders within the first-time buyer group indicate our efforts are meeting with success. In closing, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their efforts in delivering such outstanding operating and financial results. On the numbers we show in our financial statements, you continue to provide exceptional homes and home buying experiences to our customers.\nI will now turn the call back to Jim.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the time remaining. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I'll now ask Avi to explain the process and open the call for questions."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Audra. Good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining today's call. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup had an exceptional first quarter, and we are excited to discuss our operating and financial results. Participating on today's call, Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today.\nAs noted in this morning's earnings release, to be more consistent with industry reporting practices, effective with our first quarter 2023 reporting, the company has reclassified closing cost incentives and cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. This reclassification impacted the company's reported home sale revenues and associated average sales price as well as home sale gross margin and SG&A percentages, but had no impact on reported earnings. An analysis of the impacts on the current quarter in comparable prior year period is included in this morning's press release and can be found in our webcast slides associated with today's call.\nOur comments today reflect these changes for all periods referenced. Also, I want to inform everyone that today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides.\nThese risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. Based on the improving demand dynamics, we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, we were cautiously optimistic heading into 2023. I am extremely pleased to report the market momentum that began building in Q4 continued to expand in the first -- into the first quarter of 2023. Today's stronger market conditions, combined with actions implemented by our outstanding field teams to enhance our competitive position helped drive our first -- strong first quarter results that included a 15% growth in home sale revenues, a 100 basis point increase in operating margin and a 28% increase in earnings per share.\nAmong the actions we've taken has been to increase our production of spec homes, a strategy we began implementing in the back half of 2022. As discussed on previous earnings calls, we made the decision to increase spec starts as we saw the opportunity to realize a number of strategic benefits within our homebuilding operations. With more units in production, we can better meet buyer demand as more consumers are seeking quick move-in homes as a hedge against rising mortgage rates.\nBy maintaining the level of spec starts, we can commit to a more consistent start cadence. This is particularly valuable in today's environment when negotiating with our trades and suppliers. Keeping units in production allows us to turn assets more efficiently, which is critical to delivering high returns over the housing cycle. The importance of having an appropriate inventory of spec homes available can be seen in our first quarter sign-ups, which on a gross basis, increased 1% over last year to 8,900 homes.\nOf these sign-ups, almost 60% were spec sales, so the decision to increase spec starts was the right one. That said, I want to be clear that our strategy is to keep starts directionally in alignment with market demand. We believe this balanced approach is consistent with both these historic business practices and allows us to turn our assets, while maintaining a better margin profile.\nOur first quarter results show that we are successfully executing against this strategy as we realized strong sales, while still delivering exceptional gross margins of 29.1%. You've heard me say that we won't be margin proud, but we also won't sacrifice profits if we don't have to. By being more measured in our starts cadence, we can meet buyer demand, while not oversupplying the market.\nCase in point, we ended the first quarter with 1,500 fewer specs in production than we started the quarter. This gives us flexibility to maintain or increase production volumes, which in today's market is an important lever, when working with trades and suppliers. As it relates to overall housing demand, home sales are benefiting from recent declines in mortgage rates, but I also think just having a general sense of stability in rates is important to consumer confidence.\nGiven improvements in demand conditions in the broader interest rate environment as well as a generally limited inventory of existing homes, we are starting to see the pressure on selling prices ease in many of our markets. In fact, and well over half of our markets, we have found opportunities to pull back on incentives and/or move prices higher in many of our communities. While the price changes are modest, it demonstrates the point that people desire home ownership and are willing to buy when they see a value.\nEarlier this month, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that looked at the housing shortage in this country. The article raised the point that depending upon which expert you ask, the housing shortage ranges from 2 million to 7 million houses. While there are certainly debates about the number, I think there is broad agreement that we have a housing shortage. I believe this is one of the reasons homebuyers are quick to respond when affordability pressures can be eased.\nBefore turning the call over to Bob, let me take a minute to address impacts on credit availability given recent disruptions in the banking industry, particularly among the regional banks. The short answer is that we have not experienced any disruptions. On the mortgage side, we are advantaged by having a captive financial services operation that routinely originates mortgages for between 75% to 80% of Pulte homebuyers that require financing.\nOn the project side, big builders such as PulteGroup, self-fund or have access to capital that smaller builders typically cannot match. In the end, it may be that recent disturbances in the banking sector may create opportunities for PulteGroup to put its more than $2 billion in total liquidity to work. I am very proud of our team as PulteGroup delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter.\nI'm also highly encouraged by the improving demand conditions we have been experiencing over the past 2 quarters. And I would add that buyer demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of April. While we have and will continue to take steps to best position PulteGroup for success within today's changing market dynamics, we remain measured and disciplined in our actions.\nFrom production rates and land spend to overheads and share repurchases, we remain focused on delivering performance over the long term. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter.\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we have reclassified closing cost incentives from cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. The total incentive reclassified amounted to $81 million in the first quarter of this year and $38 million in the first quarter of last year. This reclassification impacted our reported home sales revenue and associated average sales prices as well as our reported home sale gross margin and SG&A percentage.\nAn analysis of the impact of this reclassification in the current quarter, and prior year periods is included in today's webcast slides. Where appropriate, any numbers referenced in my comments, current, past or future are inclusive of this reclass. Let me now get started with a review of our first quarter results.\nHome sale revenues in the first quarter increased 15% over the prior year to a first quarter record of $3.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflected 6% increase in closings to 6,394 homes and a 9% increase in average sales price to $545,000. On a year-over-year basis, we realized higher average sales prices across all buyer groups, led by double-digit gains in both move-up and active adult.\nIn the quarter, we reported 6,394 closings, which represents a 6% increase over the comparable prior year period. Our closings for the quarter came in above our guide as we capitalized on stronger demand for spec homes an improvement in select areas of our supply chain that allowed us to close additional homes in the period. I'd like to take a moment to thank our procurement and construction teams working in partnership with our trades and suppliers for their contributions over the last several quarters.\nTheir efforts during a time of extraordinary market volatility were instrumental to the operating success we have achieved. Looking at the mix of our closings in the quarter, our results included 39% from first-time buyers, 35% from move-up buyers and 26% from active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the closing mix was 34% first-time, 40% move-up and 26% active adult.\nThe higher percentage of closings from first-time buyers reflects our increased investment in that part of our business over the last several years, as well as an increase in the availability of spec homes in our first-time communities, resulting from our decision to increase spec production in the back half of 2022.\nLooking at our orders in the quarter, our net new orders totaled 7,354 homes, which is down 8% from the prior year. Our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog was 13% in the first quarter, which is up from 4% last year. On a sequential basis, the 13% cancellation rate is up less than 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. So cancellations are beginning to stabilize.\nIn fact, on a unit basis, cancellations in this quarter amounted to 1,544 homes, which is down sequentially from 1,871 homes in the fourth quarter. By buyer group, net new orders to first-time buyers increased 18% over the prior year to 3,177 homes, while move-up orders decreased by 20% to 2,645 homes, and active adult orders were lower by 22% to 1,532 homes. Our average community count in the first quarter increased 13% over last year to 879.\nBased on the communities opened in the period, our absorption pace of 2.8 homes per month was down from the prior year, but in line with our pre-pandemic sales rate, which averaged 2.7 for the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020. Based on land investments we made in prior years, we expect to operate out of approximately 900 communities in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of 14% over the second quarter of last year.\nLooking over the balance of the year, we continue to expect community count growth of 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. Given our expanding community count, PulteGroup is well positioned to increase its market share within the improving demand environment. We ended the first quarter with a backlog of 13,129 homes with a value of $8 billion. This compares with last year's Q1 record backlog of 19,935 homes valued at $11.5 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 16,872 homes under construction, of which 15% were finished. Spec units represented 38% of our production, which is up from last year and consistent with our strategy to have specs available to meet buyer demand for homes that can close sooner.\nOver the course of the first quarter, we started production on approximately 5,200 homes. This start rate was down about 40% from the first quarter of last year, but up on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to drive an appropriate start cadence as we focus on turning our assets. Based on the roughly 17,000 homes we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to deliver between 7,000 and 7,400 homes in the second quarter.\nGiven the ongoing improvement in the overall operating environment, we're pleased by the level of production we've been able to realize, thanks to the efforts of our outstanding operating teams. In addition to these higher unit volumes, we are also seeing the beginning stages of a shortening in our production cycle. At this point, depending upon the market, the gains range from just a few days to a few weeks, but the trends are generally positive. Based on our strong Q1 results and the potential for cycle times to gradually improve, the production potential of homes will have available to close in 2023 has increased to 27,000, 28,000 homes. This is up from our initial guide of 25,000 homes.\nObviously, the strength of sign-ups in the second quarter will go a long way in determining how much of this production universe actually converts into 2023 closings. While the average sales price in our backlog is $608,000, we currently expect the average sales price to our second quarter closings to be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. That estimate reflects both the mix of homes scheduled to close as well as the impact of anticipated spec closings, which are primarily first-time loans that have a lower average sales price.\nWe reported first quarter gross margin of 29.1%, which was 20 basis points below last year. Please note that our reported gross margins in the first quarter benefited by approximately 70 basis points from the reclass of closing incentives and cost of sales to net revenue. The benefit to our first quarter 2022 gross margin was 40 basis points. I would highlight that in the current quarter, our margins benefited from our move-up and active adult business where pressures on our selling prices have been relatively less impactful compared with entry-level homes.\nAfter several years of gross margin parity across buyer groups, we are seeing a reversion to the historic trend of higher margins in our move-up and active adult business. Based on the mix of homes we plan to close in the second quarter, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. As with our closings and reported margins in the first quarter, deliveries in the second quarter will reflect the benefit of lower lumber costs that are flowing through our operations.\nIn the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $337 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our SG&A expense was $329 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Higher closings and associated revenues in this year's first quarter drove the improved overhead leverage relative to last year and our guide. With expected 2023 production volumes moving higher, we are carefully adding sales and construction staff but still expect to maintain overhead leverage.\nAs such, we expect second quarter SG&A to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5%. In the first quarter, our financial services operations reported pretax income of $14 million, which is down from $41 million in the prior year. Pretax income in the period was impacted by lower loan volumes competitive pricing dynamics and higher mortgage incentives being used throughout the industry.\nIn Q1, our capture rate was 78% compared with 81% last year. Market conditions have clearly improved but as we do under all market conditions, we continue to routinely reassess our own planned positions and pending land transactions. Based on this review process, in the first quarter, we walked away from 5,300 lots that were previously held under option and roll off approximately $6 million in associated deposits and pre-acquisition costs.\nIn the first quarter, our reported tax expense was $170 million for an effective tax rate of 24.2%. We expect our tax rate in the second quarter to be 24.5%. Our net income for the first quarter was $532 million or $2.35 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $455 million or $1.83 per share. In addition to significantly higher net income, our earnings per share benefited from the company's share repurchase program.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million common shares at a cost of $150 million or an average price of $54.30 per share. Consistent with our plans to continue returning excess [ shift ] funds to our shareholders, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available under the program to $1.2 billion. Along with returning funds to our shareholders, we continue to strategically invest in our business.\nIn the first quarter, we invested $906 million of land acquisition and development, down from $1.1 billion in Q1 of last year. Given the stronger demand environment and the increase in our overall construction activities, we now expect to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in land acquisition development in 2023. We ended the period with 210,000 lots under control. This is consistent with year-end and down 10% from last year.\nBased on our activity over the past several quarters, 61% of those lots are owned and 49% are optioned. We will continue to seek increased optionality of our land bank with a target of up to 70% of our lots being controlled via option. Reflecting the strength of our first quarter financial results and associated cash flows, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, which lowered our net debt to capital ratio to 7.2%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 18.1%, down from 21.5% at the end of the first quarter last year.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. I think there are a lot of positives to be taken out of our first quarter results, including we delivered record first quarter earnings, driven by higher closings, continued strong gross margins and improved overhead leverage. Overall market conditions continue to improve as we experienced strong demands and are finding opportunities to reduce incentives and/or increase prices in many communities.\nSupply chain conditions are stabilizing, and we have seen at least an initial turn towards shorter cycle times. At this point, the gains have been market-specific, but we are optimistic that we've seen a high watermark in terms of construction cycle times.\nOur national and local teams are making strides and climb back construction days, which is critical because shortening our cycle time is an important driver to expanding our 2023 production universe. PulteGroup's Board approved another $1 billion increase due to the company's share repurchase authorization. We've bought over -- we have bought back over 40% of our shares and clearly remain committed to the systemic return of bonds to our shareholders.\nOne other positive I would highlight is that PulteGroup was once again ranked among the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for. This is our third year on this prestigious list and we again moved higher, climbing from #43 last year to #36 in the most recent ranking. We take pride in being included on this list because it is based on what our employees say about their experience as part of the PulteGroup team.\nOur success in delivering quality homes and delighting our customers starts and ends with our 6,100 employees dedicated to doing the right thing, taking care of our customers, focusing on quality and lifting the teammates around them. The amazing culture resident in PulteGroup doesn't happen by chance, but rather it comes from a committed effort by every employee to create a world-class culture.\nI am extremely proud of our team and I want to thank all of our employees, along with our trade partners and suppliers for their tremendous work in helping to deliver another outstanding quarter of operating and financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVice President-Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions, so that we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of the call. [Operator Instructions] Audra, do you want to get the process started. We're prepared for Q&A."

My name is Devon, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Q4 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you for your patience. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin the conference.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thank you, Devon. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter earnings for the period ended December 31, 2022. The I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today. Please note that consistent with this morning's earnings release, we will be discussing our reported fourth quarter numbers as well as our financial results adjusted to exclude the benefit of certain insurance reserve adjustments and JV income as well as the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition spend and a tax charge recorded in the period.\nA reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance.\nAnd finally, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. We ended 2022 on a high note as we closed almost 8,900 homes and delivered all-time fourth quarter records with homebuilding revenues of $5.1 billion and earnings of $3.85 per share. These results, in turn, helped PulteGroup finish the year with over $1 billion in cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below 10%. Bob will detail the rest of our Q4 results in a few minutes.\nDriven by the company's exceptional fourth quarter performance, PulteGroup delivered another year of great financial results. For 2022, our home sale revenues increased 18% over the prior year to $15.8 billion, our reported pretax earnings increased by 37% to $3.4 billion and our reported earnings increased 48% to $11.01 per share. These results provided us the flexibility to invest $4.5 billion into the business while returning over $1.2 billion to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases. Let me just pause right here and thank our entire organization for their efforts in delivering such a great operating and financial results under some challenging market conditions. We are truly fortunate to have such an outstanding team.\nIn assessing our 2022 financial results, we fully appreciate that gains in volume, pricing, gross margin and earnings reflect the stronger demand environment that existed earlier in 2022. As we all know, the Federal Reserve decision high grade 7x in 2022 and its fight against inflation is successfully slowing the economy, including housing. For the full year, national new and existing home sales across the country fell 16% and 18%, respectively, from 2021. Consistent with the trend of these national numbers, our 2022 net new orders were down roughly 27% from 2021. The softer demand we've experienced as a result of consumers priced out of the market by higher prices and higher mortgage rates, along with those individuals who have moved to the sidelines given market uncertainties and risks.\nDespite the higher rate environment dominating the national conversation, we saw buyer demand improve as the fourth quarter progressed and can confirm this strength continued through the month of January. We'll have to see how things progress from here, but I think this improvement attests to the ongoing desire for homeownership that exists in this country. Net sign-ups, both in absolute number and absorption pace, increased as we move through each month of the fourth quarter and through the month of January. While seasonal trends have been distorted over the past few years, monthly sales moving higher as the fourth quarter progressed is atypical.\nIn short, we are encouraged by the recent improvement in our new home sales. Based on feedback from our sales offices, buyers have been responding to the decline in mortgage rates. Consistent with this idea, I would add that rate buy-downs remain among the top incentives for our customers. Along with the decline in mortgage rates, actions we've taken to help improve overall affordability appear to be gaining traction. In alignment with our strategy to find price and turn our assets, we continue to implement programs that enable consumers to buy homes in today's higher rate environment. The cost of these programs, which might include rate buy-downs, lower lot premiums or even price reductions, can be seen in our higher Q4 incentives. In the fourth quarter, incentives increased to 4.3% of sales price. On a sequential basis, this is up from 2.2% on closings in the third quarter of 2022.\nBeyond just adjusting incentives, in many of our active communities, we have already introduced smaller floor plans to help lower future prices and associated costs. The introduction of smaller floor plans is just part of a comprehensive effort to lower overall construction costs to help offset the pressure on sales price. The obvious question now is, will this strengthening of demand continue? Like all of us on this call, I've heard strong arguments on both sides, but the honest answer is that no one really knows. Homebuilders are optimist by nature, and I want to believe that the Fed can orchestrate a soft landing, but the risk of a recession is real. We're currently seeing buyers respond to lower rates and better pricing, but what happens as Fed actions weaken the employment picture is uncertain.\nWith today's volatile market dynamics, one of our frequent conversations with investors is around how Pulte plans to operate its business over the near term, given the long-time lines associated with land development and home construction, we need to set a plan, but be prepared to adjust as market dynamics require. At a high level, I'd like to share how we plan to operate the business for the foreseeable future.\nAt our core, we remain a build-to-order builder, but our system operates best with a steady volume of production. As such, our plan is for a consistent cadence of new starts. This would include starting spec homes on a pace consistent with spec sales. We shared on prior calls that in the current environment, buyers are showing a preference for homes that have near-term delivery dates. As an example, in the fourth quarter, spec sales represented over 60% of our new orders.\nOur recent sales show that we are finding the market clearing price using our strategic pricing tools to set price and incentives. Within today's sales environment, we will be intelligent about the process as we optimize our production machine and turn through our land assets. As always, our primary focus will be to deliver strong relative returns on invested capital through the cycle.\nIn planning for 2023, we have assumed our current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the reality for the next several months. Combining our planned starts, with our 18,000 homes currently in production, we expect to have a production universe that will allow us to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023. We have goals in place to reduce cycle time, and our procurement and construction teams are already realizing success in cutting production days, but a lot of work remains to be done.\nBuyer demand will ultimately determine what the coming year looks like, but this is our operating plan. We see this as a prudent, balanced approach that checks key strategic boxes, namely; we maintain a level of production in our communities, which is critical when negotiating with local trades and suppliers. We keep an appropriate level of specs in production while seeking to control finished inventory, and we continue to turn our assets, generate cash and position the business for the next leg of the housing cycle.\nGiven today's market dynamics, at this time, we will be providing guidance for our first quarter, but not the full year. And sharing our operational approach for 2023, we have hopefully conveyed a thoughtful process and conceptualize the opportunity we see for our business.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results.\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup completed the year by delivering a strong fourth quarter results, the benefits of which can be seen throughout our financial statements. In my analysis of the company's operating and financial performance, I will review our reported numbers as well as our financials adjusted for the specific items Jim noted at the start of this call. PulteGroup's fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 20% over the last year to $5.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 8,848 homes in combination with a 17% increase in average sales price to $571,000. The increase in average sales price in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains in pricing across all buyer groups.\nOur closings for the quarter came in above our Q4 guide as we benefited from higher spec sales that closed in the quarter and a faster-than-anticipated recovery in our Florida operations following the impact of Hurricane Ian. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter was 36% first-time buyers, 39% move-up buyers and 25% active adult. This compares with last year's closings, which were comprised of 33% first-time, 42% move-up and 25% active adult. The increase in first-time closings is consistent with changes in our mix of communities and the greater availability of spec homes in our first-time buyer neighborhoods. Our spec strategy emphasizes production within our Centex brand as almost 60% of spec units are in communities targeting first-time buyers.\nIn the quarter, we recorded net new orders of 3,964 homes, which is a decrease of 41% from the same period last year. The decline in orders for the period reflects the ongoing softness in buyer demand caused by the significant increase in interest rates realized in '22 in combination with higher cancellations experienced in the period. As a percentage of sign-ups, the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was 32% compared with 11% last year. Cancellations as a percentage of backlog at the beginning of the quarter totaled 11% in the fourth quarter this year compared with 4% in the fourth quarter last year.\nI would note that in the 4 years prior to the pandemic, quarterly cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog averaged 10%, so Q4 cancellations in relation to backlog were in line with historic norms.\nIn the fourth quarter, our average community count was 850, which is up 8% from an average of 785 last year. Community count growth reflects new community openings as well as the slower closeout of certain neighborhoods. Based on planned community openings and closings, we expect our average community count in the first quarter of '23 to be flat sequentially or approximately 850 communities. For the remainder of '23, we expect quarterly community count to be up 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter.\nBy buyer group, fourth quarter orders to first-time buyers decreased 28% to 1,574, while move-up demand was lower by 56% to 1,241 homes and active adult declined 36% to 1,149 homes. As this has been widely discussed, housing demand remains under pressure as higher interest rates and years of price appreciation have stretched affordability for buyers.\nWe ended the quarter with a backlog of 12,169 homes with a value of $7.7 billion. This compares to the prior year backlog of 18,003 homes with a value of $9.9 billion. As Ryan discussed, our objective is to keep turning -- to keep inventory turning, which requires that we start an appropriate number of homes. In the fourth quarter, we started approximately 4,000 homes, which is down 50% from the fourth quarter of last year, and, on a sequential basis, down about 40% from the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with a total of 18,103 homes in production, of which 10% were finished. Of our total homes under construction, 43% were spec. This is slightly above our target of having specs comprised approximately 35% of our work in process, but given buyer preference for a quicker close, we are comfortable having a few more homes in production.\nBased on our production pipeline, we currently expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,700 homes in the first quarter of the year. As Ryan indicated, for the full year, we will have the production potential to close approximately 25,000 homes. These production numbers assume a continuation of current construction cycle times.\nGiven the price of homes in backlog, the mix of homes we expect to close and the anticipated level of spec closings in Q1, we expect the average sales price for Q1 closings to be between $565,000 to $575,000. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 12% over the first quarter of '22.\nIn the period, we reported gross margins of 28.8%, which remain near historic highs for the company. This represents an increase of 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period, although down sequentially from the 30.1% gross margin we delivered in the third quarter.\nLooking ahead, we expect to deliver another strong quarter with Q1 gross margins of 27%, which included the benefit of lower lumber costs due to the fall in lumber prices in the back half of '22. Any savings from ongoing renegotiation of labor and material contracts will be realized in future quarters, and we'll have to see how much of this work benefits our '23 versus our '24 closings.\nOur reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $351 million, or 6.9% of home sale revenues, includes a net pretax benefit of $65 million from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $415 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues. In Q4 of last year, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues included a net pretax benefit of $23 million from insurance-related reserve adjustments. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues.\nWith the pullback in overall housing demand, we have worked hard to ensure our overheads are properly aligned with today's tougher operating conditions. As such, we expect SG&A expense in Q1 to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% compared with 10.7% last year. In other words, even with lower closing volumes, we are in a position to realize overhead leverage that is comparable to '22.\nReported fourth quarter pretax income from our financial services operations was $24 million, down from $55 million last year. The decline in pretax income reflects both lower profitability per loan and an overall decrease in loan origination volumes as mortgage capture rate declined by 10 percentage points to 75%.\nIn the fourth quarter, we walked away from 21,000 auctioned lots and an associated $900 million in future land acquisition spend. As a result of these actions, we incurred a pretax charge of $31 million for the write-off of related pre-acquisition costs and deposits. This charge was offset by a pretax gain of $49 million in JV income associated with the sale of commercial property completed in the quarter.\nOur reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $282 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our Q4 taxes included a $12 million charge associated with deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. We expect our tax rate in the first quarter and for the full year in '23 to be 25%. On the bottom line, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $882 million or $3.85 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company's net income was $832 million or $3.63 per share. These results compare with prior year reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share, and adjusted net income of $637 million or $2.51 per share.\nMoving past the income statement, we invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, with almost 65% of this spend for development of existing land assets. For the full year, we invested a total of $4.5 billion in land, including $1.9 billion of acquisition and $2.6 billion of development spend.\nGiven recent decisions to exit certain option land positions, we ended the year with 211,000 lots under control, which is down 8% from last year and down 13% from the recent Q2 peak of 243,000 lots. With the decision to drop option lot deals over the past 2 quarters, owned lots currently represent 52% of lots under control.\nAs we have discussed on prior earnings calls, given the slowdown in overall housing activity, we plan to dramatically lower our land spend in 2023. At this time, we expect our total land investment to be approximately $3.3 billion, with an estimated 65% of these dollars going toward development of owned land positions. Along with investing in the business, we continue to allocate capital back to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares at a cost of $100 million for an average price of $41.81 per share. PulteGroup continues to maintain one of the most active share repurchase programs in the industry, having repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock in 2022, or almost 10% of our shares outstanding, for $1.1 billion at an average cost of $44.48 per share.\nIn 2022, we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. After allocating capital to the business and our shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 18.7%, which is down from 21.3% last year.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. For all the financial success that we realized in 2022, I can tell you it was a hard year to navigate. When the year started out, we had almost unlimited demand, but supply chain disruptions resulted in countless bottlenecks and extended build cycles. As the year progressed and rising interest rates push more and more consumers to the sidelines, we initiated a series of operational changes as we quickly adapted to the more competitive market conditions.\nIf there is a silver lining in today's challenging demand environment, I think we have what can be viewed as favorable supply -- as a favorable supply dynamic. Recent figures from the National Association of Realtors show the inventory of existing homes for sale at 970,000, or only 2.9 months of supply. Existing homes are our industry's biggest source of competition, so such limited supply is certainly advantageous. As we sit here today, I am incrementally more optimistic about the year ahead, but as the expression goes, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I think what we have done -- well, I think that we have done that in terms of how we've set up our business.\nWe head into 2023 with enough units in production to meet demand and with production plans will allow us to continue turning assets. At the same time, we don't have an excess of spec homes in the system that will cause incremental self-inflicted pressures. We are in a strong competitive position within the markets that we serve. We are typically among the biggest builders in our markets, and our ability to serve all price points provides opportunities with land sellers and municipalities.\nAnd finally, we are in exceptional financial position with plenty of liquidity, no debt maturities for 3 years and expectations for another year of strong cash flow. There are opportunities to be seized upon even in challenging market conditions. When the time comes, PulteGroup will have the flexibility to take advantage of those opportunities.\nI will close by again thanking the entire PulteGroup organization for their work this past year to build outstanding homes and to provide an exceptional customer experience. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the time remaining. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up.\nDevon, if you'll open it up for questions, we're all set."

My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you, Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call for our third quarter ended September 30, 2022. Joining me to discuss PulteGroup's third quarter results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance.\nA copy of this morning's earnings release and the webcast slides that accompany this call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post a replay of today's call later today.\nAs always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the comments we make today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying webcast slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. I suspect that throughout this morning's call, we will find ourselves delineating between the favorable demand environment that existed earlier this year which drove PulteGroup's third quarter earnings versus the more challenging market conditions we're encountering today. Stating the obvious, the primary difference between the 2 periods is that mortgage rates have more than doubled since the start of the year to upwards of 7%.\nOur Q3 earnings reflect the benefits of the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first few months of 2022. The favorable demand and pricing dynamics, which existed at the time are reflected in the 15% or $71,000 increase in the average sales price of closed homes that we reported for our third quarter. Further, even with tight labor and a difficult supply chain, we were able to leverage this pricing gain into a 360 basis point expansion of gross margin and an almost 50% increase in earnings to $2.69 per share. Bob will provide more details on our third quarter results in a few minutes, but it is important to acknowledge the success and recognize the efforts of the entire PulteGroup organization in delivering these great results.\nIf our income statement demonstrates prior demand strength, third quarter order and cancellation rates show the more challenging market dynamics we are operating under today.\nAs we move throughout the quarter, you could almost see demand ebb and flow with the movement of interest rates. Softness in July's homebuying demand eased as mortgage rates fell in August. The positive trend in demand was short-lived, however, as interest rates surged higher in September in response to Federal Reserve actions and hawkish commentary from Chairman Powell.\nThe pullback in demand was widespread across geographies and consumer groups as potential home buyers move to the sidelines, some because they can no longer afford a home and others because they were unsure if now it's truly the best time to buy a home. The impact of consumers dealing with issues of financing or fear also extended to our backlog as cancellation rates increased to 24% in the quarter. While there are a number of factors influencing housing demand, the rise in mortgage rates has likely had the most significant impact on today's consumers.\nBased on their commentary, expectations are that the Federal Reserve will continue to aggressively raise rates to control inflation for at least the remainder of 2022, and then likely hold rates higher for longer. Given these market dynamics, we continue to meaningfully adjust our operating practices as we adapt to today's more challenging market conditions.\nOn the sales side, we are working closely with our divisions on a market-by-market and even community-by-community basis to find pricing or buyers are able and are willing to transact. When demand first begin to slow in response to higher rates, incentives in most of our markets were focused on mortgage rate locks and buy downs. As mortgage rates have moved even higher, incentives have extended to other areas, including more aggressive discounting of standing inventory and price reductions.\nAs we move through the third quarter, absorption paces were choppy but on average, slowed as the quarter progressed. This trend continued into October, although ongoing adjustments to incentives and pricing are gaining some traction with consumers. We've told our divisions to be strategic in their decision-making, but we need to intelligently find the market and turn our inventory. The reality is that we can't be margin proud, but rather, we need to protect our share of sales within the markets.\nHousing this front and center in the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation. As the Fed clearly desires, new home sales rates and selling prices are in the process of adjusting lower in response to higher interest rates. With home sales slowing, we are adjusting how we approach ongoing land investment.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we controlled 130,000 lots under options. Given the more challenging demand conditions we face today, we are re-underwriting our land deals using price, pace and cost assumptions based on current market conditions with a view towards assessing whether expected returns still achieve or exceed our required hurdle rates. As a consequence of these reviews, in the third quarter, we canceled agreements accounting for approximately 19,000 lots or 14% of the lots we held via option at the end of the second quarter.\nIn taking these actions, we walked away from almost $800 million of future land acquisition spend. No one wants to write off $24 million of deposits and pre-acquisition spend, but the flexibility to exit these transactions reaffirms the strategic importance of building more optionality into our land pipeline.\nHomebuyer demand clearly moved lower as the third quarter progressed, but the dramatic and ongoing rise in interest rates likely being the biggest concern for most consumers. However, there are certainly other factors at play, including inflation, fear of recession or increasing concerns about job loss. Given all of these considerations, it is easy to understand why consumers have moved to the sidelines.\nHaving said that, people still desire homeownership and are prepared to buy when they find a compelling offer. Operationally, we are appropriately taking a more defensive posture for at least the near term as we work to navigate today's more turbulent conditions. We believe this approach is appropriate today and appreciate that stability whether talking about mortgage rates, the stock market or inflation, maybe what people will need to move off the sidelines and become homebuyers again.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of our Q3 operating and financial results.\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. There's a lot to review this quarter, so I'll dive right in. Home sale revenues for our third quarter totaled $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 16% over the same period last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven primarily by a 15% increase in our average sales price to $545,000. The year-over-year increase in average sales price of $71,000 was driven by improved pricing across all buyer groups as first time was up 20%, move-up gained 16% and active adult was up 15%.\nUnit closings in the quarter increased by 1% over last year to 7,047 homes. It's worth noting that approximately 200 closings that were slated for the fourth -- the third quarter were delayed due to Hurricane Ian as we shut down or slowed operations across a number of our Florida and Carolina markets ahead of the storm.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed slightly as 36% were first-time buyers, 38% were move-up buyers and 26% were active adult buyers. In the prior year, 31% of homes delivered were first-time, 44% were move-up and 25% were active adult. The shift in mix to more first time is in alignment with our strategy of having approximately 1/3 of our business in the first-time buyer space.\nNet new orders in the third quarter totaled 4,924 homes, which is a decrease of 28% from last year. The year-over-year decline in orders reflect softer demand, resulting primarily from higher interest rates as our absorption pace fell to 2.0 homes per month, down from 3 homes per month for the same period last year. Along with a slower pace of sales, our reported net new orders in the third quarter were impacted by a significant increase in cancellations.\nOur cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%, which compares with 10% in the third quarter of last year and 15% in the second quarter of this year.\nIn the quarter, orders among first-time buyers increased 3% over the prior year as sales benefited from a double-digit increase in community count and the availability of quick move-in homes as the majority of our spec production is in our Centex communities. Orders for move-up buyers were lower by 45% than the prior year, while active adult orders decreased by 31%. Changes in community accounts did not materially impact -- did not materially impact order rates among either of these buyer groups.\nDuring the quarter, we operated from an average of 823 communities, which is up 7% from last year. The increase in community count is consistent with our previous guidance and reflects both new store openings and the slower closeout of existing communities. Average community count for the fourth quarter should increase slightly to 840.\nAt quarter end, our backlog totaled 17,053 homes, which is down 14% from the same period last year. While unit backlog is lower, the dollar value of our backlog increased 3% over the prior year to $10.6 billion due to the rise in our average sales prices. We ended the third quarter with a total of 23,010 homes under construction, which is up 22% over last year. Of the units under construction, 65% were sold and 35% were spec.\nConsistent with comments made on prior earnings calls, we've been working to increase our inventory of spec homes primarily in our Centex communities to better serve first-time buyers. We continued start expects in the third quarter as we have continued to see buyer preference for homes that can close in 30 to 90 days across all buyer groups.\nAt quarter end, we were still well below our commonly used metric of one finished spec per community. However, with 8,000 specs in production, we believe we are well positioned to meet demand and to compete effectively in our markets. Having achieved our targeted level of spec within our production universe, we have now lowered our spec starts and we'll manage our production to maintain the balance of our spec and dirt inventories with an emphasis on build-to-order production for move-up and active adult consumers.\nBased on the homes we have in production and current sales rates, we now expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. The decrease in expected deliveries relative to our prior guide reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on our Florida operations. To the last point, while damaged to faulty communities in Florida and the Carolinas was limited, municipal resources are appropriately being diverted to the repair and restoration of services at the expense of getting power to new homes and communities.\nBased on the mix of homes we expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the average sales price on closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000. At the midpoint of our range, this would be up 15% over last year. Please note that all of the guidance we provide on this call, including ASP, reflects our current best estimate, but cancellation rates and pricing dynamics as we move through the quarter could impact our actual results.\nFor the third quarter, our homebuilding gross margin was 30.1%, which represents an increase of 360 basis points over the third quarter last year. Referring back to Ryan's opening comments, our third quarter gross margins benefited from the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first half of 2022. These conditions supported the double-digit price increases we show in the quarter and allowed us to cover higher material and labor costs, including elevated lumber prices.\nThe strength of demand in that period can also be seen in our sales discounts which were only 1% for homes closed in the third quarter. By contrast, discounts on new orders taken in the quarter increased 180 basis points over last year to 2.5%. It's worth noting that this increase in discounts is in addition to the higher financing incentives we've discussed during our Q2 earnings call.\nFinancing incentives on new orders in the third quarter were 1.9%, which is approximately 80 basis points above last year and our historic average. Given the demand and pricing dynamics we are currently experiencing in the market, in addition to the increase in incentives needed to attract sales, we currently expect our fourth quarter homebuilding gross margin to be approximately 28%. This would represent an increase of 120 basis points over last year, but would be lower sequentially and is down from our previous guide.\nGiven the changing market dynamics, our procurement teams are already having discussions with suppliers and trade partners in an effort to identify opportunities to reduce our land development and house construction costs. However, at this point, any savings we are able to realize would benefit our business in 2023.\nIn the third quarter, our SG&A expense was $350 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. The company remains on track for full year SG&A to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%. Given the pullback in buyer demand and expectations that market dynamics will remain challenging for summer all of 2023, we are taking needed actions to better align overheads with current demand.\nFor the third quarter, higher gross margin and greater overhead leverage helped PulteGroup generate an operating margin of 21%, which represents an increase of 410 basis points over the prior year.\nTurning to Financial Services. Our operations continue to face extremely challenging market conditions. In the third quarter, our reported pretax income totaled $28 million, which is down from $49 million last year. In the quarter, lower loan origination volumes driven in part by a lower capture rate and decreased profitability per loan were the primary drivers of the decline in pretax income. Capture rate for the quarter was 77% compared with 85% last year as our mortgage business seeks to be competitive but not to chase unprofitable business.\nOur tax expense for the third quarter was $183 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.6%. Our taxes in the third quarter include federal energy-efficient home credits which were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted into law in August of this year. In total, PulteGroup's reported net income for the third quarter increased to $628 million or $2.69 per share. The company's prior year net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share.\nIn the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase activity, buying 4.4 million shares or another 2% of our outstanding common shares for $180 million or an average price of $41.20 per share. Through the first 9 months of the year, we have repurchased approximately 9% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of the year for $975 million. Along with buying back stock, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the quarter, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets.\nAs Ryan discussed, in response to changing market conditions, we are re-underwriting every land transaction based on current price, pace and cost dynamics.\nWe ended the third quarter with approximately 232,000 lots under control, which is down 11,600 lots from the end of the second quarter of this year due in large part to the deals we elected to terminate. At quarter end, 50% of our total land pipeline was controlled via option and we continue to work toward our long-term goal of getting to 65% to 70%.\nWhile we have terminated a number of transactions, there are land positions that we have under control that we still project to achieve or exceed our required rates of return. As a result, we currently expect to close on such transactions and expect our result in full year land investment to be approximately $4.8 billion, which is in line with our prior guide.\nGiven the change in buyer demand and the resulting impact on the turning of our own land inventory, we currently expect that our land spend will drop materially next year. While we are still in the planning process, our preliminary estimate is that land acquisition and development spend in 2023 will drop by $1.5 billion to approximately $3.3 billion. Of this spend, we expect that upwards of 2/3 will be for the development of existing land assets. We will provide more details on next year's planned land acquisition and development spend during our Q4 earnings call.\nWe ended the quarter with $291 million in cash and had $319 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. Our drawings under the revolving credit facility were driven primarily by our land acquisition and development spend, an increase in our house inventories as we move homes through production and the delay in closings related to Hurricane Ian. Our debt-to-capital ratio at quarter end was 22.5%.\nWrapping up the higher interest rates being orchestrated by the Federal Reserve are achieving the Fed's objective in terms of slowing demand and negatively impacting price appreciation in the market. While conditions have gotten tougher, I am confident in PulteGroup's competitive position and in our ability to successfully work through this phase of the housing cycle. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nLooking at the tables in this morning's press release, you can see that on a year-over-year basis, our net new orders were lower across the country, although we continue to see relative outperformance in Florida, Texas and the Southeast. Generally, we are faring better in markets where buyers can still find affordability.\nIn contrast, conditions in our western markets are clearly more difficult as price appreciation, generally higher selling prices and the spike in mortgage rates have force buyers to pause their buying plans. The softer demand conditions that we experienced in the third quarter continued into October and have likely gotten even more challenging with mortgage rates now pushing 7%.\nRunning a homebuilding company during this part of an economic cycle is complicated, but we are fortunate to have an experienced leadership team that knows how to operate the business. We are taking action to impact the critical areas of the business, including finding price at a community level where we can sell homes. We will do the best we can to protect backlog, but we won't sit on inventory. With the right level of home inventory to meet demand and to compete effectively, we are aligning starts with the ongoing pace of sales and remain committed to our build-to-order model.\nWe remain disciplined in our approach to land acquisition. It's hard to cancel a land deal that you've worked on for months or even years, but if the return is no longer pencil, then we will walk away. We will work intelligently with our suppliers and trade partners to adjust costs given the new market pricing dynamics. And we will continue to evaluate and adjust our overhead spending and changes in current -- to changes in current and expected construction volumes.\nFor all the defensive actions we are implementing, I remain constructive on long-term housing demand. While we expect the coming quarters will be difficult for the industry, long-term dynamics for housing remain positive. If the Federal Reserve just pauses or if the stock market doesn't swing 5% in a single day or if inflation starts to ease, that might go a long way towards giving consumers enough confidence to get back into the market. While we wait for conditions to stabilize, we will be aggressive in managing our day-to-day business to sell homes, efficiently run our operations, intelligently manage land investment and work to deliver high returns.\nI want to recognize our employees for their tremendous work in delivering a great third quarter. I also want to call out our teams impacted by Hurricane Ian. You have done tremendous work taking care of each other and the communities you serve.\nBefore opening the call to questions, I want to provide a quick comment on the second press release we issued this morning. After a 30-plus year career with our company, John Chadwick, PulteGroup Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has announced his plans to retire in 2023. John has had an amazing career with our organization and has been instrumental in its success over the years. I know I speak for our Board and our entire company in wishing John all the best in retirement.\nBrandon Jones, Senior Vice President, Field Operations, has been named to replace John effective January 1, 2023, as Chief Operating Officer. Brandon began his Pulte career 18 years ago as the Director of Operations in Arizona and has held a series of field positions of increasing responsibility, including Division President in several markets and Area President of our Southeast area. Since being named Senior Vice President of Operations in 2021, Brandon has been managing our construction operations throughout the country so I expect a seamless transition into his new role. John will remain with the company through April of next year to assist with the changeover. We are fortunate to have a deep and talented bench within PulteGroup, and I look forward to advancing the great partnership Brandon and I have built over the years.\nNow let me turn the call back to Jim.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And now, Chris, if you will explain once again how to ask questions, we'll get started with Q&A."

My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup, Inc. Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) James Zeumer, you may begin.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today to review our -- PulteGroup conference call to review our second quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2022.\nJoining me to discuss PulteGroup's strong second quarter are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nA copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today.\nI want to highlight that in addition to reviewing our reported Q2 results, we will also be reviewing adjusted results for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted results exclude the impact of a $46 million pretax insurance benefit as well as a tax benefit of $12 million, resulting from a change in valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carryforwards.\nA reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials are included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance.\nAs always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nThank you. And now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of exceptional and in many cases, record-setting financial results. Led by price appreciation and a 430 basis point expansion in gross margin, our second quarter earnings of $2.73 per share increased by 44% and 59%, respectively, over last year's reported and adjusted earnings per share.\nOur strong earnings performance helped to further reduce our debt-to-capital ratio to below 21%, while raising our return on equity for the trailing 12 months to north of 30%.\nWe have talked in the past about wanting to deliver high returns over the housing cycle, and building the financial strength to safely navigate changing market conditions. I'm proud to say that we are accomplishing both.\nI would also note that consistent with our stated plans, we continue to return funds to shareholders, having repurchased an additional 3% of our shares during the quarter. As we approach the 10-year anniversary of reinstating our share repurchase program, I think it's worth noting that we have reduced our share count from roughly 387 million shares at the end of 2012 to the current 233 million shares, a decrease of almost 40%. Bob will detail the rest of the quarterly numbers, so let me spend some time reviewing the demand dynamics we experienced during the quarter.\nBetween national housing data, and Wall Street analyst surveys, I suspect my comments may only serve to reaffirm your understanding of the changing market conditions. It is clear that the 200 basis point increase in interest rates over the past several months finally caught up with consumers. After 2 years of meaningful home price appreciation, the jump in mortgage rates created sticker shock and pushed affordability out of reach for some first-time buyers. At the same time, rising inflation, falling consumer confidence and the drumbeat of a possible recession caused some buyers -- some move-up buyers to hit the pause button.\nAs for our active adult consumers, the drop in the stock market, combined with the overall uncertainty has created some to slow their home search process as they wait for conditions to settle down. While demand has slowed, it is by no means stopped as we continue to work with buyers to sell homes. At the right price where consumers see value, they remain engaged in the home buying process.\nConsumers who are in the market right now are obviously accepting of and making decisions based on current mortgage rates. What we are experiencing with these customers is that given the volatility in mortgage rates, a higher percentage of these buyers are interested in spec homes that can close in the coming 30 to 60 or even 90 days rather than building to order. Given the shorter time to close, buyers are using their own funds or available incentives to lock in a mortgage rate or by the rate down to an acceptable level. In other words, during this period of rate volatility, some buyers are willing to trade the opportunity to personalize the home for greater financial certainty.\nReinforcing this point, I can tell you that the majority of incentives in the second quarter took the form of longer-term rate locks or rate buydowns. Many of today's homebuyers can still afford the price of a new home, but some need a little help on the rate or want the mortgage rate certainty for a home that will close later in the year.\nAfter 18 months of exceptional demand, we entered the second quarter with only 64 finished specs. And while we have successfully increased spec production to our historic range of 25% to 30% of units, we had a limited supply of quick move-in homes available.\nWe have taken actions to improve our inventory position and now have specs that have advanced in the build process and will be available to sell and close in the third and fourth quarters of this year.\nDuring this period of interest rate volatility, our strategy is to start specs consistent with buyer demand. As market conditions evolve, we are prepared to continue starting specs, reemphasize build-to-order homes, or slow starts entirely as demand conditions warrant.\nThe Fed has been clear in articulating their intention to fight inflation through higher rates and we recognize the housing market has been and will continue to be impacted by these actions. While consumers are being understandably cautious, people still desire homeownership, aging millennials still need homes, and there remains a long-term deficit in U.S. housing stock after years of underbuilding.\nLet me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. Following on Ryan's comments, our second quarter financial results demonstrate both the continuation of positive trends as well as some of the newer challenges which are impacting the market.\nIn the second quarter, PulteGroup's home sale revenues totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of 18% over the prior year. Higher homebuilding revenues in the second quarter were driven by a 19% or $83,000 increase in average sales price to $531,000. Given our construction cycle times, the increase in average selling prices primarily reflects strong demand and pricing conditions across all buyer groups in the back half of last year.\nIn the quarter, we closed 7,177 homes, which is down less than 1% from last year and a few units below our guide. While the overall production environment remains generally challenging, the shortfall in deliveries is primarily attributable to a specific supplier issue that impacted our Florida markets.\nMore broadly, I think it's fair to say that the supply chain remains challenging. While we are seeing areas of improvement, I would use the word fragile to describe overall conditions. Between limited inventory in the system and bottlenecks in distribution, any disruption in production or shipping can set back construction by a couple of days or weeks. In fact, during the second quarter, our overall cycle times extended by another 2 weeks.\nThat being said, we are feeling a little more optimistic about supply chain conditions getting better through the back half of the year, allowing us to begin flowing back work days next year.\nThe mix of deliveries in the second quarter continued to align with our started targets with 35% from first-time buyers, 39% from move-up buyers and 26% from active adult buyers. In the second quarter last year, the mix was 30% first-time, 43% move-up and 27% active adult.\nWe reported 6,418 net new orders in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 23% from the second quarter of last year. The decrease in orders reflects both slower sales pace and higher cancellations resulting from the significant increase in mortgage rates over the past several months. The slowdown in sign-ups impacted all buyer groups, although our first-time buyer spared the best with orders up 1% to 2,454 homes. Move-up orders were lower by 37% to 2,172 homes and active adult orders decreased 27% to 1,792 homes.\nOn a relative basis, the stronger orders among first-time buyers reflects current buyer preference for spec homes that can close sooner with less interest rate risk. By design, our spec production has been heavily weighted toward our first-time communities.\nOur reported orders for the quarter also reflects an increase in cancellations as some consumers were impacted by the change in consumer confidence and today's higher rates. On a unit basis, we had 1,152 contracts canceled in the second quarter, up from 665 cancellations last year. This pushed up our cancellation rate for the period to 15% compared with 7% last year. We always want our homebuyers to complete the transaction and enjoy their new Pulte Home, but when cancellations do occur, we have been able to resell the home.\nIn the second quarter, we operated from an average of 791 communities, which is a decrease of 2% from an average of 808 communities last year. After several quarters operating at a year-over-year deficit on communities, Q2 should mark an inflection point as we begin showing growth in our year-over-year community counts. More specifically, in the third and fourth quarters, we expect to operate from an average of 800 and 830 communities, respectively. Both numbers would be up over the comparable prior year period as we begin realizing the impact of increased land investment over the last several years.\nWe ended the quarter with a backlog of 19,176 homes, which is down 4% from last year. While units are down slightly, strong price appreciation over the past year has raised our backlog value by 18% to a record $11.6 billion. At quarter end, we had 23,349 homes under construction, which is an increase of 35% over last year. Consistent with Ryan's earlier comments about buyers seeking to minimize time to close, we have increased spec starts and ended the quarter with 6,789 spec units under production.\nWhile we have been successful in increasing the overall number of homes under construction, longer cycle times mean that 70% of these units are at the start of framing stage. As such, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,000 to 7,400 homes. While we have the homes in production, given changing market conditions and ongoing supply chain issues, we now expect full year deliveries to be in the range of 30,000 to 31,000 homes.\nBased on the anticipated mix of closings, we expect the average closing price of homes in the third quarter and for the full year to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000.\nSupported by the strong price appreciation, we have realized over the past few quarters, PulteGroup generated substantial gains in our homebuilding gross margin, which increased 430 basis points over last year to 30.9%. In addition to higher prices, our Q2 gross margin reflects the flow-through of lower cost lumber purchased in the back half of last year.\nAs we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we've experienced meaningful cost inflation for labor and materials in the current year, led by a significant upswing in lumber cost at the start of this year. Although lumber has decreased again, which will impact our 2023 closings, we've continued to experience incremental house cost inflation as the year has progressed. Based on our most recent internal estimates, we now expect cash costs for the year to be up 10% to 12% over last year.\nDespite the ongoing inflation in materials and labor, including the meaningfully higher lumber costs, we are raising our margin guide for the third quarter and now expect to realize gross margins of approximately 30%. At the present time, we are maintaining our prior guide for fourth quarter gross margins to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%.\nIn the second quarter, SG&A expense totaled $351 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues. In the prior year period, our reported SG&A expense of $272 million or 8.4% of home sale revenues, included a $46 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in that period. Excluding that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense in the second quarter last year was $319 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues.\nBased on the number of homes we expect to close in the third and fourth quarters, we are targeting SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9.1% to 9.3% of homebuilding revenues. At the midpoint, this would be a roughly 40 basis point improvement over last year. For the full year, we still anticipate SG&A expense to be 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues.\nOur financial services operations reported pretax income of $40 million in the second quarter, which is down from $51 million in the same period last year. The decrease in pretax income reflects the extremely competitive market conditions that continue to pressure profitability and capture rate of the business. In the quarter, our capture rate was 78% down from 86% last year as we are unwilling to chase market pricing down to unprofitable levels.\nOur tax expense in the second quarter was $212 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5%. In the second quarter of last year, our reported tax expense of $136 million for an effective tax rate of 21.3%, included a tax benefit of $12 million and the benefit of Federal Energy Efficient Home Credits, which expired as of December 31 last year.\nLooking at the bottom line, PulteGroup's reported net income for the second quarter was $652 million or $2.73 per share. In the prior year, our reported net income was $503 million or $1.90 per share with adjusted net income for the period of $456 million or $1.72 per share.\nIn the second quarter, the company continued its active share repurchase program, buying back 7.1 million shares for $294 million or an average price of $41.44 per share. Through the first 6 months of the year, we have repurchased 17.4 million shares or 7% of our shares outstanding for $794 million.\nThroughout the past 10 years, we have taken a fairly systematic approach to our share repurchases. We plan to maintain a routine presence in the market, but given ongoing stock market volatility, we will incorporate more of an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. Over the near term, we believe this strategy allows us to be more responsive to changing market conditions.\nWe ended the quarter with $732 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 20.8%. We continue to see value and the potential to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns in many of the land assets we put under control over the last couple of years. As such, we invested $470 million in outright land acquisition during the quarter, and invested another $655 million in the development of existing land assets, bringing our total land investment for the second quarter to $1.1 billion.\nWe remain constructive on long-term housing demand, but we appreciate that market conditions are in flux. While we always maintain a disciplined approach to land investment, we are assessing the land positions we have under control to make sure that the underwriting assumptions supporting our investment reflect current market conditions and that the projected returns still achieve our required return thresholds. At this time, we still expect to invest between $4.5 billion and $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the year with more than half of this spend allocated to developing existing land assets.\nGiven today's changing market dynamics, the optionality of our land book becomes an even more important tool for potentially enhancing returns and controlling risks. We ended the second quarter with 243,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through auctions.\nAnd as we highlighted in our last earnings call, we are assessing ways to meaningfully increase our option lot position to a target range of 65% to 70% of our lots under control.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThe more challenging demand conditions that developed in the quarter have continued through the month of July as the significant increase in mortgage rates has impacted consumers throughout the country.\nWhile all consumers are impacted by higher rates, we are seeing differences across our markets. Lower-priced markets in places like Florida, Texas and the Southeast, areas of ongoing high in-migration are holding up better. Higher-priced markets are those which have realized outsized price appreciation in recent years have incurred a more meaningful slowdown in demand. In tech hubs like Austin or in our Western markets in California and Washington, where prices routinely approach or exceed $1 million, sales bases have slowed as buyers struggle with a combination of elevated prices and increased mortgage rates.\nHousing is clearly in the sights of the Federal Reserve and its fight against inflation. As the Fed desires depending upon the community, home price appreciation has slowed, stopped or through the use of incentives is taking a couple of steps back. Through much of the second quarter, incentives were mostly tied to the mortgage, but this is now expanding to include discounts on options and lot premiums. In the end, these are variations on a path toward lower price, which is what the Fed needs to see as it assesses when they have moved rates high enough.\nWhile we are still early in this process, we are starting to see some impact on the cost side. Commodities like lumber, copper and aluminum have rolled over. The fall in lumber prices alone could save us upwards of $10,000 per home beginning in 2023. And while land prices are notoriously slow to adjust, deals are getting canceled and/or renegotiated. We walked away from a handful of deals in the second quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are reassessing all of the land transactions we currently have under control given ongoing changes in housing demand dynamics.\nWe remain constructive on the long-term outlook for housing demand. But right now, higher mortgage rates are having an impact. We have to work harder to sell homes. We have to be more nimble in the market to make sure we have the right product available. We have to be responsive to changes in the competitive landscape. This is how homebuilding typically operates, and I am extremely confident in PulteGroup's ability to compete.\nI would highlight that we operate from a position of strength with an outstanding balance sheet, a strong land pipeline, unmatched product quality and most importantly, experienced and talented people throughout our organization. So let me end by thanking our entire team for their hard work and commitment.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Thank you.\nAnd Chris, if you would open the line, we'll get started with Q&A."

My name is Abby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\nToday's conference is being recorded.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAnd Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Abby. Good morning. Thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss PulteGroup's first quarter earnings for the period ended May 31, 2022. Q1 represents another quarter of strong financial results and has gotten the year off to a great start for us.\nI'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O’Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance.\nA copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today. Please note that as part of this morning's call, we will review our prior year results as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of a $61 million pretax charge associated with the bond tender and a $10 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. A reconciliation of prior year adjusted results and reported financial results is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance.\nI also want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. As Bob will detail shortly, PulteGroup delivered outstanding first quarter financial results with year-over-year growth of 18% home sale revenues and 43% in adjusted earnings per share. The significant increase in our Q1 earnings per share reflects gains in a number of areas, including higher selling prices, expanded gross margins, increased overhead leverage and our active share repurchase program.\nPulteGroup's first quarter financial results are just the most recent in a string of strong quarters that have raised our return on equity to 29.4% for the trailing 12 months. There is a lot for investors to be excited about in terms of the company's operating and financial performance. Taking a step back from the specifics of our Q1 financial results, I think it's fair to say that the supply/demand dynamics of the first quarter were consistent with the trends the industry has been experiencing for the past year or more. In short, demand was strong, available inventory was scarce and the incoming supply is limited.\nLet me take a minute to expand on these thoughts. On the demand side, consumer interest in purchasing a new home remained high throughout the quarter. With few exceptions, demand was strong across all the price points, buyer groups and markets that we serve. The U.S. housing market continues to benefit from favorable demographics, a strong economy, an outstanding job market and a rising wage environment. New home sales are also benefiting from ongoing and significant increases in rental rates for single and multifamily dwellings.\nAccording to John Burns Real Estate Consulting, their numbers indicate that rental prices for single-family homes increased by upwards of 5% in 2021, while multifamily lease rates were up by approximately 13% over the prior year. Forecast point to further increases in 2022. Even with today's higher prices and rising rates, owning a home can still make clear economic sense for many consumers. Not only can homebuyers get a comparable or even lower monthly payment, but that payment is more stable over time.\nGiven this demand strength in the first quarter, we were able to raise prices in effectively all of our communities with sequential price increases in the range of 1% to 5% common across the country. In addition to the fundamental strength in homebuyer demand, home price appreciation is benefiting from a lack of available inventory in both new and resale. Similar to buying a new car these days, people who are shopping for a home understand how competitive the market is.\nThis brings me to the supply side of the equation. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, our teams did an outstanding job advancing our homes through the construction process and even surpassed the high-end of our closing guidance. I want to recognize the efforts of our homebuilding operations to manage through the constraints and the availability of people and materials that are impacting everything from land entitlement and development to home construction.\nDepending on the specific market, the availability of labor and materials has, at best, remained the same, but in certain areas, conditions have gotten a little worse and build cycles have gotten longer. Given these challenging conditions, our production timelines extended by about 1 week in the first quarter and now stand at 145 to 150 days in most of our divisions. With only a couple of days remaining in April, unless dynamics change dramatically in the next couple of weeks, which does not look likely, any improvement in the supply chain would provide a more meaningful benefit to 2023 production.\nBob's comments will include us reaffirming our guide for expected 2022 deliveries of 31,000 homes, and I would highlight that this guidance assumes that the availability of labor and materials does not change for better or worse. With our production cycles remaining extended, we continue to tightly control sales in most of our communities across the country. We appreciate these restrictions can be frustrating for consumers but it is the right strategic decisions given overall conditions. From both the customer experience and a business risk perspective, it doesn't make sense to extend our backlog out a year or more just to record another sign up.\nEven with all of these challenges, I want to highlight that we started almost 9,000 homes in the first quarter, and that we now have approximately 5,200 spec homes in production. The majority of these homes are in the initial start and framing stages, but we would expect these houses to deliver in the back half of 2022. As we've noted on prior calls, our spec production is largely focused in our entry-level communities.\nIn sum, I think it's fair to say that housing demand remains strong. Home prices continue to rise and the supply of new construction homes coming to market is constrained. That being said, the Federal Reserve has been very clear in signaling that interest rates are going higher as they seek to control inflation that has hit 40-year highs. There are a lot of favorable market dynamics that can support ongoing buyer demand in the face of higher rates, but the Fed is intent on slowing down the economy, and this certainly has the potential to impact the housing industry.\nGiven this dynamic, it makes sense for us to take actions to position our business for continued success. For now, this means focusing on our land acquisition practices. Internally, we are committed to increasing our option lot position and have set a goal of having 65% to 70% of our future land pipeline controlled under option. Our disciplined land investment process helped us to place some great land positions under control over the past several years, and we'll be closing on -- that we'll be closing on in 2022.\nGoing forward, we will continue our thoughtful approach to investing in the business and we'll be prepared to make adjustments in response to changing market conditions. We certainly expect that our land teams can continue to identify tremendous land opportunities, but we want to make sure that only the best projects ultimately get approved.\nNow let me turn over to Bob for additional comments on our first quarter. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan highlighted, the year has gotten off to an excellent start as home sale revenues in the first quarter were up 18% over last year to $3.1 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by an 18% increase in average sales price to $508,000, while closings of 6,039 homes were consistent with last year. The higher ASP for the period was driven by double-digit gains in pricing within our first-time move-up and active adult buyer groups. By buyer group, our mix of closings for the first quarter was also consistent with last year as we remain well balanced across the primary buyer groups.\nIn the quarter, 35% of buyers were first-time, 40% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time; 44%, move-up; and 23%, active adult.\nIn the first quarter, we recorded net new orders of 7,971 homes, which is down 19% from last year. Lower orders for the quarter were primarily the 7% decrease in community count, combined with the impact of aggressively controlling sales paces, given ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. As has been the case for the past several quarters, we continue to restrict sales in many communities in order to align sales with current production pace.\nLooking more closely at our order activity. Orders to first-time buyers decreased 13% to 2,710 homes, while orders to move-up buyers were lower by 22% to 3,341 homes. And active adult orders declined 23% to 1,920 homes. The relative outperformance among first-time buyers is due to the availability of the spec production we started in the back half of 2021 that supported some incremental orders.\nBetween delays in municipal approvals and extended land development timelines, it is taking longer for some communities to open for sale. As a result, in addition to being down from the prior year, our first quarter average community count of 777 was slightly below our previous guidance. We expect the modest drag in the community openings that we experienced in the first quarter to continue for the remainder of the year. As such, we now expect that our average community count in the second quarter will be 780 with growth to 800 in the third quarter and 830 in the fourth quarter. Reflective of the strong demand conditions we experienced in the quarter, our cancellation rate remains exceptionally low at 9%.\nIn total, we ended the first quarter with a unit backlog of 19,935 homes, which is an increase of 5% over last year. The dollar value of our backlog increased 31% to $11.5 billion, which reflects the 5% unit growth combined with the significant year-over-year increase in our ASP and backlog.\nAs Ryan noted, our teams are doing a great job moving homes through the production cycle in light of the challenges the industry is facing and the availability of labor and materials. As a result, we ended the first quarter with 21,269 homes under construction, which is an increase of 44% over last year. This production number includes 5,181 spec homes that are currently in the pipeline, which is almost triple our spec units at this time last year. At quarter end, specs were 24% of units under production as we continue to make steady progress toward our goal of 25% to 30%.\nOur overall production pipeline is still early in the construction process as 28% of these homes are at the initial start stage, with 43% of the homes at the framing stage. We ended the quarter with only 64 finished specs, which is consistent with our comments that homes made available for sale sell quickly.\nBased on the universe of homes in production as well as their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 7,200 and 7,600 homes in the second quarter. Again, assuming no significant improvement or erosion in the availability of labor and/or materials, we still expect to deliver 31,000 homes for the year, which would be an increase of 7% over last year.\nOn our prior earnings call, we noted that given supply constraints and limited opportunity to meaningfully increase construction pace, we would rely on price as the bigger lever to maximize return. Looking at the dollar value of our backlog and new orders, you can see that this is what has occurred. Based on the average price in backlog and the mix of homes we expect to deliver, we expect our second quarter closings to have an ASP in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. Inclusive of the $508,000 average sales price realized in Q1 and the first time spec homes we expect to deliver in the back half of the year, we now expect our average sales price for the full year to also be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. As we always highlight, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter.\nGiven the ongoing strong demand conditions, we have been able to increase sales prices sufficiently to offset rising costs and to further expand our gross margin. In the first quarter, homebuilding gross margin was 29%, which is an increase of 350 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is up 220 basis points sequentially. In addition to the strong demand and pricing environment, our Q1 deliveries also benefited from the flow-through of lower cost lumber as prices for wood products rolled over in the back half of last year.\nUntil a recent pullback, lumber prices had moved significantly higher since the beginning of the year, which will impact our closings in the back half of this year. Beyond lumber, we are continuing to see meaningful inflation in most materials and labor costs. As such, even with the recent pullback in lumber, we expect house cost inflation exclusive of land cost to be in the range of 10% to 12% for the full year.\nBased on the strength of recent selling conditions and despite the volatility in the materials and labor market, we now expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.5% to 30% for each of the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Given the timing and impact of lumber and other input costs, we expect to be towards the higher end of this range in Q2, but likely toward the lower end of the range in the third and fourth quarters. As always, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we'll update you on our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year.\nOur SG&A expense in the first quarter was $329 million or 10.7% of home sale revenues, which is in line with our earlier guidance. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense of $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues included a pretax insurance benefit of $10 million. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues.\nGiven expected homebuilding revenues for the coming quarters, we currently expect SG&A expense in the second quarter to be in the range of 9.4% to 9.6%, which would be a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint. For the full year, we now expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues.\nFirst quarter pretax income for our financial services operations was $41 million compared with prior year pretax income of $66 million. Lower pretax income for the current period is reflective of a much more competitive market conditions, which negatively impacted our capture rate and overall profitability per loan. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81%, down from 88% last year.\nOur reported tax expense for the first quarter was $145 million for an effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our effective tax rate in the period was lower than our recent guidance, we recorded benefits related to equity compensation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in each quarter over the balance of the year.\nOur reported net income for the first quarter was $454 million or $1.83 per share. In the comparable prior year period, our reported net income was $304 million or $1.13 per share while adjusted net income was $343 million or $1.28 per share.\nIn the first quarter, the company repurchased 10.3 million common shares or approximately 4% of the shares outstanding at the end of 2021 at an average price of $48.59. Relative to the first quarter of last year, our share count is down by almost 10%. In addition to allocating $500 million to share repurchases in the first quarter, we invested $1.1 billion of land acquisition and development. This keeps us on track to achieve our prior guidance of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of land spend for the full year, with more than 50% of that spend being for development of existing land assets.\nInclusive of our first quarter spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 52% were held under option. Our strong land pipeline provides us with the lots need to grow our business while allowing us to focus future investment on projects that meet our underwriting standards. Even after allocating approximately $1.6 billion to investment in the business and share repurchases, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 21.5%.\nIt's worth mentioning here that as highlighted in this morning's earnings release, Moody's Investors Service recently noted the strength of our operations and overall financial position when they upgraded PulteGroup's senior unsecured ratings from Baa2 -- to Baa2 from Baa3.\nAs Ryan discussed, given the Federal Reserve comments that we were in for a period of rising rates, we are acutely focused on ways to mitigate land-related risk. In recent years, we have established a land pipeline that can support the ongoing growth of our operations, but provides optionality should demand conditions change in the future. Going forward, we will continue to emphasize the use of lot options or comparable structures to control rather than own positions, and we are actively working to increase our percentage of option lots within our land portfolio.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. We realized continued strong buyer demand in the first quarter and buyer interest has remained high through April. That being said, a 200 basis point increase in mortgage rates since the start of the year is likely to have an impact on consumers. Even with the potential for changes in demand, I think the limited supply of available homes means prices can remain high and puts the construction industry in an advantageous position to weather future demand volatility.\nAs we sit here today, the bigger challenge by far isn't getting houses sold, but rather getting them built. That said, it is important that we take actions now to put PulteGroup in the best possible position for continued success.\nBased on recent field visits and walking numerous job sites, I can personally tell you that our teams are doing an amazing job getting our homes constructed. I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts. I have to highlight the work of our corporate and field-based procurement teams, sourcing even the most basic materials can change from week to week, but this group has learned to adapt and find solutions to the most challenging situations.\nBefore opening the call to questions, I would also like to highlight that PulteGroup was, again, ranked among the 100 Best Companies to Work for by Great Place to Work and Fortune magazine. We didn't just rank again this year but jumped up 32 positions to #43 on the list. Being ranked is certainly a nice acknowledgment, but much more important is actually having an amazing and supportive culture that makes PulteGroup a place where people want to be. This is an important competitive advantage when working to attract and retain the most talented individuals.\nNow let me turn the call back to Jim.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAbby, if you'll explain the process, we will get started."

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter earnings for the period ended December 31, 2021. I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance.\nA copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call later.

We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. Also, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance.\nActual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning. It's great to speak with you again and to have this opportunity to review PulteGroup's impressive fourth quarter and full year results. I am extremely proud of what our organization has been able to accomplish. For starters, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for the tremendous effort demonstrated throughout 2021, but particularly in the fourth quarter from sales to procurement and construction, to our financial services team, you clearly showed what a proud and talented group of determined people can achieve.\nIn a minute, Bob will review our fourth quarter results, but I want to highlight a few of our full year numbers to clearly demonstrate just how much success we've realized over the past 12 months. Even with all the challenges, the homebuilding industry faced in 2021, from supply chain disruptions and labor shortages to municipal delays and COVID waves, we grew our closings by 17% to almost 29,000 homes, benefiting from the very favorable demand and pricing conditions, we increased homebuilding revenues by an even greater 27% to $13.5 billion.\nWe were then able to fully capitalize on this top line growth by expanding gross margins by 210 basis points to 26.4% and driving a 43% increase in our reported full year earnings of $7.43 per share.\nOur financial discussions tend to focus on the income statement, but I would also highlight that over the past 12 months, we lowered our debt-to-capital ratio to a historic low of 21.3%, while raising our return on equity to 28%.\nI would also highlight that over the course of 2021, we continued our disciplined allocation of capital in alignment with our stated priorities. This allocation included investing over $4 billion in land acquisition and land development, increasing our dividend pay rate per share in 2021 by 17%, retiring $726 million of bonds and repurchasing $900 million of stock, reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 6%.\nThere is a lot to be excited about with regard to PulteGroup's 2021 operating and financial results. In assessing our performance, we fully appreciate that we benefited from a very favorable supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace.\nOn the demand side, we saw a strong desire for homeownership across all markets and buyer groups. At one end, we have maturing millennials driving extraordinary demand for first-time and first-move of product, while at the other end, we have empty nesters who are downsizing or retiring into their next stage of life.\nThis demand strength drove an increase of 8% in our 2021 net new orders to almost 32,000 homes, including 6,769 orders in the fourth quarter. The reality is that these numbers could have been significantly higher, but COVID and other challenges impacted our availability of lots, labor and materials, which caused us to intentionally slow sales.\nAs part of our response strategy to these resource constraints, we raised prices in 2021 and actively restricted new home sales through lot releases or similar practices.\nWe continue to implement these actions in the fourth quarter as we raised prices in effectively all our communities. At the same time, we continue to restrict sales in more than half of our communities. The strong demand experienced in the fourth quarter has continued into January with no signs that higher interest rates are impacting the desire for new homes.\nAs we look forward to the year ahead, we are well positioned to meet the strong demand. We entered 2022 with twice as many spec homes in the production pipeline compared to last year along with a land pipeline that will allow us to expand our community count throughout this year.\nWe also have all the lots we need for our 2022 deliveries and expect to increase our full year gross margins by upwards of 250 basis points. In other words, we enter 2022 with tremendous momentum. While demand conditions are strong, the supply side of the equation has been extremely challenging, with no clear signs as to when things will get better.\nThe limited supply of new and existing homes allowed prices to increase by double digits last year, but labor shortages and significant disruptions in the supply chain are limiting production and extending build cycles. Our suppliers and partners are working hard to provide needed resources, but key products that are under allocation must be ordered months in advance or are simply not available.\nThe ongoing surge in COVID infection rates is impacting our suppliers and is also making it very hard for trades to field crews consistently and expanding their teams is an even bigger challenge.\nUnfortunately, we expect construction processes to remain difficult through much, if not all, of 2022. In response to these challenges, we continue to implement actions to help ensure we can complete high-quality homes and grow our deliveries until supply chain issues are resolved.\nThese actions include increasing spec starts, ordering earlier, narrowing option packages and even warehousing inventory of critical building products. These efforts are time-consuming and we lose some production efficiencies, but for the foreseeable future, they are required to get homes built. We've said in the past that scale, particularly local scale matters and this is certainly the case today.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?\n\nRobert T. O’Shaughnessy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good morning. As part of my review of our fourth quarter performance, I'll discuss our reported results and where appropriate, review our results adjusted for specific items in the current or prior year quarter.\nAlong with reviewing the company's fourth quarter results, I will also be providing guidance on key performance metrics for both the first quarter and full year 2022.\nLooking at the income statement. Home sale revenues in the fourth quarter increased 38% over last year to $4.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 26% increase in closings to 8,611 homes, along with a 10% increase in average sales price to $490,000. The higher ASP in the quarter reflects double-digit pricing gains from all buyer groups, while closings came in slightly above guidance, thanks to the tremendous effort on the part of our homebuilding and financial services teams.\nConsistent with comments made throughout 2021, favorable supply and demand dynamics for housing supported the strong price appreciation we experienced across all markets and from all buyer groups. The mix of closings in the quarter were a direct alignment with our long-term goals and included 34% from first-time buyers, 42% from move-up buyers and 24% from active adult buyers.\nClosings in the fourth quarter last year included 31% first time, 46% move up and 23% active adult. Net new orders in the quarter totaled 6,769 homes, which is a decrease of 4% from last year. The decrease in orders reflects a decrease in community count as well as the ongoing actions to manage sales to better align the pace of our sales and production that Ryan mentioned.\nOur average community count in the quarter was 785, which is down 7% from the prior year. Buyer demand was strong and order volumes were fairly consistent across all 3 months of the quarter as we didn't experience the typical seasonal drop-off in order volumes as we moved through the quarter. I would note that we continue to experience this strength in demand through January.\nBy buyer group, orders by first-time buyers increased 12% to 2,207 homes, while orders by move-up and active adult buyers both declined 10% to 2,812 homes and 1,750 homes, respectively. The primary drivers of the lower order rates among the move up and active adult buyers was having fewer communities and our decision to restrict sales. We ended the fourth quarter with a large backlog of sold homes, which provides a strong base of production heading into the new year.\nOn a unit basis, our backlog at year-end was 18,003 homes, which is an increase of 19% over last year. Backlog value at year-end was $9.9 billion, which is an increase of 45% over 2020. Even with the well-documented challenges within the supply chain, I can say that thanks to a lot of hard work by our teams, trades and suppliers, we're getting homes into production. As a result, we ended the year with 18,423 homes under construction, which is up almost 50% over last year.\nI'm also pleased to report that we've been able to increase our spec production as 23% of homes under construction are spec. This is up from 17% in the third quarter and it's getting us closer to our target of having between 25% and 30% spec.\nWhile it's great to see homes getting into production, it's important to note that the overwhelming majority of these units are in the early stages of construction. More specifically, 31% of our production pipeline is at the initial start stage with another 44% of the homes only at the framing stage.\nAt the other end of the production pipeline, we have only 411 finished homes. This figure includes both sold and spec units. Given the number of homes under production and equally important, their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 5,600 and 6,000 homes in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn addition to the challenging production environment Ryan discussed, our Q1 delivery guide reflects the impact of limited finished spec inventory and the longer construction cycle times we're experiencing.\nFor the full year 2022, we expect to deliver 31,000 homes. This estimate assumes no meaningful change in the state of the supply chain and in turn, our current cycle times. If the favorable demand conditions allow us to sell in an even higher year-over-year growth rate, we'll have to see if the supply of materials and labor will be equally supportive.\nBased on what occurred in 2021, we want to be confident we can deliver a high-quality and complete home at closing. If the supply of labor and materials does not allow for increased production, we'll continue to emphasize price over pace, restrict sales as needed as we focus on driving the best returns within each community.\nAs we move through 2022, we are well positioned to meet buyer demand, given our expectations for sequential increases in our community count throughout the year. For the coming 4 quarters, we project our average community count to be 790 in Q1, 815 in Q2, 840 in Q3 and 870 in Q4.\nGiven the land investments we've made, we expect this trend to continue and see further community count growth in 2023. As mentioned, strong demand and pricing conditions in 2021 resulted in higher prices across all buyer groups, which has resulted in our average sales price in backlog increasing by 22% compared to last year.\nGiven the price of homes in backlog and the mix of homes we anticipate closing, we expect our average sales price to be between $500,000 and $510,000 in the first quarter. Our average sales price should move higher as we move through the year, and we currently expect our full year average sales price to be approximately $515,000.\nAs always, the ultimate mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Driven by the strong price appreciation achieved throughout our markets, our homebuilding gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 180 basis points over last year and 30 basis points sequentially to 26.8%.\nWith 18,000 homes in backlog, we have good visibility on near-term gross margins, but we also know that input costs are moving higher and that we expect to continue to incur what are now commonly called scramble costs as we work to ensure product and labor availability.\nBased on what we can see today, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 29% in the first quarter and for the full year. This guide takes into consideration our current construction costs as well as the recent run-up in lumber prices. Based on these factors, we anticipate being towards the bottom end of the range in the first quarter, but towards the higher end of the range by the end of the year.\nSpeaking of inflation, we are closely monitoring increases that are impacting the cost of labor and materials. As a result, we currently expect house cost inflation exclusive of land costs of 6% to 8% for 2022. More than ever, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we'll update our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues includes a net pretax benefit of $23 million from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues.\nIn the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense was $280 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues, excluding a $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.\nLooking at 2022 overheads, we currently expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.9%, which would be flat to down slightly from last year. For the full year, we expect SG&A expense to decrease as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% of home sale revenues as we realize incremental overhead leverage on the business.\nIn the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pretax income of $55 million. Prior year reported pretax income of $43 million included a $22 million pretax charge for adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves.\nDuring the fourth quarter, financial services pretax income was driven by increased loan production consistent with the growth in our homebuilding operations, offset by lower profitability per loan resulting from a more competitive market condition.\nMortgage capture rate for the quarter was 85%, which is down slightly from last year's 86%. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $193 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.5%.\nTaxes in the fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $9 million, resulting from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period.\nFor 2022, we expect our tax rate to increase to 25%, driven by changes in certain underlying state tax rates and the fact that legislation to extend the energy tax credits beyond 2021 has not been passed.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share and adjusted net income of $637 million or $2.51 per share. Prior year fourth quarter reported net income was $438 million or $1.62 per share with adjusted net income of $415 million or $1.53 per share.\nPulteGroup's earnings per share continue to benefit from our share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million common shares at a total cost of $283 million or an average price of $50.11 per share. For all of 2021, we repurchased 17.7 million shares, driving a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding at an average cost of $50.80 per share.\nFor the year, we returned $897 million to shareholders through share repurchases, plus an additional $148 million of dividends. This brings the 5-year total of share repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.2 billion.\nHaving reduced our common shares outstanding by more than 1/3 over the past 8 years, returning funds to shareholders has been a significant part of our capital allocation strategy. We fully expect such systematic repurchases to continue in the future. So we're extremely pleased with the Board's action that we announced today, approving a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization.\nAt the end of '21, we had $458 million remaining on the existing programs. Given our improving financial results and cash flows, even after returning over $1 billion to shareholders, investing over $4 billion in our business and paying down $726 million of bonds during the year, we ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash.\nOur debt-to-total capital ratio at year-end was 21.3%, which is a decrease of 820 basis points from last year. 20 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 2.5%.\nAs part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we have routinely talked about maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 30% to 40%.\nAs noted in today's press release, we are updating these numbers to better reflect how our business operates today. Over the past several years, we have driven material and sustained gains in our operating performance and capital efficiency. These, in turn, have dramatically increased the cash flows we expect to generate. Taken in combination, we now believe we can grow our business and fund its operations while maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 20% to 30%. This represents confirmation that the changes we've driven in the business continue to support long-term growth.\nTo further demonstrate this point, in the fourth quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of land acquisition and development. This brings our total land spend for 2021 to $4.2 billion. On paper, this is an increase of almost 50% over 2020 land spend. But I would remind you that we suspended land investment for almost 6 months when the pandemic first hit in 2020, so some of the 2021 spend was simply deferred for the prior year.\nWe currently expect to increase our land investment in 2022 to between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. Given the vast majority of land we acquire is undeveloped, more than half of our spend in 2022 will be from the development of existing land assets. Supported by the higher land spend, we ended 2021 with 228,000 lots under control, of which 109,000 were owned and 119,000 were controlled through options.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we ended 2021 with an incremental 30,000 lots under option and remain focused on advancing our land life strategy going forward. I would note that included within our land position are approximately 1,400 lots that were approved under our strategic relationship with Invitation Homes and that we remain on track with our 5-year plan of building 7,500 homes under this program with first closings expected in 2023.\nNow let me turn the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan R. Marshall\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. For a number of reasons, we remain constructive on the outlook for the housing industry. Earlier, I spoke about the large demographic trends, which are aligned to support buyer demand over the long term. In the near term, most economic indicators point to an ongoing expansion of the U.S. economy, which should keep the job market strong and increase wages even further.\nWe recognize that COVID and its various mutations are obviously a wildcard, but we hope that this latest surge may have already peaked and that conditions will begin to improve going forward.\nThe impacts from COVID that don't appear to be waning are the desire for single-family living and the ability to work from home indefinitely. We are certainly mindful of rising interest rates and the potential risk through affordability and overall demand and are prepared to respond appropriately should conditions change.\nStill, given a strong economy, high unemployment -- high employment and rising wages, this is a market environment in which we can sell homes.\nBefore opening the call to questions, I do want to highlight an initiative that we've launched internally in 2020, but which you may begin hearing more about this year called our Hope to Home program. This is our effort to make available for sale more affordable housing and the possibility of homeownership to individuals who might not otherwise get the chance.\nWe all know the benefits that homeownership can afford people over time, but we also can appreciate that not everyone has the same opportunity to access this path. We are beginning to pilot Hope to Home in a few communities and believe it's a program that could ultimately result in the sale of a couple of hundred homes a year.\nHope to Home is a for-sale program designed to complement, but run independently of our highly successful Build to Honor program through which we donate mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans. Started in 2013, I'm extremely proud to say that Build to Honor will award its 75th mortgage-free home later this year. Now let me close as I begin by thanking our entire organization as well as our suppliers and trade partners. You continue to prove yourselves to be an outstanding group of people focused on serving our customers and supporting each other.\n\nJames P. Zeumer\n\nVP of IR & Corporate Communications, PulteGroup, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) Rob, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A."

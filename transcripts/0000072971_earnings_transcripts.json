[Operator Instructions]. Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nMorning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'm going to use my time slightly differently today on the call and talk very briefly about the quarter, then I will spend more time talking about our growth opportunities. What is different with the lifting of the asset cap, our capital levels and how we see our path to higher returns over time. I will refer to the presentation posted on our website. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start by saying we're very happy with our third quarter results. The momentum we are building across our businesses drove strong financial results, with net income and diluted earnings per share, both up from a year ago and the second quarter. Our results benefited from the investments we have made in prior years and we are now on a path to grow more broadly with the lifting of the asset cap. Revenue increased 5% from a year ago, with growth in both net interest income and strong fee-based revenue.\nI pointed out the investments we've been making in our businesses on prior calls and the early signs of the positive impact on our results and the benefits were cleared this quarter with investment banking fees increasing 25% from a year ago. Loan growth accelerated in the third quarter, increasing from both the second quarter and a year ago. Our credit performance was strong and continued to improve, and we increased our capital return, raising our common stock dividend and doubling our share repurchases from the second quarter.\nI want to spend the rest of my time today addressing the topics I mentioned earlier. First, a refresher on what our management team has accomplished since late 2019. We have talked much about our success in closing 13 regulatory orders and the removal of the asset cap by the Federal Reserve, and I want to reiterate the importance of continuing to build on that work and sustain our new culture.\nBut I want to shift the conversation by reminding everyone that while we are incredibly proud of our success, we have worked in parallel to transform and reposition the company by changing our business mix and how we manage the company, and this has resulted in significantly improved returns and margins.\nWells Fargo, without the regulatory constraints and with the changes we have made, is a significantly more attractive company than what we were several years ago, and we believe this positions us for continued higher growth and returns.\nI'm going to be referring to the slides from our presentation deck, starting with Slide 3. We love the fact that we are a U.S. focused bank that benefits from the strength of our nation's economy and markets. More than 95% of our revenues are from U.S. consumers and U.S.-based companies. Our global presence exists because of the strength we have in this country. And while we have opportunities to grow our wholesale businesses outside the U.S., our primary opportunity and focus is growing all businesses domestically. The U.S. is and will continue to be the most attractive market in financial services and is a U.S.-focused bank, we will continue to benefit from the strength of the U.S.\nScale matters and, as you can see on Slide 4, we have it in all of our businesses. In many of our businesses, such as consumer banking, wealth management, corporate banking and commercial banking, we are top 3. In these businesses, there is generally a gap between the top 2 or 3 and the rest of the market. In other businesses, such as credit card, investment banking and markets, while we're not top 3 yet, we have enough scale to compete with the top 3 and have competitive advantages that we think support the ability to increase our share profitably.\nTurning to Slide 5. We have simplified and refined our business mix by selling or scaling back to many businesses. We sold or exited businesses that generated approximately $5 billion of annual revenue but these businesses were either not poor or did not produce high enough risk-adjusted returns over time, and we have targeted our investments in areas with higher growth and returns. While the asset cap constrained our ability to grow loans, deposits and security financing and inventories, our strategic review uncovered areas across the company where we had room to invest to serve consumers and businesses more broadly and build our fee-based revenues without the need to grow the balance sheet.\nMoving to Slide 6. We have made progress diversifying our revenue mix and growing fee streams and now consistently see the benefits of our refined business mix and strategic investments. Several of the businesses we have invested in are listed on this slide, and revenue from these businesses alone increased almost $5 billion since 2019. More importantly, we can now more aggressively and broadly pursue growth in other areas of the company.\nAs you can see on Slide 7, we have also improved returns by reducing expenses. But at the same time, we've increased our investment in risk and control, infrastructure and our strategic growth initiatives. In total, expenses have declined $3.6 billion since 2019. And just a reminder that I have said that we spent approximately $2.5 billion more on control and regulatory work in 2024 than when I arrived at Wells Fargo. By the end of this year, we expect to have achieved approximately $15 billion of gross expense saves, and this has funded the large increases in spend to make us a better and stronger company and allowed us to reduce overall expenses.\nSavings have come from across our businesses, but let me highlight just a few examples. Our head count has declined from a peak of approximately 276,000 in the second quarter 2020 to approximately 211,000 in the third quarter 2025, down 24% with head count reductions [indiscernible] quarter for 5 years. I want to note that this was not driven by business sales or outsourcing, but in fact, real improvement in our efficiency. We've also significantly reduced how much we spend on professional and outside services as well as nonbranch real estate.\nTurning to Slide 8. We have made progress in proving returns, with a goal to achieve best-in-class returns for each segment over time. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our ROTCE was 8% and we wanted to put a stake in the ground by setting what we thought was an achievable higher return goal of 15%. We said that this was not our final aspiration and would relook at it after we achieved it. We've made significant progress and are approaching this goal. And while we are proud of our progress, each of our lines of business still have the opportunity to improve further. All should eventually have returns comparable to our best peers, who continually to invest for the long term.\nAnd as you can see on this slide, this is not the case in all lines of business. Our progress will continue to come from both continued efficiencies and the higher revenues driven by our investment in growth. Given our progress and the lifting of the asset cap, we believe now is the time to update our return goal and describe our aspirations.\nFirst, our aspirations. To be the top U.S. consumer and small business bank and wealth manager providing industry-leading deposit, loan, investment and payments products. Also to be the top U.S. bank to businesses of all sizes with the goal of being the top 5 U.S. investment bank. We expect all of our businesses to eventually generate returns and growth equal to our best competitors, while continuing to invest for the longer term.\nWe have the scale necessary in all of these businesses today. We have a strong and disciplined management team that has proven they can execute on our priorities. And with the regulatory constraints lifted, we have more degrees of freedom to grow and achieve our goals.\nLet me now talk about what has changed since the asset cap was lifted on Slide 9. I have consistently said that the lifting of the asset cap would not be a light switch moment where we would immediately expand the balance sheet significantly and change our risk tolerances. Instead, I've said that it would remove the constraints that we have had to grow our balance sheet-intensive businesses and allow us to compete more effectively, as I just outlined. Having said that, we are now beginning to use this increased capacity and have started to grow our balance sheet.\nOur total assets at the end of the third quarter were over $2 trillion for the first time in the company's history. We have grown our trading-related assets in the Corporate and Investment Banking, which are up 15% since the end of 2023. This is a client-focused flow-based business where we serve corporate and institutional investors, most of which have broader relationships with us. We expect this growth to continue as we continue to onboard new clients and accommodate customer trading flows and financing activity without significantly increasing our risk profile. We have not actively grown consumer deposits and we both limited at a times reduced commercial and corporate deposits due to the asset cap.\nWithin consumer and small business banking, we are now focused on reaccelerating checking account growth through enhanced marketing and expansion of digital account openings. Average deposit balances have now grown year-over-year for 3 consecutive quarters. We are also investing in our branch network and remain on track to have over half of our branches refurbished by the end of this year. Total consumer check account openings and branch-based credit card openings grew during the first 9 months of 2025 compared to a year ago.\nWe have highlighted in the past the biggest opportunity in our consuming lending business as credit cards. We've been making enhancements to our product offerings over the past several years, which has started to increase the size of our credit card portfolio and new accounts grew 9% during the first 9 months of 2025 compared to a year ago. We are focused on better penetrating the consumer and wealth management client base and are seeing progress.\nJust as a reminder, growing credit card portfolios are a drag on earnings and returns until approximately the third year before starting to add to earnings. Over the life of the portfolio, they have strong returns as long as spend, balances and credit results are in line with expectations, and this is consistent with what we are seeing. So we are confident that this will become more accretive to our results.\nWithin Commercial Banking, with the asset cap lifted, we are now focused on growing deposits through our Global Payments and liquidity business through targeted calling efforts, and improved product and digital capabilities. More broadly, we've targeted 19 high-density markets for growth where we have less market share than other parts of the country.\nWhile our hiring is not complete, we have hired 160 coverage bankers over the last 2 years and are beginning to see increased production from this new group. We have also been investing to grow our corporate and investment bank. We're using our competitive advantages, including decades long, deep relationships with large corporates and middle market companies, a complete product set, significant existing credit exposure, strong risk discipline, and the capacity and resilience to support our clients and invest through cycles.\nWe have driven growth through investments and talent. Since 2019, we have hired over 125 managing directors across corporate and investment banking. These investments have translated into real growth. In Investment Banking, we have gained over 120 basis points of share in the U.S. since 2022, the most of any investment bank. In M&A, we are winning increasingly bigger and more complex assignments.\nWe recently advised Union Pacific's $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, the largest announced deal of 2025 so far. When you look more broadly at the industrial sector, of the top M&A transactions that have either been announced or closed in 2025, Wells Fargo has advised on half of them to help drive growth in our Wealth and Investment Management business, we launched Wells Fargo Premier, helping us to better serve our affluent clients. We are starting to see benefits with net investment flows into premier up 47% during the first 9 months of this year.\nThe opportunities remain significant. We estimate that our existing bank customers have trillions and assets at other financial institutions and we are not fully meeting the lending, deposit and payment needs of our existing wealth clients. And in our wealth advisory channels, we've been investing to improve the adviser and client experience, including making improvements to our independent platform, which has helped to increase adviser retention and the quality of the financial advisers we've been able to recruit. Adviser attrition has declined every quarter this year.\nAnd you can see on Slide 10 that we are now targeting a 17% to 18% ROTCE over the medium term, and managing to a 10% to 10.5% CET1 ratio. We believe our ability to grow the balance sheet after years of the asset cap constraint, the opportunities I've discussed to grow in each of our businesses and our excess capital position should be catalysts for continued improved returns over time.\nOur new ROTCE target is obviously dependent on a variety of factors, including interest rates, the broader macroeconomic environment and the regulatory environment. This is not our final goal but another stop along the way to achieve best-in-class returns by businesses and ultimately, our returns should be higher than this target. Our confidence in reaching this range is driven by several factors, including our commercial businesses are already achieving industry-leading returns, but will be more sizable as we continue to benefit from our growth investments.\nOur consumer businesses are currently generating returns below the industry. We've made good progress on transforming and simplifying our home lending business and the remaining actions should generate a higher return business than we see today.\nI spoke earlier of the negative impact on our financial results of growing our card business in the early years of investment. But as these vintages mature, we expect our card business to drive increased returns. In addition, as we now seek to grow consumer, small and business banking, we increased returns in this business should also contribute to higher returns. Many of these opportunities to drive higher returns through our business are distinctive to Wells Fargo, given the constraints [Audio Gap]\nTurning to Slide 15. Net interest income increased $242 million or 2% from the second quarter, driven by one additional day in the quarter, higher loan and investment securities balances and fixed rate asset repricing which was driven by the turnover of debt securities, residential mortgage loans and auto loans. While we grew net interest income, the net interest margin declined 7 basis points from the second quarter driven by growth in lower-yielding trading assets as we deployed more balance sheet after the lifting of the asset cap to support our strategy of growing our markets business. Excluding the impact of the markets business on our net interest margin, would have been flat from the second quarter. Given the growth in our business, we plan to start breaking out markets net interest income next year. I will update you on our expectations for full year net interest income later in the call.\nMoving to Slide 16. Both average and period-end loans grew from the second quarter and from a year ago, and we had the strongest linked quarter growth in period-end loan balances in over 3 years. Average loans increased $18.4 billion from a year ago, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans in our corporate investment banking business. Securities-based lending and wealth and investment management, credit card and auto loans also grew while residential mortgage loans declined.\nTotal average consumer loans grew from the second quarter after declining for 10 consecutive quarters as growth in auto and credit card loans more than offset continued declines in residential mortgage loans, driven by our strategy to primarily focus on our existing customers. Average deposits declined $1.8 billion from a year ago as we reduced higher cost of corporate treasury deposits by $37.5 billion, which more than offset deposit growth in our businesses. The growth in average deposits from the second quarter reflected an increase in corporate treasury deposits as well as growth in Wealth and Investment Management and Corporate and Investment banking.\nTurning to Slide 17. Noninterest income increased $810 million or 9% from a year ago. Our results a year ago, including losses from the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. We had strong growth in the areas where we have focused our investments, including Wealth and Investment Management and investment banking. You can also see the momentum we are building in driving higher fee-based revenue when you look at our results versus the second quarter.\nNoninterest income increased 4% as growth across all business-related fee categories more than offset a decline in other noninterest income from the second quarter, which included a gain associated with our acquisition of the remaining interest in our Merchant Services joint venture.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 18. Noninterest expense increased $779 million or 6% from a year ago. Let me highlight the 3 primary drivers. First, as I highlighted earlier, we had $296 million of severance expense in the third quarter. Second, we had $220 million of higher revenue-related compensation expense, predominantly in the Wealth and Investment Management business driven by strong market performance. Finally, we had higher technology and advertising expenses driven by the investments we're making in our businesses to help drive growth.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 19. Credit performance remained strong and continued to improve. Our net loan charge-off ratio declined 9 basis points from a year ago and 4 basis points from the second quarter. Commercial net loan charge-offs were stable from the second quarter with lower losses in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, largely offset by higher commercial real estate losses. Office valuations continue to stabilize, and although we expect additional losses, which could be lumpy, they should be well within our expectations.\nConsumers continue to be resilient as income growth has generally kept pace with increase in inflation and debt levels. Consumer net loan charge-offs declined $58 million from the second quarter to 73 basis points of average loans with improvements across all of our consumer portfolios with the acceptance of auto. Nonperforming assets declined 2% from the second quarter, driven by lower commercial real estate nonaccrual loans.\nMoving to Slide 20. Our allowance for credit losses for loans declined $257 million from the second quarter, driven by a lower allowance reflecting improved credit performance and lower commercial real estate loans, partially offset by higher commercial and industrial, auto and credit card loan balances. Our allowance coverage for our corporate investment banking, commercial real estate office portfolio declined from 11.1% in the second quarter to 10.8% in the third quarter.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 21. We maintained our strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 11%, well above our new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 8.5%, which became effective in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the third quarter. Given that we are now managing to a CET1 ratio of approximately 10% to 10.5%, we continue to have capacity to repurchase shares, and we currently expect fourth quarter repurchases to be roughly in line with the third quarter. During the first 9 months of this year alone, we have reduced average common shares outstanding by 4% and they've declined 24% since 2019.\nMoving to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on Slide 22. Consumer, Small and Business Banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit costs and higher deposit and loan balances. Results also reflected the transfer of approximately $8 billion of loans and approximately $6 billion of deposits related to certain business customers previously included in the Commercial Banking operating segment. Home Lending revenue increased 3% from a year ago due to higher mortgage banking fees. We continue to reduce head count in this business, which has declined over 50% since the end of 2022 as we have simplified the business and reduced the amount of third-party mortgage loan service for others by 36% over the same period.\nCredit card revenue grew 13% from a year ago and included higher loan balances and card fees. While we had strong new account growth, adding over 900,000 accounts in the third quarter, up 49% from a year ago, benefiting from the strong digital engagement and better production in the branches. Auto revenue declined 6% from a year ago due to loan spread compression from previous credit taking actions, but increased 6% from the second quarter, driven by higher loan balances.\nAuto originations more than doubled from a year ago and loan balances have grown for 2 consecutive quarters, reflecting the benefit from being the preferred financing provider for Volkswagen [indiscernible] vehicles that began in the second quarter as well as growth in the rest of the portfolio. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 23. Revenue was down 9% from a year ago as lower net interest income due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit loan balances was partially offset by growth in noninterest income driven by higher revenue from tax credit investments and equity investments. Average loan balances in the third quarter declined $7.1 billion or 3% from the second quarter, reflecting the transfer of the business customer accounts to consumer small and business banking.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 24. Banking revenue grew 1% from a year ago, driven by higher investment banking revenue with strong performance across leveraged finance, equity capital markets and M&A. Our results benefited from the favorable market as well as the investments we've been making to help increase our market share. Commercial real estate revenue was down 13% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances, the impact of lower interest rates as well as reduced mortgage banking servicing income resulting from the sale of our non-agency third-party servicing business in the first quarter.\nMarkets revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth across most asset classes. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 4% from the second quarter. Growth reflected higher balances in markets and banking driven by new originations as utilization rates were relatively stable.\nOn Slide 25, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset-based fees from increased market valuations as well as higher net interest income due to lower deposit pricing and growth in deposit loan balances. Underlying business drivers showed solid momentum from the second quarter in adviser recruiting, net asset flows, loan and deposit balances and total client assets. As a reminder, the majority of [indiscernible] advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results will reflect the higher October 1 market valuations.\nSlide 26 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased year-over-year, largely reflecting losses we had a year ago from the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio.\nTurning to our 2025 outlook on Slide 27. Starting with net interest income, we still expect net interest income for full year 2025 to be roughly in line with full year 2024 net interest income of $47.7 million. Fourth quarter net interest income is expected to grow from the third quarter to approximately $12.4 billion to $12.5 billion. The drivers of the expected growth in the fourth quarter include continued loan growth, particularly in our commercial credit card and auto portfolios as well as the benefit of the growth we had in the third quarter, continued repricing of fixed rate assets at higher rates, including the investment securities portfolio and higher markets net interest income.\nTurning to expenses. At the beginning of this year, we expected our full year 2025 noninterest expense to be approximately $54.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2025 noninterest expense to be approximately $54.6 billion and fourth quarter to be approximately $13.5 million.\nThere are 2 primary drivers for the increase in our full year expectation. First, approximately $200 million of higher severance expense than we expected at the beginning of the year, we had assumed approximately $100 million in severance expense in the 2025 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And as we highlighted, we had $296 million in the third quarter. As we finish our budget for 2026 and plan for our efficiency initiatives next year, we could have additional severance expense in the fourth quarter that is not included in our outlook.\nSecond, approximately $200 million of higher revenue-related compensation expense, predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management due to strong market performance in the second half of the year. As a reminder, this is a good thing as higher expenses were more than offset by higher noninterest income.\nIn summary, our improved financial performance in the third quarter reflected the consistent progress we've been making on our strategic priorities. Compared with a year ago, we had strong growth in net income and diluted earnings per share increased revenue by 5%, including growth in net interest income and fee-based revenue across both our consumer and commercial businesses, continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, improved credit performance and reduced common shares outstanding by 6% and increased our dividend. These efforts helped improve our return on tangible common equity to 15.2% in the third quarter. And as Charlie highlighted, we believe we have an achievable path to a return on tangible common equity of 17% to 18% in the medium term.\nWe'll now take your questions.",

Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplements, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second-quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second-quarter highlights. Our second-quarter results reflect the progress we're making to consistently produce stronger financial results with net income, diluted earnings per share, and our return on tangible common equity all up from both the first quarter and a year ago. We continue to invest in our businesses, which has driven higher fee-based income. This growth was diversified, with each of our business segments increasing during the first half of the year. While we've been investing, we've also continued to take a disciplined approach to expenses, and we have now reduced headcount for 20 consecutive quarters, resulting in a 23% decline from five years ago.\nWe maintained our strong credit discipline, and credit performance continued to improve in the second quarter, with lower net loan charge-offs from both a year ago and the first quarter. Losses in both our consumer and commercial portfolios improved from a year ago. The big news during the quarter was having the asset cap removed. The lifting of the asset cap marks a pivotal milestone in our transformation, along with the termination of 13 orders since 2019, including seven this year alone. We are a far stronger company today because of the work we've done. In addition, we've also changed and simplified our business mix, transformed the management team and how we run the company, and have been methodically investing in the company's future while improving our financial results and profile.\nI know this call is for investors, but I want to once again thank the over 212,000 employees at Wells Fargo who all contributed in one way or another to this milestone. Though we have tremendous opportunities, this has been a demanding place to work. We have recognized the contributions of many here by increasing compensation, improving benefits, investing in more employee learning and development programs, and by giving those employees making below $85,000 in total compensation special year-end cash awards for the past two years. With the lifting of the asset cap, we wanted to do something special for everyone who invested so much of themselves into the company in recent years. As a demonstration of our appreciation for what we've accomplished, we gave a special award to all employees so they could own part of Wells Fargo and hopefully benefit from our future success.\nSo everyone has been asking, what does the lifting of the asset cap mean? First, we will continue to move forward with our risk and control agenda and embed the disciplines we have built deep into the culture of the company. But we are certainly in a different position with the asset cap and the many orders lifted. It is hard to convey the amount of time and effort the senior team has devoted to this work. With so much of this work completed, we can allocate our time differently and spend more time focusing on growth and the future. While we have not ignored this, the additional time we now have should prove meaningful.\nAs you know, though we have generated substantial amounts of capital in the years since the asset cap was imposed, we've been limited in how much we've been able to deploy to support our customers and communities. While shareholders benefited from increased stock buybacks, we would have preferred to allocate more capital to grow our businesses and the overall balance sheet. We now have the flexibility to proactively grow deposits and to allocate capital to grow loans and our corporate investment bank. Since I arrived, we've had to make difficult choices where to allocate our balance sheet given our inability to increase total assets. As we pointed out, we have turned away deposits from corporate clients. While we have not turned away consumer deposits, we've been careful not to aggressively grow consumer deposits given the limitations we were subject to.\nWe've also had to be cautious about loan commitments, especially given the potential for significant drawdowns of committed facilities as we saw during the early days of COVID. We have also pointed out that we have constrained our markets-related balance sheet to allow for activity elsewhere in the company. As we look forward, we are now able to move forward more aggressively to serve consumers, businesses, and communities to support US economic growth. We expect to be more aggressive in our pursuit of consumer and corporate deposits, and we will selectively look to grow loans, though we will be cautious during periods of economic uncertainty. We also see opportunities to allocate more balance sheet to our markets business to drive increased profitability. Our goal is to increase customer trading flow and financing activity without significantly increasing our risk profile.\nWe also have the opportunity to think more broadly about using our balance sheet as we evaluate additional opportunities. In addition to the lifting of the asset cap, we expect that changes in both the regulatory and supervisory environment will allow us to compete more effectively. We announced earlier this month that our expected stress capital buffer will decrease by 120 basis points starting in the fourth quarter, which would reduce our required CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers back to 8.5%. We are also encouraged by the Federal Reserve's intention to provide more detail supporting the CCAR process. That detail, along with the finalization of the broader set of capital rules, will help us determine the appropriate level of capital we should hold going forward.\nWe are also very supportive of the review the different regulatory agencies are conducting regarding rules and supervisory constraints that go beyond safety and soundness and do not allow us to effectively serve our customers and communities. We are committed to continuing to maintain a strong capital position and are excited about using our excess capital and additional capital generation to reinvest in our franchise as well as continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. As a reminder, we have returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the past five years, including reducing our average common shares outstanding by 23% since 2019. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third-quarter common stock dividend by 12.5% to $0.45 per share, subject to approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month.\nWe've repurchased over six billion of common stock during the first half of this year, and during the second quarter, our board of directors authorized an additional common stock repurchase program of up to $40 billion. We continue to make significant investments in our core business, which are helping to improve our returns. We continue to invest in our credit card business not only by launching new products but also enhancing the overall customer experience. Our commitment to delivering a seamless, secure, and user-friendly digital experience to our card members was recently recognized by J.D. Power, which ranked Wells Fargo number two in both mobile app and online credit card satisfaction. Enhancements like these have spurred new account growth and higher balances in spending from a year ago.\nIn our auto business, we completed the launch of our multi-year co-branded agreement as a preferred purchase financing provider for Volkswagen and Audi vehicles in the US. We had strong auto originations in the second quarter, and ending balances in our auto portfolio grew for the first time in over three years. In Consumer Small and Business Banking, we have continued to see momentum in the growth of primary checking accounts, benefiting from our investments in marketing, offers, and enhancements to both the digital and branch experience. We are on track to have over half of our branch network refurbished by the end of this year and to complete a refresh of the entire network by the end of 2028. We continue to optimize and better position our network, including expanding in certain locations, including Chicago, New York City, and Nashville.\nWe continue to enhance our digital experience, and consumer checking accounts open digitally continue to increase, and active mobile users now exceed 32 million, up 4% from a year ago. We also continue to see good momentum from Wells Fargo Premier, our offering for affluent clients. Let me highlight a few areas that demonstrate our growth. We are investing in more bankers to serve these clients and have increased branch-based financial advisors by over 10% from a year ago. The improved collaboration between our bankers and advisors has helped to drive over $16 billion of net asset flows into the Wealth and Investment Management Premier channel during the first half of the year, up over 60% from a year ago. Deposit and investment balances from Premier clients have also been steadily increasing and were up approximately 10% from a year ago.\nTurning to our commercial businesses, the investments we have been making in corporate and investment banking have continued to help drive growth, with investment banking fees up 16% during the first half of the year. We've also made steady progress increasing our US investment banking market share, with our share up each of the last two years and again in the first half of 2025, driven by gains in leveraged finance and M&A. We're continuing to invest in top talent and strengthen and expand our commercial banking business. For example, in our technology banking group, we have grown our team of bankers by over 25% over the past year. We expect to continue to add bankers to this priority sector and in a number of additional markets and sectors where we have room to grow.\nIn addition to driving growth in our core business, our strategy also includes simplifying our businesses and focusing on the products and services that matter most to our clients. As part of the strategic focus in the second quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our rail equipment leasing business. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. As we look ahead, what we see regarding the health of our clients and customers has not changed. Consumers and businesses remain strong as unemployment remains low and inflation remains in check. Credit card spending growth softened very slightly in the second quarter but is still up year-over-year and remains strong overall. Debit card spending growth has remained strong and consistent with what we saw in prior quarters.\nConsumer delinquencies continued to improve from a year ago, and commercial credit performance continued to be relatively strong. Deposit flows for both our consumer and commercial clients were in line with seasonal trends. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of our commercial banking clients this past quarter, and many have conveyed optimism that the administration is working to level the trade playing field. They would like certainty but prioritize a good outcome for US trade above short-term certainty. Many have found ways to avoid passing the 10% tariffs onto their customers. At the same time, they are preparing for the downside and are not growing inventories or hiring aggressively, and developing a contingency plan if the downside scenario occurs. As I've said before, we are hopeful that the results of the current negotiations will make our clients more competitive and help drive stronger economic growth in the US.\nBut there is uncertainty, and we should recognize there is risk to the downside as the markets seem to have priced in successful outcomes. As I highlighted, now that the asset cap has been lifted, we are more committed than ever to serving our customers, supporting businesses and communities, and contributing to economic growth in the US. I continue to believe we have one of the most enviable financial services franchises in the world. I'm excited to continue to move forward with plans to produce industry-leading sustainable growth and returns. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, we had net income of $5.5 billion, or 1.60 per diluted common share, up from both Q1 and a year ago. These improved results reflect our continued focus on our strategic priorities.\nThrough our ongoing investments in our businesses, expense-focused, strong credit discipline, and continued capital return, we have steadily increased profitability and returns. Our second quarter results included $253 million, or 0.06 per share, from the gain associated with our acquisition of the remaining interest in our merchant services joint venture. Turning to slide four, net interest income increased $213 million, or 2%, from the first quarter, driven by lower deposit costs, one additional day in the second quarter, and higher securities yield and higher loan balances. I'll update you on our expectations for full-year net interest income later in the call. Moving to slide five, both average and period-end loans grew from the first quarter.\nPeriod-end balances were up $10.6 billion from a year ago, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans, predominantly in the corporate investment banking business, as well as slightly higher auto, other consumer, and credit card loans, while residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans continued to decline. Average deposits in our businesses increased 4% from a year ago. We reduced higher-cost corporate treasury deposits by 58% from last year, causing total average deposits to decline 1%. Total average deposits also declined 1% from the first quarter, as a small increase in consumer deposits was more than offset by lower commercial and corporate treasury deposits. Average deposit costs continued to decline and were down six basis points from the first quarter. Turning to slide six, non-interest income increased $348 million, or 4% from a year ago.\nResults in the second quarter benefited from the gain associated with our merchant services joint venture transaction. I would note that the increase in card fees versus the first quarter reflected a change in where we recognize merchant services revenue resulting from this transaction. Revenue is now included in card fees, whereas previously our share of the net earnings in the joint venture were included in other non-interest income. We continued to have growth in many of the businesses where we have been investing, including a 9% increase in investment banking fees from a year ago. The growth in non-interest income more than offset lower net interest income, resulting in modest revenue growth from a year ago. Turning to expenses on slide seven, non-interest expense increased $86 million, or 1%, from a year ago, driven by an increase in revenue-related compensation, predominantly in Wealth & Investment Management.\nOur other expenses were relatively stable, as the investments we were making in our businesses, including the increased spending in technology and advertising, were offset by lower operating losses and the impact of efficiency initiatives. The 4% decline in non-interest expense from the first quarter was driven by seasonally higher first-quarter personnel expense. Turning to credit quality on slide eight, credit performance continued to improve and remain strong. Our net loan charge-off ratio declined 13 basis points from a year ago and one basis point from the first quarter. Commercial net loan charge-offs increased $36 million from the first quarter to 18 basis points on average loans. The losses in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio were borrower-specific, with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio. Commercial real estate losses decreased during the first quarter. As we have said, it will take time for the office fundamentals to recover.\nValuations appear to be stabilizing, and although we expect additional losses, they should be well within our expectations. Consumer net loan charge-offs declined $48 million from Q1 to 81 basis points of average loans, with improvement across all of our non-real estate portfolios, while the residential mortgage portfolio continued to have net recoveries. Non-performing assets declined 3% from Q1, driven by lower commercial real estate non-accrual loans, predominantly in the office portfolio. Moving to slide nine, our allowance for credit losses for loans increased modestly from Q1, and our allowance coverage ratio for total loans has been relatively stable for the past five quarters, as credit trends have remained fairly consistent even amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\nOur allowance for credit losses for our Corporate and Investment Banking commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable over the past year and was 11.1% in Q2. Turning to capital and liquidity on slide 10, we maintained our strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 11.1%, well above our current CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.7%. Starting in Q4 of this year, our new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers is expected to decline to 8.5%. As you know, the Federal Reserve has a pending notice of proposed rulemaking that would include averaging stress test results from the previous two years to determine the stress capital buffer. If that is finalized as proposed, the effective date may move to 1 January, and our expected new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers would be 8.6%.\nWe repurchased $3 billion of common stock in the second quarter and have the capacity to continue to repurchase shares. Also, as Charlie highlighted, we expect to increase our common stock dividend to $0.45 per share in the third quarter, subject to board approval. Moving to our operating segment, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11, Consumer Small and Business Banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit costs and higher deposit balances. For the second consecutive quarter, deposit balances grew from a year ago, even with higher outflows for tax payments in the second quarter of this year compared with last year. Debit card spending remained strong, up 4% from a year ago, consistent with the prior two quarters. Home Lending revenue was stable from a year ago.\nMortgage loan originations increased 40% from a year ago as we focused on servicing Wells Fargo customers. This higher volume also reflected a stronger mortgage market from a year ago. However, the mortgage market continued to be weak compared with historical levels due to the high-rate environment. We continue to reduce headcount, which has declined 49% since the end of 2022, as we have simplified the business and reduced the amount of third-party mortgage loans serviced for others by 33% since the end of 2022. Credit card revenue grew 9% from a year ago as loan balances increased and spending slowed slightly but remained strong. Auto revenue decreased 15% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression from previous credit tightening actions. While these actions have reduced revenue, they have improved credit performance.\nAuto revenue increased 2% from Q1, the first linked quarter increase since Q4 2021. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances. Turning to commercial banking results on slide 12, revenue was down 6% from a year ago as lower net interest income due to the impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by growth in non-interest income driven by higher revenue from tax credit investments and an increase in treasury management fees. Average loan balances in Q2 increased 1% from both a year ago and Q1, as clients have largely remained cautious while waiting for more clarity on the economic environment. Turning to corporate investment banking on slide 13, banking revenue was down 7% from a year ago, driven by the impact of lower interest rates.\nThis decline was partially offset by lower deposit pricing and higher investment banking revenue, including higher advisory fees. Commercial real estate revenue declined 6% from a year ago due to lower loan balances, the impact of lower interest rates, as well as reduced mortgage banking income after the sale of our commercial non-agency third-party servicing business in Q1. Markets revenue declined 1% from a year ago as higher revenue in foreign exchange and rates products was offset by declines in equities. We had a $122 million gain related to an exchange of shares for Visa Class B common stock that benefited equities a year ago. Average loans grew 4% from a year ago and 3% from Q1. The increase from Q1 was broad-based with higher balances in markets banking and commercial real estate.\nOn slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% from a year ago as growth in asset-based fees, driven by higher market valuations, was partially offset by lower net interest income due to the impact of lower rates. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results will reflect higher 1 July market valuations. Slide 15 highlights corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by the gain associated with our merchant services joint venture transaction. Turning to our 2025 outlook on slide 16, starting with net interest income, we currently expect net interest income for 2025 to be roughly in line with full year 2024 net interest income of $47.7 billion.\nWhile there are several moving pieces of why we currently expect net interest income to be a little lower than we discussed in April, the largest driver is that we have dedicated more balance sheet to our markets business than we originally assumed, including supporting stronger client activity in products like commodities and rates, which can have low or non-earning assets. The cost of funding this activity results in lower net interest income, while most of the revenue generated is recognized in non-interest income. Our updated expectation still assumes net interest income grows sequentially in both Q3 and Q4 of this year. We are only halfway through the year, and several key variables influencing net interest income remain uncertain. We will closely monitor how these assumptions evolve over the remainder of the year.\nTurning to expenses, our expense outlook has not changed, and we still expect 2025 non-interest expense to be approximately $54.2 billion. In summary, our second quarter results reflected the consistent progress we've been making to improve our financial performance. Compared with a year ago, we had double-digit growth in net income and diluted earnings per share. Through revenue, including fee-based growth across many of our businesses, we maintained our expense discipline, improved our credit performance, and reduced common shares outstanding and increased our dividend. Now that the asset cap is lifted, the management team has more time to focus on our growth initiatives, and we will also have the flexibility to allocate more capital to growing our balance sheet, including deposits, loans, and trading assets. We will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now begin the question and answer session.\nIf you would like to ask a question, please first unmute your phone and then press Star 1. Please record your name at the prompt. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press Star 2 to remove yourself from the question queue. Once again, please press Star 1 and record your name if you would like to ask a question at this time. Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from John McDonald of Truist Securities. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning. Mike, thanks for the explanation. On the NII outlook, it's helpful, the markets piece of it.\nJust on the non-markets NII, could you talk about what kind of loan growth assumptions you kind of built into the NII outlook for the back half of the year and how that connects to what you saw in terms of loan growth in Q2?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah, sure, John. Thanks for the question. When you break apart the portfolio, on the consumer side, we're not on the mortgage portfolio. We expect that'll likely just continue to come down just a little bit in the second half. I think you should see a little bit of growth in card, some of that seasonality in terms of what happens as you go into Q3 and Q4 spending.\nAnd then we started to see some growth in auto, small, but started to see that turn, so hopefully that will continue to grow in H2, but relatively modest in the overall balance sheet. On the commercial side, we do expect to see some modest growth as we go into the rest of the year. I think it likely comes from the same places, at least as we come into Q3, mostly in the corporate investment bank. Hopefully, we'll start to see some of the commercial bank customers borrow a little bit more as well. But I'd say overall, still relatively modest. But as you get to the end of the year, hopefully, if things play out, we'll start to see a little bit more activity more broadly.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. And then maybe you could just give us your thoughts in terms of total revenue. I know you don't give total revenue guidance, but just maybe when you look at your own internal projections and budgeting, how is the revenue outlook for this year shaping up? What are the puts and takes relative to your expectations if we think about the year so far?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah, no, it's a, as you sort of break apart the pieces, we talked a bit about where NII is coming out at this point. I think when you look at the fee side, the biggest, you go through the biggest line items, and you look at the investment advisory fees, the market's been very supportive as you look at the rest of the year.\nAnd so you can easily sort of model what the third quarter looks like based on where the market's ended already, given most of the fees are already sort of certain. And so as long as the market sort of holds up or grows a little potentially as you go into the fourth quarter, that should be constructive. You start breaking down deposit fees, card fees, all that stuff plays into some of the seasonal activity that we'll see in the third and fourth quarter. And I'd say largely those things are kind of playing out pretty close to what we modeled, depending on the month or quarter, maybe a little bit better, but they're playing out largely as we expected across most of those. And then it's really sort of the trading line, and that'll be driven by what kind of activity and volatility we see in the market.\nBut I think we've had a pretty constructive environment now for a couple of quarters, so hopefully that continues. And then I think lastly, just we'll see how the year comes out on the equity securities gains that we saw. We did see some modest gains in this quarter, big improvement relative to what we saw last quarter. As the market remains constructive, hopefully that will continue as well.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. And I guess just to clarify, Mike, you used to previously say that your NII guide assumes the asset cap remains in place, and now we relax that assumption. The outlook's a little worse. Is it just this counterintuitive mix shift that you're going to grow the capital markets balance sheet, but it's going to come in fees?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. Well, I'll remind you first, it's been off for what, six weeks now? Five and a half weeks, six weeks?\nAnd so I do think it has been off for a very short amount of time. And I think what's happened as we sort of looked at, and some of this started towards the end of the first quarter, early second quarter, and we sort of talked about it in some other public forums, we've seen some increase in the activity, and that's what's causing it. That's by far the largest driver of what's causing it to move down a little bit from the low end of the range that we talked about in April. And as we said, that's largely offset in fees because you get paid in fees for some of that activity.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. And let me just add a little, hey, John, this is Charlie.\nLet me just add one thing here, which is, as we look forward to the end of the year, we have so far assumed, I would describe it as a very small increase in the overall size of the balance sheet. So we do assume it grows above what used to be the cap, but not in any really meaningful way. When we look at where that growth is coming from, part of it is the loan growth that Mike spoke about earlier, but we have been and assume that we dedicate balance sheet to our markets business. As we think about that, we're not focused on maximizing net interest income. We're focused on maximizing returns, how much money we make overall.\nAnd so we'll try and do as good a job as we can going forward, giving some more clarity on how we intend to use that balance sheet, how it can affect the different pieces. But that is, it's a little bit of what we saw during this past quarter, and it's the way we're thinking about the rest of the year.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nThat's really helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping, Mike, maybe we could approach the NII question maybe, I guess, a little differently. I guess what are—if loan growth in the second half will only be kind of modest, what are the other factors that will allow NII to grow?\nBecause I think you'll still need to average a few percent higher in the second half than you just did in the second quarter. So just trying to understand what the major puts and takes are within there.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah, Scott, it's a little bit of a lot of things, right, that will sort of add up to some growth each quarter. We do expect deposit costs to continue to come down. We do expect to see some loan growth come through. We do expect, which will be a driver, we do expect to see further repricing of the securities portfolio. So it really is a little bit of a lot of things, plus some deposit growth as we go into the end of the year. And so I think all of that sort of adds up to seeing it grow sequentially each quarter.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you for that.\nAnd then, Charlie, maybe just sort of a top-level thing. With the asset cap now off, I guess one of the questions that I get pretty frequently is sort of when or how might be the right time to revisit medium-term return targets. Do you have any broad sense for sort of where you are in thinking about that kind of dynamic?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nSure. I guess a couple of things on that. I think you didn't directly ask the question, but let me just maybe talk for a second about capital levels because capital levels obviously dictate returns to a certain extent. And so with what's happened, we've certainly seen a lot of change over the past quarter or so. Obviously, we've got the ability to rethink how we use balance sheet with the asset cap.\nI do just want to remind people that I have said very consistently over and over and over again, when the asset cap is lifted, it's not like this light switch is going to go off and all of a sudden things are going to dramatically change. We didn't know exactly when the cap was going to be lifted. We didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're very carefully thinking through how we use the additional capacity to help grow the company. We expect that to happen over time. We never wanted to lead people to believe that there'd be any major change in the next week, the next month, or the next quarter, but it certainly does open options for us to grow and increase returns beyond what we've seen in the past.\nSo now that it's off, we're going to be thoughtful about it. As we go through our planning for next year, this is the perfect time. We will do our best to talk more about it and provide more clarity broadly to everyone so we can create a level of understanding there. We have the lower SCB, which it is a huge decrease after a significant increase from the year before, which we commented in the year before we didn't understand why we saw the increase. As we think about how that impacts where we should be running our capital levels, we want to take a little bit of time to let the Fed go through its process, both on CCAR and on the work they're doing on capital requirements, so we can try and get an understanding of what the right long-term level of capital is.\nSo they've said that they're going to provide more transparency on CCAR, whether it's the underlying assumptions, the models, things like that. That'll be extremely helpful for us so that we're not constantly readjusting capital targets on a yearly basis in any material way when, in our view, we haven't materially changed the risk of the company. So that'll be forthcoming, hopefully, over the next couple of months as the work they're doing on capital. So that'll allow us to come back with a more definitive point of view on where we should be running capital. But certainly, all of these things are lower levels from where we had been running it because of the increases that we saw. So that allows us to deploy excess capital either organically or through buybacks. And so we do expect to get there.\nAnd then just more specifically to your question, we've also said very clearly, 15% is not the. It's an interim target. It's not the final target. Once we get there, it's a good time to revisit where we go. So both through hopefully some increased returns that we're seeing in terms of how we run the business, running at some point with lower capital returns, we believe we'll be consistently at that 15%. And then we'll provide more information on where we go from there, which will obviously be a higher number, not a lower number.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right. That's perfect. Thank you both very much.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nAll righty.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Huston of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Huston\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just one more question on capital.\nGiven all you just said, Charlie, and that we still have now a really big amount of capital, the buyback in Q2 was a little smaller than Q1. Loan growth, as you said, looks like it's getting better, but not that quickly. So can we expect that you might do more in terms of the buyback in advance of kind of getting that final zone of where you want to live, given that it seems like you have enough capacity to do kind of all things you would want to do in terms of growing the balance sheet and also returning more?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. Listen, I don't think we want to give a specific forecast on how much we intend to do. But to your point, we have more capacity, not less capacity. The price of the stock does matter.\nAnd so we'll be thinking about that, and I think we'll go from there. But I think how do I describe it? I guess I would say, on the one hand, we don't feel like we need to deploy all of this capital immediately because we do want to have the opportunity to use the balance sheet to grow and do interesting things. But I've also said that we don't intend to do anything dramatic. And so that does create more opportunity to buy stock back. But again, the way we're thinking about it is we want to first use the capital that we have to grow the company organically. That's what allows us to produce the right kind of returns. It allows us to create the ability to increase the dividend. And buying stock back is kind of what we're left with.\nWhat we hope the answer is, and what certainly seems like, is we'll have the ability to do all of those things to a greater extent than we've been able to do in the past. We'll just hopefully be very thoughtful about the timing.\n\nKen Huston\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. On one of, you've laid out all the organic potentials in the past, but the one I wanted to ask you specifically about is on retail deposits, where there's obviously a strong competitive landscape and a lot of banks still building branches in other territories. You've talked about how that consent order coming off last year has helped you kind of just go to market in a broader sense. How will that manifest itself in terms of just retail deposit growth?\nCan you see, do you expect an acceleration there in either net new checking or just overall deposit growth taking on the retail side? Thank you.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nSure. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, I think the answer is, as I said, I think it was just a little bit of, if you go back for a second, is when we had the sales practices consent order, it was specifically driven by some of the things that happened in those businesses. And so we had to be very, very careful about what we did. We scaled back an awful lot of stuff, which stood in the way of our ability to grow.\nAnd then even as that order came off, recognizing we had a deposit cap, well, I'm sorry, an asset cap, which effectively can be a deposit cap, even though we were adding back some of the things that would actually help us grow quicker, we were very careful about not doing too much too quickly because when you have a constraint, you just don't want to bump up against that constraint. So the activities that we've kind of reinstated inside the consumer business have to do with reporting. They have to do with the way we manage the business. They have to do with the way we pay people. And so you're starting to see increased net checking account growth. We're focused on primary checking account growth. That should, and we believe, will lead to higher deposits. That, what you'll see, is you're going to see more marketing.\nYou're going to see more aggressive marketing. You're going to see more merchandising in our branches. You're going to see more local advertising as well as national advertising, as well as just expansion of footprint in areas where we think we have room to grow. And so those are all things that we have been very, very cautious about doing up till now. And with the value proposition that we have for our customers and the strength of the brand and the great quality of the people here, we think we'll be able to compete very effectively. And I remind people, we're not competing with a small number of banks. We're competing with a lot of banks out there that we believe we have a better value proposition for.\n\nKen Huston\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. Great. Thank you, Charlie.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYour line is open. Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up, Charlie, on what you said in terms of in one of your responses around nothing's going to change dramatically. 15% ROTCE was step number one, which you were at Q2 again just one quarter. I appreciate that. But I think the glass half full way of to look at this, you mentioned the word grow aggressively many, many times on the call. And I think the concern from an investor standpoint is a lot of this growth may come from at the cost of ROTCE. I don't think that's what you're saying. But just give us a sense of the lens with which you're looking at these growths beat on consumer deposits, commercial deposits.\nCould it be that we could see a near-term hit in terms of profitability before things pick up and you gain more wallet share? Just how should we think about the impact on the next six, 12, 18 months of returns? And are there offsetting factors on the expense side or productivity side that could mitigate things that you do to pursue growth? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. No, thank you for the question. I mean, we don't mean to imply at all that we will sacrifice returns for growth. As we do all of our planning and we think about the opportunities, we think the things that we're going to do to grow the company will actually be very focused on continuing to increase the returns that we have. So please don't take anything that we've said as anything other than we continue to be very focused on those two things.\nYou do raise the question about expenses. We do point out in the remarks that we made that we've continued to be very, very focused on using the expense resource that we have as wisely as we can. And so that means that we are still focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in the company. And as we've done up till now, hope to be able to use this material part of the efficiencies that we continue to drive in the company as a way to pay for a lot of the investments that we intend to make. But that is very consistent with what we've done. So even as we've increased marketing spend, we've increased the number of hires that we have in the corporate investment bank. We've increased the hires in the commercial bank. We've increased the number of bankers that we've had in the consumer business.\nWe've increased the number of financial advisors that we have. We haven't stood up and said that those things are dilutive to returns. It's just the opposite. We've been able to do those things because we're driving efficiency elsewhere in the company. And those things will drive increased revenue over a period of time and ultimately higher returns. And so we're continuing to think about those things the exact same way we've been thinking about them. And I would just say that we, as I've said, every quarter, including I think we said it on the last quarter, we continue to feel like there are significant opportunities to drive efficiencies in the company, both traditionally and through technology, including AI.\nThe only thing I'll just make sure we're clear on is, yes, we had 15% ROTCE in the quarter, but we also recognize that we had a gain in our merchant services business. So we don't really think about that as ongoing. So we would say it's still a little bit lower, even though we were running capital levels before the SCB adjustment was put in place.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. So thanks for walking through that. Maybe a separate question, Mike, for you in terms of NII. The market's view on what the Fed might do keeps changing. I appreciate that. But remind us in terms of asset sensitivity as we put into context the sequential growth in NII in the back half and maybe into next year.\nBut how should we think about what three or four rate cuts would do to the balance sheet and the ability to maybe offset that given the growth outlook that you assume? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. Look, I mean, we look at the implied forwards and what the market's pricing in on cuts, obviously. And so that's all sort of embedded in sort of the view of where NII is sort of trending as we look into the latter part of the year. And obviously, even with that, you're still going to see pricing come down on the positive side and the commercial businesses. You're going to see continued repricing on the fixed assets components of the balance sheet. And then you're going to see hopefully start to see some more growth come out of it that will also help from an NII perspective.\nAnd so all those things should be constructive as you look forward despite what could be rates coming down a little.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I was hoping you could just provide some clarity on the net interest income ex markets this quarter. I was having a hard time finding that. And then maybe just give the guidance or comments on kind of the forward guide on NII ex markets just to clarify.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. We don't break out the components in total across markets versus non-markets. That's not something we've historically done. I think when you look under what's happening in the NII ex markets, there's lots of puts and takes across the balance sheet.\nI think if you look at the kind of rates in general, or sort of about kind of what we expected, plus or minus a little bit. So that's the change in rates that we've seen throughout the year, is not impacting sort of our guide really in any significant way. You've seen slightly higher payment rates in places like credit cards. So that's probably muting balances there just a little bit, as well as some other factors there. And so loan growth, depending on the outside of card, has been a little bit slower. Deposits are sort of mostly behaving the way we thought. We're not seeing any significant, or we're seeing really the trends of any cash rebalancing into higher yields, has sort of been stable now for a bit for a number of quarters. And so we're not seeing that change in any significant way.\nAnd so I'd say overall, the trends are FX markets are pretty stable to what we've seen over the last couple of quarters and largely consistent with what we've expected to see with a few puts and takes across the different portfolios.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And I'm sure you guys have heard it before, but just as you're growing the trading business, I think the clarity on the trading that I over time would be helpful. And then just simply want to ask about the lower tax rate this quarter and somewhat related just the impact of the new legislation reducing clean energy tax credits. I think there's some kind of puts and takes there as you think about some stuff going away and some stuff that you might be able to do that you're not doing now. But just the broader tax this quarter and going forward. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company",
    "content2": "Yeah. On the last piece on the tax credits, that'll be a few years out before you see anything, any real impact on that in terms of new projects that will come on. So it'll be a little bit of a while before you start to see that matter much. The broader bill doesn't have a lot of direct impacts relative to the taxes other than the tax credit piece. Few small things. I think just more broadly on the tax line, there's always puts and takes on tax line given how big we are.\nThere were a few things in the quarter that probably brought the tax line a little bit, the tax rate down a little bit lower than what you see over a longer time period, including a California tax change that sort of changed the way they do revenue attribution and a few other sort of wonky items that sort of change it. And so our view on the tax rate over a longer period of time is still kind of high teens. Tax rate is sort of probably the right place given what we see over a longer period of time. But there always seems to be stuff in each quarter that sort of changes that a little bit.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. I wanted to ask another question about capital, Charlie.\nEveryone appreciates that the regulatory reform is in flux. You mentioned earlier an 8.6% minimum on CET1. Your current CET1 level implies 140 basis points minimum to that 9.7%. I'm just wondering, as we think about where you should operate going forward, are you saying that you want to take the time to make sure that that 8.5% is something that is a little bit sustainable if we get GSIB reform, if we get more comprehensive stress test reform? And if that's the case, is 140 basis points still an appropriate buffer, which would imply that your sort of minimum with buffer would be about 10%?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nSo listen, I think I tried to answer this before.\nI think we're in a period of time where we have seen over a 13-month period, we've seen our capital requirement go up like 100 and how much did it go up? 190 basis points, 190 basis, 90 basis, [crosstalk] 90, 90 basis points. And then we saw it come down 120 basis points. The Fed has said that we're going to give you more information, which would be super helpful to us so that we can understand what the future volatility looks like. One would presume that with this administration and the types of things that they're saying, that the lower level is probably more indicative of what the future would look like rather than the higher level.\nBut we just don't think it makes a whole lot of sense to come and say, \"Well, here's how we're going to a number that we're going to run with capital until we avail ourselves of the information that they tell us they're going to give us.\" So trying to directionally lower is the direction we're going, but we don't want it to be a moving target every quarter where we tell you something different. We don't think that's the right way to provide the kind of information to you that we should be providing. So we just want to take that time to understand what the right level is. And we will also be thinking about, with other changes that they're making, and any other changes to these moving pieces, what the right buffer will be. But directionally, lower is certainly where things are going.\nBut we don't know enough to actually tell you what that number should be yet.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThe good news is, right, we have a ton of excess capital. We have more flexibility to deploy it to help support clients and the broader economy here, right? So that should give us more opportunity to use it. Then we'll bring it down. I think we've shown over the last five years that we are not shy about returning capital back to shareholders through buybacks when we feel that's appropriate. So hopefully, we can see that come through over the quarters.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nWe live in a really, I mean, for us, this is an incredibly interesting and fun time.\nI mean, we're sitting here where even with the constraints that we've had, I think we've started to show that the things that we're doing have the ability to drive higher revenues across the company regardless of what's happened in the NII cycle. So we spent a lot of time talking about the things that we've been doing to focus on growing non-interest revenues, which we've been doing because they're strategic opportunities, not just because of the balance sheet. So those strategic opportunities haven't changed. And those will continue to be there for us. So we're still incredibly focused on increasing the non-interest revenues of the company as we've seen we've been able to do. We're starting to see some loan growth. Yes, the loan growth hasn't turned out this year to be as much as we otherwise would have hoped when we first set our targets, our guidance.\nBut overall, where we sit today and the types of things that we're seeing is certainly marginally better than what we had seen in terms of what we're seeing. We're starting to see deposit flows as we've talked about. We've got new account growth. We've got expenses in check. Credit is performing well. We've got more capital than we had the last time we had the conversation. We have less constraints. So for us, as we sit here, even though there's a lot of work for us to do and we've got a lot to prove, we understand that. Those things all line up to be pretty exciting for the management team here.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nAgree with that. Thanks so much.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nHey, Betsy Charlie.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI had a question about just how you're thinking about the arc of expenses over the next period of time, call it a year or two. With the asset cap removal, underlying question is, are there efficiencies that can be generated from investments you had to make that were unique to the asset cap period? And if so, with those efficiencies, is there reinvesting in everything you just mentioned on headcount to drive revenues, or is there a technology angle to some of this reinvestment that we should be expecting? And how are you positioned for generating efficiencies from AI? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nSure. Let me start, Mike, and then you pick up because I've been getting all the questions here.\nSo first of all, on the question of expenses related directly to the asset cap, it's important to point out that the consent order that had the asset cap is still in place. And just as a reminder for those that haven't followed as closely as we do, the asset cap gets lifted when we adopt and implement a series of things. And then the full order gets lifted when the regulators view it as effective and sustainable. We obviously feel really good about the progress that we're making. We feel very comfortable that we're getting there. But until that order is lifted, we've got to be very, very careful about just changing anything because of the plans that we put in place, and the way we and the regulators go about validation.\nSo we're not assuming that anything materially changes up to this point until that happens. Even then, we'll be very, very careful. As we think about the opportunities to drive efficiency, we talk about the fact that there are still substantial opportunities away from our ability to just do things more efficiently from a risk and control perspective. We're continuing to focus on driving those things across the company. It's what you've seen kind of quarter on quarter on quarter, is our headcount has come down, using attrition as much as we can as our friend, to create those efficiencies. Yes, technology will be able to help that trajectory continue even more.\nWe want to be careful about giving any long-term guidance beyond this year on expenses, which is why we've stopped because, as we've said very consistently, we really like the idea of going through the planning cycle, being able to take a look at what we want to invest in, what we think we can drive in terms of efficiencies, and then give a number. But I would say the same thing that we said is similar to the question that Ibrahim was asking before. We're very, very conscious of the fact that expenses are an important lever for us, for us to be able to increase the returns for the company.\nAnd so hopefully, we'll be able to create the right kind of balance by increasing the level of investments while we're keeping expenses in check and focus on not just driving more growth, but driving higher returns in the shorter and medium term as we've tried to do up till now.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nAnd Betsy, I would just say from an AI perspective, it's very early to see any impact of any significance from AI. But we've got capabilities and pilots in our branch system, in our ops system, in our call centers, really across anywhere where you've got anything manual and a lot of people. And those things are starting to mature a little bit very early. But you're starting to see some of the benefit you thought you'd see in terms of efficiency start to come through in some of the early use cases. But it's super, super early.\nAnd I think the impact will build over time there.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks. And I know you said that you would address the ROTCE target when you hit the 15%, which you did this quarter. So can you give us a sense of the timing when we should expect that you would be revisiting that target?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nSo just as a reminder, the 15% that we reported this quarter did include the merchant services gain. So again, we try and be as transparent as we can and look through that and some stuff you saw in taxes. So we're not declaring victory on getting to the 15% yet.\nAnd then maybe as we get towards the end of the year and we talk about next year, we'll talk a little bit more about the timing on those things and recognize that people want to understand a little bit more about how we're thinking about the future.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper. Thank you. So maybe the January call post the strategy deck?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYou just won't stop. We'll see. We'll see.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. No, thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nWe hear you, though.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Yep. Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nSEVP and CFO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. Just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on the loan yields this quarter. It looks like they were relatively flat. I guess overall, would have expected an increase given some of the front book, back book dynamics.\nSo can you maybe talk us through some of the puts and takes and your expectation as you look out, given the rate environment and the curve outlook as well?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. I mean, when you look at spreads, particularly on the commercial side, John, it's still very competitive. And so there's been a couple of spots where you see a little bit of widening of spreads, but not a lot. In most cases, what's holding spreads to be as tight as they are is really the competition we're seeing across the space, particularly in the middle market, commercial banking side of things. And so that's what's driving it when you look at that side of the house.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAnd did that competition intensify to a greater degree than you may have thought? Because it seems like a higher loan yield expectation would have been fair to assume.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nNo, it's been pretty consistent now for a number of quarters, right? It ebbs and flows a little bit depending on which part of the country or which segment you may be talking about. But the competition has been pretty intense there for a while. And so you're just not seeing sort of the widening that you might in sort of a slowing economic environment. That's just not materializing that way.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. And then my follow-up would be related to that too. Where are you seeing that competitive pressure come from? Is it private credit? Is it other types of non-banks? We've heard some citing insurance players stepping up again in certain parts of real estate. Are there areas that you'd flag? And then has that impacted anything around loan growth expectations? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. I'd say still the primary competitor, particularly when you're talking about the middle market, commercial bank, or other banks. You certainly see other non-bank players at times in certain pieces of it. But the primary competitor still is other banks. And they vary depending on what part of the country you're in, obviously. But I think that's what's driving it mostly.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi, Mike. Hi, Charlie. Mike, you talked about the growth in the commercial and industrial loans in the quarter. It was predominantly in the Corporate and Investment Banking. Can you give us a little more color and insights into where you saw that in that segment of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio growth?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah, sure. It's across the board in a bunch of sectors, Gerard.\nBut I'd say we're seeing growth in places like fund finance, which are capital call facilities with big private equity firms. We saw a little bit of growth in probably three or four sectors across the large corporate space, including TMT, industrials, and healthcare. So a little bit across the board. You're also seeing some more asset-backed loan growth coming out of our markets business across whether it's mortgages or other types of collateral. A tiny bit of growth in prime brokerage. And so it really is sort of across the board in terms of a number of different areas within the corporate investment bank.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. And you guys have talked a lot about improving efficiencies and improving profitability with the asset cap being lifted. Kind of a pivoting question. You talked about exiting the rail equipment leasing business, and you've exited other businesses over the years.\nAre there any other businesses left that are not meeting your internal profitability targets, possibly that could enhance the longer-term profitability of the company? Or is this essentially it for divesting of different segments?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. The rail portfolio is really the last thing of any size. I mean, we looked at the businesses a few years ago now and sort of have methodically sort of worked our way through each of them. And really, the rail portfolio is sort of the last of those.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the last question for today will come from Chris McGratty of KBW. Your line is open.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nOh, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just on operating leverage a little bit more broadly, the markets feel better today, more optimism in markets. But certainly, we know that's fluid.\nI know you touched briefly on it, but just maybe unpacking the degree of confidence in the operating leverage over the medium term and then, I guess, both sides of it, the revenue and the expenses. Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nYeah. Chris, I mean, look, I just come back to what we talked about a little bit earlier in the call. I think on the expense side, we feel as confident as we can be that there's a lot more to do on the efficiency side of it. And over the last four or five years, we've taken out $12 billion already. You've seen headcount come down by 20 consecutive quarters in a row. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. And it's how we start all of our conversations with the business leaders and our budgeting each quarter. We go through it.\nAnd so I think there's more to do there really across almost every part of the company. I think we'll continue to drive that the same way we've done that the last number of years. And look, I think on the revenue side, I just come back to the broader opportunity that we have to grow across each of the businesses. How that manifests itself in any given quarter is a little out of your control to some degree, and so, given how markets can be. But I do think across every single one of our businesses, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to grow. And so I think those two things together should provide growth, profitability, and returns over the long run.\n\nChristopher McGratty\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no more questions at this time.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nChairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nGreat. We appreciate the time and look forward to talking next quarter.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all participants may disconnect."

The session will begin momentarily. Welcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.\nIf you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star two. Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn Campbell\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss Q1 results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our Q1 earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.\nInformation about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our results, update you on our priorities, and provide some observations on what we're seeing in the current environment. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review Q1 results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with Q1 highlights. We had solid Q1 results with diluted earnings per share up 16% from a year ago, including some items noted in the earnings release.\nWhile revenue declined from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income as expected, we grew our fee-based revenue across many of our businesses, reflecting the benefit of the investments we've been making to diversify revenues and reduce our reliance on net interest income.\nWe continued to take a disciplined approach to expenses, with expenses declining from a year ago as we executed on our efficiency initiatives, which have helped drive headcount reductions for 19 consecutive quarters. We maintained our strong credit discipline, and credit performance improved during the quarter, with lower net charge-offs from both a year ago and Q4, driven by improved performance in our commercial portfolio while consumer losses were relatively stable.\nWe've been actively returning excess capital, and in Q1, we returned $4.8 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and our diluted average common shares outstanding were down 8% from a year ago. Regarding our strategic priorities, I'm very proud of the significant progress we've made on our risk and control work. It remains our top priority, and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. Five consent orders were terminated in Q1.\nSome of these were longstanding, and others were resolved with timeframes that are much improved from other historical orders, which is an indication that our team is establishing the right processes and controls to meet our regulators and our own expectations. Since 2019, 11 orders have been terminated. We are a different company today than when this new management team arrived.\nThese recent closures reflect that we have completed much of the common risk and control infrastructure work across the company that is required by other orders. I'm incredibly proud of the work done by our teams and remain confident that we will complete the work needed to close our other open consent orders. We also continue to show progress on our other strategic priorities, which are helping to improve Wells Fargo's returns.\nOur investments in our card business have continued to drive higher balances and spend from a year ago, while credit results have continued to be within our expectations. During Q1, Ed Olebe joined us as the Head of Cards and Merchant Services. I want to thank Ray Fischer for his leadership of our card business over the last five years. Ray was my first hire when I joined Wells, and I've worked with Ray for much of the 38 years we've known each other.\nSo I'm not surprised at the great job he did in transforming our Card and Merchant business. He brought great talent into the business, transformed our product offerings, and greatly improved the customer experience while making the card business an important strategic part of Wells Fargo. I'm equally excited to welcome Ed to the company.\nHe brings more than 25 years of financial services and credit card experience, and his expertise will be invaluable as we continue to grow our credit card business and expand our payment capabilities across merchant services. Turning to our auto business, we've started to launch our partnership with Volkswagen and Audi brands as their preferred purchase financing provider in the United States.\nFollowing the termination of the sales practices consent order over a year ago, we have been taking measured actions in Consumer, Small, and Business Banking that started to generate modest growth across a number of metrics, including net checking account growth, credit cards originated in our branches, and improved customer experience scores.\nWe've also continued to invest in refurbishing our branches while at the same time making enhancements to our account opening experience in both our digital and branch channels. In Q1, active mobile customers grew 4% from a year ago, and digital account openings continued to grow. We continue to increase collaboration between our bankers and advisors that is helping drive an increase in net asset flows into the Wealth and Investment Management Premier channel.\nWe've also seen more of our clients investing in alternative products, which is one of our goals. Turning to our commercial business, we continue to generate strong growth in investment banking fees, driven by strength in debt capital markets. I want to thank Jon Weiss, who announced his retirement earlier this year and started leading Corporate & Investment Banking in 2020.\nJon has built a great management team, and together they have taken a good corporate investment bank and have made it an important driver of growth and strong returns for the company. We are a better and stronger company because of Jon's leadership, and he is leaving Corporate & Investment Banking well-positioned for future growth. Fernando Rivas, who joined Wells Fargo last year with nearly 30 years of industry experience, is now the sole CEO of Corporate & Investment Banking.\nWe are also focused on expanding our Commercial Banking business, and the investments we've made in relationship managers and business development officers have helped to attract new clients, and we've seen some early success in offering our investment banking capabilities to our Commercial Banking clients. Now let me turn towards what we're seeing from our customers.\nThrough Q1, our internal indicators continued to point towards the strength of our customers' financial position. Consumers have remained resilient, and debit and credit card spending patterns have remained stable. More affluent customers continue to show strength, while less affluent customers show more stress. Consumer credit also continues to perform well.\nDelinquencies appear to have leveled at historical norms, and payment rates on unsecured portfolios have been quite strong. Deposit flows for both consumer and commercial clients have been consistent and in line with seasonal trends. And while overall loan growth was modest, we've seen pockets of increased loan demand from our commercial clients, resulting in modest growth in both average and period-end commercial loan balances from Q4.\nAll of this points to the strength of our customer base through the end of Q1. Some broader comments now on what we see currently. I'm encouraged by the willingness of the administration to take on some very difficult issues. It's been over 15 years since the financial crisis, and we greatly support the willingness to look at the cumulative impact of the regulatory changes that have been made during this period and evaluate where changes are needed to better support a growing US economy.\nThis is not just a bank issue. We also hear from our corporate clients that they experience significant regulatory barriers to growth and support the effort to look at regulations and make meaningful changes. We believe the changes that are being discussed would allow us to better support our customers. That means make more loans, take more deposits, and provide more liquidity to the markets while still preserving robust regulatory oversight.\nRegarding trade, we also support the administration's willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States. Though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions, and we see concern playing out in the markets and the economic uncertainty that now exists, timely resolution, which benefits the US, would be good for businesses, consumers, and the markets, and therefore good for Wells Fargo since we're predominantly a US bank.\nWells Fargo prospers when the US prospers. Though we have heard a great deal from our clients as they work through this transitionary environment, we have not seen an impact on their condition yet. This is a complicated issue, and it is our current expectation that we will face continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025. But the actual outcome will be dependent on the results and timing of policy changes.\nWe and our customers come into the current environment from a position of strength, and that should serve us well. We have managed credit well over many cycles, and over the past couple of years, we have taken several credit-tightening actions that have reduced our origination volume and improved our credit performance, which should position us well if there is an economic downturn.\nWe have a strong balance sheet, including our capital and liquidity levels, which allow us to support our customers and clients in a variety of economic scenarios. We will continue to react to both known and anticipated policy changes and their potential effects on the economy, and we'll continue to carefully monitor these trends and respond accordingly. Our focus is unwavering.\nWe want to be an important partner for our clients, communities, and governments in driving sustainable economic growth in the US. We are transforming Wells Fargo by investing to build a well-controlled, faster-growing, and higher-returning company while we work to better serve our customers and become more efficient.\nI'm proud of all that we've accomplished and even more excited about our future as we build one of the most respected financial institutions in the country. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results were solid, with net income of $4.9 billion US dollars or $1.39 US dollars per diluted common share, both up from a year ago. These results reflect the consistent execution on our strategic priorities. We continue to see growth in fee-based revenue across many of our core businesses, had a focus on reducing expenses, and maintained strong credit discipline and continued to return excess capital to shareholders.\nOur Q1 results included $313 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to resolution of prior period matters, and a $263 million or $0.06 per share gain on the previously announced sale of the non-agency third-party servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business. These benefits were partially offset by $149 million or $0.03 per share of losses related to $2.6 billion of debt securities as we continue to reposition the investment portfolio.\nTurning to slide four, net interest income was down $341 million or 3% from Q4, driven by two fewer days in the quarter, as well as the impact of lower rates and floating rate assets. I will update you on the full-year net interest income expectations later on the call. Moving to slide five, both average and period-end loans grew slightly from Q4, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans.\nWhile still quite modest, it's the first time we've seen growth in average loans since Q1 2023. Average deposits increased from a year ago across our commercial and consumer businesses, enabling us to reduce higher-cost corporate treasury deposits by $69 billion, or 58%. Average deposits declined 1% from Q4 as higher consumer balances were more than offset by a reduction in higher-cost corporate treasury deposits, as well as seasonal declines in our commercial businesses.\nAverage deposit costs declined 15 basis points from Q4, with declines across all of our businesses. Turning to slide six, net interest income was stable compared to a year ago. The impairments in the venture capital portfolio and losses from the investment portfolio repositioning were offset by growth across many of our businesses where we have been investing, resulting in higher investment advisory and investment banking fees.\nWe also benefited from the gain on the sale of a part of our commercial mortgage servicing business. Turning to expenses on slide seven, net interest expense declined 3% from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, the lower FDIC special assessment, and the impact of our efficiency initiatives.\nNet interest expense was relatively stable compared to Q4, which included $647 million of severance expense, while Q1 included approximately $700 million of seasonally higher expenses, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement-eligible employees, and 401(k) matching contributions.\nTurning to credit quality on slide eight, credit performance improved, with our net loan charge-off ratio down 5 basis points from a year ago and 8 basis points from Q4 to 45 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs decreased $192 million from Q4 to 16 basis points of average loans, driven by lower losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio.\nConsumer net loan charge-offs declined $10 million from Q4 and were 86 basis points of average loans, as declines in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher losses in the credit card portfolio, reflecting seasonality, which was consistent with our expectations. Non-performing assets increased 4% from Q4, driven by an increase in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans.\nMoving to slide nine, our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $84 million from Q4, reflecting a lower allowance for commercial real estate loans on lower loan balances. Although we haven't seen evidence of weakness in our consumer or commercial portfolios, when setting the allowance in Q1, we made a modest adjustment to reflect the potential economic weakness that could develop.\nOur allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking commercial real estate office portfolio declined to 11.2%, which was in line with the coverage ratio we had in this portfolio for most of the last year. Turning to capital and liquidity on slide 10, our capital position remained strong, with our CET1 ratio stable at 11.1%, well above our CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8%.\nWe repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock in Q4 and have the capacity to continue to repurchase shares. Moving to our operating segment, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11, Consumer, Small & Business Banking revenue declined 2% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit costs, reflecting the impact of customer migration to higher-yielding deposit products.\nOf note, deposit balances grew from a year ago, marking the first year-over-year gain since Q4 2022, as the average balance per checking account stabilized and the pace of migration to higher-yielding products continued to slow. Debit card spending remained strong, up 4% from a year ago, consistent with Q4 growth rate. Home Lending revenue was stable from a year ago. Mortgage loan originations increased 26%, with increases in both purchase and refinance volume.\nWe continued to streamline the business, with headcount down 47% and the amount of third-party mortgage loan service for others down 31% since the end of 2022. Credit card revenue grew 2% from a year ago as loan balances increased. Auto revenue decreased 21% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression.\nThe spread compression reflects our previous credit-tightening actions, which have resulted in an increased concentration of higher FICO borrowers in our portfolio, as well as improved credit performance. The decline in Personal Lending revenue from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12, revenue was down 7% from a year ago as growth in non-interest income, driven by higher treasury management fees, increased revenue from tax credit investments, and higher investment banking fees, was more than offset by lower net interest income due to the impact of lower rates. Average loan balances in Q4 were stable from a year ago and up 1% from Q4.\nTurning to Corporate & Investment Banking on slide 13, banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by the impact of lower interest rates. This decline was partially offset by lower deposit pricing and higher investment banking revenue from increased activity in debt capital markets. Commercial real estate revenue grew 18% from a year ago, driven by the gain on the sale of a part of our commercial mortgage servicing business.\nIncreased capital markets activity and higher revenue in our low-income housing business also benefited revenue in Q4. Markets revenue was stable from a year ago as higher revenue from activity across most commodity products, as well as foreign exchange, was offset by lower results in structured products and credit trading. The 22% from Q4 reflected seasonality and higher trading activity across most asset classes.\nAverage loans declined 2% from a year ago but increased 1% from Q4 as growth in markets and banking more than offset continued declines in commercial real estate as transaction activity remained muted, capital markets remained liquid, and our office portfolio continued to decline. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 4% compared with a year ago as higher asset-based fees, driven by increased market valuations, were partially offset by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so Q2 results will reflect market valuations as of 1 April, which were down from 1 January but up from a year ago. Despite the market volatility during Q1, the mix of our clients' assets allocation was relatively stable. Average deposit balances continued to increase, and the migration of deposits to cash alternatives continued to slow. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results.\nRevenue declined compared to a year ago, driven by lower results from our venture capital investments, and higher net losses on debt securities related to the repositioning of the investment portfolio. Turning to our 2025 outlook on slide 16, we have not changed our net interest income outlook, and we still expect 2025 net interest income will be approximately 1% to 3% higher than in 2024.\nHowever, given what has occurred over the past three months, we currently expect our full-year 2025 net interest income to be in the low end of the range. It is still early in the year, and clearly we are entering a period with more volatility, so we will need to see how the key variables driving net interest income, such as rates, deposit flows, and mix, as well as loan growth, play out, and we will continue to update you over the remainder of the year.\nI would also point out that the amount of trading-related net interest income will be impacted by rate and asset levels, which would be largely offset by trading-related non-interest income. Regarding our expense outlook, we still expect 2025 non-interest expense to be approximately $54.2 billion. In summary, our results in Q1 reflected the progress we have been making to improve our financial performance.\nCompared with a year ago, we had double-digit growth in diluted earnings per share, grew fee-based revenue across many of our businesses, reduced our expenses, and improved our credit performance. Lastly, the strength of our balance sheet, including our capital and liquidity positions, our risk discipline, and our diversified business model allows us to be a source of strength for our customers throughout economic cycles. We will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please first unmute your phone and then press star one. Please record your name at the prompt. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star two to remove yourself from the question queue.\nOnce again, please press star one and record your name if you would like to ask a question at this time. Please stand by for our first question. And our first question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate you taking the question. Charlie, maybe I was hoping you could start by perhaps expanding on your thoughts regarding current customer sentiment. Is your sense that customers are still eager to do things once we get past all this turmoil? In other words, we just sort of need a finite termination to some of this uncertainty, or are they now beginning to gear themselves for a more prolonged slowdown that would sort of dial back some of their plans?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Listen, I would say I think they're trying to figure it out. I mean, I think everything that we see in the behavior, both in terms of both our consumers as well as our corporate customers, has been just continued strain, which is a great position to start from. But everyone is trying to assess the situation in terms of, will there be resolution to some of these things? What does it mean for their business? And that's not completely clear.\nSo business hasn't come to a halt in any way at this point, but people are certainly taking stock of what it means, figuring out where to sit and wait and where to continue to move forward. And I think there is still a hope that the positives of regulation, positives of tax reform, the long-term positives of changes in trade can put us in a position to feel better about the future and a growing economy. But people are cautious, so I just kind of put it in the wait-and-see category. Cautious in the shorter term, but probably still bullish for the longer term.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you very much. And then, Mike, I was hoping you could unpack a little more on the NII commentary. A few caveats in there, and I appreciate you're thinking more toward the lower end of the range given what we see currently. But maybe as you look at some of the puts and takes regarding rates, the forwards, anticipated loan growth or lack thereof, if you could just maybe point to where you feel like you're most confident and, by contrast, what might need to be right to get a little stronger performance as the year plays out.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, I appreciate it. There are a lot of puts and takes and certainly a lot of uncertainty just more broadly around where the path is. If you start and think about where rates are relative to the expectations we set in January, really the difference is on the short end of Fed funds; really the difference is in the second half of the year. The first half of the year is pretty close, and that's moving around a lot, right?\nYou can just look at the implied forwards for year-end on Fed funds, and you got a 30 basis points plus or minus move over the last six, seven days. And so I think that's going to continue to evolve a bit as we kind of look forward. On the long end, right now, rates are a little bit lower than what we projected, but it's not a huge driver of what's going to be success for NII.\nAnd we're up 50 basis points in the last seven days, and so that can move pretty or a little over that, actually, as of now. And so that can move pretty quickly. So we'll see. And it's hard to predict exactly where rates are going to go just given sort of the volatility that we've seen. On the loan side, like we said in January, we didn't expect to see a lot in the first half.\nWe expected to see more in the second half and call it sort of mid-single-digit kind of growth rates, kind of 3%-ish, 4%-ish sort of growth rates. That kind of pace when you look at the Q4 versus Q4. And that's still an open question. Charlie sort of highlighted a little bit of the uncertainty that's there. We did see a little bit of growth in the Q1, so that's a positive. As I mentioned in my remarks, we haven't seen that in a while, so that's good.\nAnd so we'll see how that progresses, and hopefully we get a little bit more clarity and things calm down a bit and we start to see some of that growth that we expect to happen. But that's certainly going to be a place that could move around a little bit. And then when you look at deposits, we come into the Q1, you see non-interest bearing down a little, interest bearing up a little bit. So you got a little bit of on a negative side, you got a little bit of mixed changes there.\nOn the positive side, though, as we look at the consumer business, we saw a little bit of growth. Plus, we're getting better results when we look at the retention of some of the savings promotions that we had on, or the CDs that are rolling over. So we're retaining more of those deposits than we'd model. So there's some puts and takes there as well. And so as you look forward, and then you have trading NII that's going to move around a little bit.\nYou see a little bit of that in the first quarter where we had higher trading assets driving a little bit lower NII, but that's offset in fees. And so you see there's lots of puts and takes. And so at this point, we still feel like that low end of the range is kind of what it looks like now, but it could move around a little bit as we go into the middle of the year, both in a positive or negative way.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. And I just want to emphasize just what Mike just said, which is we're trying to be as transparent as we can be about what the outcomes can be in terms of NII. But there are huge unknowns, and the huge unknowns can go both ways in this, right? You can make arguments. If I look at the forward curve in terms of how many rate cuts there'll be, you can also make an argument that suggests there just won't be nearly the amount of rate cuts that are embedded in the forwards.\nYou see what's happened to the curve over the last couple of days, let alone the past couple of hours. The same holds true relative to what happens in terms of just loan balances. There are scenarios where, for a host of reasons, both could be positive or negative in terms of customers wanting to borrow. And so it's just, it is a volatile time. It is a time of unknowns. Again, we're trying to be as clear as we can about what we think today.\nAs we think about what the future is, we're not locked in on one scenario that's locked in on the low end of NII. It's how can this play out? It could play out multiple ways. And as we see here next quarter, we'll hopefully be able to share more because time won't just have passed, but hopefully the issues that are driving the rate curve out there we'll have a little bit more clarity on.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Thank you all for the additional color.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Usdin of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Charlie, in your interest statements, you mentioned the continued progress on knocking down more of the consent orders. And I just want to ask a bigger question about the regulatory backdrop, and does anything in the moving parts that we're all watching happen in terms of the appointments and new heads and such impact how you move forward on trying to get the rest of them done? Just if you have to make an adjustment, what are those adjustments that you have to just be thinking about? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Listen, I don't think we need to make any kind of adjustment. I mean, I was asked in the past about how I felt about the willingness of people in leadership positions in the prior administration to close orders. I was very consistent in my belief that the regulators are very objective when it comes to these things. They're very fact-based. They want us to see them do the work. They want us to do their validation.\nAnd if we do that, they'll close the orders. And we've seen that. We've had 11 closed since 2019. And so I think I don't think the change in administration suggests that we need to do anything differently. I do think certainly the view that this administration has and the people that are both, whether they're acting or those that have been nominated or those that are in new positions, would certainly want to be constructive when it comes to not just regulation, but supervision.\nAnd so I presume that they will react in a very positive way to the progress that they've seen us make. And I would point you to the quote in the press release about our view on the importance of the work that's been completed in the closed consent orders and what that means for some of the orders that are outstanding. And so I think these things come together to not have us feel any different, meaning we still are extremely confident in our ability to do what needs to get done here.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGreat. And Mike, one for you. You mentioned that you made a little bit of an adjustment on the reserve. I think people are noticing that there was a bit of a reserve release. You guys are one of the more conservatives in your scenarios, but can you kind of just talk through just how you feel about where you stand now and how the environment also just makes you think about whether that was fully captured in the first quarter reserve or are there any things we should be thinking about going forward? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Sure. I think first, in terms of the adjustment we made that I highlighted, it was a couple hundred million dollars. And so we would have had a bigger release given both the change in balances we saw in the quarter, but also sort of the credit performance, which has been really, really good.\nYou can kind of see that. Come look at the charge-offs. So it would have been a bigger release. I think when you take a step back and look at the way we've approached the allowance now for consistently now for a number of years, we start with a pretty significant weighting on the downside scenarios. We have a baseline scenario. We have a couple of downside scenarios. We've had a pretty significant weighting on those scenarios now for a number of years.\nWhen you look at how that projects out, and you can see a little bit of this in the Q, but it doesn't quite give you the whole time series. But when you look at what that shows, it shows unemployment kind of getting to a little over 5.8%, so a little under 6% out a couple quarters versus what you might see in the Q. So it already is a pretty significant uptick in sort of unemployment running through the models. But I would also point out that's step one.\nSo running the models, getting 5.8% as the unemployment, that's step one in terms of where we get with the allowance. Step two is then really being thoughtful about all of the things the models might not capture appropriately. And so we increase the allowance based on a lot of the judgment that we then apply across the different risks that might be there within the scenario. So I would sort of take comfort that, one, we do have a pretty good weighting there on the downside.\nIt is 5.8% of employment, and then we add more allowance on top of it. Now, will that change based on the path of the economy? Maybe, right? We've got to see where this starts to go. If we have a much deeper recession, would you see allowance uptick? Probably. But I think something's got to change pretty change in terms of the outlook in a pretty significant way.\nI sort of bring it back to where Charlie was before, when clients coming into this are in really pretty good shape, right? And you can see that through the charge-off performance. And so both on the consumer side, in good shape, we're not seeing deterioration happen in any meaningful way relative to what the trend that we've had over the last couple quarters, even on that lower-end consumer. And on the corporate side, same thing.\nVery consistent performance now for a number of quarters. Really, the only place that we've seen any systematic stress is still the office portfolio. Even there, it's been pretty stable in terms of the trends and what our expectations have been.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nLet me just add a couple of things if I can and emphasize a couple of things Mike said. First of all, when you look at our change in reserve this quarter, it came down because loan balances came down and because we had charge-offs really in our commercial property portfolio where we have substantial reserves, and so it's appropriate to use those. As Mike said, our modeling, which we think is very well, you can argue, but we think it's appropriate.\nProbably on the conservative side, given the unemployment numbers and the way we weighted our scenarios, would have suggested a release. And so away from those two places where we did reduce the reserve, we kept what we think are relatively conservative assumptions for unemployment and the weighting of scenarios and didn't release.\nSo it's more conservative today than it was at the end of last quarter, which was an intentional reaction to what we see going on out there. But as Mike said, would that be enough under a range of scenarios? It depends on how bad the scenario were to get.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGreat color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John McDonald of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nYes. Hi. Good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what you saw with commercial loan growth this quarter. It seemed like it picked up a little bit. Change in utilization or a build-out of customers? Just give a little color there, please.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Sure, John. First, in the commercial bank, it was mostly a utilization story. There may have been a few new customers as well where we saw kind of a slight uptick there in utilization, mostly in kind of the bigger client segments, so the mid-corporate segment, not the smaller clients in the commercial bank. We also saw some upticks in our asset-based lending portfolio as well, all in the commercial bank. Again, mostly utilization, but a little bit of a couple of new clients.\nAnd then we also saw some uptick in the corporate investment bank. Again, a mix there of utilization and a couple of new clients that sort of came into the portfolio. And so it was encouraging to see that. The question I got earlier in the day too was, was it related to kind of tariffs or was it related to just BAU sort of borrowing?\nAnd it appears like it was mostly just BAU activity out there. We haven't really seen any evidence of people pre-positioning significantly that caused significant borrowing, at least as it relates to their expectations around tariffs.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thanks. And I was wondering if you could give some more color on what you saw this quarter in terms of the market-sensitive fee businesses across trading, IB, and venture capital. How did the environment impact this quarter? And what should we keep in mind as we think about the outlook for those items?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. First, on the venture portfolio, what you saw was a couple of things in that portfolio. One, we had an exit event late last year, and we're in a lockup period on an IPO. And so you saw some mark-to-market losses on that stock, and that's been moving around a little bit, but that was part of it. That's still, by the way, an amazing return on that investment, even with the noise there. And then you had some impairments across a number of portfolios.\nAnd given the volatility that we've seen in the equity market in particular, but also just more broadly, that's going to have an impact on exits coming out of that venture portfolio and kind of pushing them back in time. And so you really have to. That number can be a little volatile quarter to quarter, so you really have to look at that over a slightly longer period of time. But overall, we feel really good about the portfolio.\nWe feel good about the investments that are made there, and it's just going to take some time to monetize it given some of the volatility. When you look at trading, which I guess is part of the other piece, we had a decent quarter in trading really across a number of different desks there.\nAnd that's just a continuation of what we've seen now for the better part of, I guess, two or three years almost now where we've gotten better and better and more consistent at driving good results there. And then, obviously, we have some volatility coming into this quarter in early April, at least. And so we'll see how that progresses through the rest of the quarter.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nOkay. Just again, on the IB, obviously, things have kind of ground to a halt a bit on activity levels, but you guys are building out your investment bank and adding people. Just kind of some thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, the investments that we're making continue. We've announced a few more over the last number of weeks with different people joining in different roles. We've got a really disciplined plan there, and we'll continue to make those. And as you know, you really have to have consistent coverage and product capabilities over a long period of time, and we're going to continue to do that. I think in the activity, what you saw in the quarter was really led by debt capital markets.\nNot surprising, probably. You did see a little bit of equity capital markets activity. At this, with the volatility that we've seen over the last two weeks, it's going to be hard to see much activity in the equity capital market space until that calms down a bit. I do expect you'll continue to see good activity in debt capital markets. And then M&A, the conversations are good. The pipeline's good.\nAnd to Charlie's point earlier, I think it's going to be dependent on when people start to get a little bit more certainty around the policy adjustments that are being made and how that's going to impact their business. So we'll see how that goes. But as you know, in investment banking, it's a long game, and so we need to be consistent there over a long period of time, and that's the goal.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a follow-up to the discussion around the fee outlook, but maybe with an expense lens or framing it with an expense lens. Just given the better core expense outcome in the quarter versus the quarterly run rate implied by the full-year guide and some of the headwinds you cited just on the fee side from various impairments or negative AUM marks, I was hoping you could speak to the expense flexibility in the model if the fee outlook or backdrop continues to deteriorate further.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Sure. Look, I think there's always a degree of flexibility as you go through the year. We want to try to make sure that we stay consistent and execute on a lot of the core investments we're making. But if you start with the easy ones, right, if the market continues to decline from where it is today, you'll see less revenue-related expense, particularly in Wealth and Investment Management. The IB comp will be a function of sort of activity and revenue that we see throughout the year.\nAnd so there's some flexibility, obviously, there depending on sort of where revenues come in. I think we've seen really good performance in the quarter on operating losses. So we gave you an estimation there. That's obviously running below sort of the run rate. So hopefully, that will continue as well.\nAnd so I think it's an area we're actively managing that each week, each month, each quarter as we have now for the last four or five years. So we'll take action if we think this is going to be sustained in some way, but while we protect some of the core investments that we need to make.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for that color. And Mike, for my follow-up, I was hoping to drill down into some of the NII comments you made around the second-half ramp and some of the idiosyncratic factors like the CD roll off you cited. It's certainly an encouraging guide, especially given the changes in the forward curve.\nMyself and others appear to be struggling to reconcile some of the resiliency, admittedly, with all the incremental cuts that are now in the forward curve. I was hoping you could maybe just speak to the exit rate on NII once those cuts are fully absorbed, just as we try to think about the jumping-off point, looking ahead to 2026.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, that's a difficult one, right, to give you a lot of specificity. I can understand why you'd want me to try to do that. But I think, obviously, rates are one factor that go into sort of the jumping-off point. I think as you just sort of look at where the forwards are relative to what we showed you in January, as I said earlier, you're 40 or 50 basis points lower potentially on the forwards in part of the second half of the year.\nBut remember, in the fourth quarter, the cut usually comes in later in the quarter. So it doesn't have a big impact in 2025. And then I think loan growth, we're still expecting to see some loan growth. We think some of it will be resilient to the environment, but some of it, obviously, in the commercial bank and some of the corporate franchise, is going to be a function of the broader macro view here.\nAnd so we'll see how it sort of plays out. But I think trying to estimate where we're going to exit 2025 is not something I think we're going to try to get very specific on at this point.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd I would just remind everyone that just as we plan for different scenarios, you all should plan for different scenarios as opposed to just what the forward curve says.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Forward curve is usually wrong.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd changes dramatically.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYep.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nIt's almost always wrong and is always changing. So I could certainly appreciate that sentiment. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning. Charlie, a couple of questions for you. One is on the five consent orders that were closed so far year-to-date 2025. And I'm just wondering, how does that impact you? Does that give you more management time? Does it enable you to take down expenses at all? Does it make you more efficient or not? I'm just wondering if there's any tangible impact that we should see from this.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. That's a good question. Listen, I think as we've been doing all of the work that needs to get done individually on consent orders takes up a lot of management time and a lot of internal and external resources. So as we complete the work, we have to dedicate less resources towards the project aspect of getting these things done.\nThe fact that the operating committee spends the first chunk of time at every management committee meeting we have or operating committee we have going through where we are on these things, absolutely, it clears up time for us to do other things and focus on other things. The fact that the consent orders are closed doesn't mean we're going to stop doing the work. It doesn't mean that we're committed to doing what's underlying that work.\nBut we do then have a chance to figure out, are we doing everything as efficiently as we can? Because now we have a much better understanding of the control environment and how to run it properly. So I wouldn't put a number on it per se, but it does give us more degrees of freedom, certainly, in terms of how we run the place.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. The follow-up is you mentioned in your remarks about being excited about the future. It would be helpful to understand how you're thinking about that. What underlies that statement, especially given you still do have the Asset cap on? I mean, we're all expecting at some point it'll be taken off. In an environment with the Asset cap still on, what underlies that statement? In an environment without it, what underlies that statement would be helpful to unpack a bit? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. So in an environment where the asset cap is still on, I think what you've seen us do over the past four or five years is to focus on growing businesses where we don't rely on balance sheet, which, by the way, are things we should be doing anyway because they're important strategic things for us to grow to round out our franchise.\nAnd so whether it's been focused on spending in the card business, whether it's focused on our investing in the wealth business, whether it's building out the fee-based businesses in the corporate investment bank, be it underwriting, be it advisory, be it our treasury management businesses, the focus we have on delivering those products and services into the commercial bank, those are all things we've been investing in significantly and have helped our non-interest revenues.\nThose things are going to continue with or without an asset cap. We think that'll give us a significant opportunity. In a world without an asset cap, as I've talked about multiple times, we have limited our ability to grow the ability to finance customers, our trading businesses, and associated inventory. We wouldn't look for.\nDon't expect any kind of step functions in how we think about risk there, but just facilitating more customer activity, balance sheet certainly would be very helpful. As loan demand picks up across all of our businesses, it gives us the opportunity to grow there as well as not having to limit deposits as we've had to limit deposits all along.\nJust the financial dynamics with and without an asset cap, I think, lead us to feel very, very good about the future. And I've talked in the past and in the shareholder letters strategically about why we think we're so well-positioned in all of our businesses. Hopefully, that's helpful.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd is there an opportunity for an even more elevated ROE, ROTCE outlook here as you progress through that opportunity set?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nListen, I would say we aren't going to be happy until we get to the 15% that we told you we were going to get to, which we, in terms of having it be sustainable. And then we said when we get there, we're going to look at where we should be. And we don't think our businesses are. Let me say it differently. Each business individually has the opportunity to have the returns amongst the best in the industry.\nAnd then you weight that to look at what we think about in terms of answer the question why we shouldn't get there eventually. That's how we think about it. But we also know that we're going to continue to grow investments and things like that. So we feel very good about what's in front of us, regardless of the short-term volatility that we see in the economic environment and the markets.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Good morning. I guess maybe just on the last thing you mentioned, Charlie, around each business should have best-in-class ROE. You've talked about that for a while. The consumer business obviously stands out there. Give us a sense of how much of that improvement in the consumer business on ROE is removal of the asset cap.\nMaybe there's some efficiency opportunities that arise out of that versus better using your branch network after the consent order that got lifted last February. Just would love to hear how we should think about that ROE gap relative to best-in-class peers, narrowing from here, and if there's a timeframe that you have in mind?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, I'm not going to talk about a timeframe because, again, what we've said very consistently is get to 15%. And so that's what we're focused on. And when we get there, then we'll talk about how we think of the overall returns at that point. But I'm just trying to provide some context for how we think about what the longer-term opportunities here are.\nWhen we talk about internally the opportunities to increase ROE, and I just want to also make the statement that we're focused not only on growing sustainable ROTCE, but we're focused on sustainable growth because it'd be very easy for us to get to a much higher ROTCE number without investing to build the kind of growth we want to build into the franchise.\nAnd so that does elongate the time theoretically that it takes to get to some of these industry-leading numbers because it's not lost on us that some of our great competitors have both very high ROTCEs while investing significantly. And they've been doing that over a long period of time to get to where they are.\nBut when I think about just specifically the consumer business, and I refer to some of these things in our shareholder letter, when we think about our consumer lending business, almost all of our businesses in our consumer lending segment are earning far below the ROTCEs that they should be earning for different reasons. We're in a growth phase in the card business.\nWe've talked about just what that means in terms of how so many of the expenses are front-loaded, balances get built over a period of time. But as long as the results play out on top of the models that we assumed, we know that's just a matter of time until those returns increase significantly. Our auto business is on a journey. Programs, obviously, we've got some question marks in terms of what tariffs will mean to some of our partners out there.\nBut the deal that we've done to be the captive on new cars with Volkswagen and Audi, we think certainly is a significant plus. It will help us become more of a full-spectrum lender where we can increase the profitability of that business. We're still on a journey, which we're very confident we're going to get there, not just to run a better home lending business, but that business does not have the returns that it should.\nThat's just as we transition to this different model. We look at those things. When we look at our consumer and small business bank, the returns are very strong, but we've not had the kind of growth that other people have had. I've talked about the constraints that we've had there, but we feel really good about what we're doing.\nAnd so there, as you see that growth, given the nature of the business, it's not capital-intensive per se, so it increases returns. And so we see a pretty clear path in our consumer businesses for some material improvements.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nIt's helpful. And just a second question. Would love to hear how you're thinking about capital management. Now, your SCB went up 90 basis points last year, and we'll see what the results have come end of June. But assuming we have a similar size or some decline this year, is there an internal philosophy around where you think the right CET1 is for Wells, regardless of where the SCB shakes out?\nAnd does potential changes in sort of the regulatory backdrop reduce the need for a 100 basis point buffer in terms of how you've thought about that?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Listen, I would say, Mike, I'll start, and then you either correct me or add to it based on what you think. Listen, our SCB went up 90 basis points last year. We have no idea why. When we look at the company, when we look at the balance sheet of the company, when we look at the businesses, we're a less risky business today. We have higher margins, higher returns than we had.\nAnd so trying to understand why our SCB went up, just it's illogical. When we look at the scenarios in this CCAR, you've obviously seen them. They're different scenarios, less severe. And so hopefully that produces a different outcome. But who knows? Because we haven't had the kind of transparency that we think is appropriate to wait and see. So we've got to get through CCAR before we actually make any of those determinations.\nLayer on top of that, the comments that we've heard from regulators of their commitment to increase transparency, to re-look at a lot of these things, both from the Fed as well as the administration's desire to look at these things. It appears that we have more aligned regulators across the different. Regulators have to agree on some of these things away from what's just specifically in the Fed's purview.\nI think all of these things align to a better capital environment, which means it gives us more flexibility to serve customers. I said this in my comments. That means make loans, take deposits, provide more liquidity in the markets, which banks are supposed to do.\nBut I think it would be wrong for us to get too specific about what that all looks like and how that determines what we think about buffers until we know what they're actually thinking. But directionally, it's certainly a positive, not just from what was proposed, but hopefully from where we are today.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just related to that last topic, I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're feeling about the pace of buybacks here. We saw you bought back $3.5 billion in the quarter, and you just talked about your CET1 level where it stands now.\nHow are you feeling about the pace of buybacks as you look forward, particularly if we are looking at some softening in the economic backdrop? Does that make you feel any different in terms of how you're approaching the pace of buybacks? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, John. Mike. I'll take a shot at that. Our approach is no different in this environment than it is every quarter since we've been here. We start with what's the opportunity set we have in terms of providing support to clients either through loans or other activity. We go through a series of conversations around risks that are there in the short, medium, and longer term. Then whatever's left sort of goes towards buyback if we think it's appropriate.\nI think we'll go through that same process. We've tried really hard not to get in this game of trying to predict each quarter what we're going to buy back. But I think, as we've said, we've got capacity to do more. It's been a priority for us over the last number of years. We'll continue to go through the same process we go through and see where we end up.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nJust to emphasize what Mike said, just because we each said this, I think, in our remarks, we have a very strong capital position now. We have significant excess capital, and that's been very, very intentional. Well, at the time, we were unsure whether or not capital requirements were going to go up and what was necessary there. That seems to be off the table. Directionally, it looks like it'll go the other way. But we're also in this period of uncertainty.\nSo we have the flexibility, certainly, to continue to buy stock back given the position that we have. We're just going to have to evaluate it throughout the quarter as time goes on. But we'll certainly tell you when there's more to talk about.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And then separately, on credit, on the commercial front, are you seeing any indications of borrowers beginning to draw down lines as a precaution given the economic backdrop and recessionary fears? And then secondly, on the commercial front, I guess this would apply to consumer as well.\nIs there any areas that you're tightening lending standards incrementally now post the tariff announcements and the economic implications where you're looking at things more cautiously and therefore tightening?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Let me take a stab. So on the draws, we're monitoring it really, really closely, both on the commercial banking side and the CIB side. There's been one, I mean, literally one draw that we've actually talked about, and we don't really think it relates to COVID, quite frankly.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nNot to tariffs. But definitely doesn't relate to COVID.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nDefinitely doesn't relate to COVID. We don't think it relates to tariffs. It's just the situation of that company and not something that anyone is worried about. But it just gives you a sense for how actively we're monitoring draw activity. The moment it happens, we're talking about it. There's communication across everything. The second part of the question was, oh, credit tightening actions.\nListen, one of the things, and I referred to this in my remarks, we have made a whole series of tightening actions which have reduced volume. And that's part of the reason why we're seeing such strong credit performance, including on the card side. So we've gone into this environment with what we think are pretty conservative underwriting parameters. We had been having some conversations about whether or not we should reverse some of those.\nSo we'll certainly be slower in terms of our willingness to do that. And we will sit and have a conversation, as you'd expect us to do, of if we really were nervous about how this could affect the consumer, what we should be doing. But we haven't made any decisions at this point. But it's a living, breathing thing, which I hope you'd expect us to do.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. All right. Thank you, Charlie. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I just wanted to follow up on expenses in terms of how much benefit there is still to come from, call it, natural passage of time. You referenced the legacy servicing costs were down significant from the top. But how much more kind of built-in savings are there from things like that, decisions that you've already made and taken that just take time to play out?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I'm not going to quantify it specifically, but as we've said, probably, I don't know, over and over and over in different forums, we still feel like there's a significant amount of opportunity to make the company more efficient. That's in better automating what could be manual processes today. It's continuing to take down excess real estate that we might have, which just takes some time to sort of work through.\nIt's continuing to work on third-party expenses, operating losses, and on and on and on. And I'd say there's really almost no part of the company that we feel is completely optimized at this point. And so we're going to continue to just methodically focus on it. And it's not one or two things. It's hundreds of different activities that are underway at any given point that sort of drive a lot of that efficiency work. And we still have more to do.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd I guess taking a more medium-term outlook, my sense has been those opportunities will allow you to self-fund kind of the rest of your expense base. So conceptually, you're kind of relatively stable on costs as hopefully revenue growth picks up a little bit. Is that still a reasonable framework as you think out over the next several years?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, we're not going to project out into the future. But I think certainly if you look backwards for the last number of years, we've cut $12 billion or 13 billion of expenses and reinvested a significant amount of that back into the businesses. So we'll see, and we'll continue to give a view each year in terms of what it looks like. But as I said, we still feel like we've got opportunity to make the place more efficient. And we'll decide each year how that sort of gets allocated between investments and other stuff.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nHey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to maybe follow up on the auto business. It's obviously not a big part of your total loan book, but the delta on growth has changed a lot. And it's no longer declining as much as it was, and that's helped the overall loan growth trajectory. But curious what your views are from here.\nMy sense is that this business has become more rational in terms of the competitive landscape. But you also mentioned in the prepared remarks that the results were impacted by loan spread compression, and obviously you have tariffs in the background. So just if you can give us an update on what you're thinking for this business, what the outlook is, how you're strategically positioned, and yeah, just any color.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. It's Mike. I'll try to answer that. So again, just maybe I'll start with the last piece on the loan spread compression. What I said in my remarks was that really the bulk of that is driven by the fact that the book has migrated to higher FICO clients over time as we've done a bunch of credit tightening two or three years ago. And I think that served us quite well over the last couple of years.\nAnd you can see the credit performance coming through. And what we've been really focused on now for the better part of a couple of years is two things. One, finding opportunities like the Volkswagen relationship that Charlie referenced before, which is, again, a great way to sort of improve not only the growth, but the return of that business over time.\nAnd then to some degree, becoming a more full-spectrum lender there as we've built out other capabilities to do that in a very methodical, rational way. And so it'll always likely be a relatively small part of the balance sheet. But I do think that you should, over time, see that trough in terms of the balances start to grow some and see better returns over time. Our focus there is not growth at any cost, right?\nAnd we've talked about this over the last couple of years too. We're going to continue to focus on generating solid returns as we sort of grow that business. And so if things get a little irrational at times, we'll pull back and focus in the right places. But I do think you'll start to see over time that those balances to trough grow a little bit and hopefully at better returns.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up on the markets business. Obviously, you're building those out. The equities piece was flat year-on-year. And I know it's a small business at this point. But some of your competitors who reported this morning had reported very big increases year-on-year. Obviously, you've had a lot of engagement and volatility.\nI'm just curious if last year the base was very strong or there was a base effect. But just any color on what drove this. Is it a disappointing result? And just, is there anything in terms of your ability to use balance sheet that is really impairing you from growing in this business? Just any color would be helpful.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, first, the businesses just aren't comparable, right? So if you look at some of another peer or two sort of reported today, the equity businesses are just different, right? And one, they're more global. We're not. Their prime business is massive. We're not. And so those are a couple of the big differences. And you get very different outcomes depending on the environment you're in. We're actually very happy with the way the team has been managing the markets business overall.\nWe've seen this consistent sort of performance now for a while. I'd say some of the equity finance business that is resident within prime is impacted by the asset cap. We don't have the same flexibility to grow that. That's part of what we've been talking about for a while in terms of the opportunity in a post-asset cap world. But so I just think you got to look through a little bit of the differences in the business at this point.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nI just want to pile on just for a second, just to do a shout-out to our markets team run by Dan Thompson and Mike Riley. I mean, these guys have done an amazing job building both our fixed income and our equity business without the luxury of balance sheet. In fact, it's been the opposite.\nThey've gone out of their way to help the rest of the company by giving up balance sheet. And our businesses, albeit from smaller levels, they're stronger. We're spending money on technology. We're taking share. We're building out broader corporate and institutional relationships.\nAnd so the gains that we've seen and the performance we've seen in terms of our trading revenues are being built the right way without being based on taking additional risk. It's building additional customer activity and technology.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nAnalyst, HSBC\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. I know we've run long, so I just had one follow-up question. Mike, just going back to Steve's question, I think on the previous call, you talked about a net interest income trajectory that was flatish in the first half of the year and then sort of ramped in the second half.\nI'm wondering, number one, if that's still your expectation, and perhaps help us frame maybe the impact of the swing in trading NII to this quarter's NII print. And additionally, what impact should the securities repositioning have on your margin as we think about a go-forward basis?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Well, the incremental repositioning we did is relatively small. And the pickup is pretty similar to what we did in terms of yield that we quantified for the stuff we did late last year. So probably pretty easy to model, but pretty small overall.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nCan I just interrupt for a second? Just we don't make those decisions because of guidance. We make those decisions based upon what we think is smart economically to do in the investment portfolio relative to where rates are.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. For sure. And look, the expectation is still pretty similar to what we talked about, right? It hasn't changed much. So kind of flatish with more loan growth in the second half of the year. And then obviously, rates and the other factors will sort of drive the ultimate outcome. And then we haven't really provided a lot of detail on trading NII, Erika.\nAnd I think given how volatile rates are right now, that would probably be a little bit of a mistake for us to do just given it moves around quite a bit. And just keep in mind that whatever trading NII is either up or down, there's likely an offset in fee revenue. So a lot of it's revenue neutral.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Charlie, I hear your message loud and clear. Just wanted to flag that I'm sure that the investor base will look through some of these questions on NII given everything that you guys laid out on your return trajectory going forward. But thank you for the color, Mike.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. I totally understand, Erika.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Charlie, you said in your prepared remarks how you're going to be reducing the reliance on net interest income. Can you remind us, and I'm not suggesting or asking when you think the asset cap's going to be released, but when that happens, what's the optimal mix that you think you guys can get to between net interest income and non-interest income or fee revenues? And then what's the main driver of that fee revenue line?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, we've not gone there yet to say exactly where we think each have to get to because, to the point, until the asset cap is lifted, we really don't want to be talking about what the implication of that can be other than in general terms, which we've tried to do. But listen, when we think about the things that we're doing in building the fee-oriented businesses, it's the things that we're doing.\nI referred to these earlier. It's what we're doing in the card business. It's what's happening in the wealth business. It's our advisory, our underwriting businesses, both through larger companies as well as middle-market companies, and our payments-related businesses.\nAnd those are smart things to do strategically, regardless of whether we have the asset cap or not, and make us a more attractive provider of services for our customers. And so that's the reason to do it predominantly. It builds a more diverse and hopefully more valuable revenue stream for the company. But ultimately, I think your point is right. We'll have the continued opportunity to grow both fee businesses as well as NII with more degrees of latitude on NII without an asset cap.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. And then, Mike, I know you touched on credit quality throughout the call. And in terms of your focus going forward on the C&I loan portfolio, are there specific categories within the C&I loan portfolio that you guys are ensuring that you're checking maybe more rigorously today than 12 months ago just as a potential weakness could develop in a slower economy?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWe're looking at the whole portfolio, Gerard, as we always do. And it's something we've got a really long-standing great credit discipline across the company. And it's something I think the team does really well. And it's a focus for all of us. And you can't pick and choose. You got to really look at the whole thing.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate the call. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you."

Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, John. Let me start by acknowledging the unbelievable devastation from the Los Angeles wildfires. Our hearts go out to everyone who's been affected, and we're committed to helping rebuild their lives, businesses, communities. I also want to thank our employees who are working hard to support our customers, many of whom who have been impacted themselves. Turning to Wells Fargo's performance, I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2025.\nBefore we take your questions, let me start with some general comments. Our solid performance this quarter caps a year of significant progress for Wells Fargo across multiple areas. Our earnings profile continues to improve.\nWe are seeing the benefit from investments we're making to increase growth and improve how we serve our customers and communities. We maintained a strong balance sheet, returned $25 billion capital to shareholders, and made significant progress on our risk and control work. We grew net income, and our diluted earnings per share was up 11% from a year ago. After I arrived, we reviewed our businesses and sold or scaled back several, which reduced revenues in the shorter term and increased investments in others.\nWe also made a conscious effort to diversify revenues and reduce our reliance on net interest income in 2024. Our strong fee-based revenue growth of 15% from a year ago largely offset the expected decline in net interest income. Reflecting these efforts, our disciplined approach to managing expense levels has been consistent and an important part of our success.\nWe increased investments in areas that are important for our future and generated efficiencies to help fund those opportunities. Overall expenses declined from a year ago, benefiting from lower FDIC and severance expenses as well as the impact of our efficiency initiatives which have helped drive headcount reductions every quarter since Q3 2020. We maintained our strong credit discipline and credit performance was relatively stable throughout the year and consistent with our expectations. Average loans declined throughout the year.\nAs growth in credit card balances was offset by declines in most other asset classes reflecting weak loan demand as well as credit tightening actions. Average deposits grew from Q4 2023 with growth in our deposit gathering businesses enabling us to reduce higher cost CDs issued by corporate treasury. We've been actively returning excess capital over the past five years and that has resulted in average common shares outstanding decreasing by 21% since Q4 2019. This year we increased our common stock dividend per share by 15% and repurchased approximately $20 billion of common stock, up 64% from a year ago.\nRegarding our strategic priorities, I'm very proud of the progress we've made on our risk and control work, and it remains our top priority, and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. Early last year, the OCC terminated consent order it issued in 2016 regarding sales practices. The closure of this order was an important milestone, and was confirmation that we operate much differently today. This was the sixth consent order terminated by our regulators since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Our operational risk and compliance infrastructure is greatly changed from when I arrived, and while we are not done, I'm confident that we will successfully complete the work required in our consent orders and embed an operational risk and compliance mindset into our culture. Our results also show our progress on the other strategic priorities that we have.\nImproving our credit card platform is an important strategic objective, and our progress here is clear. Since 2021, we have rolled out a total of 11 new cards, including four new consumer cards and a new small business card in 2024. Our new product offerings continue to be well received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells Fargo. With over 2.4 million new credit card accounts opened in 2024, we've done this while maintaining our credit standards. The momentum in this business is also demonstrated by strong credit card spend up over $17 billion from a year ago. In our auto business, we announced a multi-year co-branded agreement where we will be the preferred purchase finance provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands in the United States starting in the first half of this year.\nWe continue to reposition our home lending business as we execute on the strategic direction we announced in early 2023. We've reduced headcount by 47% and the amount of third-party mortgage loan service by 28% since the announcement. As we continue to streamline this business, the business is more profitable today and opportunities remain to improve after several years of little to no growth. As we focused on satisfying the requirements of our consent orders, we are starting to generate growth and increased customer engagement in our consumer, small, and business banking segment. We had a more meaningful growth in net checking accounts in 2024 and importantly most of that growth came in the form of more valuable primary checking accounts. We had over 10 billion debit card transactions last year, up 2% from a year ago, the highest annual volume in our history.\nWe accelerated our efforts to refurbish our branches, including 730 in 2024. We continued to make enhancements to our mobile app, including making it significantly easier to open accounts, and in Q4, over 40% of consumer checking accounts were open digitally. We grew mobile active customers by 1.5 million in 2024, up 5% from a year ago. Our customers are also increasingly using Zelle, and we had over 1 billion Zelle transactions in 2024, up 22% from a year ago. We introduced Wells Fargo Premier to better serve our affluent clients.\nWe're starting to see some early benefits from the enhancements we've made. We increased the number of premier bankers by 8% and branch-based financial advisors by 5% from a year ago. We focus with a focus on increasing the number of bankers and advisors in top locations. We have enhanced our customer relationship management capabilities for our bankers and advisors. This has increased collaboration, driving $23 billion in net asset flows into Wealth and Investment Management Premier channel last year.\nDeposit and investment balances for Premier clients grew steadily throughout the year and increased approximately 10% from a year ago. This remains a significant area of opportunity for us, turning to our commercial business. In the commercial bank, we're focused on adding relationship managers and business development officers in underpenetrated and growth markets to drive new client acquisition, future revenue growth, and we expect to hire even more in 2025. We created a strategic partnership with Centerbridge Partners and introduced Overland Advisors to better service our commercial bank customers with a direct lending product. We have targeted our investment banking capabilities towards our Commercial Banking clients.\nWe're still early in these efforts, but we're starting to see results including our investment banking market share with our Commercial Banking clients increasing by approximately 150 basis points in 2024, which includes helping some clients access capital markets for the first time. Additionally, we've been working closely with our clients to support their M&A activity, driving higher M&A-related revenue. The opportunity remains significant.\nWe continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen corporate investment banking. More than 75 new hires joined CIB since 2019 with many of these in key coverage and product groups within trading and banking. Our revenue and share in many important areas is increasing including in our markets business where we've grown our US market share including in credit, trading, commodities, and our equity, cash, and derivatives business. We also continue to make steady progress in growing our FX business with strong growth in both our institutional client base and volumes. In 2024, we also grew our US market share in investment banking with share gains in debt and equity capital markets and increased revenue in our advisory business in 2024.\nWe enter 2025 with solid pipeline in both capital markets and advisory. While the market conditions can always change, I feel great about our progress and continue to believe we're just beginning to see the benefits of our investments. We've also continued to exit or sell businesses that are not in sync with our strategic priorities. Last year we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third-party servicing segment for our commercial mortgage servicing business.\nMore broadly, the US economy has performed very well and remains strong, and lower inflation and unemployment position the economy well into 2025. We are predominantly a US bank. We succeed when the country succeeds. The incoming administration's support of US businesses and consumers gives us optimism as we look forward.\nAdditionally, the incoming administration has signaled a more business friendly approach to policies and regulation which should benefit the economy and our clients. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2025, but as we start the new year, I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities we have to drive higher returns across our businesses by growing revenue and managing expenses. I'm proud of the progress we made in 2024. I want to conclude by thanking everyone who works at Wells Fargo for their hard work for what they do every single day to support our customers, clients, and communities. I'm excited about the momentum we're building and all that we can accomplish together in 2025. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you Charlie and good morning everyone. We had solid results in the fourth quarter, including net income of $5.1 billion or $1.43 for diluted common share. Underlying business performance was strong compared to a year ago. We grew fee income across most categories, maintained our expense and credit discipline, and grew customer accounts and activity level. We benefited from the investments that Charlie highlighted. We also grew net interest income from the third quarter.\nOur fourth quarter results included $863 million or $0.26 per share of discrete tax benefits related to resolution of prior period matters. This benefit was largely offset by $647 million or $0.15 per share of severance expense and $448 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities as we took the opportunity to further reposition a portion of the investment portfolio. This included the sale of approximately $8 billion of securities which we reinvested into higher yielding securities. The estimated payback period for this repositioning is approximately two and a half years.\nTurning to slide four, net interest income grew $146 million or 1% from the third quarter, the first linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter 2022. The increase was driven by higher customer deposit balances, which enabled us to continue to reduce higher cost market funding. Moving to slide five, average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago. Period end balances grew 3 billion from the third quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans and credit card loans more than offsetting declines in most other categories.\nAverage deposits increased both from Q3 and a year ago with growth in our customer deposits enabling us to reduce higher cost corporate treasury deposits. Average deposit cost declined 18 basis points from Q3 as deposit costs stabilized or declined across all of our deposit gathering businesses. In response to the Federal Reserve rate cuts, we have reduced standard pricing for commercial clients as well as pricing for promotional deposit officers, offers, and CDs in our consumer businesses. Lower deposit costs also reflected the slowdown of customer migration to higher yielding deposits. Additionally, lower cost consumer deposit balances and checking and savings accounts have continued to stabilize.\nTurning to slide six, we had strong growth in noninterest income up 11% from a year ago, benefiting from the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as market conditions. This growth was diversified with each of our operating segments generating growth from a year ago. I'll highlight the specific drivers of noninterest income when discussing our operating segment results. Turning to expenses on slide seven, noninterest expense declined 12% from a year ago driven by the lower FDIC special assessment. Excluding this assessment, expenses were relatively stable as lower severance expenses and the impact of our efficiency initiatives was largely offset by higher revenue-related compensation, predominantly in wealth and investment management as well as higher technology and equipment expense.\nTurning to credit quality on slide eight, credit performance has been relatively stable with our net loan charge-off ratio the same as a year ago and up four basis points from Q3. Commercial net loan charge-offs increased $80 million from Q3 to 30 basis points of average loans driven by the commercial real estate office portfolio. Commercial real estate office fundamentals have not changed and remain weak. We still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients.\nConsumer net loan charge-offs increased $20 million from Q3 to 85 basis points of average loans, driven by higher losses in the credit card portfolio which was consistent with our expectations. Non-performing assets declined 5% from Q3, driven by a $390 million decline in commercial real estate office non-accrual loans, which includes pay downs and net loan charge-offs.\nMoving to slide nine, our allowance for credit losses from loans was down $103 million from Q3, with modest declines across most asset classes, partially offset by an increase in allowance for credit card loans driven by higher loan balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past five quarters as credit trends have remained fairly consistent. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking commercial real estate office portfolio increased 12% as loan balances continued to decline and allowance levels were relatively stable.\nTurning to capital liquidity on slide 10, our capital position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 11.1% continued to be well above our CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8%. We repurchased $4 billion of common stock in the fourth quarter and approximately $20 billion for the year, reducing common shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11. Consumer, Small, and Business Banking revenue declined 7% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. However, the pace of the migration continues to slow. Lending revenue grew 2% from a year ago, driven by higher mortgage banking fees. Credit card revenue grew 3% from a year ago as loan balances increased and card fees grew from a higher point-of-sale volume.\nWe continue to be pleased with the performance of new products that we've launched over the last three and a half years, with credit performing as expected and strong growth in new accounts and usage. Auto revenue decreased 21% from a year ago driven by lower loan balances reflecting previous credit tightening actions and continued loan spread compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago is also driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression.\nTurning to some key business drivers on slide 12, retail mortgage originations increased 31% from a year ago with higher purchase volume as well as stronger refinance volume early in the quarter when interest rates were lower. Debit card spending was strong in the fourth quarter and increased $4.9 billion or 4% from a year ago and credit card spending was up 9% from a year ago with growth in all categories except fuel.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on slide 13. Middle market banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago driven by lower net interest income reflecting higher deposit costs partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset based lending and leasing revenue decreased 12% from a year ago driven by lower net interest income and lease income partially offset by improved results from our equity investments. Average loan balances in Q4 were down 1% compared with a year ago as growth in middle market banking was more than offset by lower balances in asset based lending. While our commercial clients are generally more optimistic, we did not see a meaningful change in loan demand in Q4 as many clients remained cautious.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 14, banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. This decline was partially offset by higher investment banking revenue from increased activity in equity and debt capital markets as well as higher advisory fees. Commercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a year ago reflecting the impact of lower loan balances partially offset by higher capital markets revenue from higher volumes in commercial mortgage-backed securities, real estate, loan syndications, and multifamily capital as market sentiment improved. Markets revenue was down 5% from a year ago driven by lower revenues in equities and municipals partially offset by stronger performance in most other products, Fixed Income products.\nOur fourth quarter results reflected the implementation of a change to incorporate funding valuation adjustments for our derivatives which resulted in a loss of $85 million. The decline from the third quarter was also driven by seasonally lower trading activity across most asset classes. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by continued reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio, driven by office, as well as lower loan balances in banking, as clients continue to access the capital markets for funding.\nOn slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 8% compared with a year ago due to higher asset-based fees driven by increased market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so first quarter results will reflect market valuations as of 1 January, which were up from both a year ago and from 1 October. Average deposits increased by 16% and average loans grew by 2% from a year ago, which have both benefited from product enhancements and pricing improvements that provide value to our clients. The growth in deposits also reflected the slowdown in migration to cash alternatives with balances in those products lower than a year ago.\nSlide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago driven by improved results from our venture capital investments. After having impairments on these investments for the past two years, we had net gains every quarter in 2024 with improved performance in the second half of the year.\nNow turning to our outlook on slide 17, I'll go into more detail on our 2025 expectations for net interest income and noninterest expense in the next few slides. But first I want to highlight the progress we've made in improving our returns. When we first started discussing the outlook for our returns in Q4 2020, we had an 8% ROTCE. Over the past four years, we have been successfully executing on our efficiency initiatives, diversifying our sources of revenue by investing in our businesses to better serve our customers, drive growth, and return excess capital to shareholders. These actions helped to improve our ROTCE to 13.4% in 2024. We still believe we have an achievable path to a sustainable ROTCE of 15% as we continue to make progress on transforming the company, including the priorities highlighted earlier on the call.\nOn slide 18, we provide our expectations for net interest income for 2025. We had $47.7 billion of net interest income in 2024, which was within the expected range we provided at the start of last year. Net interest income declined sequentially for the first three quarters of the year before growing modestly in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter annualized net interest income is $47 billion or approximately $700 million lower than full year 2024.\nOur current expectations is that full year 2025 net interest income will be approximately 1% to 3 higher than full year 2024 or approximately 3% to 5 higher than annualized Q4 2024 net interest income. We expect net interest income will be relatively stable in H1 2025, which includes the impact from two fewer days in Q1, with more growth in H2 2025. Underpinning our expectations are a series of key assumptions, including using the recent forward rate curve, which includes between one and two Federal Reserve rate cuts. Given our modestly asset-sensitive position, this would be a slight headwind to net interest income.\nAverage loans are expected to grow modestly from Q4 2024 to Q4 2025 driven by anticipated growth in the Corporate and Investment Banking markets group and GIB banking, as well as anticipated growth in our auto and credit card portfolios. Deposits in all our deposit gathering businesses are expected to grow modestly, which would allow us to further reduce higher-cost market funding reinvestment of lower-yielding securities into higher-yielding assets. Our expectation also reflects the benefit from the actions we took in the second half 2024 to reposition the investment portfolio, and trading-related net interest income is expected to be higher due to lower interest rates, which would largely be offset by lower trading-related non-interest income as we've done in prior years. For the purposes of estimating net interest income, we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2025 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing, and loan demand.\nNow turning to our 2025 expense expectations on slide 19. Following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported $54.6 billion of noninterest expense in 2024, which included $647 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter that was not contemplated in our guidance. Our 2025 expense expectation includes operating losses of approximately $1.1 billion, which is approximately $700 million lower than operating losses in 2024. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $500 million lower in 2025. Given the expense pool we took in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect Wealth and Investment Management revenue-related expenses to increase by approximately $600 million in 2025.\nAs a reminder, this is a good thing, as these higher expenses are more than offset by higher noninterest income. Actual revenue-related expenses will be a function of market levels, with the biggest driver being the equity markets. Our outlook assumes the S&P 500 will be up modestly at current levels, but clearly the ultimate performance of the markets is uncertain.\nWe expect all other expenses to be up approximately $200 million, with the impact of efficiency initiatives more than offset by higher investments and other expenses. We expect approximately $2.4 billion of gross expense reductions in 2025 due to efficiency initiatives. We've successfully delivered on more than $12 billion of gross expense saves since we started focusing on efficiency initiatives four years ago and we continue to believe we have opportunities to get more efficient across the company. Keep in mind, however, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives.\nThere are three primary areas where we're expected to invest. First, we expect approximately $900 million of incremental technology expense, including investments in infrastructure business capabilities. Second, we expect approximately $900 million of incremental other investments, including the specific areas we highlight on the next slide.\nFinally, we expect other expenses to increase by approximately $800 million, including expected merit increases in performance-based discretionary compensation. As a reminder, the first quarter has seasonally higher personnel expenses which are expected to be $650 to 700 million. Putting this all together, we expect 2025 noninterest expense to be approximately $54.2 billion.\nOn slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for the investments which are critical to better serving our customers and generating growth. Let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority and we will continue to invest in this important work. We continue to invest in technology and digital platforms to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers. This includes continuing the transition of our applications to the cloud, migrating into new data centers, and investing in data platforms to drive more insights. We are continuing to upgrade our core lending capabilities, including improvements to our fulfillment and servicing systems, enhancing credit decisioning, and strengthening fraud capabilities.\nTo drive customer growth in the consumer businesses. We plan to continue scaling our marketing efforts, modernizing our branch footprint, and increasing the number of premier bankers and financial advisors. We are also focused on onboarding more independent advisors as we continue building out our independent brokerage channel. In addition, we continue to improve our digital capabilities for our customers, specifically our mobile account opening and onboarding, as well as Zelle. We plan to continue hiring in priority sectors to help drive growth in investment banking capital markets. We also plan to continue hiring relationship bankers within Commercial Banking to build out coverage in underpenetrated markets and key industries.\nIn summary, our results in 2024 demonstrated the continued progress we've been making to improve our financial performance. We generated strong fee-based revenue growth, reduced our expenses, maintained strong credit discipline, increased capital returns to shareholders, and retained our strong capital position. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made so far. I'm excited about the additional opportunities we have to continue to drive improved performance. We will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please first unmute your phone and then press star one. Please record your name at the prompt. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star two to remove yourself from the question queue. Once again, please press star one and record your name. If you would like to ask a question at this time, please stand by for our first question.\nOur first question comes from John McDonald of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good morning guys. John, Mike, I was hoping you could unpack the deposit expectations embedded in slide 18 and the NII outlook. You talked about stabilization of retail volumes and mix, just kind of wanted to get a little more detail about what you're assuming for retail deposit growth, mix, and how that plays into the pay down of higher cost borrowings throughout the year in your plan.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, sure. Thanks John. Welcome back, and welcome to your new seat. I think as we've sort of talked about now, I guess for the last three or four quarters we've been seeing less and less migration out of non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. You got to look through some of the product consolidations we did in the third quarter. There's some noise there that we talked about last quarter. But so we've seen continued sort of stabilization of the mix between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing. And so that, that's sort of helpful as you go into this year and we expect that to continue.\nAs we look forward and then start to see absolute growth across the consumer franchise. As you know, in the interest bearing products and the consumer side, pricing hasn't really moved much through the cycle, and so you're not seeing standard pricing change much, but you are seeing the price, promotional savings, and CD rates continue to come down over the last 90, 120 days as rates have started to move. And so we would expect that mix to stabilize. We expect some absolute growth, and we don't expect pricing pressure to come through on the consumer side.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. And then just wanted to shift gears and ask about credit card profitability. When you're in growth mode, credit card experiences a drag from accounting on the upfront acquisition costs and provision. Where are you on card profitability now? Is that an upside driver to ROE as more of the balances roll off teasers and some of that upfront expense wanes?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, certainly is. I think as you look backwards a little bit, we started launching the new products three and a half years ago. The first of the vintages came on starting in July, August a few years ago. And so we're just starting to kind of see those earliest vintages mature and become more profitable. We're still early days in terms of seeing that profitability really come through in the P&L. I'd say, obviously the factors you got to think about as you sort of look through that is the credit box and the credit performance.\nThat's all behaving right on top of what we would have modeled. We're not seeing any concerns flow through from what we modeled across all of the different new products. We're seeing, as Charlie highlighted in his script, we're seeing good new account growth continue.\nAcross the different products there. And so it's just a matter of time for that to really sort of more meaningfully come into the P&L. It really hasn't contributed much at all yet, as you sort of look at it, but it'll start to come through over the next year or two.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd John, this is Charlie. The only thing I would add, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but the two places that we think of is where we've already taken actions and it's just execution now which will improve profitability. One is card, as you point out, and the second I referenced is we're still not at the level of profitability where we should be in home lending, just given as we continue to wind down that servicing book. And so we think those two things will be helpful for us as we look forward.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawalla of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess I just wanted to go back, maybe Charlie, to something you talked about back in December on the back of the lifting of the OCC consent order. As we think about just the ROE trajectory for the bank, it'll be useful if you can maybe give some tangible examples of things that you've been able to do post the lifting of that consent order. In terms of incenting branch employees and where in the balance sheet or in the P&L, we should expect that to show up maybe as early as 2025.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, Ibrahim, it's Mike. Maybe I'll start and Charlie can chime in if he wants to add. I think what you're referencing, just to make sure everyone's clear, is the sales practices consent order that got lifted last February as part of the work we had to do. When that came on, we dialed back. Much of what you would expect to see in the branch system around incentive plans. Sales goals and the like. To make sure that we rebuilt the control framework and all of the things that we would do there in a way that would make sure that the problems of the past don't reoccur.\nAnd so as we saw that consent order go away, we've been able to more fully roll out a standard sort of incentive framework across the branches. We had been piloting it for a while in a small subset, and as you would expect, you would see different performance and better performance in those pilot branches. That's across new checking, growth, credit card accounts, and the like. And so we're still in the early days to see the benefits of that system be put in place because it got rolled out, as you know, throughout 2024. We would expect to kind of see the results start to come through more meaningfully over the near term, medium term,\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO and President, Wells Fargo\n\nMaybe just a little more color to what Mike said. You know, I think again, if you think back, that was, you know, it was hugely important that, you know, that we satisfied the obligations that existed in that consent order and that we were comfortable with the control environment that existed. And so, you know, we took away, as Mike said, a whole series of things. It's not just one thing. It was, you know, compensation, it's reporting goals. Just the whole way we managed the system as we were building out everything that would make us, and our regulators, comfortable as we managed the system in the future, similar to the way other people managed their system, that if something, if someone were to be doing something that wasn't appropriate, that we had the right controls and reporting in place to catch it.\nIt took a long time to build that out. But to have the confidence that we could add back a lot of these management mechanisms that you have in place. And so no one individual thing is earth shattering. But when you take compensation, when you take reporting, when you take management routines, when you take all those things and put them together.\nAt the same time, you're monitoring all the controls that you've built. That's what gives us the confidence to go forward, you know, with the system that we think can, you know, attract more customers and do more with our existing customers, but within a, you know, a very tightly controlled framework that we feel comfortable relative to how we manage the risk. That's there.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you, [inaudible].\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nI'd say Charlie and a lot of other folks here have seen this before and we're confident we're going to get the results we think out of that.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. Charlie, thanks for that and I guess just maybe following up. Thanks Mike, for running through the expense investment priorities. As we think about the severance charge in the fourth quarter and runway to extract additional efficiencies relative to your $54.2 billion expense guide, how should we think about like are we getting to a point where some of the low-hanging fruit is done and expenses generally move higher given the investments and we should at least anticipate positive operating leverage on the way forward or do you still see opportunities to meaningfully cut costs, make things more efficient, especially in the consumer bank?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, I think, Ebrahim, as we sort of look at what you see there and what we're doing in 2025, it's no different than the thinking is, no different, different than it's been now for the last four or five years that we've both been here. I think as you look at the company, we still feel like there's a significant amount of opportunity to drive efficiency, and that's what you see in 2025. I know we've used this analogy a lot, but it is just like peeling an onion. As you sort of look at the next layer down, you find more efficiency, you bring better technology, you bring breadth to automation, which by the way saves us money but also in a lot of cases improves the client experience for our customers. We, you know, as we come in, you know, every day, we still think about it the same way that we've been thinking about it for a while. That's what you see in the expectations for this year.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nMorning. On the NII outlook. I know you said it includes modest loan growth expectation for 2025. I just want to see if you can elaborate a little bit on how we could think about that in terms of level and trajectory. Should it be near GDP or how should we think about that? And then, can you, in addition to maybe sizing up the most likely drivers, also give us a little bit of color on the pace of expected incremental runoff of balances as we look at the growth outlook? Thanks.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, maybe I'll start on the loan side. As I said in my commentary, like we're expecting to see a little bit more of it as we get to the middle and second half of next year. We may see a little bit in the first half, but it's not be more meaningful as we go later in the year. You know, I would think of it as like low to mid single digits, depending on the category of loans. But obviously some of that will be dependent upon the overall backdrop that we're in. As you look at the consumer side of the picture, mortgages will likely continue to decline a little bit given sort of the rate environment we're in.\nWe did see a little bit of incremental refinance activity in the fourth quarter, but now with rates back up, that seems to be back down again. We should see some card growth as we go through the year, and we should start to see some growth in the auto portfolio as well. On the commercial side, some of it will be new account growth, new client growth. As we go through the year, we've been adding bankers across different categories.\nWe do expect to see some growth in the markets business as well. That drives some loan growth. And so it should come from a lot of, you know, a little bit from a lot of different areas across the population. But I would expect to see that a little bit more as we go into middle and second half of the year.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. And then separately on capital, 11.1% CET1, pretty solid. You still bought back about $4 billion this quarter. How should we think about buyback appetite? As you look at 2025, assuming that you do see some improvement in organic growth opportunities, how could that influence your pace of buyback?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, I mean, look, it's the standard sort of waterfall of decision making that goes into it. Right. If we've got good organic growth opportunities across loans and other categories to serve customers, that's always first. We still have the asset cap in place. So there's some limits to that.\nWe'll look at all the different risks that are out there across the different categories of items that we got to be concerned about, and then buybacks will kind of be the rest. Given we've got the asset cap and given we've got limited organic growth depending on the quarter you're in, I think you'll see us continue to return capital back to shareholders like we've done now for the last number of years. At this point, we don't believe we need to be higher than where we are from a CET1 percentage. And so, we'll manage that based on those opportunities and those decisions that we talked about.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. Clearly, the way the stock has reacted, you know, the message from your shareholders has been, you know, an embrace of Wells Fargo is more than a remediation story. You know, thinking about the, you know, return improvement even beyond the asset cap resolution and the consent order. I guess to that end, Charlie and Mike, you have a medium-term ROTCE target of 15%. In 2024, you generated almost 13.5%.\nBy your own commentary, you still have places like card and home lending where your profitability should improve. From here, you're carrying excess capital, you're under the asset cap. Obviously, you're making great efforts in CIB in terms of really using your balance sheet to generate even more fees, and off of your relationships as well. As we think about that 15%, especially in the context of you have one money center that has to hold more capital than you, that has a 17% target, and another money center that has to hold more capital than you and has a 15% target, I guess I'm wondering if your shareholders are thinking about fully realized Wells beyond the remediation story. What is the true natural return of this business?\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, let me. Eric, thanks for that. I think, I guess what we would.\nWell, let me just repeat what we've said in the past, right. Which is when we look at our businesses, we look at each one individually, and we compare ourselves to the best people out there in terms of performance. It's both returns and growth that we look at because, again, other than our home lending business, and I would say the auto business generally, we do expect that our businesses, given the quality, should be growing at rates commensurate with some of the best out there, in addition to.\nHaving some of the strongest returns. You know, when you compare us to other people, you've got to look at the mix of business, you've got to look at the size of our different businesses versus others. When we think about where we ultimately, what our aspirations are, you know, it is based upon where the others are by business and what our business mix looks like relative to how we think about our own targets and what the timing is. I guess we would just say, you know, we got to think about it one step at a time and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We've said we want to get to 15% and we're close, but we're not there. We want to achieve that for sure.\nWe have to get out of these orders that we still have that do constrain us. There's a point at which we've said that not just yourself, but we too will address where we think we go from the 15%. In due time.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nBetsy, are you there?\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSorry. Hi, good morning. Thank you. Two questions. One, just to follow up on the last question that Erika asked on the drivers. We're in the last mile, so congratulations, you're in the last mile to the 15%. Are you thinking about that last mile as being driven by revenue growth happening faster in the businesses that have the higher returns, or are there still expenses to be cut out such that the expense ratio and the expense focus is what's going to drive that?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, Betsy, it's Mike. I'll start. I'll go back to what we said at some point last year in reference point, but obviously there's multiple paths to get there depending on sort of the environment and what happens. If you look at where we were talking about earlier in the call, you have the credit card business, you have the home lending business. As those two things get to sort of more mature, mature return profile in the card business, and we get to sort of the profitability improvement we want to see in home lending, you can make your own assumptions, but those two things alone probably get you pretty darn close. You can then look at growth we're getting in the investment bank, in capital markets, in wealth, and so there's lots of different combinations that get you there.\nThat's why we feel very confident that we'll get to that 15%. You know, reasonable people can have different opinions on exactly, you know, what gets you there first. I think there's multiple paths to get there.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nLet me just add to that, which is good, Betsy, for a second, if I can. If you just look at, you know, what we've said for next year, right, we've, you know, we've given you an expense number in terms of what our expectations are, which are pretty close to what they are this year. We've given you our NII guidance, which is also, you know, up from the prior year. Make your own assumptions on credit and fee income, and you'll get a sense for, you know, what we, you know, to your question of if it's expenses or revenues, how we think we're going to get there, I mean, you know, in terms of, you know, what those dynamics look like.\nThe one thing I just do want to say though, when we think about returns, I think we feel really great about the prospects here. As I said, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We've been very, very careful.\nTo make sure that we've got the latitude to spend whatever it is we need on all of the risk and operational things. That's still the case. Even though we feel great about the progress, and I've tried to, you know, give an indication of how we feel about that, we have to maintain that flexibility because that is the, you know, that is a gating factor in the top priority. The second thing is, you know, we've been very careful not to provide multi-year guidance for expenses. That's because as we continue to peel this onion back, we find opportunities. We've tried to also lay out in the presentation the point that we're not just reducing expenses and funding inflationary increases across the place, we're increasing the level of investment in technology and other things.\nAs we look towards the success that we have in different parts of the company as we invest, as we see the positive results, we want the ability to make those decisions at each point in time as to how much more we want to invest. Yes, if we didn't increase the level of investment or if we kind of capped that out, you could sit here and say, yes, lots of things, margins would continue to expand, returns would expand, you could get to some pretty significant numbers. You know, we're building the company for the future and as long as we see the payoffs there, we want the latitude to do that. We're very conscious of what our investors expect from us. We're very conscious of what we think the franchise can produce.\nWe do intend to build both a higher returning and a higher growth franchise. You're just starting to see that and how that plays out from a timing perspective. That's what, you know, we're trying hard not to get boxed in on.\n\nBetsy Graseck",
    "content2": "Managing Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nTotally get it. It does feel like there's a bit of a shift at the margin to rev led profitability growth, in my opinion, which is great. A lot of low hanging fruit is already out on the expense side. Just lastly on credit card, I understand, get it more mature. There was the announcement during the quarter, I believe, that Ray Fischer is stepping down. Could you help us understand what drove that?\nDecisioning and new, yeah, and new management and what I assume it's going to be the same goals and everything. If we could just have a few thoughts on that whole situation. Thank you.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. You know, listen, Ray, I've known Ray a long time. We've worked together for many, many years. When I came to Wells, literally, I think it was the first or second day I was at Wells, the person who was running the card business told me that they had already accepted another job outside the company.\nThat had nothing, you know, I wasn't a part of that change. That was a decision that was made. I asked Ray to join us, and he's done a fabulous job. Ray, I think, I don't know his exact age.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nI want to say we can give away his exact age, but he's old enough to deserve to retire.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, very well, thank you. Very well put. He's done a great job, and this is a very natural progression, something that we've talked about relative to his timing and what his expectations are.\nWe've got a great team in place, you know, that he's built out. We've recruited a great leader from outside the company, Ed Olebe, who joins us, I believe, sometime in February. The strategy is the same. Nothing's going to change. We've had lots of conversations about what we're doing and what the opportunities are. I think Ed's super excited about both what we've done, but continuing to execute along the lines that we've laid out for you all.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. You'll announce the new head when the time's appropriate. Right. Thank you.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWe have already. We have Betsy, John will send you the press release.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Thank you. Sorry about that.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nI think we sent it out, to be fair. We sent it out internally, and then there was an article this past week pointing that.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat picked it up. Okay. All right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Obviously, rate volatility is quite high here. How do we think about the rate tentativity to your net interest income if rates end up being a little bit higher? Obviously, it seems like a structurally good, but help frame some of the sensitivity to the guidance that you put out there from changes in rates. Thanks.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, Matt. Obviously we'll update the sensitivity in the Q or the K, I guess, when you get it. We're still marginally asset sensitive, as I said in my script. The balance sheet has sort of naturally gotten less sensitive, you know, over the last number of quarters. Rates coming down is, as I said in the guidance, a slight headwind to sort of our estimates.\nIf they hold a little bit higher than what was in the forwards, then I think that will be a slight positive. You know, obviously we're a little less. We've become less rate sensitive over the last number of quarters, but it's still a little bit asset sensitive.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Just on trading, obviously you guys have been executing really well for a few years now. I don't want to make too much of just one quarter. Even if we strip out the fair value adjustment, the trading was still down year over year. Obviously the peers are kind of implying up, I don't know, 15%, 20% plus. Just maybe talk a bit about was there anything unusual this quarter that weaker trading. I appreciate last year was a strong quarter, but it did jump out.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, it was really about last year being a strong quarter, this year being a weak quarter. Nothing's changed. There's nothing abnormal underneath the surface. Nothing's changed in sort of our approach there. Obviously, the businesses are quite different when you look at peers. I do think you have to look through the results a little bit given the global nature, and maybe the risk that some of the others take.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, actually just on the last point, obviously we know you're more domestic, but your comment that others might take more risk, how do you think you're being more conservative in trading?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, I just said you have to look at the risk they're taking. I'm not suggesting that. I'm not going to. I'm not trying to say anybody's taking more risk or not, but when you look at our business, we've been very, very disciplined about sort of the risk appetite that we have across the trading businesses. Much of the focus has been in places that are balance sheet friendly, like FX, given the asset cap and other areas.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nWhat we're saying is just that the size of our business is materially smaller than the biggest folks out there. The complexity of the products is very, very different, both because of the global nature, but also some of the things we do. We just have a smaller, less complex business.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Long\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGood morning, everyone. As it relates to auto, this seems like a bit of a strategic shift. After three years of seeing that portfolio decline, what are you seeing in that business that is increasing your appetite to grow it here forward?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, I wouldn't position it as a strategic shift, but a couple years ago now we took some tightening actions based on credit tightening act. There were two things going on. We took some credit tightening actions based on what we were seeing as what was happening in the market, and that had an impact on originations. We also saw some pretty significant spread compression at different points over the last couple years. Our focus is not to be big. Our focus is to have a good returning, sort of profitable business there.\nWe backed away in certain areas. I think over time that sort of starts to evolve and change, and spreads, we still, spreads are a little bit better than they were a couple years ago in some pockets. That's part of it. Second, Charlie highlighted it as well.\nWe are continuing to invest in the auto business. We've been continuing to build out better capabilities to be a little bit more of a full spectrum lender across different pockets. That's a very small piece of what you're seeing in there. Obviously, the deal we signed with Volkswagen and Audi hasn't had any impact at this point. That'll start to have a small impact as we get later in the year. It's still relatively, still relatively small growth in the originations. We're only talking a couple billion year on year, and we'll see as it progresses throughout the year.\n\nDavid Long\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nGot it. Thanks for that color. The second question I had relates to the investment securities portfolio repositioning. Do you have certain internal payback maximums that you're willing to look at, or do you need to have a gain elsewhere in the bank before you look to take a loss in making some adjustments? What is the thought process that you go through to get you to the decision to actually act?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, look, I think we've acted twice. We're in the third and the fourth quarter as we've sort of looked at different opportunities. We've been pretty disciplined about payback periods so far. In total, it's roughly a two, two and a half year payback period across both of the repositionings we've done. Could we do something has a longer payback period maybe. It's something we'll continue to evaluate based on what we're seeing in the market. So far we've been pretty disciplined about when we do it.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, a follow up for you on. Your guide for NII of +1% to +3 for 2025 full year. Can you give us the guide for NII ex Markets for 2025?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, Vivek, that's not something we've historically provided. Again, given the size of our markets, business, and the contribution, and obviously it's very sensitive to where short rates will end up going. There is an improvement embedded in the guide for trading related NII that becomes, you know, that is very sensitive to where the, you know, where rates end up going. It's not something, you know, we're going to disaggregate at this point.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nCharlie, can you guys share with us? Obviously, there's geopolitical risks all around, and I think many investors obviously are aware of those. Can you list for us the risks that you guys talk about outside of the geopolitical risk when you're running your business? What are the things, because the outlook, I think we all share the optimism for you and your peers for the upcoming year for banking. What are the risks, though, that could maybe throw a curve ball at us?\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, listen, the biggest risk that we have that we spend the most time talking about is cyber at this point, just away from the normal kicking around, you know, credit, interest rate, operational risk, all the types of things you would talk about. Which is why we spend so much time on that and have the level of, of investment that we have and put the resources into it. You know, listen, as I said, you know, I think in my remarks we feel, you know, optimistic about, you know, where we are, you know, going into 2025, both because of where the economy is and the strength that has existed, as well as, you know, the business friendly approach from the incoming administration.\nYou know, what can, I mean, you know, you know, bad things can happen. It could be, you know, it could be related to conflict, could be related to a surprise in the market. I mean, those things are out there, you know, we're prepared for them as we think about just, you know, the way we run the company.\nThere's no one risk that sticks out relative to just the things that you would do relative to how you run the business. The most important thing for us relative to, you know, just risk management, the performance of the company away from these big tail risks. The strength of the US economy will drive, you know, the levels of success for our customers both on the consumer and the wholesale side. We follow from their success. Anything that risks that, you know, is a risk for us.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. No, very clear. As a follow up, and I apologize if this is putting the cart before the horse. You guys have obviously made great progress in resolving your regulatory issues. You talked on the call today about the OCC lifting, obviously, the cease and desist order earlier last year. When we get beyond these issues for you folks, obviously everybody talks about the asset cap and the Federal Reserve's cease and desist order.\nCan we talk about strategic planning going forward in terms of how you might, because you have plenty of excess capital, how you might consider acquisitions? In particular, what I'm interested in is pre-pandemic and pre-asset cap, Wells' deposit market share was over 10%, which, as we all know, no bank is permitted to buy a depository when the market share is over 10%. Now with the growth in the industry's deposits and you guys have been flat, you're below 10%. Would there, and again, I apologize if this is the cart before the horse, but is there any consideration once this is all behind you as you guys look to grow through maybe acquisitions, depositories, or investment banks? How are you guys looking at it from that standpoint?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, hey Gerard, it's Mike. Look, we're 100% focused on all of the organic growth opportunities we have across each of the businesses. The plan that we have been executing, that Charlie started when he got here five years ago, is the same plan we're going to be executing. I think it just involves basic execution across all the priorities, whether it's in card, wealth, IB, capital markets, et cetera, et cetera. That's our focus because we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to build off of the positions we have in each of these businesses across the country.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question for today's call will come from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You addressed in response to an earlier question changes in the incentive framework across the branches. There is this debate about the extent and how quickly an asset cap removal would kick start and allow for balance sheet growth. I'm curious to hear if you think there are still operational, cultural constraints that you need to address to really capitalize on the growth opportunities across your businesses. In response to the sales scandal, you changed the compensation structure at the branches, as you mentioned. You've built in safeguards to prevent abuses, and maybe there's more of a cultural predilection to be more risk averse.\nDo you feel like these are factors you still need to address to sort of remove the shackles, create incentives that help you grow as you change more to way more of a growth mindset? If you could just maybe elaborate on those questions, please.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, let me take a shot at us all. I think the way we think about it is we are, and we've been this way since I got here, which is very deliberate about how we go about business expansion, and whether it's an area like the card business where we started five years ago, or the CIB, whether it's in trading or banking. In the private credit space that we're offering something, the direct lending world for our commercial, you know, we do, you know, we're very focused on doing all these in a very controlled way with the right risk framework, and with all the right processes in place behind it. I said in my remarks, we're not done yet in terms of all the things we have to deliver. We are a very, very different company relative to the types of controls that exist today versus then. It's having those controls in place, it's us doing the testing and seeing, you know, that they're actually effective, is what gives us the confidence to grow. When we talk about the opportunities that we have and the things that we're doing, it's because we have the confidence in those things that we put in place.\nWhen you talk about, you know, the shackles off and where we go, you know, we just, I mean, those aren't things that we talk about, those aren't things that we think about. What we think about is that we are very disciplined in our approach in a very linear way towards where we are today versus where we want to go. When we have the ability to grow the balance sheet from this point of view, we would expect to see the same. It's not, we're not going to sit here and say the shackles are off. Therefore, the following 10 things are going to change materially. It's going to be disciplined, thoughtful, piece by piece, in a very controlled way, and only in places that are supported by the controls that we have in place.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nOkay, that's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAll righty. Well, listen, everyone, thank you very much. We appreciate it, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star two. Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn Campbell\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss Q2 results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our Q2 earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, John. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our Q2 results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. So let me start with some Q2 highlights. Our financial performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing efforts to transform Wells Fargo. We continue to generate strong fee-based revenue growth with increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments we're making in our businesses and favorable market conditions, with particular strength in investment advisory, trading activities, and investment banking.\nThese results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income. Credit performance during the Q2 was consistent with our expectations. Consumers have benefited from the strong labor market and wage increases. The performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve, reflecting prior credit-tightening actions, and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio. While losses in our credit card portfolio increased as expected, early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations.\nIn our commercial portfolios, losses continued to be driven by commercial real estate office properties, where we expect losses to remain lumpy. Fundamentals in the institutional-owned office real estate market continue to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country. However, they still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses. We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has driven headcount to decline for 16 consecutive quarters. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the Q1.\nThe higher interest rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan demand, and we have not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth. Balance growth in our credit card portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios. Average deposits grew modestly from the Q1, with higher balances in all of our consumer-facing lines of businesses. Now let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work.\nWe are a different Wells Fargo from when I arrived. Our operational and compliance risk and control build-out is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables are completed, and we embed this mindset into our culture, similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit risks today. We continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans.\nThe numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment. While we see clear forward momentum, it's up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is done to their satisfaction. Progress has not been easy, but tens of thousands of my partners at Wells Fargo have now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity, and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set for ourselves.\nWhile we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment, the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment, and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. We are also a different Wells Fargo in how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time. Let me highlight a few examples of the progress we're making for diversifying revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income.\nWe are improving our credit card platform with more competitive offerings, which is important both for our customers and strategically for the company. During Q2, we launched two new credit cards, a small business card and a consumer card. Since 2021, we have launched nine new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product build-out. The momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth.\nWe are not lowering our credit standards, but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being well received by the market. Building a large credit card business is an investment, as new products have significant upfront costs related to marketing, promo rates, onboarding, and allowance, which drive little profitability in early years. But as long as our assumptions on spend, balance growth, and credit continue to play out as expected, we expect the card business to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures.\nWe have been methodically growing our corporate investment bank, which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for us. We are executing on a multi-year investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline, and our positive momentum continues. We have added significant talent over the past several years and will continue to do so in targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth. Fernando Rivas recently joined Wells Fargo as Co-CEO of Corporate Investment Banking. Fernando has deep knowledge of our industry, and his background and skills complement the terrific team John Weiss has put together.\nWhile we view our work here as a long-term commitment, we expect to see results in the short and medium term and are encouraged by the improved performance we've already seen with strong growth in investment banking fees during the first half of the year. In our wealth and investment management business, we have substantially improved advisor retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisors and our consumer banking clients, which should ultimately help drive growth.\nIn the commercial bank, we are focused on growing our treasury management business, adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated, and delivering our investment banking and markets capabilities to clients, and believe we have significant opportunities in the years ahead. We continue to see significant opportunities for consumer, small, and business banking franchise to be a more important source of growth. Let me give you just a few examples of some of the things we're doing here. We continue to optimize and invest in our branch network.\nWhile our branch count declined 5% from a year ago, we are being more strategic about branch location strategy. We are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 296 during the first half of this year, and are on track to update all of our branches within the next five years.\nAs part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience, we are also increasing our investment in our branch employees and improving technology, including a new digital account opening experience, which has been a positive for both our bankers and our customers. We continue to have strong growth in mobile users, with active mobile customers up 6% from a year ago. A year after launching Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, we have had nearly 15 million users and over 117 million interactions.\nWe expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our customers additional self-service features and value-added insights, including balance trends and subscription spending. Looking ahead, overall, the US economy remains strong, driven by a healthy labor market and solid growth. However, the economy is slowing, and there are continued headwinds from still elevated inflation and elevated interest rates.\nAs managers of a large complex financial institution, we think about both the risks and the opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers and clients. The actions we have taken to strengthen the company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic environments, and while risks exist, we see significant opportunities in front of us. Our commitment and the progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is foundational for our company, and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete our work.\nWe have a diversified business model, see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream, and are seeing the early progress in our results. We have maintained strong financial risk disciplines and a strong balance sheet. Operating with a strong capital position and in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirements resulting from Basel III finalization has served us well. It also allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, and we remain committed to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs we previously announced, we expect to increase our Q3 common stock dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share, subject to the approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We've repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of this year, and while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock. I'm proud of the progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for Q2 was $4.9 billion or $1.33 for a diluted common share. EPS grew from both Q1 and a year ago, reflecting the solid performance in our fee-based businesses as we benefited from the market environment, and the investments we've been making. We also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the company. I will also note that our Q2 effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the Q1 adoption of the new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments, which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3% versus a year ago.\nThis increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on income since it had an offsetting increase to non-interest income. Turning to slide four, as expected, non-interest income was down. Net interest income was down $1.2 billion or 9% from a year ago. This decline was driven by higher funding costs, including the impact of lower deposit balances and customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products in our consumer businesses, and higher deposit costs in our commercial businesses, as well as lower loan balances. This was partially offset by higher yields on earning assets.\nNet interest income declined $304 million or 2% from the Q1. Given the higher rate environment and weak commercial loan demand, loan balances continued to decline as expected. We saw positive trends, including average deposit balances growing from the Q1, with growth in all of our customer-facing businesses, including within our consumer business. Customer migration to higher-yielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter.\nThis slowed the pace of growth in deposit pricing, with our average deposit cost up 10 basis points in Q2 after increasing 16 basis points in Q1. If the Fed were to start cutting rates later this year, we expect that deposit pricing would begin to decline, with the most immediate impact of new promotional rates in our consumer business and standard pricing for commercial deposits, where pricing moved faster as rates increased, and we would expect beta to also be higher as rates decline. On slide five, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both Q1 and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined.\nI'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate funding offset declines in our consumer businesses, driven by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives and continued consumer spending. Average deposits grew $4.9 billion from the Q1. Commercial deposits have grown for three consecutive quarters as we've successfully attracted clients' operational deposits. After declining for nearly two years, consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the Q1.\nWe've seen outflows slow as many rate-seeking customers in Wealth and Investment Management have already moved into cash alternative products, and we've successfully used promotion and retention-oriented strategies to retain and acquire new balances in consumer, small, and business banking. These improved deposit trends allowed us to reduce higher cost market funding.\nThe migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was similar to last quarter, with our percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits declining from 26% in Q1 to 25%. Turning to non-interest income on slide six, non-interest income increased 19% from a year ago, with growth across most categories reflecting both the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as the market conditions, as Charlie highlighted. This growth more than offset the expected decline in interest income, with revenue increasing from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.\nI will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment results. Turning to expenses on slide seven, Q2 non-interest expense increased 2% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, an increase in revenue-related compensation, and higher technology and equipment expense.\nThese increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower salaries expense and professional and outside services expense. Operating losses increased from a year ago and included higher customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we were working hard to get behind us. 7% decline in non-interest expense in the Q1 was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel expense in the Q1. Turning to credit quality on slide eight, net loan charge-offs increased 7 basis points from the Q1 to 57 basis points of average loans.\nThe increase was driven by higher commercial net loan charge-offs, which were up $127 million from the Q1 to 35 basis points of average loans, primarily reflecting higher losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio increased in the Q2 after declining last quarter, they were in line with our expectations. As we have previously stated, commercial real estate office losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients. We continue to actively work to de-risk our office exposure, including a rigorous monitoring process.\nThese efforts help to reduce our office commitment by 13% and loan balances by 9% from a year ago. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased $25 million from the Q1 to 88 basis points of average loans. Auto losses continued to decline, benefiting from the credit-tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021. The increase in credit card losses was in line with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus and as more recent vintages mature.\nImportantly, the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations, and we currently expect the credit card charge-off rate to decline in the Q3. Non-performing assets increased 5% from the Q1, driven by the higher commercial real estate office non-accruals. Moving to slide nine, our allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the Q1, driven by declines across most asset classes, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past four quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent.\nOur allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% for the past several quarters. Turning to capital and liquidity on slide 10, our capital position remained strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11% continued to be well above our current 8.9 regulatory minimum plus buffers. We're also above our expected new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8% starting in the Q4 of this year as our stress capital buffer is expected to increase from 2.9% to 3.8%.\nWe repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the Q2, and while the pace will slow, we have capacity to continue to repurchase common stock, as Charlie highlighted. Also, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the Q3 by 14%, subject to board approval.\nTurning to our operating segment, starting with consumer banking and lending on slide 11, consumer, small, and business banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. Lending revenue was down 3% from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline. Credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances, driven by higher point of sale volume and new account growth, was offset by lower other fee revenue.\nAuto revenue declined 25% from last year, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. Personal lending revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on slide 12, retail mortgage originations declined 31% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on simplifying the home lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. Since we announced our new strategy at the start of 2023, we have reduced headcount in home lending by approximately 45%.\nBalances in our auto portfolio declined 14% compared with a year ago, driven by lower origination volumes, which were down 23% from a year ago, reflecting previous credit-tightening actions. Both debit and credit card spend increased from a year ago. Turning to commercial banking results on slide 13, middle market banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees.\nAsset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 17% year-over-year, including lower net interest income, lower lease income, and revenue from equity investments. Average loan balances were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand has remained tepid, reflecting the higher-for-longer rate environment in a market where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure.\nTurning to corporate investment banking on slide 14, banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago, driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, partially offset by lower treasury management results, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts. Commercial real estate revenue was down 4% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue grew 16% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in equities, structured products, and credit products.\nAverage loans declined 5% from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real estate, where originations remained muted, and we have strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio, as well as declines in banking, where clients continue to access capital markets funding. On slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 6% compared with a year ago. Higher asset-based fees, driven by an increase in market valuations, were partially offset by lower net interest income, reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so Q3 results will reflect market valuations as of 1 July, which were up from both a year ago and from 1 April. slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our venture capital investments. Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and non-interest expense on slide 17, at the beginning of the year, we expected 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9 lower than full year 2023.\nDuring the first half of this year, the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected, with net interest income down 9% from the same period a year ago. Compared with where we began the year, our current outlook reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts, as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had assumed in our original expectations, which has helped us reduce market funding. Deposit costs increased during the first half of this year as expected, but the pace of the increase has slowed.\nHowever, late in Q2, we increased pricing in Wealth and Investment Management on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. This change was not anticipated in our original guidance, better aligns rates with rates paid in money market funds, and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately $350 million this year. Our current outlook also reflects lower loan balances. At the beginning of the year, we assumed a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year.\nAs we highlighted on our Q1 earnings call, loan balances were weaker than expected, and that trend continued into Q2. We expect this underperformance to continue into the second half of the year, with loan balances declining slightly from Q2 levels. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our full year 2024 net interest income to be in the upper half of the range we provided in January, or down approximately 8% to 9 from full year 2023. We continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of the year.\nWe are only halfway through the year, and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will continue to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses. At the beginning of this year, we expected our full year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. We currently expect our full year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $54 billion. There are three primary drivers for this increase.\nFirst, the equity markets have outperformed our expectations, driving higher revenue-related compensation expense in Wealth and Investment Management. As a reminder, this is a good thing as these higher expenses are more than offset by higher non-interest income. Second, operating losses and the other customer remediation-related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than we expected. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year.\nFinally, we did not anticipate the $336 million of expense in the first half of the year for the FDIC special assessment, which is now included in our updated guidance. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses. In summary, our results in Q2 reflected the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our financial performance.\nOur strong growth in fee-based businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income. We made further progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our capital position remained strong, enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders, and we continue to make progress on our path to a sustainable ROTCE of 15%. We will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please first unmute your phone and then press star one. Please record your name at the prompt. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star two to remove yourself from the question queue. Once again, please press star one and record your name if you would like to ask a question at this time. Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThanks a lot. Good morning. Mike, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail on those latter points you made on the changes on the deposit cost side. First of all, I guess relative to the 12 basis points that you saw in terms of interest-bearing cost increase, which was lower than the 17, how do you just generally expect that to look going forward, and is that sweep pricing also a part of what that number will look like going forward? Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks, Ken. Yes, I mean, the sweep pricing will be included in that going forward. You saw basically about a month's worth in the quarter. We made the change in June, so you saw about 1/3 of a quarterly impact already included in the number.\nI think when you drill into what's going on in the deposit side, I'd say a few things. One, overall, we're not seeing a lot of pressure on overall pricing in deposits. On the consumer side, this migration that's been happening now for a while from checking into savings or CDs is still happening, but at a slower pace. And you can see that over the last couple of years as it's been pretty stable the last quarter or two, but it's definitely slowing as you look at the quarter. And so I'd anticipate you'd still see more migration, but continuing to slow as we look forward.\nOn the wholesale side, the pricing's been pretty competitive now for a while, and that's the case. And so we've been pleased to see that we're able to grow good operational deposits. And so given the competitive pricing there, that puts a little near-term pressure on NII, but those deposits are going to be very valuable over a long period of time, particularly as rates start to come back down. And so the positive, I think, overall is you saw deposits grow in every line of business for the first time in a long time, and that migration is slowing to higher-yielding alternatives. And so we'll see how it plays out for the rest of the year, but I think there's some good positive trends that are emerging there.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you. And just to follow up, the fees were really good, and the trading business continues to demonstrate that it's taking market share. I guess how do we understand how to kind of measure that going forward, right, versus what the group's doing? You guys are definitely zigging and outperforming there. Where do you think you are in terms of market share gains, and how sustainable do you think this new kind of run rate of trading is going forward? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, I'll take that, and Charlie can chime in if he wants. As you look at trading in any given quarter, it's going to bounce around, right? So you can't necessarily straight-line any single quarter. So I'd be careful there as you look forward. But I think the good part is we've been methodically sort of making investments in really all the asset classes: FX, credit, to a lesser degree in equities and other places, but we're getting the benefit of those investments each quarter on an incremental basis.\nI think that business is still constrained by the asset cap, and so we are not growing assets or financing clients' assets at the same level we would be if we didn't have the asset cap, which also then drives more trading flow as we go. And so I'd say we're still methodically sort of building it out, and there should be opportunity for us to grow that in a prudent way for a while. But any given quarter may bounce around a little bit depending on what's happening in a market or an asset class. And we're getting good reception from clients as we engage with them more and see them move more flow to us.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd this is Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things, which is as we think about the things that we're doing to invest in our banking franchise, both markets and the investment banking side of the franchise. It's not risk-based. It's focused on customer flows on the trading side. It's focused on expanding coverage and improving product capabilities on the banking side. So what we look at, and we're also very, very focused on returns overall, as you can imagine, as all the other large financial institutions are. So as we're looking at our progress, we do look at share across all the different categories and would expect to see those to continue to tick up. And so as you look through the volatility that exists in the marketplace, we are looking at a sustained level of growth, recognizing that we don't control the quarter-to-quarter volatility.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. You expressed confidence that NII should bottom towards the year-end or towards the back half of this year. Maybe could you just give us what gives you the confidence in maintaining that view, just given the loan growth dynamics that you mentioned and just mentioned the funding cost and the rate backdrop? If you could just kind of walk us through your confidence in that inflection and I guess what it could mean as you go into 2025. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. We won't talk much about 2025, John, but as you sort of look at what's happening, you're seeing this pace of migration on the deposit side slow, as I mentioned earlier. So you're seeing more stability as time goes by there.\nOnce the Fed starts lowering rates, which the market expects to happen later in the year, you'll start to see betas on the way down on the wholesale side of the deposit base. You'll continue to see some gradual sort of repricing on the asset side as you see more securities and more loans sort of roll. And so you got to look exactly calling sort of the trough is which quarter it's going to be. Sometimes it can be a little tough, but as you sort of look at all the components of it, we still feel pretty good about being able to see that happen over the coming few quarters.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks, Mike. If I just hop over to capital buyback, somebody bought back about $6.1 billion this quarter, similar to the Q1. You indicated the pace will slow. Maybe could you give us a little bit of color on how we should think about that moderation, and how long that could persist at this point, and how long until you could be back at the run rate you were previously?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Let me take a shot at it, Mike, and then you can add the color on this one. Listen, I think when you look at where we've been running capital, we've been trying to anticipate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the uncertainties that exist around the way we find out about SCB, as well as the uncertainty that exists with where Basel III ultimately comes out. The reality of those two things are we know where the SCB is for this year at this point. We still don't know where Basel III ultimately winds up.\nSo I think as we sit here today, we will continue. We'll be conservative on capital return in the shorter term until we learn more about exactly where Basel III will ultimately wind up, and then we can get more specific about what that means for capital return. So I think we're just trying to be very pragmatic. The reality is we're still generating a significant amount of capital and a reasonably sized dividend that's increased as our earnings power has increased. Given the fact that we have constraints, most of what the remainder of our capital generation goes towards capital return, but we want to see where Basel III ultimately winds up.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. Just maybe one follow-up first, Mike and Charlie, on capital. Is 11% a line in the sand right now as you wait for Basel and clarity there? At least you're not guiding for it, but as we think about what the pace of buybacks might be, or could CET1 go below 11%, still significant buffer with the 9.6% minimum? Would appreciate how you think about that ratio in the context of capital return.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nI think where we are, plus a little bit, probably not minus a little bit, but plus some is probably the right place to be at this point. Remember, the SCB was higher than we expected, and so that's factoring into our thinking. And so that's really what's driving our thinking in terms of slowing the pace of buybacks at this point. But again, hopefully, we'll get some more clarity on Basel III. We know what you know, and then we'll be much clearer about what we think the future looks like there. But again, overall, we still have the capacity to buy back. As we've always been, we want to be prudent.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nUnderstood. And then just moving to expenses. So I get the expense guide increase, but remind us, has anything changed? Maybe, Charlie, from you first on the expense flex? That's a big part of the Wells thesis around efficiency gains, which should lead to the path for that 15% ROTCE. And what are you baking in in terms of the fee revenue for the back half as part of that guide? Does it assume elevated levels of trading in IB? Thank you.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nLet me just take the first part. And I appreciate you asking the question. I think as far from where as we look forward, nothing has changed for us as we think about the opportunity to continue to become more efficient. That story is no different today than it was yesterday or last quarter. As we increased the estimates for the year, it's really reflective of three broad categories. One are the variable expenses that relate to our Wealth and Investment Management business, where we have higher revenues that result in higher payout. And as Mike always points out, that's actually a good thing, even though it's embedded in the expense line, which causes that number to head upwards.\nThe second thing are the fact that we've had higher customer remediations and FDIC expenses in the first half of the year than when we contemplated the expense guidance. On the customer remediations, we've said they're not new items. They're historical items. We're getting closer to the end of finalization in these things. And as that occurs, things like response rates and making sure that we've identified the full amount of the population gets all fine-tuned, and that's what's flowing through. But that really relates to historical matters and not something that's embedded in what we see in the business going forward.\nSo what you're left with is the rest of the earnings, I'm sorry, the expense base of the company, and it's playing out as we would have expected. And so as we sit here and look forward, all the statements I've made in the past are still true, which is we're not as efficient as we need to be. We're focused on investing in growing the business. We're focused on spending what's necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure. And we're focused on driving efficiency out of the company. And that lever continues to be exactly what it's been.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nAnd you assume fees are staying elevated in the back half as part of that guidance?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. We assume equity markets are about where they are today. So it's still staying pretty elevated.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nNoted. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. First, I just want to put context to this question because I didn't want to ask it just in isolation because it seems ticky-tacky, but it's not. So the stock is down 7.5%. And if I just take consensus to the higher end of your NII range to 9%, that would imply that consensus would adjust 3.5% in isolation. So this is just the context of why I'm asking this question on expenses. So your expenses went up in terms of, from your original guide, $1.4 billion. And you laid out those three bullets, and you quantified the FDIC special assessment.\nI guess I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how much more the remediation expenses and op losses were up versus your original expectation because I think what the market wants to understand is NII, okay, we get it. That's happening because of deposit repricing. But is core PPNR outside of that going up? Right? Just sort of want to have that assurance in terms of is the EPS going to be down as much coming out of this as the market is indicating?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, Erika, it's Mike. I appreciate the question. We give you the operating loss line in the supplement, so you can see that. Based on what we had said in January, if you assume that the $1.3 billion on a full-year basis was just split evenly across all the quarters, you can see that the operating losses are up about $500 million year-to-date over that run rate. So that's the way to think about approximately what the impact of that is year-to-date in the first half.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSo then you take that, you add the FDIC to it.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nRight. The remainder is roughly the revenue-related expenses in wealth management.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSo that's why, Erica, when I was talking before, when you look at what's driving the increase in the expense guide, it's the remediations in the first and Q2. It's the FDIC expense that you've seen, and it's the increase in variable expenses. Everything else is playing out as we would have expected.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nGot it. Okay. That makes sense. And just maybe some comments on how you're thinking about credit quality from here. It looks like you continue to release reserves in Q2. Is this a message that you feel like you've captured most of the CRE-related issues, of course, absent of a further deterioration in the economy? And how should we think about the trajectory of the reserves from here relative to your charge-offs?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, I think when we look at the reserves, you have to bucket it into different pieces. Our exposures are coming down in parts of the consumer business. And based on underwriting changes we've made, it's not just balances, but also the actual losses. So that's what's driving the reductions in that part of the loss reserves on the consumer side. And on the credit card side, the increase is really driven by balances. So you've got two very different dynamics going on there, with the releases being just representative of a smaller, higher credit quality credit portfolio.\nAnd then on the wholesale side, the losses that we've seen and the credit performance in our CIB office CRE portfolio is playing out no worse than we would have expected when we set our ACL. But there's still uncertainty there, so we're maintaining the coverage. So overall, there's really, in terms of our expectations, no real change from what we're seeing in the CRE portfolio, which is where the loss content is actually coming through. And elsewhere, things are still fairly benign other than some episodic credit events in part of the wholesale business, but no real trend there.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you, Charlie and Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Can you just elaborate a bit on why you increased the deposit cost for Wells? Was it to keep up with competition? Was it trying to get ahead of some potential repricing pressures? Or what was kind of the logic there?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hey, it's Mike, Matt. So this was very specific to a suite product in the Wells business. So it's a portion of that overall deposits, and it doesn't have any bearing on any other products. So I would just leave it at that, very specific to that one individual product in fiduciary accounts or advisory accounts.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And how big is that, those deposit balances?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's not something we normally have out there. But you can see the impact is I sort of highlighted the impact is roughly $350 million for the rest of the year, for the second half of the year. So I would just use that as, and that's already embedded in sort of the guidance we gave.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. And then it's a separate topic here. I mean, the credit card growth has been very good. You highlighted rolling out some new products. And the question is always, when you anybody grows kind of so much in a certain category, you initially are not growing too quickly. The loss rates have gone up maybe a little more than some peers, not as much as some others. Obviously, in line with what you were targeting, there was that negative Wall Street Journal article on one of your cards. So just kind of taking together what kind of checks and balances do you have to make sure that it's somewhat new initiative for you, that you're growing at the right pace? Thank you.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. So Mike, why don't I start, and then you can chime in. So first of all, when we look at our credit card performance, we do not look at it in total. Right? We look at each individual product. We look at all of the performance broken out by vintage. And we compare the results that we're seeing, both in terms of balance build as well as credit performance, not losses, but starting very early with early-on-books delinquencies. And we look at how they're playing out versus pre-pandemic results as well as what we would have anticipated when we launched the product.\nAs I said, we look at the actual quality of the consumers that we're underwriting, and the overall credit quality. We haven't compromised credit quality at all. We've probably tightened up a little bit as time has gone on relative to where we had been. But the actual performance, when you look at the vintages, it's really spot on with what we would have expected. So what you're seeing in terms of the increase in loss rates is just the maturing of the portfolio.\nAnd the last thing I'll just say is just when you think about the Wall Street Journal article that we've launched a bunch of new credit cards. That is relative to the size and the scope of all of the cards that we issue and what our strategy is. That's a very, very, very small piece of it.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. And I would just add one piece. As you look at new account growth, we're not originating anything less than 660. So as Charlie mentioned, some of the credit tightening with 660 FICO, sorry. So as Charlie mentioned, the credit box has not been broadened really at all. When you look at some of the bigger products like the cashback card, Active Cash, the new originations are coming in at a higher credit quality than the backbook was. And so at this point, as Charlie said, we go through it at a very, very granular level each quarter, and the results are kind of right where we expect. And if we start to see any kind of weakness at all, we're adjusting where needed.",
    "content2": "Charlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd just one last comment here, which is, again, because I appreciate the question. Whenever you see a lot of growth in a product that has risk in it, it's always the right thing to ask the questions. We're not. This isn't the people that are doing this, both in our card business, Club, who runs consumer lending, myself. This is not a new product for us. We've seen this happen in the past. We've seen people do this well, and we've seen people not do this well. And so we're very, very conscious of the risks that you're pointing out as we go forward, just as we are on the other businesses that we're investing in.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And obviously, you talked about car washes going down in Q3. So that's consistent with everything that you said as well. So thank you for the color.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. Absolutely.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning. Hey, Betsy. So just wanted to make sure. On the expense guide, I get the point that a bunch of that is related to better revenues from wealth management. So we should be anticipating, as a part of that, that revenues for wealth management in the second half is going to be at least at 1/2 or maybe even a little higher. Is that fair?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, Betsy, I covered that in my script too. So as you look at the advisory assets there, they get priced based on, and most of them get priced in advance for the quarter, so you know what Q3 looks like based on where we are now. Obviously, it's not all equity market. There's some fixed income in there as well. But you should see a little bit of an increase as you go into Q3 based on where the markets are now. Then we'll see what Q4 looks like when we get there.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Okay. So I just wanted to make sure we balanced out the expenses with the rev beat. That or I know you're not guiding revs up, but interpretation leads you down that path. So then I guess the other piece of the question I just had to relate with the loan balance discussion that was going on earlier. What's your view of interest in leaning into the markets business today? I realize there's opportunity. There's still the asset cap constraints, but you're not at the asset cap. So there is room for you to lean in.\nThere are players who are a little bit more constrained on capital than you even in that space. So is this an area that you would be interested in leaning into, especially when C&I and CRE and other types of loans are low demand right now, as you indicated earlier? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, let me start. I think, so first of all, relative to where the balance sheet is running, we're not, let me say, we're careful about how we run the overall balance sheet, right? Which is we don't want to operate at the cap on a regular basis because you've got to be prepared both for customer appetite in terms of lending and deposits when you see it, as well as we lived through COVID where there was an event, and all of a sudden, there were a bunch of draws, and we have to live within that asset cap. So running it with a cushion is a very smart thing, we think, for us to do, even though you can argue we're giving up some shorter-term profits. So that's just the reality of where we live.\nAnd so as we think about the markets business and what that means, yeah, in a perfect world, we'd be allowing them to finance some more. There are more opportunities out there for us to be able to do that. But what we are doing is, as we think about inside the company, optimizing the balance sheet and where we get the most returns and where there's more demand and less demand. There has been less demand in other parts of the company, and there's been more demand on the trading side. So our assets are actually up 15-ish%.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. If you go to the supplement, Betsy, trading assets on an average basis are up 17%, a little more on a spot basis.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSo we're just trying to—so we're reflective of what those opportunities are. But we've got to keep capacity for the reasons I mentioned.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nCharlie, you mentioned in your opening comments about Fargo. You guys launched Fargo over a year ago, I guess, and you're having real good pickup. Can you share with us any other AI-orientated programs that are in work in progress right now that could lead to increased efficiencies or cost savings or even revenue enhancements as you go forward?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. First of all, when we think about AI, we do break it into different categories, right? There is traditional AI, and then there is GenAI. We have a huge number of use cases already embedded across the company with just traditional AI. That is, it's in marketing. It's in credit decisioning. It's information that we provide bankers on both the wholesale, on the consumer side, about what customers could be willing or might be willing to entertain a discussion about. And so that is, in a lot of respects, that's business as usual for us.\nThe new opportunity that exists with GenAI is where AI creates something based upon whether it's public data or on our own data in terms of things that haven't existed. We are most focused in the shorter term on things that can drive efficiency, but it also contributes to just quality of the experience for our customers. So great examples of things like that are call centers. We take lots of phone calls, and we've got lots of opportunities through AI to answer those questions before someone gets to a call center rep.\nBut once they get to a call center rep, we put a lot of effort into answering that question correctly, but also making sure that we're capturing that information, understanding root cause across all these calls we get. That means telephone bankers have to go in, actually enter what the call was about, what they think the root cause is. We then have to aggregate that and so on and so forth. Through GenAI, that can be done automatically. It can be done immediately, and the work can be done for us to identify that root cause so then we can go back, look at it, make sure that's the case, and make the change.\nSo ultimately, that results in fixing defects going forward, but it also takes so much manual effort out of what we do. And so any place where something is written, something is analyzed by an individual, we've got the opportunity to automate that. Those things exist on the wholesale side as well as the consumer side. To the extent that they impact a consumer, we're going to move very slowly to make sure we understand the impact of that. And so the work is a meaningful part of, as we think about prioritization in terms of our tech spend.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. I appreciate those insights. And then just as a quick follow-up, you also mentioned about improved advisor retention in the quarter. And when you look at your Wealth and Investment Management segment, I recognize commissions and brokerage service fees are not the main driver. Investment advisory and other asset-based fees are in revenues for this division. But I noticed that they've been flattened down this year.\nThey're up over a year ago. Is it seasonal in the Q2 that that line of business just gets soft, or is it the higher rate environment where customers are just leaving more cash in, or more assets in cash because they're getting 5% or so?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. There really is no rhyme or reason necessarily, Gerard, to exactly how that moves one quarter to the next necessarily. Obviously, if there's large bouts of volatility, you might see more transaction activity. That certainly hasn't been the case necessarily in the equity market in the Q2. But to some degree, as that line item, over a very long period of time, that line item probably declines more and advisory goes up. And that's actually a really good thing from a productivity and from an ongoing revenue perspective as well, so.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYep. Okay. Super. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question for today will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. And good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Just given the sheer amount of, I guess, investor questions that we've received on the deposit pricing changes in wealth, I was hoping you could provide some additional context given many of your peers have talked about cash sorting pressures abating or at least being in the very late innings. And want to better understand what informed the decision to adjust your pricing.\nWas it impacting advisor recruitment or retention? Was it impeding your ability to retain more share of wallet? And/or is this an effort to maybe go on the offensive and lead the market on pricing and sweep deposits and force others to potentially follow suit?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Steven, it's Mike. I'd say just a couple of things. One, this is not in reaction to cash sorting. We are seeing cash sorting slow in the wealth business just like we're seeing that in the consumer business. So this is not a reaction to that in any way. It's a relatively small portion of the overall deposits that sit within the wealth business. And it is very specific to this product, which is in an advisory account where there's frictional cash there. So it's not a reaction to competitive forces that we're seeing or us trying to be proactive somewhere to drive growth.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. And just one follow-up on the discussion relating to expenses. And just given the fee momentum that you're seeing within CIB and wealth, and you're clearly making investments in both of those segments, at the same time, the incremental margins have actually been quite high, especially in CIB where it's running north of 75% just first half this year versus last. And was hoping to get some perspective as we think about some of that fee momentum being sustained. What do you believe are sustainable or durable incremental margins within CIB and wealth, recognizing the payout profiles are different?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, let me start on the wealth side, and I'll come back to the investment banking or banking side. So on the wealth side, what's really going to help us drive margin expansion in that business over time are really kind of two things. One is continued productivity and growth in the advisory asset side, which you can see happening. And then two, and we've talked about this in other forums, it's doing a much better job penetrating that client base with banking and lending products. When you look at our loans in the wealth business and you look at the overall asset base or the advisor for us, we're much less penetrated than some of the peers.\nSo I think those things really help drive us to get to more best-in-class margins, which are higher than where we sit today. That takes some time. On the lending side, in this rate environment, it's a little harder to drive that growth. As rates start to come down, you'll probably see more demand there. So there are some cyclical aspects of it that sort of come from a timing perspective. But those are things that Barry Sommers, and the whole management team in wealth are very focused on and making sure we've got the right capabilities, the right sales force, the right support for the sales force, and so forth.\nOn the iBanking side, we've been making investments in that business now for the better part of two-plus years, a little longer than that, probably. And as we're adding good people, we're also not necessarily, we're also making sure that we've got the right people in the right seats. And so you're not seeing this really huge increase in overall senior headcount. We're making sure we got the right people in the right seats. And so you've seen some reductions as you've seen some growth. And so that's helping also moderate the overall investment. And then also, as we've brought those people on, you're paying them full freight when you recruit people, right?\nSo what you're seeing is you're getting the benefit of those investments by adding the revenue piece now, but you've already got the expense and the run rate to some degree. And so I think you'll see that pace of margin expansion moderate over time. But what you're seeing is what you should expect, which is we made the investments, you're paying the people, now they're becoming productive incrementally each quarter. And that's good to see.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful, color. Mike. Thanks for taking my questions.\nYep. All righty, everyone. Thanks very much. We'll talk to you soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."

Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn Campbell\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss Q1 results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our Q1 earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our Q1 results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some Q1 highlights. Our solid results reflect the progress we're making to improve and diversify our financial performance and the continued strength in the US economy. It's gratifying to see the investments we're making across the franchise contributing to higher revenue versus Q4, as an increase in non-interest income more than offsets an expected decline in net interest income.\nNon-interest income also benefited from higher equity markets, which benefited our Wealth and Investment Management business. Net charge-offs were higher than a year ago, as expected, and stable from Q4. Credit trends remain generally consistent. Consumer delinquencies continue to perform as we forecasted, and year-over-year growth in consumer spend remains consistent with prior quarters. In our commercial portfolios, the weakness we see continues to be in certain commercial office properties, but our expectations have not significantly changed versus what we anticipated last quarter.\nMike will discuss the specific items that drove an increase in expenses from a year ago, but we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, including reducing headcount, which has declined every quarter since Q3 of 2020. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from Q4, as higher rates are impacting demand, and we are continuing to reduce our exposure in certain portfolios. Average deposits were relatively stable from Q4, as growth in interest-bearing deposits offset lower non-interest-bearing deposits. Our capital position remains strong, and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority.\nAs we stated on our last earnings call, we expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. In Q1, we repurchased a total of $6.1 billion in common stock, and our average common shares outstanding declined 6% from a year ago. Now, let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Earlier this year, the OCC terminated a consent order issued in 2016 regarding sales practices misconduct. The closure of this order was an important milestone, as it is confirmation that we operate much differently today around sales practices.\nAs I repeatedly said, our risk and control work remains our top priority, and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. This is the sixth consent order that our regulators have terminated since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort, and as we implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, and we see that we are completing interim deliverables, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. So it will remain our top priority, and our approach will not change.\nAs I highlighted in my recent annual letter, we have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk and control-related groups, and we're spending over $2.5 billion more per year than 2018 in these areas. We are a stronger, better company for our customers, communities, and employees. While we're moving forward with confidence, I will repeat what I've said in the past. Regulatory pressures on banks with longstanding issues such as ours are high, and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions.\nAdditionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, new issues could be found, and these may result in regulatory actions. At the same time, we're making progress on our risk and control work. We're executing on our strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time. We continue to introduce attractive new products as we build our Credit Card business. Last month, we launched Autograph Journey, designed for frequent travelers who can earn points wherever they book travel. Our new product offerings continue to drive strong credit card spend up approximately $5 billion or 14% from a year ago.\nWe continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen Corporate and Investment Banking. More than 50 new senior hires have joined our CIB since 2019, with many of these in key coverage and product groups within banking. In February, Doug Braunstein, with more than 35 years of industry experience, joined Wells Fargo as a Vice Chairman. Doug is a world-class banker, and he's working alongside the great team we've assembled to continue to grow the franchise. In addition, given the breadth of Doug's experience, he's also providing counsel on broader business issues beyond client development.\nAs we look forward, it's always helpful to be grounded in the facts. We continue to see strength in the US economy. Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year over year. Consumer credit is performing as we expect. Wholesale credit continues to perform well, and our views around commercial real estate have not significantly changed since last quarter. These are all positives. In addition, we remain committed and confident in our ability to increase efficiencies across the enterprise. Areas we have targeted for investments, such as credit card, investment banking, and trading, are performing well.\nWe are beginning to see early signs of share and fee growth, which will be important as we diversify our revenues and reduce net interest income as a percentage of revenue. We remain bullish on opportunities across our other businesses, again, more positives. Having said that, markets and rates will likely remain volatile, and as risk managers, we are prepared if trends were to change. We've historically managed credit through multiple cycles and believe that the actions we've taken over the last several years position us well. We have strong capital liquidity positions.\nAs we're building many of our businesses, we have done so within a consistent level of risk appetite, and our business model and franchise value differentiates us from most of who we compete with, regardless of the environment. So what does all of this mean for our outlook? Simply said, our views haven't changed from last quarter. While we could look at specific data points on a specific date and alter our guidance, there is not enough of a consistent fact pattern to change our views, but what we see is helpful. Our focus remains the same.\nWe are transforming Wells Fargo and are investing to build a well-controlled, fast-growing, and higher-returning company while we work to become more efficient. I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm optimistic about the future opportunities ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for Q1 was $4.6 billion, or $1.20 per diluted common share. Our Q1 results included $284.06 per share for the FDIC special assessment as a result of the regional bank failures last year. Recall last quarter, our results included $1.9 billion for the special assessment, and this additional amount reflects recent updates provided by the FDIC, including potential recoveries, which were highlighted in their disclosure. The ultimate amount of our special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual losses and recoveries to the deposit insurance funds.\nTurning to slide four, net interest income declined $1.1 billion, or 8% from a year ago, due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products, as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Q1 results were largely as expected, with loan balances a little lower and deposit balances in the businesses a little higher than our expectations. Our full-year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter, and we still expect 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than 2023.\nWe also continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of this year. It is still early in the year, and ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including deposit balances, mix, and pricing, the absolute level of interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve and loan demand. On slide five, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both Q4 and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow, while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased 69 basis points from a year ago to over 6%, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago, reflecting lower deposits in our consumer businesses as customers continued spending and reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. While growth in average deposits from Q4 was modest, we have grown deposits in our commercial businesses for two consecutive quarters, which reflected our success in attracting clients' operational deposits.\nPeriod-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up 2% from Q4, but some of this growth reflected a temporary increase driven by quarter-end that was on a payday and a holiday. While the pace of growth slowed, our average deposit costs continued to increase as expected, rising 16 basis points from Q4 to 174 basis points, with higher deposit costs across most operating segments. Our mix of deposits continued to shift, with our percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits declining to 26%. Turning to non-interest income on slide six, we were pleased with the growth in non-interest income across all of our business segments.\nGrowth in non-interest income more than offset lower net interest income, reflecting in revenue growth from both Q4 and a year ago. Non-interest income was up 17% from a year ago, with strong growth in investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions, deposit and lending fees, related fees, and trading and investment banking fees. As Charlie highlighted, we benefited from market conditions as well as the investments we've been making in our businesses. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing the segment results.\nTurning to expenses on slide seven, Q1 non-interest expense increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, the FDIC special assessment, an increase in revenue-related compensation, predominantly due to the higher investment advisory fees in our wealth and investment management business, and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower professional and outside services expense, which declined 10% from a year ago.\nThe higher operating losses were driven by customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us. The increase in personnel expense from Q4 was driven by approximately $650 million of seasonally higher expenses in Q1, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement-eligible employees, and 401(k) matching contributions. Not including expense for the FDIC special assessment in Q1, our full-year 2024 non-interest expense guidance is unchanged and is still expected to be approximately $52.6 billion. However, we continue to watch a couple of items.\nOur guidance included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the year, which we still believe is a reasonable estimate even with a higher level of operating losses in Q1. However, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. Also, if market valuations remain at current levels or move higher, that would increase investment and advisory fees, and revenue-related compensation could be higher than we assumed in our expense guidance for this year, which would be a good thing. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses.\nTurning to credit quality on slide eight, net loan charge-offs declined three basis points from Q4 to 50 basis points of average loans. Credit performance trends were consistent with what we saw last quarter. The decline reflected lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $131 million from Q4 to 25 basis points of average loans. The reduction was driven by lower losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. We did not see further deterioration in the performance of our CRE office portfolio versus Q4, and therefore, our expectations have not changed. We continue to expect additional losses in the coming quarters.\nHowever, the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic. Consumer net loan charge-offs continue to increase as expected and were up $28 million from Q4 to 84 basis points of average loans. While auto losses continued to decline, benefiting from the tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021, credit card losses increased in line with our expectations. Non-performing assets declined 2% from Q4, driven by the lower CRE office non-accruals, reflecting the realization of losses and paydown from the quarter. Moving to slide nine.\nBased on the consistent credit trends I noted before, our allowance for credit losses was down modestly, driven by declines for commercial real estate, and auto loans, partially offset by higher allowance for credit card loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We didn't increase our allowance for this portfolio in Q1, and the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio of 11% was stable compared with Q4.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on slide 10, our capital position remained strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2% continued to be well above our 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in Q1. While the amount of stock we repurchase each quarter will vary, we continue to expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. Turning to our operating segment, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11, Consumer, Small, and Business Banking revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by our lower deposit balances.\nWe continue to invest in talent, technology, and branches to improve the customer experience. Our branches are becoming more advice-focused, with teller transactions declining while banker visits have increased. We are modernizing and optimizing the branch network. The number of branches declined 6% from a year ago, while at the same time, we are accelerating the refurbishment of our branch network. In addition, the enhancements we are making to our mobile app continue to drive momentum in mobile adoption, and we surpassed 30 million active mobile customers in Q1, up 6% from a year ago.\nMobile logins also reached a milestone, surpassing 2 billion logins for the first time in Q1, up 18% from a year ago. Home lending revenue was stable from a year ago as higher mortgage banking income was offset by lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline. Credit card revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Payment rates remained relatively stable compared with Q4 and were above pre-pandemic levels. Auto revenue declined 23% from a year ago, driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal Lending revenue was up 7% from a year ago and included the impact of higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on slide 12, retail mortgage originations declined 38% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objective to simplify the business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. We also made significant progress in reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans we serviced, down 21% from a year ago. We also continued to reduce the headcount in home lending, which was down 33% from a year ago. Balances in our auto portfolio were down 12% compared to last year. Origination volume declined 18% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions, but increased 24% from a slow Q4.\nDebit card spend increased 4% from a year ago, with growth in most categories except for fuel and travel. Credit card spending remained strong and was up 14% from a year ago. All categories grew, with stronger growth in non-discretionary spend. New account growth continued to be strong, up 12% from last year. Turning to commercial banking results on slide 13, middle market banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by higher deposit-related fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 7% year over year and included lower revenue from equity investments.\nAverage loan balances were stable compared to a year ago as growth in asset-based lending and leasing was offset by declines in middle market banking. Weaker loan demand reflected the impact of clients being cautious given the higher-rate environment and the anticipation of lower rates this year, as well as some potential uncertainty in an election year. Turning to corporate investment banking on slide 14, banking revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products.\nOur results benefited from the areas where we have had strength for some time, such as investment-grade debt capital markets and from the talent we've been attracting into the business. While it is still early, we are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing. Commercial real estate revenue was down 7% from a year ago and included the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue increased 2% from a year ago, driven by continued strong performance in structured products, credit products, and foreign exchange.\nOur trading results continue to benefit from market conditions, and the investments we have made in technology and talent to round out the business have enabled us to produce strong results even as market dynamics have changed. Average loans declined 4% from a year ago. Banking clients have taken advantage of strong capital markets payoff loans. In addition to weak loan demand in commercial real estate given market conditions, balances also declined due to credit tightening actions we implemented last year, along with our efforts to actively reduce certain property types in the portfolio.\nOn slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 2% compared to a year ago. Lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives was more than offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations. While cash alternatives as a percentage of total client assets was higher than a year ago, it has declined the past two quarters as the migration of deposits into cash alternatives has slowed significantly. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter.\nQ1 results reflected market valuations as of 1 January, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in Q2 will reflect market valuations as of 1 April, which were higher from both a year ago and from 1 January. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments. In summary, our results in Q1 reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. We grew revenue, driven by strong growth in our fee-based businesses. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives.\nWe increased capital returns to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We'll now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, first, unmute your phone and then press star one. Please record your name at the prompt. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star two. Once again, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star one. Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, good morning. Guys, I wanted to ask about your profitability targets and kind of how you're seeing the journey to the mid-teens ROTCE goal. Mike, maybe you could talk about that through the lens of 12% return on tangible common equity this quarter. Where do you think you're kind of over-earning, under-earning, and what does that journey to the mid-teens look like over the next couple of years?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, John, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So look, I think not much has changed in our thinking on the topic. As you sort of think about it on a long-term basis, there's no reason, there's still no reason why our businesses shouldn't have returns like the best of our peers. As we sort of go through that journey, obviously, we are where we are in terms of the returns today. As we get towards closer to 15%, it's going to be the same kinds of drivers that we've been talking about now for a while. We've got to continue to optimize sort of capital and balance sheet. You saw us return some via buybacks today.\nWe're making investments on each of our businesses, and so we'll need to start seeing some of the returns there. This was one quarter of it, but a good quarter that shows some of the benefits of those investments we're making across a whole range of the businesses, which is good to see. Charlie highlighted a bunch of that in his commentary. Then we've got to stay on the efficiency journey, which we continue to believe is not done. We've got a lot of work to do to continue to drive efficiency across the company. We're going to stay at that as we look forward.\nI think it's really those drivers that get in, and we still have confidence that we're going to get there.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, John, let me. It's Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things. Number one is just as a reminder to everyone, we've tried to be clear as NII was rising and we got to certainly either at the peak or near the peaks that we were out-earning and that we didn't look at those ROEs at those points as sustainable, but that our clear journey was to continue to get there on a sustainable basis. I think second of all, when we look at, obviously, it's very hard to draw any conclusion from a specific quarter, right? We've got the FDIC, we've got operating losses, which we've talked about, where our expectations are for the full year, which are different than the quarter.\nIt's very hard to draw a conclusion on a specific quarter. But when we look at what is going to get us there, we are very consistent on what those things are. Number one, it's improved business performance. We tried to highlight where we see that. Those areas that we don't talk about are areas that we are still bullish on, but would like to see some more improvement in the ability to increase our returns in those parts of the company, as well as continued capital return, as well as the limitations we have because of the asset cap. So again, our thesis hasn't changed. Our views haven't changed, and our confidence in getting there hasn't changed.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Then one just quick follow-up there. Do you think this 11% CET1 is probably kind of the ballpark of where you hang out regardless of the minimum? Just because it feels like you have super regional banks that aren't G-SIBs that are running at 10%, 10.5%. You have bigger banks at 12%, 13%. Does 11% kind of feel like the right ballpark, which means you can return most of what you're generating now?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nI would say it's something that we continue to think through. You know our existing needs today with buffers are at 8.9%. At 8.9%, everyone understands that Basel III endgame is coming, but likely with significant revisions. So I don't—I think as the quarters continue, we'll learn more about where that will come out, and we'll be able to be more informed about where we'll wind up. We've always tried to be on the more conservative end, but there's a point at which too much is too much, which is why we bought the amount this quarter that we bought back.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst of Large Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess just following up on that, as we think about Basel III, your capital levels, even with 100 basis points buffer, you probably have $12 billion of excess capital. Given what we saw in Q1, and I heard you, Mike, year over year, you're going to be higher, but that doesn't give enough color. I'm just wondering, should we expect the pace of buybacks to continue given where the stock's trading, which is still fairly attractive valuations?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. It's Mike, thanks for the question. As you look at the pacing, we're really not going to provide specific guidance on what we'll do quarter to quarter. I think, obviously, as you pointed out, we've got significant excess capital to where we need to be. We'll be able to handle whatever comes out of Basel III quite easily with where we are today. Gives us the ability to be there and invest as we've got opportunities with clients. We've got lots of flexibility.\nEach quarter, we'll go through the same process we go through every quarter, which is thinking about sort of where the capital requirements are going to go, looking at all the different risks that are out there across the spectrum, whether it's rates or other, and then looking at what we're seeing from client activity. Then we'll make a decision on the pacing of it. But as you say, we're still very confident we'll do more than we did last year, but pacing will kind of leave to, we'll cover that each quarter after we report.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. I guess just separately, I think there's a lot of focus on market share opportunity for Wells Fargo in capital markets, IB, corporate lending. I think Charlie referenced the hiring of Doug Braunstein. Would appreciate additional color in terms of areas where you see within corporate capital markets where there's market share to be had. What's the level of investment/infrastructure needed in order for competing in that space and winning market share?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Let me start out. I think, first of all, when we talk about the level of investment that's necessary, we're making the investment, and it's embedded in what we're spending. So we are funding that through normal course of business. Some of the folks that we're hiring are replacing other people, and others are additions, but that's part of what it is. We don't anticipate any kind of step-up in the expense base to fund what we're doing, which we feel great about. We've got the ability to spend along the way and to actually see them paying off for itself.\nListen, I've said this very consistently, which is we are extremely under-penetrated across almost all segments of the investment banking space. We've been stronger on the debt side. We have not been as strong on the equity side. By the way, all for reasons that relate to our own willingness to invest over the last decade and a half, not because of the opportunity or because of our business model. It's just the opposite. It's just not something that the senior management team here was supportive of. We feel very differently than that.\nWhen we look across coverage in the equity space by industry on the strategic side and how that relates to the existing high-quality debt platform that we have, again, we're prioritizing industries based upon where we already have strength in relationship and where there are significant wallets. But we feel really great about our ability to serve a broad set of customers and their desire to do business with us because of both the platform and the talent that we have here. Then when we look at the trading side of our business, a big part of what we do there is to support our efforts within the investment bank.\nBut it also is to leverage the broader institutional relationships that we have, where we do a lot with those institutions, but we haven't necessarily leveraged trading flow as part of that. To do that, we're making investments not just in people, but in technology. As I alluded to, we're not doing any of this by rethinking the way we think of our risk tolerances. It really is about getting the right products, the right services, the right people, and calling on our customer base with a different degree of credibility and desire that we've had in the past.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's a great color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Good morning. Wondering if we could talk a little bit about just that kind of last mile of deposit repricing. You talked about the mix shift and noninterest down and interest-bearing up. But just wondering just what's happening on the pricing side, and are you still seeing both sides, consumer and wholesale? If you can maybe just kind of give us the dynamics that's happening underneath and how you expect that to continue as we get to this, as we stay in this rates peak. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. I'll take that, Ken. As you look at the commercial side, not much has changed. It's pretty competitive. We're not seeing it move one way or the other in a significant way as you sort of look over the last quarter. Good news is we've been able to attract good operating deposits in the corporate investment bank. We've seen some growth in the commercial bank as well. All that's kind of performing as you'd expect. You wouldn't really expect pricing to move there until the Fed starts to move. It'll stay pretty competitive at that point. We still expect betas to be pretty high on the way down as you start to see that eventually happen.\nOn the consumer side, standard pricing is not moving. Really what you're seeing is people continue to spend some of the money that's in their checking accounts and/or move some of it into either CDs or higher-yielding savings accounts. So you still see some of that activity happening across the consumer space and the Wells space where you still have some people moving into higher-yielding alternatives. The pace of that migration has slowed, at least for now. So we'll see how that progresses through the rest of the year, but it has slowed a bit over the last number of months.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay. On the lending side, I think what you guys showed is not unexpected at all based on general softness to start the year. So I think you and others had just kind of generically hoped that we get an improvement. But with rates where they are, is there any impediment to just seeing an improvement in loan growth as the year goes on, or is it baked into kind of the demand function that you're seeing underneath?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I think what we're seeing so far is exactly what we expected to see at the beginning of the year. I know different people have different views back in January, but this is exactly what we expected, which is pretty low demand. Now, as I said in my commentary, it's a little bit lower than what we had modeled, but not substantially at this point. It really is a demand function. When you look at what we're hearing from clients in the commercial bank or some of the clients in the corporate investment bank, they're being cautious still and saying, \"Okay, I'm not going to build inventories as much as I might in a different environment.\"\nThey're being thoughtful about the cost of credit and how that impacts investments they're making or the timing and the pacing of that. On the commercial side, it really is a demand issue at this point. On the consumer side, you continue to see some growth in card balances. Given the size of the balance sheet, that's not going to move the whole balance sheet very materially, given where we start from. Then the mortgage side just continues to decline a little bit given the market that we've got there.\nIn auto, we're seeing a little bit more decline given some of the changes we made about a year and a half ago, year, year and a half ago on some of the credit tightening. Eventually, that'll start to turn. I think those are the dynamics that we're seeing right now.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thanks, Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey. Okay. A couple of just quickies here. One is on the net interest income outlook that's unchanged. Could you remind us what the interest rate environment is that's the base case for that analysis?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. Hey, it's Mike, Betsy. Welcome back. Sure. When you look at the environment, we're not guessing at sort of what's going to happen, right? So I think as you sort of look at the different variables there, embedded in our baseline forecast is that we would expect somewhere around three rate cuts this year. That's what's underlying sort of our thinking at this point.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nWas that the same as last quarter, same assumption set, or has that changed?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nNo. I mean, yeah. No, it's definitely less than what I think was being projected by the market, and that's what we put out on our slide in January. When you look at the impact of that in isolation, you certainly would see a benefit from less rate cuts. But I do think you have to put that in the context of, okay, now what's going to happen with client behavior and mix shifts as we look for the rest of the year? I mean, it's certainly clear we feel better today than we did in January about our guidance and our forecast there. But I do think we have to let some more time play out to see how people react to what's happening.\nI think even you got to be really careful to take what happened over a day or two and extrapolate too far, right? We're seeing a bunch of that be given back today even. What we've seen over the last couple of years is that every time you have this strong reaction, either up or down in expectation for rates, that reaction tends to moderate a little bit over a pretty short period of time. So we'll see how that plays out.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Obviously, we've had quite a bit of activity volatility on the long end of the curve. How do you think about that, and is there opportunity set for maybe pulling in some more deposits and reinvesting in securities given the slightly improved long-end rates here?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Yeah. We've started to do that to some degree in Q1 where we have been starting to buy some securities, mainly mortgages, given where rates and levels have been. That's been a good trade, I think, for us so far. I think you'll certainly see us continue to deploy more cash in the securities, at least at some modest levels as we look forward to Q2.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Super. Thanks so much, Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. Just to follow up on Betsy's questions, on the net interest income outlook, you had a peer that had a more modest upgrade to that outlook than expected. You held firm on your NII guide. I guess to that end, as we think through whether or not there are going to be rate cuts or no cuts, above and beyond just marking to market the NII to the rate curve, is the implication for volumes, right? Like you mentioned in response to Betsy's question, the client behavior.\nI guess I just wanted to understand in terms of the range of outcomes of zero, which was being talked about a couple of days ago, to the three embedded in your estimates, how should we think about how you're thinking about volumes in terms of loans and deposit behavior? In other words, have you considered a wider range of volume outcomes as you think about the curve outlook?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, I'll take an attempt at that, Erika. You can tell me if I covered it all. But it's certainly, we're at a point in time, and I said this on a call with media earlier this morning, we're at a time where it's difficult to sort of model the different outcomes that you could expect to see with net interest income, just given all the dynamics that are happening there. As you said, I think the fact that rates might be higher than what people expected a week ago, that could change, first of all. But let's stipulate at this point, people are thinking it's going to be higher for a little bit longer. We do have to wait and see how clients are going to react.\nI think we do our best to try to come up with a range of outcomes there. Given what's happening in rates, plus what's happening in quantitative tightening, what's happening in sort of the economy overall is going to all matter in terms of what happens with deposit levels. Let's see how that plays out. But I think as I come back to what I said earlier, we feel better than we did today, than we did in January about where we are. But there's a lot to play out for the rest of the year.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Just a follow-up, kind of a two-part question, but hopefully very related to one another. It was the lifting of the consent order was clearly huge for how the market was perceiving Wells. As we think about further remediation, how should we think about how you're thinking about the potential cost saves that you could extract from all the processes that may be in place that has been focused solely on the remediation? I ask that not in light of the usual recycled question, but clearly had a massive outperformance, like Ibrahim mentioned, on investment banking and trading.\nAs we think about those expenses, should we start expecting the reinvestment back to potentially accelerate? Also on investment banking and trading, I know there's a lot of seasonality, but are these new run rates? I guess it's hard for us to tell what the base is because obviously, as Charlie mentioned, you're under penetrated across the board. Should we continue to see a moving up of this base despite the seasonality as we look forward?\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. There's a lot in there. Let me start, Mike, and then you chime in. So first of all, Mike, you can comment on investment banking and trading. But again, I mean, we're not going to answer the question on how you should think about what investment banking and trading will be in the future. What we're focused on is: are we building businesses? Are we taking share in a way which is profitable? That's exactly what we're starting to do. There is volatility to the business, but we're focused on building it over a period of time, and that's what we're seeing.\nThe way we would think about it when we look at our own forecasting is we would expect to see our market shares rise over a period of time and, quarter by quarter, you know, that it'll be subject to volatility that exists.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWhen you think about Q1 in particular, there's always going to be seasonality on the trading side. That happens pretty much every year. So you can't just take that as a run rate. On the investment banking side, you've certainly seen some very high issuance volumes on the investment-grade debt side. So that's likely maybe pulling some issuance forward later in the year, but we'll see.Then some of the M&A revenue that's embedded in there can be somewhat episodic and volatile just given the timing of deals, closings, and stuff. You do have to look at those two lines over a longer period of time.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThen on your question on expenses, again, we're in the exact same place that we've been, which is we're not thinking about at all. We're not doing work. We're not thinking about whether there are efficiencies to be gotten out of all the risk and control work that we're doing. In fact, we're still on the other side of that, which is we still have more open consent orders, and we're still committed to do whatever's necessary, including spending whatever's necessary to get that work done properly and build it into the infrastructure of the company.\nI've said there'll be a point at which when it's built into what we do and there's a high degree of confidence that it is part of the culture and our processes that we will have an opportunity to figure out how to do some of those things more efficiently. But that's not on our radar screen at all. What is on our radar screen is the fact that there's still a lot of inefficiency left within the company, completely away from the money that we're spending on this. That's where we're focused. That's why we have the ability to invest in card, invest in investment banking and trading, accelerate the branch refurbishments, hire more bankers and commercial banking, and things like that.\nSo I would just still continue to separate the fact that we're committed to get the work done. We're going to do whatever's necessary to spend there. That's not the area of focus for us when it comes to efficiency.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThat was clear, Charlie. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHi. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. So wanted to start off just on a question, maybe unpacking the NII commentary a bit more. In the prepared remarks, Mike, you noted that you expect NII to be troughing towards the end of this year. So less concerned about the full year 2024 outlook, but was hoping you could just speak to the inputs or assumptions that supporting that expectation around troughing or stabilization given further rate cuts that are reflected in the forward curve beyond 2024.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. When you look at all the different factors, Steve, there's obviously nothing that's sort of unique to sort of our balance sheet. But when you look at both the asset repricing that's happening and securities, you look at what's happening, and you sort of project forward on sort of the loans and the other parts of the balance sheet. That's obviously a key input as you sort of look forward. Then at some point, you would expect that the migration and deposit mix starts to stabilize as you go forward. I'm a little intentional in the words we use in terms of towards the end of the year. Is it right at this year? Is it early next year? It's going to be.\nWe're getting closer to that point in terms of when it's going to trough. Calling the exact date with a high degree of certainty is difficult in this environment. But it's all the things that sort of we've talked about over the last few quarters that are going to drive that. It starts with deposits, deposit mix, and deposit pricing and then goes through the rest of where we think the assets sort of net out.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's helpful color. For my follow-up, might be rewriting this question, but Charlie, it relates to how you responded to Erika's last one relating to the asset cap specifically. I recognize that you're focused internally on just addressing or remediating all the various consent orders. But externally, investors are clearly spending much more time evaluating the different potential sources of earnings or return uplift once these regulatory restrictions are eliminated, whether it's deposit recapture, growth in trading book, and reduction in that elevated risk and control spend. I don't expect you to quantify it.\nI don't expect you to speculate on timing for when the asset cap can get lifted. But just given that focus for investors, it might just be helpful if you can contextualize how you're thinking about some of those potential benefits.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "Sure. I'm not sure you should feel afraid to ask the question. You guys should ask whatever you want. I just try to be as clear as I can on what I think we'll be in a position to answer. I don't want you guys to get frustrated by the level of consistency of the things that we want to be careful about. But to your question, which is I think entirely reasonable, I've put it into a couple of categories. I think, first of all, probably the most important thing with the asset cap, quite frankly, is not the pure economics at this point that'll come from the lifting of the asset cap. It is still a reputational overhang for us.\nWhile the lifting of the sales practices consent order was extremely important for those that have just read the newspapers, certainly those that follow the stock care a lot about the asset cap, and we understand that. That is just initially, I think, an important factor in terms of how we'll be viewed as opposed to what we'll actually do. I think when we look at what we have done to proactively manage the company to keep ourselves below the asset cap, there are two, you've got two categories.\nYou've got places where we have gone and said, \"Please make your business smaller,\" because just because of normal deposit flows and consumer businesses and things like that, we'll have some asset pressure, and we need to offset that someplace. Then there's the opportunity cost of what we haven't been able to do because we've had the asset cap. Then what does that mean going forward? On the first piece, we have limited our ability, certainly within our trading businesses, for some very low-risk things such as financing our customers and things like that.\nSo by not allowing them to provide a level of financing, which is very low risk, we have not captured as much trading flow as we otherwise would have seen. In our corporate businesses, we've been very, very careful to encourage our bankers to bring in sizable corporate deposits that weren't clearly operational deposits. In some cases, been a little bit more aggressive about asking them actually not to have it here because we wanted to make room for other things that we thought were really important strategically, such as not being closed for business on the consumer side, which those folks would not understand is hopefully just something that's temporary.\nThose are the places that in the short term would benefit from the asset cap being lifted. I think when you get beyond that, the reality is when you look at what we've been able to do and the amount of excess capital that we have, we're trying to deploy that through the dividend and through our share buybacks because there's only so much that we should keep around and not return to shareholders. But as I've talked about, we think there are plenty of opportunities when you look around our different businesses to retrieve higher returns by reinvesting it inside the business.\nIt's not anything which I would describe it as dramatic, but in terms of the things that we can do when we don't have the constraints, take our, whether it's our consumer business or our wealth business, to build out our banking product set to be more aggressive about being full spectrum in terms of where we are on the lending side and the deposit side. Across all of our businesses, we've been very, very conservative in what we have asked people to do because we don't want to have an asset cap issue.\nSo again, I would describe it as it would be the ability to grow in the things that we're confident at that we do well, that we have either in some ways consciously and in some ways unconsciously restrained the company from doing. But all in all, certainly without an asset cap, it's not a neutral. It's a positive because of the things that we proactively stopped, as well as we're just limited in our ability to take advantage of the franchise that we have. You've seen others that don't have those that don't have those constraints but have the quality franchise as well. You see how they've benefited not just versus us, but versus the broader banking set.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nNo, that's really helpful context, Charlie. Thanks so much for taking my question.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning. On the 2024 NII guide, I understand that you feel better about the NII outlook here, but you're watching customer behavior. I know you did mention loan growth. Did you lower your loan growth outlook that's baked into that guidance this quarter versus what you had in there last quarter? Either way, are you able to help us with what that guide or what that expectation is on the loan growth front?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Yeah, John, it's like what we said in January is that we expected loans to decline in the first half. That's about what we're seeing, right? So again, it's slightly lower than what we modeled, but it's pretty close to sort of our expectation. Then we expected a little bit of growth in the second half of the year. Overall balances weren't going to do much for the full year. So at this point, could we be off on that a little bit maybe? Could it be a little lower? Maybe. Could it be a little higher? Yeah, for sure. But I think the more meaningful drivers this year of where NII ends up is going to come back to deposits, right? What's the level? What's the mix?\nWhat's the pricing look like given where the environment is? I think that'll be the more meaningful place to focus.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. It relates to that and deposit growth expectation that you could share?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, I think, again, it's our full year guidance that we gave you or assumptions we gave you in January, where we thought the commercial side would be pretty flat to where we are, to where we started the year. That's coming in slightly better than what we had modeled. The consumer side, we would likely see a little bit more decline as well as mix shift. Again, that's what you're seeing so far.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nListen, we want to be really careful in all this, right? We're trying to be as transparent as we can be about what we're seeing without getting over our skis and making predictions that none of us have the answers to. When you boil it all down, in terms of the customer activity that we're seeing, a touch less here, a touch more there, there's not a big change from what we said three months ago in terms of flows on the deposits or the lending side.\nIt really is relatively small relative to the big NII picture and what's going to drive NII at this point. So if we saw big changes there, we might say, \"Let's change guidance.\" But it's tweaking along the way, and we'll see how it continues to pan out. Then what we've said is relative to the rate environment, it's just, again, this is a full year number, and we've had a couple of months go by. It's just too early to mark the whole thing to market based upon that. But again, we also wanted to just provide the context, as Mike has said, and I said in my remarks, certainly what we've seen is helpful relative to just the pure overall rate and curve piece of it.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color there. If I could just ask one more along the credit side, the NPA decline is encouraging there, and I know it can be volatile. Can you just maybe talk about NPA inflows? Did you see a pullback there? Did you see that on the CRE side? Is there anything to extract from that? Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, look, I think what you're seeing on the, when you talk about commercial real estate, you're really talking about office. What you saw in the office space is actually it not move at all and get worse or not get worse in the quarter. You actually saw non-performing assets coming down a little bit in the CRE space as we've charged off some loans, and they weren't replaced by other items. That's a positive in the sense that it's not deteriorating at this point. Then everything else is sort of moving around like as you would expect. There's not substantial movements across the rest of the portfolio.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nLarge Cap US Bank Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I want to follow up on the comment that costs this year could come in higher on higher revenues, investment advisory, and I would assume the same if banking and trading continue to be so strong. Obviously, that's a net positive to earnings overall, but how would you frame the operating leverage if you can pick which revenue buckets? But if those market-sensitive revenues are $1 billion higher, is there kind of 40% cost against that, 50%? How would you frame that? Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Really, what we're referring to when we mention that is primarily in the wealth management business, is where we're focused given where market levels are. That business is the cost-to-income ratio is pretty stable there in terms of the revenue-related comp. It's a little less than 50% in terms of how to think about it. So the operating leverage is good.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nLarge Cap US Bank Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Then just specifically on banking and trading, I mean, I know you guys invested in those businesses, so there's upfront costs when the revenues come. But it seems like the operating leverage in that segment has been very, very strong. Is that something that you think can continue if those revenues continue to surprise, or could we see some upward pressure on costs from that, too, again a positive to earnings overall, but yeah, thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, look, I think the cost to invest there, as Charlie noted, is in our numbers, right? So that's already there. So we're already anticipating that. At this point, we don't see that being a big pressure point one way or the other. But obviously, as you note, if revenues far exceed our expectations in a positive way, that would come with a little bit of comp too. So that would be a, but that would be a good thing overall.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nLarge Cap US Bank Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYep. Agreed. Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nLarge Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Hi, Mike. Hi, Charlie. Mike, you touched on your non-interest-bearing deposits decline to about 26% of deposits. Do you guys have a sense what's the long-term normalization level for non-interest-bearing deposits as you look out over the 12-month horizon, assuming rates do not go up? We have stable rates. Maybe they come down a little bit.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Look, I mean, it's a hard thing to say with a whole lot of certainty, Gerard, in terms of exactly where it's going to stabilize. It will stabilize at some point, particularly as you look at the underlying mix of the consumer deposit base, right? A good chunk of our consumer deposits are in accounts less than 250. They're generally operating accounts for a lot of people. So this thing will stabilize as we go. But as you've seen, we've had some pretty consistent ± a little bit each quarter as we've gone through the last number of quarters. But at some point soon, we would expect that to stabilize. But we'll see exactly where it does.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nLarge Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIs it fair to assume that the rate of change in the deposit betas is declining where eventually those deposit betas flatten out as well?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Once you start seeing more stabilization in the mix, that's when you'll see deposit costs on the consumer side stabilize, right? Because what you're seeing now is people, as I mentioned earlier, people are spending money in their checking account, low interest costs for us. Then you're seeing growth in CDs and some of the savings accounts, which are higher costs. That mix shift will stabilize. It's very related to your first question around non-interest-bearing, right? They're kind of related together, right? Once you get to sort of that core operating balance in people's accounts, then that's when you'll see both of those stabilize.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nLarge Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Then just as a follow-up on credit, obviously, you guys put up overall good numbers, and especially in that commercial real estate area, as you highlighted. Coming back to the credit cards, you pointed out that the charge-offs were up, but they're in line with expectations. Assuming the economy does not head into a recession later this year and unemployment goes up to 6%, say it stays around 4%, what are you guys thinking for a peak in net charge-offs for credit cards? When do you think you could reach that?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Look, I think you got to really dig into the underlying dynamics of what's happening in the portfolio, right? We're in the middle of a refresh of our product set. We're seeing faster growth in new accounts and new balances coming on than maybe other players, just given the investments we've been making now for the better part of three years. With that comes some maturation of kind of the new vintages. At some point, that should peak, and you'll start to see sort of the normal behavior. But I'd just come back to, we spent a lot of time looking at each of the underlying vintages here.\nEverything's performing pretty much on top of what we would have expected, or in a couple of cases, maybe slightly better. The quality of the new accounts we're putting on, or the credit quality of them, looks very good and continues to be the case. So I would just say that we're in that normal phase of maturation. As it sort of peaks, we'll sort of let you know when we sort of feel like we're there. But it should be coming over the coming quarters.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nLarge Cap Bank Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nDave Rochester\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banks Analyst, Compass Point Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Appreciate all the color on the NII and loan trend outlook. I was just wondering on the loan side if you've noted any sensitivity at all in activity levels in general among your commercial customers to presidential elections in the past, and how big of a headwind, if any, you think that could be this year?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, that's hard. I think certainly it'll be a factor that people incorporate into their thinking of how aggressive or not they want to be in investments they're making. But at this point, that would be really hard to kind of prove out with any sort of empirical data. I think at this point, what we're seeing most is related to the overall sort of macroeconomic environment we're in with such high rates and people having some uncertainty just generally around where things go from here. But I'm sure that'll factor in at least to a small degree at some point as we go through the year.\n\nDave Rochester\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banks Analyst, Compass Point Research\n\nYeah. Okay. Appreciate that. Then just on the trading line, Matt had mentioned the momentum you've seen earlier. You obviously had a great year in trading last year. You had your strongest quarter yet this year. You've talked about making a lot of investments in the business in recent years. You're still making those now. It seems like you have a lot of momentum in this area where you could grow that this year as well despite having a huge year last year. Just wanted to get your take on all that.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, the environment's going to matter a lot. We've certainly been helped by some of the volatility that we've seen over the last four or five quarters. That could change the outcome quite materially for all of us in the industry and the trading line. So keep that in mind. But as you said, we're continuing to systematically make some investments there. We feel good about that. I think we continue to see some good performance from a market share point of view across those places we've been making the investments. But as Charlie also noted, we're somewhat constrained in some of those businesses.\nWe feel good about the progress that the team has made over the last couple of years.\n\nDave Rochester\n\nManaging Director and Senior Banks Analyst, Compass Point Research\n\nAll right. Great. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question for today will come from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions. Firstly, financial advisors, can you give some color on what those numbers have been doing over the past year, past quarter since that's not disclosed anymore? Are you building? What types of advisors? Yeah. Look, I think we have— Is that new recruits from college? Any color, Mike?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Sure. Sure. As you pointed out, over the last if you go back a couple of years ago, and you definitely saw some declines that we were seeing in the advisor workforce. But Barry Sommers and team have been working really hard to sort of not only stem some of the attrition, but also begin to really ramp up the recruiting again. I think we're starting to see some of that come through. A lot of that, we're back to more normal, maybe slightly below normal attrition levels across the business, which is good. We're feeling very good about our ability to recruit high-quality advisors.\nI think that trend you saw a couple of years ago is definitely different. We'll continue to stay at it. We're mostly focused on experienced advisors, a little less on, as you mentioned, college recruits and that type of thing.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. The only thing—listen, Vivek, this is—I mean, we're recruiting—I mean, it's across the—there's no one prototype here. We've recruited some of the biggest teams in the country that have traded over the last year and a half. These are people that wouldn't have come to Wells Fargo before that because of the issues. It was competitive, and they chose to come here because of our capabilities, not because of what we were willing to pay them. At the same time, we're staffing up in our bank branches, and those are more entry-level people, the people who come out of the banker workforce. It's going to be across the board.\nBut there's no doubt that the trajectory we have with our FA population is very different today than several years ago.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. That's helpful. A completely different question. I want to go back to NII, not to beat a dead horse. But given that higher rates, I mean, sorry, less rate cuts are better for you, if we, so that should help NII now. But if we see rate cuts then eventually in 2025, does that mean that the troughing of NII could get pushed further back?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I mean, look, we'll see, Vivek, where it exactly troughs. Obviously, sort of the exact pace of rate cuts is part of the equation. But we also have to look at sort of the broader trends that we've talked about throughout the call, right? How does a depositor sort of react? Where does the mix shift stabilize? What do we see from a competitive environment? All of that matters as you sort of look at where exactly it's going to trough.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nJohn Campbell\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it. We'll talk to you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."

    "content": "Q4 2023 Wells Fargo & Co Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2023 Wells Fargo & Co Earnings Call\n\nWFCNYSEJAN 12, 10:00 AM\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAlthough our improved 2023 results benefited from the strong economic environment and higher interest rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well. We grew net income and diluted earnings per share, with higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income, as well as higher non-interest income. Our expenses were down from a year ago, benefiting from lower operating losses, as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives. As expected, net charge-offs increased from historical low levels, and our allowance for credit losses increased as well. We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking credit-tightening actions as appropriate. We returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share in the Q3, and we repurchased $12 billion of common stock.\nAverage loans increased modestly, with growth in the first half of the year, offsetting declines later in the year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit-tightening actions. Average deposits were down, driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. The financial health of our consumers remained strong. While average deposit balances per customer continued to decline from their peak, they remained above pre-pandemic levels, as wage growth has more than offset increased spending. Having said that, there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed. Consumer spending remained strong. Credit card spend was up 15% for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year, with growth rates strong across all categories except fuel, which was impacted by lower gas prices. Debit card spending was up 1% for the year. Discretionary spend growth slowed from a year ago, while non-discretionary spend was stable.\nOur risk and control work remains our top priority, and I refer you to the comments I made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, and while it is early and we have more to do, we are starting to see improved growth and increased market share in parts of the company, which we believe will drive higher returns over time. Let me provide just a few examples. Our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average. We've also been investing in the corporate investment bank. CIB revenue grew 26% from a year ago, and our investment banking and trading market shares increased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite.\nAdditionally, continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns and earnings over the next several years. And while our consumer, small, and business banking, commercial banking, and wealth and investment management business remain strong, opportunities to increase share are significant. Other accomplishments include, we launched a new co-branded credit cards with Choice Hotels, building on the new products we've launched over the last couple of years. We continued to enhance our mobile app, which is driving mobile adoption momentum, adding 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increasing mobile logins 11% from a year ago. Consumers interacted over 20 million times last year with Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant. We exceeded our $150 million commitment to help advance racial equity in homeownership. Our special-purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers.\nFor commercial clients, we've continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base. We continue to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank, helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors. Throughout 2023, we added new heads and co-heads of equity capital markets, global mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, financial sponsors, healthcare, and technology, media, and telecom. We've also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we're making in our trading capabilities, including adding talent and improved technology, with a focus on supporting our core clients. Finally, we're launching a partnership with Centerbridge, which helps us provide our middle-market clients with access to alternative sources of capital, another example of how we're providing solutions for our clients.\nInvesting in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in 2024, and Mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call. In 2023, we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities. As I mentioned, we simplified the home lending business, which included exiting the correspondent business. We are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio, as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus. In Q3, we sold private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We also continue to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year, and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation. As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the US.\neconomy, but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle. We are closely monitoring credit, and while we've seen modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations. Our capital position remains strong, and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2024, but I'd like to make a couple of points. First, we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year, and given that we remain modestly asset-sensitive, the implied Fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for NII. Significant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate actions.\nMike will give you our expectations for net interest income, but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions, which may be right or may be wrong. We hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful. Second, we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses, but there are several moving pieces, which Mike will walk you through. We will continue to invest what's necessary for our risk and control work. We continue to realize expense efficiencies, and at this point, we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in the future. Our expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point. Decisions on how much to invest are dynamic. We closely monitor the outcomes of our investments, and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see.\nWe are focused on our shorter-term results but remain committed to building a well-managed, faster-growing, and higher-return company over the medium and longer term. I have said and I remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share and returns across all of our businesses. We believe the actions we have taken and continue to take provide a path to 15% ROTCE. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for the dedication, talent, and all they do to move our company forward. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. Mike, over to you.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, Charlie. Good morning, everyone. The first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year, some of which Charlie highlighted, so I'm going to start with our Q4 financial results on slide four. Net income for the Q4 was $3.4 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share. Our Q4 results included $1.9 billion, or $0.40 per share for the FDIC special assessment, and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million, or $0.20 per share for planned actions. These expenses were partially offset by $621 million, or $0.17 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior-period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on slide five, our CET1 ratio increased to 11.4% in the Q4, 2.5% points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers.\nThis increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed securities spreads. During the Q4, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock. We repurchased a total of $12 billion in common stock in 2023, and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in 2024. We will continue to consider current market conditions, including interest rate movements, risk-weighted assets levels, stress test results, as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters. Turning to credit quality on slide seven, as expected, net loan charge-offs increased up 17 basis points, from the Q3, to 53 basis points of average loans, driven by commercial real estate, office, and credit card loans.\nThe increase in commercial net loan charge-offs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office, while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable from the Q3. As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak. The losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance. Lower appraisals were the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss. We substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout 2023 as credit-sized and non-performing assets increased, and while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters, given market fundamentals and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector, the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic.\nOur Commercial Real Estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to de-risk and reduce exposure, and we're using this information to evaluate our allowance, which I will discuss later. Consumer net loan charge-offs continue to increase, and we're up $118 million from the Q3 to 79 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by the credit card portfolio, which performed as expected, with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing. Non-performing assets increased 3% from the Q3 as growth in commercial non-accrual loans more than offset declines in consumer. The increase in Commercial Real Estate non-accrual loans was driven by a $567 million increase in office non-accrual loans. Moving to slide eight, our allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the Q4, driven by an increase for credit card and Commercial Real Estate loans, partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans.\nThe table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. While the charge-offs we took in the Q4 were contemplated in our allowance, we were still early in the cycle, and after going through our quarterly review process, the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio remained relatively stable at 11%. On slide nine, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the Q3 and a year ago. Credit card loans continued to grow, while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 122 basis points from a year ago and 12 basis points from the Q3, reflecting the higher interest rate environment.\nAverage deposits declined 3% from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in our other deposit gathering businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Period-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up $4.2 billion from the Q3 as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in wealth and investment management for the first time in over a year, as well as higher commercial deposits, which included our efforts to attract clients' operational deposits. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 22 basis points from the Q3 to 158 basis points, with higher deposit costs across all operating segments. The pace of the increase was similar to the Q3.\nOur mix of deposits continued to shift, with our percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits declining to 27%. Turning to net interest income on slide 10, Q4 net interest income declined $662 million, or 5% from a year ago, due to lower deposit and loan balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. I'll provide details on our 2024 net interest income expectations later on the call. Turning to expenses on slide 11, while our Q4 non-interest expense included the FDIC special assessment and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million for planned actions, expenses declined from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses. While most of the planned actions should result in lower headcount, some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy, which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits but may not always reduce headcount.\nTotal expenses increased from the Q3 driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher severance expense. Personnel expense increased $554 million from the Q3 as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits, and incentive compensation expense, including certain year-end adjustments, as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower headcount. Turning to our operating segment, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 12, consumer small and business banking revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. We've been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers, which includes driving digital adoption, simplifying our product portfolio, and using technology to automate our operating environment.\nAs our customers continue to shift to lower-cost channels, resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes, we've reduced our total number of branches by over 280, or 6% from a year ago. At the same time, we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multi-year effort to transform and refresh our full branch network. I'll highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call. Home lending revenue increased 7% from a year ago. Lower gain-on-sale margins and originations, as well as lower loan balances, were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the Q4 of 2022. We continued to reduce headcount home lending in the Q4, down 36% from a year ago, reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy.\nCredit card revenue declined 1% from a year ago, driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense, partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 17% from a year ago. Auto revenue declined 19% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression, and personal lending revenue was up 13% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on slide 13, mortgage originations declined 69% from a year ago and 30% from the Q3, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business, as well as the decline in the mortgage market.\nAs we executed on our strategic objectives, we've also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third-party loans serviced, down 18% from a year ago. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for seven consecutive quarters, and balances were down 11% at the end of the Q4 compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 34% year over year, reflecting credit-tightening actions. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago, with both discretionary and non-discretionary spend up 2%, with growth in most categories except for home improvement, fuel, and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong, was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew with double-digit growth rates in every category except fuel, home improvement, and department apparel.\nTurning to commercial banking results on slide 14, middle-market banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit-related fees, reflecting lower earnings credit rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 9% year over year due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments. Average loan balances were up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset-based lending and leasing. Turning to corporate and investment banking on slide 15, banking revenue increased 15% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, and stronger treasury management results. As Charlie highlighted, we've successfully hired experienced bankers, which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve.\nCommercial Real Estate revenue grew 2% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products, and commodities. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate. On Slide 16, Wealth and Investment Management revenue declined 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower Net Interest Income, driven by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. The decline in Net Interest Income from a year ago was partially offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIMP advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so Q4 results reflected market valuations as of 1 October 2023, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the Q1 will reflect valuations as of 1 January 2024, which were also higher from a year ago. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, driven by a decline in securities-based lending. Slide 17 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the operating segments. This decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments. Turning to our expectations for 2024, starting on slide 18, let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income.\nAs we look forward, there are a number of factors that could impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening, and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior, and competitive behavior, to name just a few, all of which we have little to no control over. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate net interest income for 2024. There is more uncertainty than usual, given the market's strong view of rate cut timing and the quantum. Looking at our results, while we had strong growth in full-year net interest income in 2023 versus 2022, our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year, driven by the higher deposit pricing and mix changes. You can see this impact when you analyze our Q4 net interest income, which was down approximately 3% from our full-year 2023 net interest income of $52.4 billion.\nOur current expectation is that full-year 2024 net interest income could potentially be approximately 7% to 9% lower than our full-year 2023.\nThis expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions, including lower rates in the recent forward rate curve, which, given our modestly asset-sensitive position, would be a headwind to net interest income. A slight decline in average loans for the full year, which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year. Reinvestment of lower-yielding securities runoff into higher-yielding assets, which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio. Further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits, as well as continued mix shift from lower-yielding products to higher-yielding. Deposits in our other deposit gathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable, and market funding would replace the decline in consumer deposits as needed. We currently expect that net interest income will trough towards the end of this year.\nAs we've done in prior years, we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2024 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix, and pricing, and loan demand. Turning to our 2024 expense expectations on slide 19, we started our focus on efficiency initiatives three years ago, and we've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $10 billion of gross expenses. Through our efficiency initiatives, we have reduced headcount every quarter since Q3 2020, and headcount is down 16% since the end of 2020.\nLooking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported $55.6 billion of non-interest expense in 2023, which included the $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment. Excluding this item, expenses would have been $53.6 billion, which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of 2024 expenses. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $1.3 billion lower, driven by the $969 million expense we took in the Q4 for planned actions. We expect expenses to increase by at least $300 million due to higher revenue-related expense driven by Wealth and Investment Management. Revenue-related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity and market levels and therefore could be higher or lower than this estimate.\nAt this point, we expect all other expenses to be flat, though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation. We expect approximately $2.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2024 due to the efficiency initiatives. We highlight on the slide some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond 2024. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives, and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure. While we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest, and we expect approximately $1.1 billion of incremental technology and equipment expense, reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years, as well as new investments planned for 2024.\nWe also expect merit increases of approximately $700 million, which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries. We highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide. Our 2024 expense outlook includes ongoing business-related operating losses of approximately $1.3 billion, similar to the level we had in 2023. As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. So putting this all together, we expect 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. It's important to note that while we've made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, as Charlie highlighted, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. Given how critical it is to continue to invest in our business, on slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for 2024. Let me highlight a few.\nBuilding the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the technology investments we've already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year throughout our businesses. We are planning to hire more bankers and advisors to grow our Wells Fargo Premier offering to our affluent clients. We plan to launch a new travel-oriented credit card as part of our Autograph suite of products, as well as a new small business credit card this year. To better serve our commercial clients, we plan to continue to hire within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth. Now, let me conclude with slide 21, where we will discuss return on tangible common equity.\nWhen we first discussed our path to improving returns on the Q4 2020 Earnings Call, we had an 8% ROTCE. Since then, we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns, including executing on our efficiency initiatives, investing in our businesses to help drive growth, and returning excess capital to shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 to 0.35 per share and repurchasing $32 billion of common stock. These actions help to improve our ROTCE. Our reported ROTCE in the Q4 was 9%, but as we highlight in the table, our ROTCE was impacted by a number of notable items. Our 2023 returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth. As I've already highlighted, we expect net interest income to decline this year.\nWe still believe we have an achievable path to a sustainable 15% ROTCE over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company. There are several key factors that support our belief: our ability to return excess capital. We currently have a significant amount of excess capital, 2.5% points above our regulatory minimum buffers for CET1. We expect to increase our share repurchases this year. I highlighted the progress we've already made to reposition our home lending business, including reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans serviced by 18% from a year ago. As we continue to streamline this business, we expect the profitability to improve. We've grown our credit card business with balances up 40% since the end of 2021 and new accounts 25% higher than the Q4 of 2021.\nHowever, the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition costs and allowance bills, and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures. Finally, we've made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers and help drive growth. We expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like Corporate Investment Banking and Wealth and Investment Management will help fund additional investments. So we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns. In summary, our results in 2023 demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance. We grew revenue, reduced expenses, increased capital returns to shareholders, and maintained our strong capital position. We will now take your questions.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAt this time, we will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star then one and record your name and institution at the prompt. If at any time your question has been answered, you can remove your request by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one for questions at this time. And our first question of the day will come from Steven Schubeck of Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open.\n\nSteven Schubeck\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. So, happy New Year. Mike, I appreciate all the NII detail. Just given all the different puts and takes that you cited, I was hoping you could provide some context as to how you're thinking about the exit rate for NII in 2024 per the guidance. Just given expectations per the street that NII should inflect positively in 2025, just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking about where NII could potentially trough or stabilize based on the forward curve.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. No, I appreciate the question. Based on what we gave you, Steve, I think we said on the page and in my remarks that we do expect it to start to inflect and trough as we get towards the end of the year. Exactly when that happens, I think we'll sort of see. We're not going to get too specific there, but we do expect that you would start to see a trough as we get to the end of the year and into 2025.\n\nSteven Schubeck\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nVery helpful. Then just for my follow-up, just on expenses, the core expense guidance shows another net reduction in 2024. You noted that you're making investments, but those will be offset by efficiency savings. Just want to get a sense as to how long you can sustain that modest core expense trajectory, continue to fund investments with future efficiencies.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I think when we think about the efficiency journey that we're on, I think Charlie and I have been both pretty clear consistently now that there's more to do. And 2024 is just another year in the journey, right? And we've got more to do post that to continue to drive efficiency across the place. Where we're going to net out on a year-to-year basis in terms of the net spend, I'm not going to try to predict. But as you look across the company, I think we're just continuing to methodically make progress to drive automation, efficiency, reduce third-party spend, reduce our real estate footprint across all of the different dimensions. And I think we think we've got more to do, and that'll continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nSteven Schubeck\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi, good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask about the fee income drivers for this year. Charlie mentioned, obviously, some examples of progress that you've gotten leverage on investments. And then, obviously, you've got cyclical headwinds and tailwinds. So maybe just could you walk through some of the bigger fee income drivers and give your sense of puts and takes and how you're feeling this year going into the fee revenue outlook?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks, John. When you look at the components there, I mean, the largest one is going to be our advisory fees in the wealth and investment management business. And market levels are higher than they were this time last year. And so if that holds or gets better, as many people are predicting, that should be constructive for that fee. When you start looking at the other line items like trading, the market's got to cooperate. We're happy with the progress we've been making across the different businesses there, but the market's going to have to cooperate as well for that to continue. We had a number of impairments across our venture capital portfolio this year. At some point, that should start to peter out, and we'll see that inflect.\nAnd then the other fee lines should be pretty predictable for the most part as you sort of look forward.\n\nSteven Schubeck\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And just to follow up on the net interest income idea of bottoming towards the end of the year, theoretically, what would be the drivers of that kind of bottoming? Do you have fixed asset reprice that helps, or is it kind of assumed new asset generation? Maybe you could just wrap that into some thoughts about what would drive that inflection in the context of any update on rate sensitivity as well. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Yeah, sure. Maybe I'll start with the latter part first. As you can see in the data we gave in the presentation, we're anchoring it to what was in the forward curve as of day last week, which is not that dissimilar to what you have today. I think when you look at sensitivity to that, our interest rate sensitivity disclosures, in this case, are a pretty good estimate for how to think about whether if rates are a little bit higher or a little bit lower than what's in that forward curve. If you look at where we were at the end of the Q3, we were still modestly asset sensitive. That'll still be the case at the end of the Q4. It will come down a little bit from where it was, but it will still be asset sensitive.\nBut if you look at the forward curve, I think on average, rates are coming down something like 50 basis points. And so it is pretty linear math when you look at the sensitivities that we include in the Q. When you look at the underlying assumptions as you go into the year, we've got loan growth being pretty muted in the beginning part of the year. That'll hopefully start to pick up as we get later in the year. So that will be a driver of it as you get towards the end of the year. You'll have some stabilization. We're expecting stabilization of pretty stable deposits across the commercial and the wealth management businesses. At some point, the consumer deposits will also stabilize, and the mix will stabilize as well. You've got continued asset repricing that happens in there as well.\nSo it's a little bit of all of it that brings you to the point at which it starts to trough and inflect. But again, exactly when that's going to happen, we'll sort of leave to later in the year. But we do expect that that'll happen as we get closer to the end of the year.\n\nSteven Schubeck\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nUnderstood. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Huston of Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nKen Huston\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, thanks. I'm sorry if I'm going to stay on theme, but just as you start to the beginning of the year and deposit price continues to flow through and the mix continues to change as far as the DDAs, I'm wondering if you could help us understand how you expect that trajectory. DDAs definitely still outflowing, which is expected. But in terms of mix and then just how you expect the deposit rate of change or the downside beta to act through this cycle, can you help us understand that, Mike? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. When you look at what's happening just on deposits, the trend that we've been seeing now on the mix shift has been pretty consistent for the last two or three quarters, at least. And so at some point, that'll moderate more, but it's been pretty consistent. And so that's probably a decent assumption as you sort of go into the first part of the year, at least. When you start looking at deposit pricing kind of later in the year as rates start to move, on the commercial side, rates and betas have been competitive now and pretty high for a while. And they'll be just as rate sensitive on the way back down. That's part of the bargain on the commercial side is you get good competitive betas on the way up, and you also get them on the way down.\nOn the consumer side, there's been less movement on standard pricing across many of the products. But you've had the introduction of CDs and promo rates, and all that stuff will start to move down pretty quickly as the expectation for rates do as well.\n\nKen Huston\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay. So if I think about that, then would you imply that the Q1 starting point, we see a little bit more of an NII step down, and then as you get to that hopeful stabilization in the H2, just because of how that moves?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, I think based on what we gave you, right? So we are expecting full-year NII to be down 7% to 9%, hopefully. And if it starts to stabilize as you get to the end of the year, then that implies a step down in the beginning of the year. Exactly. We're not going to give you a number by quarter, but you should expect a step down as you go in the beginning part of the year.\n\nKen Huston\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nRight. Okay. I understand. Okay. Thanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Schafers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Schafers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to spend just another moment on the longer-term cost opportunity. I guess I'm just curious if there's a point where some of the investment spending pressure is eased and there might still be an opportunity for costs to decline more visibly on an underlying basis. Or by contrast, is this level of investment spending, is that something that'll just be sort of pretty consistent year in and year out?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Scott, it really is going to depend. I will highlight one thing, though. In the slide that we have there, I noted that part of what's driving the investment spend this year is the tech and equipment line moving up. And so that won't continue to move up at that pace forever. And so that does start to moderate as you go out into the future. But as you look at the other investments we're making, we're going to try to be very thoughtful about looking at the opportunities that we have across each of the businesses, thinking about short, medium, long-term results, and making sure that we're sort of calibrating all that, right? But I would expect us to continue to make investments in each of the businesses. And I think that ultimately, that's what's going to drive great returns and better performance over time.\n\nScott Schafers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on credit. You all have been very proactive in dealing with sort of the office CRE situation. Just curious to hear what your thoughts are on how this cycle, that asset class sort of plays out from here. Does it just remain a long slog, or is there perhaps a point where your conservatism has sort of gotten ahead of issues and you might actually be able to relieve a bit of that really healthy double-digit reserve?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Look, as we look at the reserve, and then I'll come back to the broader point there, at some point, we'll start using the reserve more fully, and then that allowance coverage ratio will come down, no doubt. I mean, that's the way it should work when you think about CECL and the way the accounting should work. I think in terms of your broader point, it's a long movie. We're past the opening credits, but we're still in the beginning of the movie. And so it's going to take some time for this to play out. And as I noted, it'll be somewhat of an uneven and episodic sort of nature to the charge-offs, and as you work through this, because every property has a different timeline in terms of events that it needs to sort of work through.\nSo I do think that we've got a while for this to play out through the system.\n\nScott Schafers\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you very much.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ibrahim Punawalla of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nIbrahim Punawalla\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. I guess maybe just to thank for all the details on NII expenses and the ROTCE. I guess if you're to—and it's not lost upon anyone with regards to the investments you made in the franchise. But when you look at the slide, Q4 2020, ROTCE 8%, three years fast forward, it's gone from 8% to 9%. Assuming there's no real perfect world to operate a bank, from a shareholder perspective, quickly, do you think we can get from 9% to 15%? You've given us the moving pieces, but I'm just wondering, maybe Charlie, Mike, how do you think about it? Is it a two-year slog? Is it longer than that? Love some perspective there.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. And I think maybe I'll start, and Charlie can chime in. So I think when you look at that page, Ibrahim, I think you really have to look at the impact of the special assessment that's in the results, right? And so that's 4% points of ROTCE. So think of the underlying operating performance from a returns perspective more closer to that 13% range. And so there has been quite a bit of progress since Q4 2020. And then as you sort of look forward, we highlighted some of the key drivers on the right. And in my commentary, look, we've got a lot of excess capital despite whatever happens with Basel III. And so we've got room to continue to return that to shareholders.\nWe are in the middle of repositioning the home lending business, which will drive not only better returns in that business, but improvement across the franchise. We've got the card business, which we're seeing very good performance in as we've launched our new products over the last couple of years. And as that matures, we'll be a meaningful contributor. And then we've got to continue to get the benefit of all the other investments that we're making. And so we feel like we've made a lot of good progress since 2020. And then we've got really clear plans to continue to see better performance.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nI'll just add a little bit to it, and to be a little bit repetitive. When you look at that slide again, those are reported numbers. So the way we think about it is the earnings power of the company today on an ROTCE basis. You got to make your own assumptions for what's in and out and what normalized net interest income is because we've been clear that we've been over-earning. But when you add back these expenses like FDIC, which relate to the past and this quarter and aren't going to go forward, our ROTCE is up 50% from where it was. So that is significant change.\nOn top of that, when we look at the actions, as Mike said, that we've taken in the home lending business, when we see the trajectory of growth that we're seeing in the card business, just as those things mature, let alone being able to deploy the excess capital we have, those are things that are in process. We don't have to really do anything more other than let them mature and let them play out. That is continued movement towards the 15% ROTCE. And then the last thing I'd say is just away from those things. When we got here, these businesses were not on trajectories to grow. The card business wasn't growing. The corporate investment bank wasn't growing. You can go through them one by one.\nAnd so, as we've talked about making investments, offsetting some of these efficiencies that we've seen, and making determinations on whether or not they're paying off, those things that we're seeing, these increases in share, we're pretty confident that they are going to continue to drive improved results over time. As I said in my remarks, we're clearly susceptible to the market environment, both for interest rates and the overall economic environment in the shorter term. But we feel both really good about the progress that we've made. We feel really good about what the path we see going forward is, recognizing that there's still a lot more that we have to do.\n\nIbrahim Punawalla\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. That is terrific. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up, Mike, on CRE. I'm assuming you had some assets moved off the balance sheet. I'm just wondering, today, relative to a year ago, do you have better visibility on where the clearing price is for some of these non-performing CRE or challenged CRE loans? And are you seeing any pressure spreading beyond CRE assets to other parts of the portfolio in any meaningful way? Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, look, as time goes by, we get better and better information around where things are going to play out. But it is still somewhat specific to the asset. And so I wouldn't try to generalize yet until we see more transactions and more data points. When you look at the broader CRE market, at least in our portfolio, we are not seeing the stress spread to other parts of it.\n\nIbrahim Punawalla\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHelpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Erica Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Ibrahim's line of questioning on ROTCE. Charlie, Mike's right. Obviously, you have plenty of excess capital. As we think about your outlook for not much loan growth in 2024, and obviously, there's the asset cap still in place, how should we think about what you're looking for as guideposts to potentially accelerate that buyback from the $2.4 billion level? Is it as far out as the Basel III endgame finalization, or would you wait for more clarity near-term on the DFAST results in June?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nIt's Mike. I'll take a shot at that, Erica. When you look at our full-year numbers, I tried to highlight in my comments that we do expect that our repurchases will be higher than what we did in 2023. The exact timing and pace, I'm not going to get into, but, and then we'll look at all of, as we do every quarter, we look at all of the different risks that could be out there, including thinking about where CCAR or the stress tests will come out. From a Basel III perspective, we are in really good shape. As we said last quarter, we're already above where we need to be if it was fully implemented as is, and we're hopeful that that won't be the case. We're going to generate more capital as we go through the year.\nAnd so we've got, as I said, we've got plenty of excess capital. We plan to buy back more stock than we did in 2023, and we'll leave the exact timing and pace to future calls.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Mike, my follow-up question is another one on NII. I did notice that your short-term borrowings went up a lot in 2023. Just looking at the asset side, it seemed like it was funding that increase in liquidity to $204 billion in cash at the Fed at period end. I'm wondering, as we're thinking about your liability mix in 2024, and then I think your average balance sheet size was $1.91 trillion at the end of the year. I'm just wondering if we should expect the balance sheet to shrink because you may not need all those short-term borrowings, or is there a reason why you feel like you want to hold that much liquidity at the Fed at this time?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, it's certainly possible the balance sheet will get smaller throughout the year. I think that'll just be a function of what we ultimately see on loan growth, how much we end up deploying into securities as we go through the year. Where it makes sense, we will just let the balance sheet just ebb and flow back down. I think that's the way we're thinking about it now. I think at this point, there's not a lot of cost to leaving at the Fed, given where RRP is. That'll change as rates start to come down, and we'll calibrate the overall size based on what we think the opportunity is.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning. On the NII outlook of down 7% to 9%, can you maybe help us think about the expected net interest margin trajectory through the year, how we should think about that in the context of what you're expecting in terms of earning asset yields and the dynamic on funding costs? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, we're not going to try to predict exactly where the NIM's going to go quarter by quarter. But I think, as you would guess, right, assuming the balance sheets at a relatively stable size, as NII starts to come down, the NIM will compress, right? And there'll be tailwinds and headwinds related. As the securities portfolio reprices, that'll be a tailwind. As you start to see variable-rate loans come down, as rates come down, that'll be a headwind. And so I think most of it should be relatively simple to kind of estimate as you sort of plug the assumptions into your model. But there's no sort of magic to it. But you would expect NIM to continue to come down as the balance sheet stays stable and NII comes down.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI",
    "content2": "Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately on commercial real estate, can you maybe give us a little more color in terms of where you saw the stress, what types of office properties, and what type of marks to the underlying assets are you seeing as you're reappraising the properties? And does that give you a—I guess, maybe just talk about the level of confidence you have in the updated 7.9% office reserve at this level?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. And really, the allowance coverage ratio I would pay attention to on the slide is our CIB, CRE office portfolio, which is close to 11%. And that's really the institutional-style office buildings where really the stress is coming through. When you look at the charge-offs, it was across a number of properties. It wasn't one or two. It was pretty geographically dispersed across different cities and across different parts of the country. So there wasn't an over-concentration anywhere. Each of the properties have very specific situations. And so there was a pretty wide range in terms of where the price cleared or where the appraisal came in. A good chunk of these, a good chunk of these properties are being marked because we've got new appraisals for various reasons. A small amount of it was actually realized because the note or the property was sold.\nAnd so for a good amount of it, we'll see how it ultimately plays out. There could be recoveries as we go. But it was a pretty, as you would expect, it was a substantial decline in what people thought the value of the properties was just a year or two ago.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Got it. Thanks, Mike.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, Mike. Good morning, Charlie.\nMike, on the guide for the net interest income on the forward curve, if the forward curve is incorrect and we're sitting here a year from now and rather than seeing a 4.15% or 4.16% Fed funds rate, if it's close to the 5% or 4.90%, how much of a positive would that be for a higher net interest income for you guys? Have you guys, I'm assuming you use different sensitivity analysis to kind of give yourself a sense of where net interest income could go under different rate scenarios?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. I would, just like I think John McDonald asked it earlier, look at our interest rate sensitivity, Gerard. As I said, we're still modestly asset-sensitive, a little bit less at the end of the Q4 than the Q3. I think it is a pretty linear sort of equation there. So I would just look at the 100 basis point move that we have in there. It's around a couple billion dollars of move when you look at that as of the end of the Q3. Again, it'll come in slightly from that, likely at the end of the Q4. Just use whatever assumption you want. It is a pretty linear, within reason, equation.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Then you guys obviously have been very focused on the expense reduction and the abnormal jobs since you guys all got there, obviously. Is there any way that you could bring down the operating losses? I think they've been pretty consistent at $1.3 billion for a bit. Is there anything in there that down the road you could change where it would actually fall, or is it just something that's just the cost of doing business with fraud, theft, and etc.?\nWell, there's certainly some portion of that that will, it's just the cost of doing business. Now, even on the fraud and BAU operating losses, we, as most people, I would think, are continuing to invest in capabilities to reduce those more and more. And we continue to do that as well. And then I think as we continue to put more of the issues, historical issues behind us, hopefully the overall number continues to trend downward.\nGreat. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Any thoughts on where card charge-offs go in 2024? I think you're about 4% this quarter. And I guess you've had really good growth. So if we lag it like we used to do in the old days, maybe we get about 4.5%. I don't know if that's a good starting point or just any way to frame losses from here. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Yeah. I won't give you a specific number, but the way you're thinking about it is exactly right. I think as you look at the portfolio that we have, which might be a little different than others, is we launched the new product set starting a little over two years ago, but you've sort of seen more meaningful new account growth starting about two years ago. And so you're in that normal maturation curve and seasoning of sort of losses as they come on. And so we would expect that it would continue to trend a little bit higher from where it is.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd then we're seeing this, obviously, not just with you guys, but kind of across the board in terms of car losses go up, even though we're still in this really good environment in terms of employment, wealth, and still a little bit of excess savings. Just thoughts on what's driving losses, again, not just for you, but just for everybody. There's life events that always happen, but it just feels like maybe car losses are getting a little higher than I would have thought with unemployment where it is. And again, jobs available and all those dynamics. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. And maybe I'll start. And I think as Charlie kind of highlighted in his script, the averages all look fine when you look at liquidity or deposit balances. And certainly, even when you look at the cumulative wage growth that you've seen over the last few years, the, in aggregate, you go, \"Oh, it paints a pretty good picture.\" But when you go below that, and we've tried to highlight this a few times over the last year or so, when you go below that, there are certainly cohorts of clients or people that are stressed. And the further you go down in income levels or the further you go down in wealth levels, the cumulative impact of inflation has really taken a toll. And so you're going to have some percentage of people that are feeling much more stressed than what the aggregate numbers would imply.\nIn some cases, their liquidity is going to be lower than it was pre-COVID. In some cases, they've been having to build bigger credit card balances. And so for us, it's not a big part of the overall portfolio, but you're going to continue to see that, which is something we should all have expected and expect to see as you go forward.\n\nCharlie Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd the only thing I would add is that that is something that has always, let me say, always existed pre-COVID, right? There were always people that were doing better, and there were people that were doing worse. And I think what's important, I feel speaking for ourselves when we look at our, when we look at our card losses, what we actually are looking at is how they're performing on a vintage basis versus pre-COVID levels. And the curves are right on top of what that is. And so when we talk about getting back to normal in terms of what we're seeing, that's what we're actually seeing in card losses. We're not seeing at this point anything that goes beyond that.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze in, remind me the targeted customer.\nI think it's like five plus, but any way to frame that in terms of whether it's FICO or wealth metric or homeowner percent or any way just to frame it? It is becoming a bigger part of the company, obviously. So thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Look, we're not going to get that specific, but when you look at individual products, they're targeted towards different cohorts of clients. But what I would say overall, we feel really good about the credit quality of the new accounts we're putting on. And in most cases and most products, the credit profile is better than what we have from the historical backbook.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thanks for all the cover.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open.\n\nDave Rochester\n\nAnalyst, Compass Point Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Sorry for one more question on the NII guide here, but was just curious how much of that decline that you're expecting for this year is driven by that continued remix of deposits and the lower non-interest-bearing deposits you talked about, and where are you assuming that that DDA mix settles out this year?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. As you would guess, when you lose non-interest-bearing deposits or they shift into higher-yielding products, that's going to have a pretty substantial impact. And so that is a big driver of what the decline is for the rest of the year. We won't get it. We haven't really talked about exactly where it bottoms, but it should stabilize at some point.\n\nDave Rochester\n\nAnalyst, Compass Point Research\n\nOkay. Then on capital, was curious what more buybacks means for capital ratios and that 2.5% buffer you talked about by the end of 2024, all else equal. Is the thought that you'll take those ratios and that buffer lower this year?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWe'll see. I think I won't try to give you a buyback number. Lots of things go into figuring that out throughout the year. As we said, we expect buybacks to be bigger than last year. The level, assuming that nothing significant happens in the macro environment, the level that we're at is higher than we need to be.\n\nDave Rochester\n\nAnalyst, Compass Point Research\n\nGreat. Thanks. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Two quick ones from me. I know you said your guide includes stable deposits, but a shift towards interest-bearing deposits. Would an end-to-QT stop that share shift, or is it different given you're seeing that share shift from the consumer side?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. What we said is we expect stable deposits on the wealth and the commercial side. We do expect some declines on the consumer side. An end to QT would be a positive.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nCan you expand on that a little bit? Why would that be?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, at some point, more meaningfully drain liquidity out of the banking system, right? So once you get the RRP facility down to a smaller number, which is likely to happen, then any further QT starts to really remove liquidity more directly out of the banking system. And so if that stops, that's a positive for deposits.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Okay. And then just on credit, how do falling rates impact your outlook for CRE losses? At the margin, do you feel better about working with borrowers and mitigating losses in NPLs and how long this takes to work out, or have things not changed that meaningfully yet?\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nHasn't changed that meaningfully yet. Really, we're dealing with what is a structural change in sort of demand for real estate in some parts of the country. So you got to work through that. And then I think on the margin, lower rates are helpful, but the bigger issue needs to get worked through first.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we'll conclude.\n\nMike Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. Thanks, everyone, for the questions. See you next time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. Revenue, pretax provision profit, net income, diluted earnings per common share and ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses.\nAs expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, and we increased our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand, and we've continued to take some credit tightening actions.\nAverage deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter.\nNow let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control work, which remains our top priority. As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the date the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation.\nThe work is not finalized all at once. It's not as if there's a big bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort. We are implementing changes throughout the life of the project, and we track effectiveness along the way.\nThe numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. We remain focused on the work ahead even as we are making progress. But I will repeat what I've said in the past: regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions.\nWe also continued to take steps to advance our business strategy, which includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers.\nAs a leader in U.S. middle-market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle-market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value-creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions. Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our network, but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise.\nLast week, we announced we are expanding our branch network in Chicago, where we only have 7 branches today. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app. And in the third quarter, we launched Stock Fractions, giving Wells trade clients the ability to buy fractions of company's stocks to help build a diversified portfolio regardless of stock price.\nJust yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers. Available on the mobile app, LifeSync is our personalized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was launched to all Wealth and Investment Management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync will be visible to bankers to enhance need-based conversations.\nWe also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels. We are seeing more mobile adoption momentum, adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since first quarter of 2021.\nWe've also continued to make important hires who bring expertise to Wells Fargo and businesses we're looking to grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, Vice Chairman of Public Affairs, who's retiring at the end of this year for all he has accomplished since he joined the company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company, and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors.\nDuring this time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our reputation both locally and nationally.\nI'm pleased to have announced that Tom Janis joined Wells Fargo as Vice Chairman earlier this month. Tom will be a close adviser to the senior management team on a range of issues, and he will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead.\nWe continue to invest in our Corporate Investment Banking business with new co-heads of equity capital markets. These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also hired a new Head of Trust Services and Chief Fiduciary Officer in our Wealth and Investment Management segment and a new Head of Affluent and Premier Banking in consumer, small and business banking.\nWe also continue to focus on better serving our communities. During the third quarter, we published 3 reports that provide an overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in communities we serve; outline our strategic approach to managing the risks associated with climate change in deploying capital to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and presenting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment.\nWe continue to make progress on our special-purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We recently expanded our special-purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers with Wells Fargo mortgages to refinance at a lower than market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement.\nWe also announced that we're offering a $10,000 homebuyer access grant that will be applied towards down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently within work purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in 8 metropolitan areas. And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers of Wells Fargo branches, including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. The centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching.\nLooking ahead, the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor strength -- from the labor market and strength in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given there is still significant uncertainty ahead.\nRegarding capital, the Basel III endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected. It's a complicated set of rules. But at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that we are hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120-day comment period.\nAdditionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules. Fortunately, we come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers. However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules.\nAt this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1, as appropriate, increase our dividend and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, the finalization of the proposed rules and economic conditions.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14 basis point benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments and lower risk-weighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.\nDuring the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the volatile [ freeing ] proposal released in the third quarter. Based on where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in RWAs and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes.\nImportantly, this is an early estimate, subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio, while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. As we expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase, up 4 basis points from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate.\nWe had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak. Our CRE teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures.\nAs we highlighted in the past, each property situation is different and the remaining variables that could determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio. As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries, while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows.\nNonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios. The decline in commercial industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns, which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs. The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual loan.\nMoving to Slide 6. Our allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter. However, we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio.\nWe've not seen significant increases in charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet. However, we do expect higher losses over time, and we continue to increase the coverage ratio in our commercial and -- our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other portfolios declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Average deposits also declined in Commercial Banking, while they stabilized in Corporate and Investment Banking.\nAs expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter of 236 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. However, the pace of the increase has slowed, and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29% but remained above prepandemic levels.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $58 million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates.\nLast quarter, we increased our expectations for full year 2023 net interest income growth to approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of the year. We now expect full year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022 with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline in interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our assumptions for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and increased 1% from the second quarter driven by higher operating losses, severance expense and revenue-related comp. Last quarter, we updated our expectations for full year 2023 noninterest expense excluding operating losses to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects additional severance and other onetime costs, revenue-related compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves.\nWe've reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, and it was down 3% in the second quarter and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count and attrition has remained low, which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process.\nAdditionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year was finalized in the fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. Charlie highlighted the investments we were making in our Chicago branch network, and we're also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network.\nAdditionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy experience for our customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from a year ago.\nHome lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower originations in servicing income, which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights. We continue to reduce head count in home lending in the third quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline.\nCredit card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above prepandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 22% from a year ago, reflecting the continued success of our new products and increased marketing. Importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. While the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers that are new to Wells Fargo.\nAuto revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 18% in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year, including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers as well as borrowers and minority communities. We did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter.\nThe size of our auto portfolio has declined for 6 consecutive quarters, and balances were down 9% at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volumes declined 24% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continue to shift towards higher FICO scores, reflecting the credit tightening actions we've taken over the past year.\nDebit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel, home improvement and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel, which rebounded after declining in the second quarter.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 23% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 3% year-over-year due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in asset-based line leasing. Average loans were down 1% in the second quarter due to declines in Middle Market Banking. After increasing the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago.\nTurning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from a year ago driven by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we've continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve.\nCommercial real estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products and foreign exchange. We've had strong trading results for 3 consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business.\nAverage loans were down 5% from a year ago driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand payoffs and modestly lower line utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago driven by higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives as well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared to both the second quarter and a year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM, Wealth and Investment Management, advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments, including the investments and funds that we sold in the third quarter. The sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our Visa B common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue.\nIn summary, our results in the third quarter reflected a continued improvement in our financial performance. During the first 9 months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pretax provision profit and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows, and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year primarily for CRE office loans and higher credit for loan balances. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders.\nWe will now take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We had solid results in the quarter with revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, diluted earnings per share and ROTCE all higher than a year ago. The revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher non-interest income. While our efficiency ratio improved, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, we had modest expense growth from a year ago. Net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels. But overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy. We increased our allowance for credit losses by $949 million, primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio today, our detailed loan-by-loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out. We also considered a number of stressed scenarios, all of which informed our actions this quarter.\nMike will discuss this in more detail, but I want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio. Loss content will be driven by a combination of factors including, but not limited to: Property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice states, loan structure and borrower behavior. Most importantly, our CRE teams remain focused on working with our clients for its portfolio surveillance and derisking to minimize loss content. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed and we've taken some credit taking actions. Credit card spending remains strong. But the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw for 2022. Debit card spending was flat from a year ago, with growth in discretionary spend, offset by declines in nondiscretionary spends. Average deposits were down from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer deposits, while the decline in commercial deposits slowed. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow, and as such, our continued intensive effort to complete the build-out of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical.\nI continue to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so. And that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required, we have more implementation to do as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time. As I said before, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete. While we're devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work, we're also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth. Our consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app. We added over 1 million mobile active customers over the past year and mobile logins increased 9% from a year ago. Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers. Since launching at the end of April, our customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times. We've continued to make important hires, bringing new expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we are looking to grow. We named Barry Simmons as the new Head of National Sales and Wealth and Investment Management will be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisers grow their business. We also continued to attract veteran bankers in corporate and investment banking, hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas, including a co-head of global mergers and acquisitions, co-head of financial institutions, and new heads of financial sponsors, equity capital markets, health care and technology, media and telecom.\nWe also continue to focus on better serving our communities. We announced a 10-year strategic partnership with TD JX Group that could result in up to $1 billion in capital and financing from Wells Fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across America. The Wells Fargo Foundation were $7.5 million to Habitat for Humanity to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide. We've worked with Habitat for Humanity for nearly 3 decades and donated more than $129 million since 2010. Wells Fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of redose U.S. home initiative to create 4 million new Latino homeowners by 2030. We provided the initial grants to start a fund launched by fintech below ALIS to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups, including women. We continue to open hope inside centers on Wells Fargo branches, including 6 during the first half of 2023, with plans to reach 20 markets by the end of this year. The centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching. We published our 2023 diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the progress we've made in our DE&I strategy and initiatives both inside our company and the communities where we live and work.\nHowever, we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require for long-term commitments. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy continues to perform better than many expected. And although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains, it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters. This year's Federal Reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model. This capital strength allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, while continuing to proudly return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We've repurchased $8 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock. Regulators have signaled that the Basel III endgame proposal, which could be out as soon as this summer will include higher capital requirements that would be skewed to the country's largest banks. While there's some speculation that capital requirements could increase by 20%, we don't know what the impact will be to Wells Fargo.\nHowever, we do expect our capital requirements will increase. While any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years. We are considering the potential impact in contemplating the amount of our future repurchases. Our balance sheet is strong. We've increased and remained focused on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position. We remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and our steadfast commitment to our risk and control build-out, coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion or $1.25 per diluted common share, both up from a year ago, reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance, which I'll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, down approximately 10 basis points from the first quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased $4 billion in common stock, and as Charlie highlighted, subject to Board approval, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 1.5 percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was 1.8 percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffer starting in the fourth quarter of this year. While we expect to repurchase more common stock this year, we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there is more clarity on the new capital requirements that Charlie highlighted. Our liquidity position remains strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately 23 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Overall, credit quality remained strong, but as expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase from historically low levels and were 32 basis points of average loans in the second quarter.\nCommercial net loan charge-offs increased $137 million from the first quarter to 15 basis points of average loans. Approximately half of the increase was in Commercial Banking where the losses were borrower-specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio. The rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio. I'll share some more details on the CRE office exposure on the next slide. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased modestly, up $23 million from the first quarter to 58 basis points of average loans. The increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses declined. While consumer credit performance remained solid overall, and we've continued to take incremental credit exciting actions across the portfolios, we expect consumer net loan charge-offs will continue to gradually increase. Nonperforming assets increased 14% from the first quarter as lower nonaccrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial nonaccrual loans, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses increased $949 million in the second quarter, primarily from commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card balances.\nWe've updated Slide 6, which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio. We had $154.3 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with $33.1 billion of office loans, which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter. As Charlie mentioned, our CRE teams are focused on surveillance and derisking, which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring at risk loans. This quarter, we added a table to this slide that breaks down our CRE office exposure in the context of our broader CRE portfolio. As the slide shows, our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate investment banking and that is also where we had the most nonaccrual loans in the highest level of allowance for credit losses. Last quarter, we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first quarter to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter. This quarter, we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total CRE office portfolio, which was 6.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 4.4% at the end of the first quarter.\nAs we've highlighted last quarter, we're providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but each property situation is different, and there are many variables that can determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. For example, we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals. We also have properties that are well leased to performing, but borrowers need health refinancing. In those situations, we are working with farmers to restructure, which in many cases, include some pay down of the balance. There are also situations that result in a sale or worked out of the asset. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable in the first quarter and were up 2% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial and industrial loans and commercial banking and credit card loans. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 247 basis points from a year ago and 30 basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment.\nAverage deposits declined 7% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows and in our consumer wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. While down from a year ago, average commercial deposits were relatively stable from the first quarter and average deposits grew in Corporate and Investment Banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 30 basis points from the first quarter to 113 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to the rising interest rates. Our mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 32% in the first quarter to 30% in the second quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Second quarter net interest income was $13.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $173 million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we expected full year net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. We currently expect full year 2023 net interest income to increase approximately 14% compared with 2022.\nThere are a variety of factors that we've considered in our expectations for the rest of the year. We are assuming modest growth in loans with some additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including competitive pricing on commercial deposits. Additionally, we were using recent -- the recent rate curve, which is shown on the slide. As a reminder, many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense grew $125 million or 1% from a year ago. At the beginning of the year, we expected our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses to be approximately $50.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2020 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses to be approximately $51 billion. The increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken and plan to take in 2023 and as attrition has been slower than expected. Of note, we've reduced head count each quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and headcount declined 1% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 19% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business as customers migrate to digital, including mobile. We've reduced our number of branches by 4% and branch staffing by 10% from a year ago. Home Lending revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations. We continue to reduce headcount in the second quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect that staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year. Credit card revenue increased 1% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Payment rates were down for a year ago, but have been stable over the last 3 quarters and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth remained strong, up 17% from a year ago, and importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically.\nAuto revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by the continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 17% from a year ago due to higher loan allowances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 77% from a year ago and increased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. We funded our last correspondent loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our paying customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for 5 consecutive quarters and balances were down 7% at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 11% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. As Charlie highlighted, debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, spending on fuel due to lower gas prices, home improvement and travel at the largest declines compared to last year. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 13% from a year ago. Growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down year-over-year. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. The Middle Market banking revenue increased 51% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.\nAsset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to higher loan balances. Average loan balances were up 12% in the second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. Average loan balances have grown for 8 consecutive quarters and the pace of growth has slowed. Average loans were up 1% from the first quarter with loan growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels, while middle market banking loans were flat. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue. The growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected write-downs taken in the second quarter of 2022 on unfunded leveraged finance movements. Commercial real estate revenue grew 26% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 29% from a year ago, driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes. Our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent, which have allowed us to broaden our client franchise and generate more trading flows.\nAverage loans were down 2% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. The decline in the first quarter was driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slow demand and modestly lower line utilization. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by a decline in asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. However, outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of win advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected the market valuations as of April 1, which were down from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of July 1. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending. Now Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased $751 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses.\nIn summary, our results in the second quarter reflected continued improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and had strong growth in pretax provision profit. As expected, our net charge-offs continue to slowly increase from historical lows as our allowance for credit losses increased. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong, and we continue to repurchase common stock. We will now take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Visa, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some first quarter highlights. Our results in the quarter were strong and reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. We grew revenue from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses declined from both the fourth quarter and the year ago, driven by lower operating losses, but we continue to be focused on controlling other expenses as well.\nThe consumer and majority of our businesses remain strong. Delinquencies and net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase as expected. We're looking for signs of accelerated deterioration in asset classes or segments of our customers. And broadly speaking, we saw a little change in the trends from the prior quarter.\nHowever, weakness continues to develop in commercial real estate office, and Mike will discuss this in more detail. Given what we're seeing, we're taking incremental actions to tighten credit on higher risk segments, but continue to lend broadly. We increased our allowance for credit losses for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our economic expectations used to support the allowance have not changed meaningfully, but we do continue to look at specific asset classes, such as commercial real estate to appropriately assess the adequacy of the allowance. We will continue to monitor the trends in each of our loan portfolios to determine the future action is warranted.\nBoth commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were relatively stable from the fourth quarter. Consumer spending remained strong with growth in both debit and credit card spend, but spending began to soften late in the quarter. The decline in average deposits that started a year ago continued in the first quarter, primarily driven by customers seeking higher-yielding alternatives and continued growth in consumer spending. We did see some moderate inflows from the few specific banks that have been highlighted in the press, but those inflows have abated. Our CET1 ratio, which was already strong, increased to 10.8% even as we resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter buying back $4 billion in common stock.\nLet me share some thoughts on the recent market events impacting the banking industry. We're glad that the work we have completed over the last several years has put us in a position to help support the U.S. financial system. Along with 10 other large banks, we utilized our strength and liquidity, and we made a $5 billion uninsured deposit into First Republic Bank, reflecting our confidence in the country's banking system and to help provide First Republic with liquidity to continue serving its customers.\nI'm proud of everything our employees have done during this historic period to be there for our customers. We believe banks of all sizes are an important part of our financial system as each is uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities. It's important to recognize that banks have different operating models and that the banks that failed in the first quarter were quite different from what people think of when they think about the typical regional bank. These particular banks had concentrated business models with heavy reliance on uninsured deposits.\nOur franchise and those of many other banks operate with a broader business model and more diversified funding sources. It is times like these that the many benefits of our own franchise become even more clear. Our diversified business model provides opportunities to serve our customers broadly, which reduces concentration risk across the different elements of risk.\nMost importantly, our customers benefit from our size and the range of banking services we provide, which helps us build a full relationship with individuals and companies. We also have strong capital and liquidity positions, which include a mix of deposits and access to multiple funding sources and our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.\nNow let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our top priority remains building out our risk and control framework appropriate for our company. I spent time in my recent annual letter, highlighting why we remain confident in our ability to complete this work, including having much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight, adding close to 10,000 people across numerous risk and control-related groups as part of our commitment to make the investments needed to complete door and building the management discipline and culture to govern and execute the work, which includes the operating committee reviewing risk and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis.\nI also summarize the actions we've taken to simplify the way we operate. This work continued in the first quarter as we largely completed the exit of the correspondent home lending business as part of our plans to simplify that business. We're also narrowing our retail mortgage business to focus on predominantly bank customers and underserved communities.\nOur strategy includes broadening our existing investment from the special purpose credit program to include purchase loans, investing an additional $100 million to advance racial equity in homeownership and deploying additional home mortgage consultants in local minority communities. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions.\nWe announced a multiyear agreement with Choice Hotels to launch a new co-branded credit card this month, creating a best-in-class credit card program designed to enhance our customers' experience and bring them more value. We rolled out early payday late last year, which makes eligible direct deposits available up to 2 days early.\nIn the first quarter, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $200 billion in direct deposits. We launched Flex Loan in the fourth quarter, a digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers, convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our expectations, we've originated over 100,000 loans since November.\nDigital adoption and usage among our consumer customers continued to increase. We added over 500,000 mobile active customers in the first quarter and digital logins increased 6% from a year ago. Since rolling out Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients late last year, we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new user experience. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs.\nWe also continued to make progress on our environmental, social and governance work. We announced a $50 million grant to the NAACP to support efforts to advance racial equity in America. This is the single largest donation at the NAACP has ever received from the corporation and builds on our long-standing relationship with the NAACP that spans more than 20 years. The Wells Fargo Foundation expanded its commitment to housing affordability through another $20 million housing affordability breakthrough challenge to advance ideas to help meet the need for more affordable homes across the country. We also announced a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native American communities including addressing housing, small business, financial health and sustainability.\nBefore concluding, I wanted to highlight the management changes we announced yesterday. Mary Mack, the CEO of consumer and small business banking is retiring this summer. She spent her entire career at Wells Fargo and has led consumer and small business banking for the past 7 years through a significant amount of change, including defining a new path forward to the business. I can think of few Wells Fargo colleagues, who have done as much for our company and have been as visible in the communities that we serve over such a long period of time.\nWe also announced that Saul Van Beurden, Head of Technology at Wells Fargo will succeed Mary. Sal is a strong leader, a technologist and he knows how to run a business. This makes him the ideal person to lead consumer and small business banking into the future. Our branch network will continue to be the key to the business. But our customers expect us to provide them with increasingly digitized and seamless banking experiences across all channels. Saul understands this deeply and has consistently proven his ability to convert new products and services across Wells Fargo.\nFinally, Tracy Kerrins, currently Head of Consumer Technology will become head of technology for the company reporting to me. Tracy has worked with the technology and finance industry for more than 20 years and has led a series of business critical initiatives to modernize our technology platforms across our consumer businesses. She is a strong results-driven leader.\nIt's always great when we can tap our own leaders for roles within the company, and I want to thank Mary for everything she's done during her tenure at Wells Fargo. It's truly been a pleasure working with her.\nAs we look forward, we're carefully watching customer behavior for clues on how the economic environment is changing. Customer activity is still relatively strong and delinquencies remain low, though they are increasing. There are pockets of risks such as commercial office real estate, which will likely impact institutions differently, and we're proactively managing our own exposures.\nWe continue to expect economic growth to slow, and we are preparing for a range of scenarios. We will continue to monitor both the markets and our customers and will react accordingly. Our diversified business model should enable us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $5 billion or $1.23 per diluted common share. While there was a lot going on in the banking industry around us, we continue to focus on our priorities and our results reflected the progress we are making, which I'll highlight throughout the call.\nStarting with capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up approximately 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting our earnings in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets. After pausing share repurchases for the prior 3 quarters, we repurchased $4 billion of common stock in the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, and we expect to continue to prudently return excess capital to shareholders in the coming quarters.\nIn the first quarter, our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 22 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. We continue to benefit from a diversified deposit base with over 60% of our deposits in our Consumer Banking and Lending segment as of the first quarter, which is a higher percentage than before the pandemic.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Net loan charge-offs continue to slowly increase to 26 basis points in the first quarter, but were still below pre-pandemic levels. Commercial net loan charge-offs decreased $16 million from the fourth quarter to 5 basis points. However, while losses improved, we continue to see some gradual weakening in underlying credit performance, including higher nonperforming assets.\nWe are proactively monitoring our clients' sensitivity to inflation and higher rates and are taking appropriate actions when warranted. We are also closely monitoring our commercial real estate office portfolio, and I'll share some more details on our exposure on the next slide. As expected, we've seen consumer delinquencies and losses gradually increase.\nTotal consumer net loan charge-offs increased $60 million from the fourth quarter to 56 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in the credit card portfolio. While most consumers remain resilient, we've seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago, and we've continued to take credit taking actions to position the portfolio for a slowing economy.\nNonperforming assets increased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans that were down 12% from a year ago due to lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans. Of note, 87% of the nonaccrual loans in our commercial real estate portfolio were current on interest and 75% recurring on both principal and interest as of the end of the first quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased to $643 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase for commercial real estate loans, primarily office loans as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans.\nGiven the increased focus on commercial real estate loans, especially office, we provided more details on our portfolio on Slide 6. We have $154.7 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter with $35.7 billion of office loans, which represented 4% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to show signs of weakness due to lower demand, higher financing costs and challenging capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to meaningful loss content yet, we expect to see more stress over time.\nAs you would expect, we have been derisking the office portfolio, which resulted in commitments declining 5% from a year ago, and we continue to proactively work with borrowers to manage our exposure, including structural enhancements and paydowns as warranted.\nAs you can see in the slide, we've provided some additional data on the office portfolio, including approximately 12% is owner occupied. Therefore, the loan performance is mostly tied to the cash flow of the owner's operating business rather than rents paid by tenants. Nearly 1/3 had recourse to a guarantor typically through a repayment guarantee. The portfolio is geographically diverse, and as you'd expect, the largest concentrations are in California and New York.\nOver 2/3 of our office loans are in the Corporate and Investment Banking business, and the vast majority of this portfolio is institutional quality real estate with high-caliber sponsors. While approximately 80% of it is Class A, keep in mind that this is a single measure that is hard to evaluate in isolation. For example, newer or refurbished properties may perform better regardless of whether they are Class A or B.\nWe are providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but as is usually the case in commercial real estate, each property situation is different and a myriad of other variables, such as leasing rates, loan-to-value and debt yields can determine performance, which is why we regularly review the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.\nAs a result of market conditions and the recent increases in criticized assets and nonaccrual loans, we've increased our allowance for credit losses for office loans for the past 4 quarters. The allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of the first quarter for the office portfolio in the Corporate Investment Bank was 5.7%. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help it solve issues they may be facing.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 6% from a year ago and were relatively stable from the fourth quarter, while period-end loans declined 1% from the fourth quarter with lower balances across our consumer and commercial portfolios.\nI'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 244 basis points from a year ago and 56 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago and 2% for the fourth quarter due to the consumer deposit outflows as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives and continued spending.\nDuring the market stress last month, we experienced a brief increase in deposit inflows that has since abated and while our period-end deposit balances were slightly higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, they're still down 2% from the fourth quarter. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 37 basis points from the fourth quarter to 83 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Our mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 35% in the fourth quarter to 32% in the first quarter, but remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 8. First quarter net interest income was $13.3 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $97 million decline for the fourth quarter was due to 2 fewer business days.\nOur full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter as we still expect 2023 net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. And Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned this year will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and repricing and loan demand.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses and the impact of business initiatives. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions.\nOur full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, is still expected to be approximately $50.2 billion, unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year.\nWe are continuing to make investments in this business. We're beginning to increase marketing spend. We're accelerating the efforts to renovate and refurbish our branches, for our bankers, we're investing in new tools and capabilities to provide better and more personalized advice to customers. We're continuing to enhance our mobile app and mobile active users were up 4% year-over-year and we're also seeing increased activity and positive initial indicators after our rollout of Wells Fargo Premier last year.\nIt's early on for all of these initiatives, but we're starting to see some green shoots. At the same time, we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Teller transactions continue to decline with reduced head count. We reduced headcount by 9% and total branches were down 4% from a year ago.\nIn home lending, mortgage rates remained elevated and the mortgage market continued to decline. Our home lending revenue declined 42% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations, including a significant decline from the correspondent channel and lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We continue to reduce headcount in the first quarter, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline due to the strategic changes we announced earlier this year. We stopped accepting applications from the correspondent channel as announced in January and begin to reduce the complexity and the size of the servicing book.\nDuring the first quarter, we successfully marketed mortgage servicing rights for approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing business. Credit card revenue increased 3% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume.\nAuto revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression from credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Personal lending revenue was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 83% from a year ago and 55% from the fourth quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. As I mentioned, we stopped accepting correspondent applications in January. So going forward, our originations will be focused on serving Wells Fargo customers and underserved communities.\nThe size of our auto portfolio has declined for 4 consecutive quarters and the balances were down 80% at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 32% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions and continued price competition. Debit card spending increased 2% in the first quarter, compared to a year ago, an increase from the 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Discretionary spending drove the growth with nondiscretionary spending stable from the fourth quarter levels.\nCredit card spending increased 16% from a year ago, in line with the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter with sustained growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. Spending growth slowed throughout the quarter, but was still at double-digit levels in March. We continue to see some slight moderation in payment rates in the first quarter, but they were still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue grew by 73% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances while deposit-related fees were lower, reflecting higher earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue increased 7% year-over-year, driven by loan growth which was partially offset by lower net gains from equity securities.\nAverage loan balances were up 15% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. After being stable in second half of last year, volume utilization increased slightly in the first quarter. Average loan balances have grown for 7 consecutive quarters and were up 2% from the fourth quarter with the growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory. Growth in Middle Market Banking was once again driven by larger clients, including both new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller clients.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago, driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Investment management -- investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all major products in nearly all industries. While commercial real estate market transactions are down across the industry, our commercial real estate revenue grew 32% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.\nMarkets revenue increased 53% from a year ago driven by higher trading results across all asset classes. Average loans grew 4% from a year ago, but were down from the fourth quarter. Lower balances in banking reflected a combination of slow demand, increased payoffs and relatively stable line utilization. The decline in commercial real estate balances were driven by the higher rate environment and lower commercial real estate sales volumes.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by lower asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher rates, which was partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\nAt the end of the first quarter, cash alternatives were approximately 12% of total client assets, up from approximately 4% a year ago. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Average loans were down 1% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $103 million or 83% from a year ago as higher net interest income was more than offset by lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. Results in the first quarter included $342 million of net losses on equity securities or $223 million pretax and net of noncontrolling interests.\nIn summary, our results in the first quarter reflected an improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and reduced expenses and had strong growth in pretax free provision profits. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slightly increase from historical lows, and we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where appropriate.\nOur capital levels grew even as we resume stock common stock repurchases, and we expect repurchases to continue. In the guidance we provided last quarter for full year 2023, net interest income and expenses, excluding operating losses, has not changed.\nWe will now take your questions.",

Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO Charlie Scharf and our CFO Mike Santomassimo will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.\nInformation about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for 2023. Before we take your questions, let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower, excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both our commercial and consumer portfolios, and charge-offs have continued to increase, but credit quality remains strong. Our capital levels also remain very strong, and our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well above our required minimums plus buffers.\nWe also continue to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our far-reaching agreement with the CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have been outstanding for several years. Over the past three years, we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement, and many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have more to do, we've made significant progress, and we will continue to prioritize our work here. In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future. As we build off the great market positions we have.\n\\We are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work. At the same time we invest in our future, and as I look back at 2022, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, early payday making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early, extra day grace giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. In the fourth quarter we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds.\nTeams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout has been smooth, and though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, our account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We continue to improve our credit card offerings, including launching two new cards, Wells Fargo Autograph and Bilt. Our new products helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022.\nWhile we've continued to maintain strong credit profiles, we launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses to provide a more comprehensive, relevant, and integrated offering for our clients. We continue to enhance partnership within our commercial business to bring corporate investment banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle market clients. Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience which has improved customer satisfaction. In 2022, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago.\nWe launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment, and total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. We completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year. Last month, we announced Vantage, a new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs.\nOver the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients, invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramped up and grew product offerings and consumer lending, and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code. We're implementing a cloud-native operating model that allows us to innovate faster. We've also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end-to-end. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multi-year digital transformation. We also continue to evaluate our existing businesses.\nAs we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a more focused home lending business aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals, families, and minority communities. This includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio. I've been saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability, returns, and serving minority communities, not volume or market share. The mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us, but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or servicers in the industry to do this effectively across all of our businesses. We must evolve as the market, regulation, and competition has evolved.\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing our focus. This will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term. Changing gears now, I'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social, and governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns for shareholders, and we provide many examples on Slide 2 of our presentation. So let me just highlight two examples here. We published our first Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our DEI initiatives.\nWe'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE and I into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, who joined Wells Fargo in 2020 to lead our home lending business and was named the company's new head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion in Q4. We've commissioned an external third party racial equity audit and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year.\n2022 is a turning point in the economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal. We are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services.\nAt this point, the impact to consumers and businesses has been manageable, and though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially. I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts. As we look forward, our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending, and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile we are not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one and we are stronger company today than one and two years ago. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher, we're better managed, and our capital position is strong. So we feel prepared for a downside scenario. If we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict, we still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements. Two years ago, we shared a path to higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in H2 2022 impacted our results, our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns.\nIn a moment, Mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute.\nWhile we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary. I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Slides two and three summarize how we helped our customers, communities, and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion or $0.67 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included $3.3 billion or $0.70 per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation, $1 billion of impairment of equity securities or $749 million after non-controlling interests, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business, primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector. Both slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations.\nIt's important to note that even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above the amount of the initial investment. $353 million of severance expense, primarily in home lending. While we've reduced headcount in this business throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week. These reductions were partially offset by $510 million of discrete tax benefits related to interest and overpayments in prior years. We highlight capital on slide 5. Our CET1 ratio is 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points in the third quarter, reflecting the benefit from our fourth quarter earnings. The annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching contribution and an increase from AOCI. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stressed capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023.\nWhile we have not repurchased any common stock since Q1 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in Q1 this year. Turning to credit quality on slide 7, credit performance remains strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time as the Federal Reserve continues to take actions to combat high inflation. Credit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses with only 6 basis points in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased $88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio, but remained slightly below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nNon-performing assets increased 1% from the third quarter, as lower residential mortgage non-accrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate non-accrual loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased $397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a less favorable economic environment. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards. Let me highlight trends in two of our portfolios. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for three consecutive quarters, and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, which reflected credit tightening actions, and continued price competition due to rising interest rates.\nOf note, our new vehicle origination surpassed used vehicles in Q4, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented, and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth.\nTurning to the commercial real estate office portfolio, the office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance, as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure, being disciplined in our underwriting standards, with both outstanding balances and credit is down compared to a year ago. On slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and $3.1 billion from the third quarter period. End loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio.\nI'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago and 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we saw declines in each of our businesses. Lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash and higher yielding alternatives, particularly in wealth and investment management and continued consumer spending. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points, driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs are up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time.\nAs rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products to continue.\nTurning to net interest income. On slide 9, fourth quarter net interest income was $13.4 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago. As we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates, I'll provide details on our 2023 expectations later on call.\nTurning to expenses on slide 10, the increase in noninterest expense from both a year ago and from Q3 was driven by higher operating losses excluding operating losses. Other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in Q4 included accruals related to the December 2022 CFPB consent order. As part of the settlement, we agreed to one incremental remediation and one new remediation related to overdraft fees. The accrual related to these two remediations was approximately $350 million. Our operating losses in Q4 also included accruals for other legal actions, reflecting these accruals.\nOur current estimate of the high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our accrual for legal actions as of 31 December 2022 is approximately $1.4 billion. This is down approximately $2.3 billion from 30 September 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation resolved, this estimate would be the lowest level since Q2 2016, though of course new matters will arise, and existing matters will develop over time. The estimate for 31 December 2022 will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may change. While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past two quarters has been significant.\nThey are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb the cost while increasing our CET1 ratio. As I highlighted earlier.\nTurning to our operating segments starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11, Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates. Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees. The majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth quarter run rate. We've continued to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customers has steadily increased. In 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs.\nWhile industry mortgage rates declined in Q4, they were still up over 330 basis points since the beginning of the year. In weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association were at a 26-year low at quarter-end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited, and refinance applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago. Reflecting these market conditions, our home lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain-on-sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging, and gain-on-sale margins will remain under pressure until excess capacity in the industry has been removed.\nAs we announced this week, we will be exiting our correspondent business which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of Q1. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results. Credit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas as well as lower loan balances. Personal lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances partially offset by lower spread compression, while originations grew 19% from a year ago driven by strong consumer demand and investments in the business. We have remained disciplined in our underwriting.\nTurning to some key business drivers on slide 12, mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32% from the third quarter with both declines in correspondent and retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago but declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022. I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto origination, so turning to debit card spending was up 1% compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower transaction volume offset by higher average ticket size. Entertainment was the only category with double-digit spending growth, while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods, and fuel were all down compared to 2021.\nCredit card spending increased 17% from a year ago, and while the year-over-year growth rate slowed from the third quarter, almost all categories continue to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but we're still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results in slide 13, middle market banking revenue increased 78% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities, partially offset by loan growth. Average loan balances were up 18% in Q4 compared to a year ago, while growth in H1 2022 was driven by higher line utilization. Utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year. Average loan balances have grown for six consecutive quarters and were up 5% in Q3, with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory, which are still below pre-pandemic levels.\nGrowth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients including both new and existing relationships, with more than offset declines from our smaller customers. Turning to corporate investment banking on slide 14, banking revenue increased 22% from a year ago, driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved lending results. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries. Commercial real estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago, driven by stronger lending results due to higher balances and the impact of higher interest rates.\nMarkets revenues increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates, and commodities, foreign exchange, and municipal products. Average loans grew 10% from a year ago after growing for seventh consecutive quarter. Average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilize across most portfolios.\nOn slide 15, Wealth & Investment Management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago, as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the decrease in market valuations. The majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so asset-based fees increased slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives, even as loan growth in securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility and the interest rate environment. Average loans grew 1% from a year ago.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our corporate trust business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in Q4 2021, which resulted in a net gain of $943 million. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to low results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments of equity securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago was driven by higher operating losses.\nTurning to our expectations for 2023 starting on slide 17, let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. We are assuming the Asset Cap will remain in place throughout the year moving from left to right on the waterfall. Based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff, a mix shift to higher yielding products, with these declines partially offset by modest loan growth. We also expect a headwind from lower TIB markets' net interest income due to higher funding costs. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenues currently expected to be small. Putting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022.\nUltimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, positive balances mix and pricing, and the loan demand. Turning to our 2023 expense outlook on Slide 18, following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $57.3 billion in noninterest expense in 2022, which included $7 billion of operating losses. Excluding operating losses, expenses would have been $50.3 billion, which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year. If you also exclude operating losses from the guidance.\nOur 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense. However, revenue related expenses were lower than expected by market conditions. We do believe a good starting point for discussion of 2023 expenses is $50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by approximately $1 billion due to both merit increases, including inflationary pressures, and an approximately $250 million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge. These increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately $100 million of lower revenue related expense, primarily driven by decreases in home lending. Based on current market levels, we expect revenue related expense in Wealth & Investment Management for 2023 to be similar to 2022.\nWe've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense days over the past two years, and through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional $3.2 billion of gross expense reductions in 2023. A piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more focused home lending business, but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized. We highlight on the slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year and believe we'll have more opportunities beyond 2023 similar to prior years. The resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives, and we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work.\nWhile we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and expect approximately $1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our ability to drive growth across the company and better serve our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year. Putting this all together, expenses excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 compared with 2022. Even with inflationary pressures, a higher G-SIB surcharge, an increase in incremental investments in our businesses, as 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict, and therefore we have not included them in our expense outlook for 2023.\nHowever, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related operating losses such as fraud, theft, and other business-as-usual losses to be approximately $1.3 billion this year, which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses. It's important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. This remains a multi-year process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix. Given how critical.\nTo invest into our story on slide 19, we provide details on our primary areas of focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the investments we've started to make in digital and payments. We plan to continue to invest in these areas as this year to make improvements for both our consumer and commercial customers. We also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage in investment banking, commercial banking, and wealth and investment management, and to continue to transform our technology platforms including moving more applications to the cloud, consolidating our data centers, and increasing investments in cyber.\nFinally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience, but also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk, and drive account growth.\nAs we show on slide 20. In the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE, but as I highlighted at the start of the call, our fourth quarter results were impacted by several notable items including higher operating losses, elevated impairments of equity security, severance, and discrete tax benefits. As we show on this slide. If you exclude these notable items, our fourth quarter ROTCE would have been approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding balances, mix, and pricing. Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels. If rates, funding balances, mix, and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher, our ROTCE would be lower.\nDepending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different answer, so, to be clear, because the interest rates are higher, and credit costs are lower than our long-term expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns.\nOn slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns since we first discussed our ROTCE goals in the earnings call for Q4 2020. We have executed a number of important items. We executed on $20 billion of gross common stock repurchases, $16 billion net of issuances, including our 401(k) plan. We increased our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share. We delivered approximately $7.5 billion in gross expense saves and reduced headcount by 11% since the end of 2020. So we've made good progress over the past two years on things we can control, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning products and businesses.\nAdding more focus in our home lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted earlier. While some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns, and our goal is for our four operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers.\nIn summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in Q4 significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income, and our expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses drive growth. Both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong in Q4, and we expect to resume share repurchases in Q1. We will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please first unmute your phone and then press star one. Please record your name at the prompt. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press star two to remove yourself from the question queue. Once again, please press star one and record your name if you would like to ask a question at this time. Please stand by for our first question.Our first question of today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Good afternoon. I should say. Mike, just a follow-up on the NII outlook for the year. So you obviously had a good high end to the year at 13.5 FTE. Just looking at what the guide implies, a step down, a little bit of step down from there after. Can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect the betas to move through and then what doesn't necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the moving parts? Thanks.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, sure, Ken, thanks for the question. I'll just kind of walk you through some of the drivers there and then, you know, obviously also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well. So as you look at the key things, you know, just take loan growth. We're expecting kind of low to mid single digit loan growth throughout the year. So not super fast paced but sort of moderate pace of loan growth. We are expecting, you know, some moderate declines across the deposit base stabilizing later in the year, but some moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters. Then we would expect the betas to continue to move up a little from here.\nAnd then, when you think about the pacing of it, the first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year if all of these things play out. And so you shouldn't expect a really big step down in the first half quarter for sure. And then I think that that provides the opportunity potentially in the second half of the year if things, if we don't see that step down in deposits or the betas are a little bit better than what we expected. And then I'd just point out, as we, even as we looked at the fourth quarter, the betas were a little bit better than what we had modeled. And so we're all in a little bit of uncharted territory here.\nBut I do think that there's some opportunity potentially in, in the second half of the year as we look at the forecast, but it'll be dependent upon how we fare over the next quarter or two.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, got it. Second question, heard your commentary about the Q1, Q3 of op losses and the fact that the RPL is down to, way down to 1.4%. Just how do you kind of help us understand your range of confidence? Obviously last year op losses ended at $7 billion as you made progress. So how wide is the range of expectations around your confidence on that level of OP loss for the year?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, I think if you look at what we've said over the last quarter or two, there's been roughly, in Q3 and Q4, 200 to 250 of just BAU op losses that have happened. You know, just fraud, theft, and normal stuff that you should expect to continue. So that gives you sort of a bottom end. And then I think the rest of it will be a little dependent upon how we work through the rest of the issues that we've got to work through. For next year, but I think as you look at the RPL going from 3.7 to 1.4. As those big items have moved to be more probable and estimable, for we booked them and hopefully that gives you confidence that we're putting some, you know, some of the big things behind us. But we still have, you know, stuff to work through and, you know, there'll be more over time, I'm sure, but we've put a lot of big things behind us.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you for taking the question. I think maybe question along the same lines there, so that, you know, the tone around the regulatory issue certainly sounds better than, like, 90 days ago and that reasonably possible losses seems to give better quantitative thinking as well. But what, maybe Charlie, what are the major touch points sort of on your on your plate right now? I know all roads ultimately lead to lifting the Asset Cap, but maybe would. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on just sort of the biggest things left in your mind.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, well, let me just. So, you know, listen, we still have a series of consent orders, of which, and I always point this out, the Asset Cap is a piece of one of them. So all roads don't lead to the Asset Cap. The roads in this respect lead to us building the proper control environment which will satisfy ultimately all the consent orders. And you know, I've tried to, you know, be clear that, you know, we are making progress on that work. It is a lot to do, and you know, our tone hasn't changed relative to the confidence in the progress that we're making there.\nWe're going to continue doing it, and you know, hopefully it's done to the satisfaction of the regulators, but they'll have to, you know, decide that, and as we, you know, continue to tick off the to-dos on that work, the control environment gets better and better, and we become a better-run company that doesn't have those kinds of operating losses that you've all seen in the past.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, all right, perfect. Thank you. Then, Mike, when you talk about resuming share repurchases in Q1, maybe if you give us sort of a sense for order of magnitude and maybe just at an even higher level. Sort of how you get comfortable repurchasing in the face of what seems sort of still uncertain rules out there.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, I would start with where our CET1 ratio is at the end of the year at 10.6, so we're well above our current regulatory minimum and the buffers that are included there. So we have plenty of flexibility regardless of any outcome that comes out of the new rules that will be proposed. And keep in mind, that'll take some time to come out, get implemented, and phase in. And so it's not going to happen in a day. And I think we'll go back to what we've been saying, the last number of quarters. As we think about the buffer that we'll put on the reg minimum in buffers of 9.2, we'll be managing somewhere in the 100 ± a little basis point range. And depending on what happens with loan growth and RWA growth that we see over the quarter. That'll help guide the share repurchases.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Okay, good. Thank you guys very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, Mike, I wanted to clarify your answer to Ken about the Q1 NII. I think you said you do not expect a big step down in the Q1. Maybe you could just frame Q1 NII a little bit for us relative to the $13.4. What are some of the headwinds, tailwinds, and what might you expect at this point?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks, John. Well, first you have to normalize for a couple less days in the quarter. So that's going to be a step down of, call it $150 to 200 million. Step down just there from the best days. And then as you look at it should be relatively stable to the fourth quarter. But there could be some, a little bit of wiggle room in there. Stable minus including the day count or you got to take the day count, adjust for the day count, and then stable after reducing for the day count.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nYeah, okay, got it. And then, Charlie, maybe a bigger question just kind of where are you on the efficiency journey? When we think about $50 billion of core expense for this year and the timeframe for ROTCE. What will it take? Is there an efficiency ratio we should keep in mind or is it that too hard to forecast? Maybe a little bit on that would be helpful.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nNo, it's a good question. I think so. First of all, I think when I make just a couple comments around. The expense guidance we gave, embedded in that expense guidance, we're still continuing to reduce the core expenses of the company. But as you can see on that slide. We're anticipating that we will spend more money on investments that are around technology, digital, building out products, and things like that that offset that to some extent to get to an overall flat expense base. Mike did say in his comments, and I just want to repeat it, that we're not going to spend this money at all costs. We're going to see how the year continues to pan out. You know, it's money that we would like to spend, we're planning to spend it, but there's a lot of discretion in the expense base. So.\nWe think it's prudent as we sit here today to plan to spend it, but we're going to constantly be looking at our performance and make judgments on what that should be. So, you know, as we look at the efficiency of the company, we do, you know, expect to continue to gas, you know, Efficiency Ratio improvement in place. If we don't see revenue growth, and if we don't see payoffs from the things that we're doing, then we will spend less money. So that's the way we're approaching it. We're either going to get, you know, the Efficiency Ratio to continue to improve because we're getting real payoff on some things or we will reduce on a net basis. But overall there are still gross expenses that should come out of the company, which gives us the latitude to continue to grow the investments inside the company, you know, and the timing to get to 15%.\nListen, you know, it's a great question. You know, as we talk about it, it's, you know, it's medium term, which is obviously not long term or short term. But I would say, you know, it's, you know, without putting a specific time frame, it is. It should be something that we have in our sights as we look out over the future. It's not something that's theoretical, it's something that we believe we should get to and just the problem. And we're just trying to stay a little bit away from quantifying exactly where we're starting from is because everyone will make their own adjustments.\nIt's just, I think, what we're just trying to do is be really clear that we don't want to take credit for the outperformance in NII and we don't want to take credit for the outperformance in charge-offs and that we still have to continue to drive improved performance each and every year at the company.\n\nJohn McDonald\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Steven Chuback of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood afternoon. So, Charlie, I was hoping to ask a follow up to that last line of questioning around expenses. You indicated that the expense work, it's going to continue beyond 2023. In the one metric that we've been tracking is headcount. And in terms of the benchmarking analysis that we've done, headcount is down more than 10% since the 2020 peak, or roughly 30,000. But it's still elevated versus your money center peers. Was hoping you could just speak to what inning you're in currently in terms of optimizing headcount and whether, as we look beyond 2023, whether there is a credible path to actually driving investments lower. You had talked about balancing investment with the need to drive those efficiency gains. I just want to think about the expense trajectory beyond 2023, whether further reductions are achievable given some of that inflated headcount still.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "Yeah. I think, I mean, I think that, you know, your point on headcount versus peers is one that we've made. And so, yes, you know, we are all different in terms of, you know, the businesses that we're in and what we do. But we do, and, you know, some insource and some outsourcing some things. But, you know, when you look at it, we still have, you know, higher headcount and higher expenses than people who are more complex than us.\nYou know, some of that is explained by the work that we're doing and the expenses and heads that are, you know, building out the control infrastructure. But there's a lot more beyond that. That's the work that we're doing to peel that back piece by piece by piece. We still have a huge amount of manual processes inside the company. We have duplicate systems. You know, that's the work that we're on. So when I say that, you know, we still have, you know, gross expenses to be reduced in the company.\nWe. That's exactly what we're talking about, you know, the question is, you know, when we get to a net basis, where does that come out? As I said before, I think that's a decision that we want to be able to make at each and every point in time when we look at what the overall performance of the company is. So again, I just want to repeat what I said. We're not going to spend under any environment at all costs. That's not the way we're thinking about it. If we don't see net improvements in performance of the company, we've got the ability to ration back the discretionary spend so that we do continue to see improved performance of the company. What we'd like to see is that these things are paying off.\nWe're seeing real sustainable revenue growth based upon these things and the ability to invest. So that's just kind of how that's the framework that we're using to make the decisions. As we get to each point in time, and it's not even just an annual decision, I mean, you know, Mike and I and the operating committee are going to have these discussions regularly about, you know, how are things panning out, what does it look like, and how do we feel about our willingness to continue to invest in these things and have it, you know, it's got to be living and breathing.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nAt top of color, Charlie. For my follow-up, just also as it relates to the discussion around the buyback, you guys are uniquely positioned in that you aren't migrating into a higher G-SIB bucket because of the Asset Cap. You're not going to necessarily see quite as much expansion in terms of balance sheet. You've conveyed a high level of confidence around a 15% ROTCE. Where your stock is trading today, at least on price to tangible, reflects a pretty healthy degree of skepticism in your ability to get there just given the strength of your capital position. Why not get a bit more aggressive with the buyback here, just recognizing the significant amount of capital you'll generate? Some of the concerns around AOCI seem to be abating. Would be helpful to get some perspective as to whether you might be willing to step it up meaningfully. Closer to 100% type payout here.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nWell, so it sounds like you're drawing conclusions to the pace at which we said we're going to buy stock back, which I don't think we actually said. What we've said is that we haven't been buying stock back. We anticipate we're going to begin buying it back as we think about how much we have available in that capacity, what Mike said was our CET1 went up to 10.6%. Our required minimums plus buffers are at 9.2%. We, you know, it said that we'll manage 100 basis points above the 9.2 ±. So we do have substantial capacity plus the ongoing earnings capacity of the company. And so that is, you know, that's our framework is to, you know, target a reasonable CET1 ratio. If in the future we have to raise the levels of capital because of Basel III Endgame or whatnot, we've got, you know, earnings capacity to be able to do that.\nBut we do have the flexibility, and now that we've got resolution, you know, with CFPB and things like that, to be able to go buy stock back, and you know, we'll, you know, we'll be making that decision based upon our views on the value of the stock, liquidity in the market, and things like that. But you know, as we said, we do anticipate we'll be back in, you know, as opposed to where we've been.\n\nSteven Chubak\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nFair enough. More my effort to assess the cadence and the magnitude, but it sounds like you guys are quite comfortable leaning in here. So thanks for taking my questions.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood afternoon. Want to see if you could just give a little bit more color on the net interest income side. Maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the non interest bearing deposit mix shift that you think could continue here. It looks like that could be a pretty material offset to your interest rate benefit. So just want to see if you can perhaps talk about that and then maybe also help quantify the runoff that you expect to continue on the deposit side in terms of balances overall. Thanks.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, John, it's Mike. You know, I think, you know, overall, as I said earlier, you know, we do expect some moderate decline in balances and some more mix shift changes as we go throughout the year. And so you should expect that to continue. And it's all the stuff that should be expected as we're in this environment. And that's what we're seeing. And if you look at each of the businesses we're seeing, it kind of most acutely happen in the wealth business as people move into cash alternatives.\nOut of deposits. That's what's happening in a lot of wealth management businesses these days as people move that cash around and then across the rest of the consumer businesses. It's part people looking for higher yields, but it's also part people spending more. You're seeing some of that decline come down as overall balances continue to decline, as the stimulus has worn off and people continue to be out there spending. It's a little bit of a number of drivers there. I think, as I said earlier, as you think about the NII pacing for this year, the first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year, given the trends that we expect to happen.\nIf those are a little bit better than what we're modeling, then I think that provides some opportunity, too, as we look at the second half of the year.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, Mike, thank you. That's helpful. And then separately, you gave some pretty good color, obviously around NII expectations now and then also on expenses on the fee side. Can you perhaps give us your expectation there around overall growth that you expect in noninterest income and maybe some of the major drivers of where you see growth and if you could possibly size it up perhaps around the investment banking area, et cetera, that would help? Thanks.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, sure. As you break apart fees, the biggest line item there is the investment advisory fees. That's going to be somewhat dependent upon where the market goes. If we start to see recovery in the equity markets at a more substantial pace, that will obviously be a big benefit for.\nThat business. When you look at some of the other line items, deposit fees, as I mentioned in my commentary, most of the decline that we were expecting to see as a result of the overdraft policy changes and new products that we implemented is in the run rate. You may see some pressure there related to earnings credits on the commercial side, but the run rate decline for overdrafts is really in there. When you think about investment banking fees, that's going to be somewhat market dependent. We've seen it's too early to know how that's going to shape up in terms of the overall industry volume there.\nAs we continue to make the investments in our investment banking business over a longer period of time, we would expect to see some growth there both in how we go after that opportunity in the commercial bank and middle market space, as well as our other large corporate clients there. So a lot of that's going to be dependent on the market, but we're confident that we're going to be positioning ourselves better and better to take advantage of it. Then we talked about mortgage. Mortgage is a small piece of the much smaller piece of the puzzle than it was today. We don't expect that to be.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSmaller piece today than it was historically.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nSorry, smaller piece today than it was historically. And so, you know, and that's going to be a pretty challenging market until, you know, in this, in this rate environment. So, you know, I think we, you know, we're confident in the investments we're making that will pay off over time. But, you know, it may take a little time to start to see some of that come through, depending on the market dynamics.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. All right. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGood afternoon. I just had one question, I guess, Charlie, in your opening remarks you mentioned that the impact on customers from higher rates, I think you implied, was not getting worse with the incremental rates. Was that the right takeaway? And if so, and if the Fed were to stop after another hike, do you actually see that the impact to your customers may not be as meaningful as feared over the last six to 12 months, and implications of that on the credit quality and the credit performance of your book? Would love to hear yours. Any perspective you can share?\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure. What I was trying to say in those remarks was the impact on rising rates is continuing to impact customers on a period over period basis. We would expect that to continue, but it's not accelerating. It's much more linear than exponential. The fact that it's much more linear is actually a very helpful thing because that gives people a more orderly transition to a slower growth economy and gives consumers a chance. It shows that.\nThey're adjusting their spending patterns, saving patterns, and borrowing patterns to adjust for the reality of higher rates. On your second question, we would anticipate that we would continue to see deterioration in those metrics continue after the Fed stops raising rates for a period, just because of the amount of time that it takes those things to filter through the economy more broadly. Hopefully that was helpful.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThat's helpful. Just a quick follow-up, I think you mentioned earlier around commercial real estate. Are you seeing any stress? There's some discussion around the ability of these loans to get refi'd given the move in rates we've seen over the last year. Any stress within the CRE book, and anything just in terms of Homestead, a lot of negative headlines such as Code Left Earth. Your perspective on that, though.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, it's Mike. I'll try to take that. Charlie can add if he needs. You're really getting at the office, I think, space more than anything there. There's certainly more stress in the office space than there was a quarter or two or three quarters ago. I think you're seeing that now. It hasn't translated into loss content at this point. So we're keeping a careful eye on it. I think it is, as you look at where you see it, in older, lower class properties. Over 80% of our portfolio is in class A space. So we feel like the quality of it is pretty good. But we will see some stress as we go through here.\nSo far it's been pretty idiosyncratic in terms of individual buildings and individual places. But we are very watchful on cities like San Francisco, like Los Angeles, like Washington, D.C., where you're seeing lease rates overall be much lower than other cities across the country. And so certainly those are markets that we're keeping a pretty close eye on and making sure we're being proactive with our borrowers to make sure we're thinking way ahead of any maturities or extensions options that need to get put in place to help manage through It.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nHead of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good afternoon. Just one more clarification question, if I may, on net interest income, Mike, your underlying assumptions to your NII outlook in terms of low- to mid-single-digit loan growth, moderate declines in deposit balances in the first half, and stabilizing?\nThis doesn't feel very different from what consensus had been assuming to get to $51.5 billion for 2023, which is clearly higher than what's implied by your outlook. So I'm wondering if I could re-ask Ken's question. What deposit betas, what terminal deposit betas, what range of expectations are you baking into that $49.5 billion forecast? And did you bake a significant amount of conservatism as you think about your NII outlook? And I'm asking that question because one of your peer CEOs said their $74 billion outlook was not conservative. So I think that given the outlook versus consensus expectations, I did have to re-ask that question here.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, no, look, it's.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nCan I just start for a second before Mike actually goes to the facts again? I think one of the things that you're hearing from all of us, that we're all very consistent on, which I know you appreciate, but I just want to say it anyway, is we don't know what the rate path is going to look like from here over the next 11 and a half months, which is exactly what you're asking and exactly what the competitive environment is going to be month by month versus all of the people we compete with. So you're looking at, you know, we don't know what the alternative is going to be in non bank deposits and we don't know what the alternatives are going to be in bank deposits. But we're trying to make those predictions.\nSo, I think, you know, when we go through all of this, we're all just trying to, you know, in our own way make sure that there's clarity that we're, and I'll speak for myself now, you know, we're trying to give you what we think is achievable. In our case, based upon the rate curve that we've laid out in the document, and it might or might not turn out that way, we're also assuming, and I talked about this at a conference in December, that we are going to continue to, you know, raise rates in which we pay our consumers because we're thinking about this not in terms of, you know, maximizing short-term NII, but thinking about it in terms of the value of the relationship and making sure that we pay properly for that so that we're, you know, you know, continuing to recognize, you know, how expensive it is to get a new relationship and how profitable it can be to keep an existing relationship. And so, you know, if your views are different towards the end of the year as to, you know, what the rate scenario could be.\nThat's fine. You know, specifically, you know, what we've tried to do as we've gotten, you know, closer to the periods with which we see is give you some clarity, as Mike did, on what we're, you know. The Q1 is a little clearer to us, but beyond that, that is pretty difficult. You know, we're not going to go through, you know, every last beta that we're assuming in terms of what those forecasts are.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. And the only thing I'd add to it is, you know, as, you know, as the Fed does, when the Fed does ultimately peak in terms of rising rates, you will see a lag on pricing as that will continue. Pricing will continue to increase over a quarter or two quarters, three quarters, really. All depends on the competitive environment. So you're going to have some lags there. But I'm sure all of us have our own points of view and assumptions underneath those models. But what we're trying to give you, as Charlie said.\nIt's a case that we think is achievable through the year. As I said earlier on the call, I think if we've, depending on how it plays out over the first and second quarter, we could have some opportunity in the second half. But I think it's, you know, it's unclear exactly how that will play out. So we'll obviously keep you updated as it goes.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks Eric.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good afternoon.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nHey Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI did want to just unpack a couple of things around the correspondent exit and also some follow up questions as it relates to the mortgage business in general there. I think you mentioned that it's not substantial impact. Maybe you could help us understand revenues, expenses, EPS. I made my own assumptions, but I got a lot of questions from people on what's management say. So, would like to understand that piece of it, and then could you help us understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business once you exit correspondent? Is there any originate and sell servicing retained left in any channel, or are you saying with this correspondent exit that you'll be moving entirely to portfolioing for yourself and the MSR will wind down over time? Just give us some color around that. Be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes. So maybe I'll start on the second and then, Mike, we circle around to the first. So we are not assuming that we will balance sheet every loan that we underwrite in the future. Again, what we're trying to do in the path that we've laid forward is just make very clear that we're not interested in running and having a business which is focused on a standalone mortgage product. We very much appreciate the importance of mortgage to the consumer base, and we're going to continue to stay in the business, but we're going to view it as part of the importance in the broader relationship. So that means we'll be originating both conforming and non-conforming mortgages, and we'll continue to make the decision as to what goes on our balance sheet as we have done in the past.\nThe fact that we'll be originating a lot less will certainly mean that over time the MSR and the overall servicing book will come down very naturally based upon that over a fairly long period of time. But we'll also look for intelligent and economic ways to reduce the complexity and the size of our servicing book between now and then, and if those present themselves, you know, we'll, we'll certainly be interested in doing that.\nI know Mike will talk a little bit about this, but I think one of the things we were just trying to say when we think about the size of, you know, the impact of exiting the correspondent business immediately is given the fact that, you know, mortgage rep mortgage volumes are so low and revenues are so low, the revenue impact of exiting the correspondent business in the short term is not meaningful. It's a very small number of people, so that's not all that meaningful in the short term. The real benefit comes over time as we reduce the size of the servicing business, which, as we've tried to make the point, is it's not just reducing expenses, but it's not profitable for us today in a whole bunch of these segments where we continue to have the servicing. And so it becomes a positive over time. But that is not a short term benefit for us, but certainly a medium to longer term one.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. The only thing I'd add is all you lose initially, Betsy, is the gain on sale on the origination. The servicing is still here. That in any given quarter over the last couple years is low tens of millions of dollars. It's a really small impact.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThe servicing cost is low tens of millions.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nThe only thing you lose today by exiting correspondent is the gain on sale on the origination of the mortgage.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThe low tens of millions is the gain on sale.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nCorrect.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Okay, sorry.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nServicing of the existing portfolio is still here.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's part of the broader servicing.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nBecause one of the follow-ups I got was, does it impact the scale? Obviously, it reduces the flow over existing plants. So, does that matter to how you price your REIT? Yeah, I mean.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nIt's not even close. I mean, the amount that we're originating today relative to the scale we have in the business is. It's immaterial. Even as we downsize the portfolio on the servicing side, you know, the whole point of our servicing portfolio can be substantially, substantially lower, and we'll still have scale to be able to originate the product, and we would say in a more profitable way than we're doing it today.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, and so the remaining mortgage origination channels are 100% retail, is that right?\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Right. Because you're at a wholesale, you're at a correspondent.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYes.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nCorrect.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nGlobal Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Question for you with the CFPB settlement. There was a comment by the head of CFPB about growth initiatives slowing your progress. So, Charlie, my question to you is what are you planning to do in regards to that comment in terms of the growth initiatives? Are you trying to slow anything, any color on that, Charlie?\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, I addressed it in my remarks, which is, we've been very, very clear. I think if you look back on every earnings call. Let alone any time I speak publicly, we're very consistent in making sure that everyone understands both internally and externally that our number one priority is getting that work done. That is how we're running the company. We have very clear processes internally to make sure that that happens. We're very confident that's the case. You know, the things that we are doing to grow the business we think are actually helpful. To actually making it a more controlled place. We're going to continue to go forward the same way we've been going forward, being very conscious of making sure things don't get in the way.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay, thanks. Completely different question. In the past, you've given some color on deposits and among different tiers of customers, any color? Any update on where those stand currently and your outlook on that?\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nIt's still very much the same, which is kind of intuitive that those who went in with lower balances are the ones who were living more paycheck to paycheck, and they are seeing more stress than those that have not had that. But I would say that it's, you know, the rate of change. It's still the same across most of the affluent spectrum. So, the trends are still very consistent.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, Charlie. Excuse me, flip this question from your answers to the servicing in the residential mortgage business. Are there any lines of businesses that, you know, you can't go out and make an acquisition? Of course. But any lines of business you're looking to grow, enhance, and beef up, maybe through hiring groups of people to do that, you know, strategic increase.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nListen, I think when we look at all of the, I mean, I've said this in the past, you know, we look at each of these businesses that we have, and that to me is consumer bank, it's consumer lending, wealth, commercial, and the corporate investment bank, with the exception of the home lending business.\nThat and the rest of the consumer lending businesses that lend, it's all going to be based upon, you know, returns and what we're seeing in terms of market competitiveness. All of these businesses have the opportunity to continue to grow, share, and, you know, when we think about, you know, the things that we're doing to, you know, invest. We are targeting investment banking adds in both coverage and products. We're focused in commercial banking. The build out of both the corporate investment offerings for that customer base. Both the corporate investment bank and the commercial bank have opportunities to continue to improve what we do from the treasury services perspective. And so we see growth opportunities there. I've talked about the opportunities in our wonderful wealth management business to bring on some more investment teams as we've reoriented that business.\nWhen we wind up looking in the consumer lending side, you've seen growth in the credit card side of the business, which we would expect to continue. Our consumer bank as we very carefully evolve from, you know, fixing the problems that we've had, taking advantage of the franchise. So, you know, when we talk about, and, you know, we had this page in the deck, that's page 19 in the investor presentation in the earnings presentation. We do see, you know, multiple places for us to be able to, you know, increase the rate of growth by, you know, just organically, which sometimes involves adding people, sometimes it's building technology, sometimes it's just improved execution. You know, there are other things like affluent whatnot that I haven't mentioned, but you know there are a bunch, and they're pretty broad.\n\nJohn Campbell\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. And then just as a quick follow-up, Mike, you guys mentioned that there was a private equity or equity write down in the quarter. Can you share with us how big that was? And then just, I know, over the years you guys have done very well in this area, but and then second, how big is the portfolio? What's remaining there?\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nSure, it was about a $1 billion-dollar write-down, 750 after non-controlling interest. So that's on the first page of the release if you want to refer back. It was primarily driven by some write-downs in enterprise software companies, and in particular, it was really one investment that drove most of it. I would just point out that investment is still a very good investment. Company is a good investment, and we're still holding it well above where the invested amount is.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nJust to be correct, we're holding it at something like a little under $0.5 billion. Yeah, I'd say 10x what we invested in it. But like all enterprise software companies, the company, it's just the rate of growth over the next year or so has come down substantially, but it's still a very high quality company.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd then, just more broadly on the venture business we've done, the team's done a great job over a very long period of time, and we still think it's a very good business.\n\nOperator\n\nThat was our final question.\n\nMichael Santomassimo\n\nCFO, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, thank you all, and we appreciate the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\n\nCharles Scharf\n\nCEO, Wells Fargo\n\nTake care, everyone. Bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."

(Operator Instructions). Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also, like, to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with the third quarter highlights. Our solid business performance this quarter was significantly impacted by $2 billion or $0.45 per share in operating losses related to litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters.\nAs you know, we've been and remain focused on increasing our earnings capacity and see the positive impact of rising interest rates, driving strong net interest income growth and our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies, resulting in lower expenses, excluding operating losses. Credit quality remains strong, and we continue to invest in our technology platforms, digital capabilities and delivering additional products to our customers and clients.\nWhile we're closely monitoring trends with economic conditions expected to weaken given inflation, geopolitical instability, energy price volatility and rising interest rates, our customers continue to be resilient with overall strong credit performance and solid cash flow. When looking at simple averages across the entire consumer portfolio, deposit balances per account decreased from the second quarter, but were still higher than a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nHowever, we continue to closely monitor activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers. We've seen average balances steadily decline and are now below pre-pandemic levels, and their debit card spend continues to decline. This is a continuation of what I referenced last quarter, but it's important to note that this remains a small percentage of our total customer base.\nOverall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll and overdraft trends, are still not showing elevated risk concerns. Debit card spending remained significantly above pre-pandemic levels and was up 3% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, consistent with the second quarter increase. Entertainment and fuel spending had the largest increases from a year ago, but the recent decline in fuel prices drove fuel spending to decline compared to the second quarter.\nApparel and home improvement spending declined from both the year ago and second quarter. Credit card spend remained strong in the third quarter, up 25% from a year ago, with double-digit increases coming across all spending categories. Spending was up modestly on a linked-quarter basis. So remember, the significant portion of this growth is from our new products, which continued to have strong credit profiles.\nPeriod-end commercial loan balances were stable compared to the second quarter, with continued growth in commercial banking, offset by declines across our businesses in corporate and investment banking. Credit performance remained strong, with net charge-offs and nonaccrual loans continuing to decline from exceptionally low levels. Clients do tell us that they continue to be impacted by persistent inflation, rising interest rates and tight labor market. And while credit quality remains strong, we're actively monitoring inflation-sensitive industries and taking proactive actions where warranted.\nNow, let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities. We continue to devote significant resources to implementing an appropriate risk and control framework across the company, and this remains our top priority. We continue to make progress and are executing on our plans, but significant work remains.\nAs a reminder, though I'm confident in our ability to complete the work, it remains a significant body of work and the primary focus of the company. We have set high standards for success, and given the long-standing nature of much of our work, we have said that we remain at risk of setbacks until it is complete. Expenses in the quarter reflect these ongoing risks and our efforts to resolve them.\nAs we continue our work to put our historical issues behind us and to address issues that are identified as we advance our risk control infrastructure work, outstanding issues still remain that will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant. We are working to close these as quickly as possible, and we remain committed to doing right by our customers and working closely with our regulators and others to resolve these matters. We recognize the importance of moving forward, and the expenses in the quarter are representative of these efforts.\nAt the same time, we're implementing changes to better serve our customers and investing in our businesses to help drive growth. As part of the announcement we made earlier this year to limit overdraft-related fees and give customers more options to achieve their financial goals, we implemented extra day grace period of the third quarter, which provides consumer customers an extra business day to cure negative balances and avoid overdraft fees.\nWe also began to roll out early payday, which provides consumer -- customers who are -- who receive eligible direct deposits the ability to access funds up to 2 days earlier than scheduled, further reducing the potential to incur overdrafts. Notably, while this enhancement was rolled out in only 6 states in the third quarter, during the first 2 weeks of offering this enhancement, we provided customers early access to $2 billion in funds from 1.3 million eligible direct deposits.\nAnd we're on track for a fourth quarter rollout of an easy-to-access short-term credit product that will give qualifying customers another option to meet their personal financial needs. These actions build on services that we've introduced over the past several years, including offering an account that does not charge any overdraft fees. We now have over 1.6 million of those clear access banking accounts, up 57% from a year ago.\nAnd as I mentioned last quarter, we've developed a new integrated banking, lending and investment offering that is geared towards the more complex financial needs of our affluent clients called Wells Fargo Premier. During the quarter, we introduced Wells Fargo Premier across our entire branch footprint, initiated a branded digital experience, and launched marketing programs to help affluent customers learn more about how we can better serve them. We'll continue to build the Wells Fargo Premier offering in the -- tucked in the coming quarters.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to launch new APIs, providing our commercial and corporate clients more flexibility and helping them drive efficiencies. For example, we launched a new real-time payment API, allowing clients to send digital requests to a payer that can be approved to easily send a real-time credit transfer. We also launched a virtual card API, which enables clients to create and configure virtual cards for B2B vendor payments and purchases.\nIn our CIB markets businesses, we're accelerating our investment into our electronic trading capabilities across multiple asset classes to better meet the evolving needs of our clients, which is helping to drive strong gains in trading volumes. And we're selectively adding talent in our investment banking coverage and product areas as we focus on leveraging our strong existing relationships to build our fee-based businesses.\nWe also continued to make progress on the environmental, social and governance work that is underway at Wells Fargo. In the third quarter, we published our latest ESG report, which highlights the progress we made in 2021 on our ESG efforts. We consider this work a sustained long-term commitment, and believe Wells Fargo is well positioned to make a difference. We issued our second sustainability bond in the amount of $2 billion that will finance projects and programs, supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy and clean transportation.\nDuring the third quarter, we officially launched a new grant program in Houston, San Diego and Milwaukee to help improve racial equity in home ownership, and we have more markets coming before the end of this year. This is part of the $60 million commitment we made earlier this year through the Wells Fargo Foundation to wealth opportunities restored through home ownership for worth. This effort aims to create 40,000 homeowners of color access -- 40,000 homeowners of color across 8 markets by the end of 2025.\nWe announced a $1 million donation to provide urgent relief to Florida following the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In addition, customer accommodations and employee support are available to those directly impacted by the storm.\nIn summary, continued high inflation has kept the Federal Reserve aggressive with rate hikes, leading the housing market to slow rapidly and the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and geopolitical events caused the financial markets to be volatile. However, labor demand remains robust, consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and customers have capacity to borrow.\nWells Fargo is positioned well as we will continue to benefit from higher rates and ongoing disciplined expense management. Both consumer and business customers remain in a strong financial condition, and we continue to see historically low delinquencies and high payment rates across our portfolios. We're closely monitoring risks related to the continued impact of high inflation and increasing rates as well as the broader geopolitical risks, and we do expect to see increases in delinquencies, and ultimately, credit losses, but the timing remains unclear.\nAs we look forward, we remain bullish on our business opportunities. Our higher operating margins and strong capital ratios have prepared us for a wide range of macroeconomic scenarios. In the third quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 20% and our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, 110 basis points above our current regulatory minimum, including buffers. We will continue to prudently manage our capital levels to be appropriately prepared for slowing economy and market volatility.\nFinally, I know many of you are interested in our 2023 expectations and our -- and on our next earnings call, we plan to provide our 2023 expense and net interest income outlook, as well as more color on our path to an over the cycle of 15% ROTCE.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone.\nNet income for the quarter was $3.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted common share. As Charlie highlighted, our results included $2 billion or $0.45 per share of accruals primarily related to a variety of historical matters. These accruals drove our total expenses higher. However, if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue grew in the third quarter, driven by higher net interest income, while noninterest income also increased from the second quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 20.2%.\nWe highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio is 10.3%, down 6 basis points from the second quarter as the 21 basis point decline from AOCI as well as the impact from dividend payments was nearly offset by our third quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023.\nWe did not buy back any common stock in the second or third quarters, and we will continue to be prudent regarding the amount and timing of any share repurchases.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Credit performance remained strong, with only 17 basis points of net charge-offs in the third quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels over time as the Federal Reserve continues to take actions to combat inflation. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risks, and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards.\nCommercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses, with only $6 million of net charge-offs and net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio for the third consecutive quarter. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios. However, total consumer net charge-offs increased $72 million from the second quarter to 40 basis points on average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the auto portfolio.\nHigher loss rates on certain auto loans originated primarily in the latter part of 2021 contributed to the linked quarter increase in charge-offs and delinquent loans in the auto portfolio. Lower loan balances also impacted the loss rate, which started -- we started taking credit tightening actions earlier this year, which have improved the quality of 2022 originations. As a result of these actions, increased pricing competition and continued industry supply chain constraints, the third quarter origination volumes were down over 40% compared to a year ago.\nNonperforming assets declined again in the third quarter and were down $411 million or 7% from the second quarter and down 20% from a year ago. While commercial nonaccruals continued to decline, lower levels of consumer nonaccruals were the primary driver of lower nonperforming assets due to a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans from the impact of customers' sustained payment performance after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Our allowance for credit losses increased $385 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 11% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Period-end loans increased for the fifth consecutive quarter, but growth slowed as expected, with commercial loan balances holding relatively stable from the second quarter, while consumer loans grew driven by credit card and first lien residential mortgage loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio.\nI'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased nearly 100 basis points from a year ago and 76 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from both the year ago and the second quarter, with declines across our deposit-gathering businesses.\nCompared with the second quarter, Wealth and Investment Management had the largest decline by dollar amount as clients look for higher-yielding alternatives. Declines in our commercial businesses were driven mostly by outflows of nonoperational deposits, which can be more price sensitive and a less stable source of funding. Outflows in consumer and small business banking were driven by continued customer spending and increased outflows from customers seeking higher-yielding products.\nOur average deposit cost increased 10 basis points from the second quarter to 14 basis points. Pricing has been consistent with our expectations, with deposit costs holding relatively stable in Consumer Banking and Lending while trending higher across other businesses. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products to also increase.\nTurning to net interest income in Slide 7. Third quarter net interest income increased $3.2 billion or 36% from a year ago and $1.9 billion or 19% from the second quarter. The growth from the second quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and 1 additional day in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs.\nIn the first 9 months of this year, net interest income was up 19% compared with a year ago. We currently expect full year 2022 net interest income to be approximately 24% higher than a year ago, with fourth quarter 2022 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.9 billion.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 8. The increase in noninterest expense from both a year ago and from the second quarter was due to the higher operating losses that I highlighted earlier. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was down 5% from a year ago as we had lower revenue-related compensation, expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Excluding operating losses, our expenses would have been down on a year-over-year basis for 6 consecutive quarters.\nAnother way you can see the impact of our efficiency initiatives is through lower head count, which has declined for 9 consecutive quarters and was down 6% from a year ago. We've also reduced professional and outside services expense by 10% and occupancy expense by 4% during the first 9 months this year. The higher level of operating losses in the third quarter will cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion expense outlook for 2022, which included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the full year. We currently expect our fourth quarter other expenses, excluding operating losses, to be approximately $12.3 billion.\nAs Charlie highlighted, outstanding litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters still remain -- that will still remain, and will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 9. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 29% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out earlier this year, which eliminated non-sufficient funds and some other fees. The extra day grace period launched in the beginning of August and early payday began in select states in mid-September, so we would expect our deposit-related fees to decline further in the fourth quarter.\nIndustry mortgage rates have increased over 300 basis points since the beginning of the year and ended the quarter at the highest level since 2007, driving weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association to a 25-year low at quarter end. As a result, our Home Lending revenue declined 52% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins, as well as lower revenue from the re-securitization of loans purchased from securitization pools. While the mortgage market adjusts to lower volumes, we expect it to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in the fourth quarter when originations are seasonally slower.\nWe continue to remove excess capacity to align with the reduced demand and expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 8% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, which benefited from higher point-of-sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by loan spread compression and partially offset by higher loan balances. And Personal Lending was 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by growth in origination volumes.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Mortgage originations declined 59% from a year ago and 37% in the second quarter, with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 16% in the third quarter. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the second quarter, driven by growth in our non-conforming portfolio. I already highlighted the drivers of decline in auto originations.\nSo turning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3% from a year ago, spending declined 2% from the second quarter. As Charlie highlighted, credit card point-of-sale purchase volumes were up 25% from a year ago, with the largest percentage increases in fuel and travel. Average balances were up 21% from a year ago, reflecting the strong point of sale volume, which also benefited from the launch of new products, with new accounts up 11%. We will continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 11. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 54% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities, higher loan balances and higher revenue from renewable energy investments.\nNoninterest expense increased 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs and higher operating losses. Average loan balances have grown for 5 consecutive quarters, and were up 17% from a year ago. Line utilization rates were fairly stable relative to the second quarter. Inflation and our customers' continued efforts to rebuild inventory as supply chain challenges remain drove the growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. Loan growth in the Middle Market Banking continued to come from larger clients, which more than offset declines from smaller clients.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity. Compared with the second quarter, the increase in investment banking fees was due to the write-down of unfunded leveraged finance commitments last quarter.\nCommercial real estate revenue grew 29% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved commercial mortgage bank-backed securities gain on sale margins.\nMarkets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting volatility and strong client-demanded equities, rates and commodities and foreign exchange trading. Average loans grew 19% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across our businesses to fund clients' working capital needs, but the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter with average balances up 3% and period-end loans down 3% from the second quarter.\nOn Slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 1% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates offset the decline in asset-based fees driven by lower market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected the lower market valuations as of July 1. And while the S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the third quarter, the decrease was not as steep as the second quarter decline. So while there will be another step down in asset-based fees in the fourth quarter, it will be less significant than the third quarter decline.\nExpenses decreased 4% from a year ago due to lower revenue-related compensation. Average loans increased 3% from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.\nSlide 14 highlights our Corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $459 million of revenue and accounted for approximately $305 million of expense in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and given current market conditions, we don't expect equity gains to improve in the fourth quarter. Expenses increased from a year ago due to higher operating losses.\nIn summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect our improving earnings capacity. We had strong net interest income growth from rising rates, and if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong.\nWe will now take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.\nInformation about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions.\nRevenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower noninterest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking and wealth management advisory businesses. We continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses.\nWe had broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong. Our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth.\nWhile we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates and the slowing economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nOverall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns. However, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress. And for certain cohorts of customers, we have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic levels following the final Federal stimulus payments early last year, and their debit card spend has also been declining.\nOverall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago when consumers received stimulus payments. And inflation appears to be impacting certain categories of spending, including a 26% increase in fuel driven by higher prices, while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits, driven by fewer transactions.\nCredit card spend increased 28% from a year ago, above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories. However, spending, while still strong, started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Payment rates remained strong and delinquency rates remain low.\nOur small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses. Leading indicators such as payment rates, deposit levels, utilization and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress. Loan demand from our commercial customers remain strong with broad-based balance and commitment growth.\nOur commercial customers' credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net charge-offs, and nonaccrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years. However, we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts.\nNow let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph. Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago. We're focused on delivering competitive offerings, and our new reward card provides 3x points across top spending categories including restaurants, travel and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards-based cards we plan to introduce. We continued to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors.\nDuring the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships. We are working towards offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses. We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for premier clients.\nWe started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a new easy short-term credit product. We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances.\nWe also continue to invest to better serve our commercial customers. And early in the second quarter, Tim O'Hara joined the Corporate and Investment Bank from BlackRock as Head of Banking. Tim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients. And he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses, who have helped us navigate recent market volatility.\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance. We also believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions.\nLast week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from The Rockefeller Foundation as the Head of Social Impact, leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo Foundation. We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors.\nAs homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home construction, renovation and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the U.S. in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together. We also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services.\nWe continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the Small Business Resource Navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country. We are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connect to More program with complementary mentorship opportunities. We published our inaugural diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results we've made on our DE&I initiatives.\nFor example, in the U.S., our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately 1/3 of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse. As I've said in the past, advancing DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project, and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact.\nLet me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers.\nDespite the economic environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates, which should more than offset any further near-term pressure on noninterest income. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis in the second half of this year, and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.\nAs we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common share, which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615 million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago, when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7 billion of gains on equity securities.\nWhile credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth. This follows 6 consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago.\nWe highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first quarter as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets as well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities to held-to-maturity and hedging securities in our available-for-sale portfolio.\nAdditionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter. But as Charlie highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. We will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.\nOur 10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers. As a reminder, based on the recent Federal stress test, our stress capital buffer for October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 is expected to be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis points in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels. And we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only 2 basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios, and total consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans, as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses.\nNonperforming assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer nonaccruals were driven by a decline in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs.\nCommercial nonaccruals continued to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, we are at their lowest levels in over 10 years. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflect a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that was due to loan growth.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% for the first quarter. Period-end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios.\nI'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year ago, with growth in consumer banking and lending, offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients.\nOur average deposit cost increased 1 basis point from the first quarter, driven by corporate and investment banking. As I previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would likely increase as well.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 7. Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and 1 additional day in the quarter. We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021. Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens. With the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately 20% from 2021.\nAnd as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth.\nOn Slide 8 in noninterest income. This quarter, noninterest income -- this quarter, we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by 2 cyclical businesses. Mortgage banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates, and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions.\nWhile all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 3% from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Operating losses increased $273 million from a year ago, primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year and higher customer remediation expense predominantly from a variety of historical matters.\nCustomer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact. While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the remaining items.\nWe're halfway through the year. And while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue-related expenses are trending lower than expected. Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress we're making on our efficiency initiatives with lower headcount and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense. We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives.\nPutting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion as lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses. But as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory matters and customer remediations, and the related expenses could be significant and hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over time.\nAs Charlie highlighted, the deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, which will further reduce deposit-related fees.\nOn lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins given the higher rate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter. The impact of higher rates also reduced revenue from the re-securitization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter. We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 7%, auto revenue increased 5% and personal lending was up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 10% from the first quarter, with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 28%. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the first quarter, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.\nTurning to auto. Origination volume declined 35% from a year ago and 26% from the first quarter due to increased pricing competition, credit tightening actions and an ongoing industry supply pressures.\nTurning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3%, transactions were relatively flat from a year ago as increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% in credit card -- 19% increase in credit card balances from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our underwriting and new credit card accounts.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market banking revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with headcount down 9% from a year ago.\nAverage loan balances have grown for 4 consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they are still not back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation. We also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients.\nAverage deposits declined 2% from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance commitments due to the market spread widening.\nAverage loan balances were up 20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures. Commercial real estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization.\nMarkets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients position themselves for rising rates, quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading.\nAverage deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in Corporate Banking than we've seen in Commercial Banking.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 5% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of April 1, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of July 1. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter, and approximately 2/3 of our advisory assets are in equities. So there will be another step-down in our asset-based fees next quarter.\nAverage loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter as clients reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly.\nSlide 15 highlights our Corporate results. Both revenues and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and the sale of our student loan portfolio. These businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio. And they accounted for approximately $375 million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in Corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses.\nIn summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital and mortgage banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on noninterest income. While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels, our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress.\nAs I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier. Finally, our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20% increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval. We will now take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start off with some first quarter highlights. We earned $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share in the first quarter. Our results included $0.21 per share impact from a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. We have broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the fourth quarter. While net interest income was down modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by fewer days in the quarter, it grew 5% from a year ago. Higher interest rates, along with our expectations for continued loan growth should drive higher net interest income growth that we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nMike will provide more details regarding our current view later on in the call. However, the increase in rates negatively impacted our mortgage banking business. The mortgage origination market experienced one of its largest quarterly declines that I can remember and it will take time for the industry to reduce excess capacity. Credit performance remained incredibly strong, and our net charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points. While we have minimal direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine, we're monitoring certain industries that have the potential to be impacted by the conflict and economic sanctions, but thus far don't have concerns.\nIn addition, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including repurchasing $6 billion of common stock and increasing our common stock dividend to $0.25 per share. The significant changes we've made across the company have put us in a position to increase the dividend and our work continues. The health of our consumer and businesses so far has remained strong, though we're entering a period of uncertainty.\nMarch was the eighth straight month in which inflation outpaced income with lower income consumers being most impacted by rising energy and food prices. That said, higher deposit balances and rising wages have thus far allowed consumers to weather these headwinds. We continued to see median deposit balances above pre-pandemic levels, up approximately 25% compared to 2020 but down from the highs observed in 2021.\nConsumer credit card spend remained strong, up 33% from a year ago. All spending categories were up with the highest growth in travel, entertainment, fuel and dining. After strong growth in the first quarter of 2021, driven by stimulus payments, debit card spending increased 6% in the first quarter of 2022. Discretionary spending remained strong with entertainment up 39% and travel up 29% from a year ago.\nThe increase in energy prices was reflected in a 27% increase in fuel spending. Loan demand from our commercial customers increased with growth in both commitments and loans outstanding as customers' borrowing needs are increasing to fund working capital expansion. Credit quality remained strong with net recoveries in our commercial portfolio. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Building an appropriate risk and [control] infrastructure remains our top priority, and I continue to believe that we're making significant progress.\nEarly in the first quarter, we named Derek Flowers, our new Chief Risk Officer, following Mandy Norton's retirement announcement. Derek has extensive experience managing risk including the work he's done over the last several years of managing the build-out of Wells Fargo's risk and control framework. Derek has been with Wells Fargo for over 20 years and his familiarity with the company and its risk background make him the ideal candidate to succeed Mandy, who I'd like to thank for the tremendous progress she made in transforming the risk organization.\nWe also continue to make progress in resolving legacy regulatory issues with news in January that the OCC had terminated a consent order regarding add-on products that the company sold to retail banking customers before 2015. We have much more work to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements, and we will likely have setbacks, but I'm confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. We remain focused on improving our financial performance while investing to drive growth across our businesses.\nProviding our customers with simple, easy to use and fast digital experiences is one of our most important strategic priorities. In the first quarter, we began rolling out our new mobile banking experience for our customers in our consumer businesses, and feedback has been very positive. Digital adoption, which is critical to both delivering seamless digital experiences that our customers expect and reducing the cost to serve has continued to increase with mobile active customers up 4% from a year ago.\nWe added approximately 500,000 new mobile active customers in the first quarter alone. We continue to invest to improve our digital capabilities with additional enhancements planned for this year. We're also focused on reducing friction and moving money. We've continued to invest in Zelle and made changes to expand customer usage, including increasing sending limits. These changes have helped to drive 21% growth in active send customers and a 33% increase in send volume from a year ago. We continued to enhance our credit card offerings with our partnership with Bilt Rewards and MasterCard. This first of its kind co-brand card allows members to pay rent and earn points with no transaction fees on rent payments at any apartment in the U.S.\nIn the first quarter, we selected nCino to streamline our origination, underwriting and portfolio management for our small business customers. This collaboration is expected to provide our customers with a more streamlined lending experience and builds on our existing relationship that we announced last year to accelerate our digital transformation within our Commercial Banking and corporate investment banking businesses.\nLet me just make some summary comments before I turn it over to Mike. As we sit here today, our internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers' financial position but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth. In addition, the war in Ukraine adds additional risk to the downside. Wells Fargo is positioned well to provide support for our clients in a slowing economy. While we will likely see an increase in credit losses from historical lows, we should be a net beneficiary as we will also benefit from rising rates.\nWe have a strong capital position and our lower expense base creates greater margins from which to invest. We remain diligent in extending credit and are focusing on managing the other risk types within the company as well. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past on a run rate basis at some point this year.\nWe continue to focus on a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. As we have all seen, the reports and images coming out of Ukraine are deeply concerning. In order to support those most impacted, we announced $1 million in donations across 3 nonprofits in support of humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees as well as services that support the U.S. military.\nEarlier this week, we also announced plans to introduce HOPE Inside centers in select branches to increase access to financial education and guidance. Working with Operation HOPE is one important way that we can remove barriers to financial inclusion as part of our banking inclusion initiative, which is focused on helping more people who are unbanked gain access to affordable mainstream banking products. Since the pandemic began, close to 100,000 of our employees never left the workplace. And last month, we started to welcome the rest back to the office. It's been great to be back together again, and I want to thank all of our employees as they work together to better serve our customers, our communities and each other.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share, and our results included a $1.1 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly due to reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID on our loan portfolios. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 16%, which included net discrete income tax benefits due to stock-based compensation. We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately 18%, excluding any additional discrete items.\nOur CET1 ratio declined to 10.5%, still well above our regulatory minimum of 9.1%. We highlight capital on Slide 3. The decrease in our CET1 ratio from the fourth quarter reflected a $5.1 billion reduction in cumulative other comprehensive income, driven by high interest rates and wider agency MBS spreads, which reduced the ratio by approximately 40 basis points.\nHigher risk-weighted assets driven by growth in loan balances and commitments, we adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which had a minimal impact on total risk-weighted assets, and we continued with our strong capital returns. We repurchased $6 billion of common stock in the first quarter, bringing our total repurchases since the third quarter of 2021 to $18.3 billion, which is in line with our 2021 capital plan. While we have flexibility under the stress capital buffer framework to exceed the share repurchases contemplated in our capital plan, we will be disciplined in our approach, given the current rate volatility and currently expect to have significantly lower levels of share buybacks in the second quarter.\nFinally, we've submitted our 2022 capital plan. And as I've called out before, it's possible that our stress capital buffer could increase when the Federal Reserve publishes our official stress capital buffer in the third quarter, while our GSIB surcharge of 1.5% will remain the same for 2023.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net loan charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points in the first quarter. Commercial credit performance was strong again with $29 million of net recoveries in the first quarter driven by recoveries in energy, asset-based lending and middle market. Consumer credit performance was also strong. Credit losses were down $59 million from the fourth quarter, which included $152 million of net charge-offs related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans.\nThe first quarter included higher auto losses and seasonally higher credit card losses. Nonperforming assets decreased $323 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. Commercial nonaccruals were down $423 million, declining again this quarter and are now below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer nonaccruals increased $82 million driven by an increase in residential mortgage on accruals and primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have exceeded our expectations.\nOur allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, less uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID, the economic recovery thus far and an outlook that reflects the increasing risks from high inflation in the Russian-Ukraine conflict. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 3% from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Period-end loans grew for the third consecutive quarter and were up 6% from a year ago, with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results.\nAverage deposits increased $70.6 billion or 5% from a year ago, with growth in our consumer businesses and Commercial Banking, partially offset by continued declines in Corporate and Investment Banking and Corporate Treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7.\nFirst quarter net interest income increased $413 million or 5% from a year ago and declined $41 million from the fourth quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by $178 million of lower income from EPBO and paycheck protection program loans as well as 2 fewer days in the quarter, which offset the impact of higher earning asset yields and higher securities and loan balances. Last quarter, we highlighted that net interest income for full year 2022 could potentially increase by approximately 8% driven by loan growth and other balance sheet mix changes as well as the benefit from rising rates, which was based on the forward curve at that time.\nObviously, a lot has changed over the past 3 months. Loan growth has been solid and average loan balances were up 3% versus the fourth quarter and 2% at period end. If we continue to see increased demand, it's possible that average loan balances will be up in the mid-single digits from the fourth quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2022, up from our prior outlook earlier this year of low to mid-single digits.\nThe rate increase is currently included in the forward rate curve would also drive stronger net interest income growth than we anticipated earlier in the year. However, it's important to note that the benefit from rising rates is not linear, and we would expect deposit betas to accelerate after the initial rate hikes and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would also likely increase. Higher rates will also have a negative impact on mortgage volumes and potentially on market-related fees in corporate and investment banking, private equity and venture capital businesses and in wealth management.\nGiven our current expectations for higher loan growth and recent forward rate curves, net interest income for full year 2022 could be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from 2021. That said, net interest income growth will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth. Now turning to expenses on Slide 8.\nNoninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses also declined due to divestitures last year. The first quarter included approximately $600 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. We also had $673 million of operating losses, which were primarily driven by higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters.\nOur full year 2022 expenses are still expected to be approximately $51.5 billion. However, as we experienced this quarter, operating losses can be episodic and hard to predict, and we will continue to update you on our expense expectations throughout the year. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on Slide 9. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees, primarily reflecting lower fee waivers and an increase in debit card transactions.\nWe continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business and serve customers. Customers have continued to migrate to digital channels and correspondingly teller transactions are down 45% from pre-pandemic levels. Over the same period, we've decreased our number of branches by 12% and branch staffing by approximately 30%, and we have more opportunities to improve our efficiency while we continue to make enhancements to better serve customers.\nEarlier this year, we announced changes that we are making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. We began to implement some of these new policies and we'll be rolling out the rest of the changes this year. We eliminated fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions in early March. So these changes didn't have a meaningful impact on the first quarter results. We still expect the annual decline in these fees to be approximately $700 million.\nHowever, as we highlighted last quarter, this is an annualized estimate and the reduction may be partially offset by higher levels of activity, and we will observe how customers respond to the new features that will be introduced in the latter part of the year. Home lending revenue declined 33% from a year ago and 19% from the fourth quarter, driven by lower mortgage originations and (inaudible) margins given the higher rate environment and competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry.\nMortgage rates increased 156 basis points in the first quarter and are above rate levels observed for the most of the last -- for most of the last decade. Reflecting this environment, we expect second quarter originations and margins to remain under pressure and mortgage banking revenue to continue to decline. We've started to reduce expenses in response to the decline in volume and expect expenses will continue to decline throughout the year as excess capacity is removed and aligned to lower business activity.\nCredit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and point-of-sale volumes. Auto revenue increased 10% and personal lending was up 2% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Our mortgage originations declined 21% from the fourth quarter. We believe the mortgage market experienced its largest quarterly decline since 2003, primarily due to lower refinance activity in response to higher mortgage rates. Home lending loan balances grew modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.\nTurning to auto. Origination volume increased 4% from a year ago, but was down 22% from fourth quarter due to credit tightening in higher risk segments and increased price competition as interest rates rose, and we targeted solid returns for new originations. Turning to debit card. Transactions declined 7% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality and were up 3% from a year ago with double-digit growth in travel and entertainment.\nCredit card point-of-sale purchase volume continued to be strong, it was up 33% from a year ago, but down 5% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 14% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts increased over 80% from a year ago, and we continue to be pleased by the quality of the accounts we're attracting.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 11. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well as the impact of higher interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, stronger net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Noninterest expense declined 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and occupancy expense due to efficiency initiatives and lower lease expense.\nAfter declining during the first half of last year, average loan balances have grown for 3 consecutive quarters and were up 6% from a year ago. Revolver utilization rates have increased but are still well below historical levels. Loan demand has been driven by larger clients who are increasing borrowing due to the impact of inflation on material and transportation costs as well as to support inventory growth. We're also seeing new demand from some clients who are catching up from underinvestment in projects and capital expenditures over the past couple of years.\nTurning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. We Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher loan balances and improved treasury management results. Average loan balances were up 18% from a year ago with increased demand across most industries driven primarily by capital expenditures and growing working capital needs. Commercial real estate revenue grew 9% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances and higher revenue in our low-income housing business. Average loan balances were up 17% from a year ago, and originations in the first quarter outpaced volumes from a year ago and loan pipelines continue to be strong.\nMarkets revenue was down 18% from a year ago, primarily due to lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and high-yield products. Average deposits in corporate investment banking were down $25.3 billion or 13% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage into the asset cap.\nOn Slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 6% from a year ago, driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations and higher net interest income from the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So first quarter results reflected market valuations as of Jan 1, and second quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of April 1. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue.\nAverage deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 14 highlights our corporate results, both revenue and expenses declined from a year ago, driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio and divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $791 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2021, including the gain on sale of our student loan portfolio and they accounted for approximately $400 million of the decline in expenses compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down on the sale of our student loan portfolio.\nWe will now take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\n\nJohn M. Campbell\n\nDirector of IR, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\n\nCharles W. Scharf\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Wells Fargo & Company\n\nThanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our 2021 results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results and some of our expectations for 2022 before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some 2021 highlights. We earned $21.5 billion or $4.95 per common share in 2021. Expenses declined 7% from a year ago, reflecting lower operating losses and progress on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue increased 6% as we benefited from strong gains from equity securities and gain from sales of our student lending, asset management and corporate trust businesses. We also have broad-based revenue growth across our businesses, including home lending, consumer and small business banking, credit card, auto, commercial real estate, banking and wealth and investment management.\nCredit quality improved significantly as the economy improved and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our loan charge-off ratio declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $5.7 billion. Deposits increased $78 billion or 6% and loans grew 1%, with declines in the first half of the year offset by a 5% increase in the second half.\nWe also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter. And we repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of the year after the return to the SCB framework. Our results in the fourth quarter also showed continued broad-based momentum. We earned $5.8 billion or $1.38 per common share. We grew loans by $32.6 billion or 4% and deposits by $12.1 billion or 1% from the third quarter.\nExpenses declined 1% from the third quarter and 11% from a year ago, and we generated positive operating leverage over both periods. Most importantly, we continued to prioritize our risk and control work. And the strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results. Consumers continue to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, though we do see this declining as the median balances today are 27% higher than pre-pandemic levels but are down 10% from the third quarter.\nConsumer credit card spend also continued to be strong, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Holiday sales were strong with spending up 31% the 3 weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and that momentum continued post Thanksgiving. All spending categories were up in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, with the largest increases in travel, fuel, entertainment and dining.\nWeekly debit card spend during the fourth quarter was up every week compared to both 2019 and 2020. This increase was driven by higher transactions but also higher spend per transaction, reflecting inflationary impacts and increased spending in higher cost categories such as travel.\nWe are watching the impact from Omicron on consumer spending. And while there is some softening in restaurant, travel and entertainment in recent weeks, overall spending remained strong in the first week of January with credit card up 26% and debit card up 29% versus the same week in 2020. And we saw strong loan growth from the third quarter across our commercial businesses, including commercial real estate, asset-based lending, middle market banking and our markets and banking businesses.\nSo I've been at the company for a little over 2 years now, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes giving you my thoughts on our progress. Overall, I feel great about what we've accomplished and continue to feel energized about the opportunities in front of us. I think about this along several dimensions: talent, leadership and culture, risk regulatory and control, financial and strategic progress and our work on ESG and broader reputational issues.\nI've spoken of the substantial talent changes we've made, but just to remind you, 11 of 18 members are new to the operating committee and 2 are new to their job since I arrived. Additionally, well over half of the senior-most people at our company, meaning those who are 1 level below the operating committee, are new to their roles and a significant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership. And with it, we've changed how we run the company, how we prioritize our work and how we view our responsibility broadly.\nWe began a process 2 years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company. And the most significant part of this prioritization was the building and implementation of an effective risk and control framework across the company. Our approach and our progress are entirely different than they were when I arrived. We are laser-focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We have clear plans in place and clear owners for every regulatory deliverable we have. We have detailed reporting on how we're progressing on those plans. We review this reporting every single week at the operating committee level.\nThe detailed involvement of the operating committee members is very different from what was happening before I arrived. Our ability to identify issues has also improved from 2 years ago. I continue to believe that we're making significant progress, and this is based on what we see in our internal reporting. It doesn't mean that we're perfect. The fact that we have multiple consent orders makes it complex. It takes time to build all of our capabilities. And it's certainly in the regulator's purview to look at issues that have been outstanding for a long time, like the OCC did in the third quarter.\nBut I would point you to the comment made by the OCC in their recent consent order that highlights that we have taken steps to comply with their 2018 order, and we're committed to addressing remaining requirements. I remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. Having said that, it continues to be the case that we're likely to have setbacks along the way. But that doesn't change the fact that we believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done.\nWe're making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have also begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We're just now beginning to bring things to market that are differentiated, and the number of significant opportunities are exciting. We're continuing to track to the financial return goals we've discussed: first, achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past and then target 15%. We continue to believe that we will achieve the 10% during 1 of the quarters in 2022 on an annualized basis.\nTo achieve this, we're aggressively focused on driving efficiencies and we're seeing net expense reductions after significant investments in our control build-out and our businesses. We are aggressively returning excess capital to shareholders now that we've returned to the SCB framework. We continue to manage credit well, and we're seeing early benefits from higher interest rates, growing loan balances and higher fees in certain businesses. We're doing this while devoting significant resources to building our franchise.\nWe have fallen behind in providing competitive digital capabilities for our clients. This is changing. In the fourth quarter, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for consumer and small business customers that is set to beginning -- set to begin rolling out this quarter. It has a new modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs. This platform is necessary to drive significantly higher digital adoption from our customers.\nEven with our existing capabilities, in the fourth quarter, our customers logged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile device, up 7% year-over-year. Teller transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We also announced that later this year, we'll be adding an all-new virtual assistant, Fargo to the app. Customers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions, ask Fargo to complete the task for them, and Fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their finances. We will also be introducing the first phase of the redesign of our public website early this year.\nIn addition, we're beginning to become more active on the wholesale side. For example, we announced that we're collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs. We're also approaching payments and credit cards very differently. We believe credit cards will remain important as both the credit and as a payment vehicle. We were also doing additional work around noncard payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key financial services provider.\nTwo years ago, our products and capabilities supporting those products were not as competitive as necessary. In 2021, we launched 2 products, including Active Cash, which we believe is the best cash-backed product in the marketplace, and Reflect, which rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core experience, including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application and enhancing our underwriting. These efforts have driven an increase in digital card activation, paperless statements and enrollment alerts.\nWe are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were prelaunch of these products, and importantly, we're not competing on credit. In fact, the quality of applications and the accounts for booking continues to be better than what we were booking historically.\nAway from card, we're beginning to invest in our broader digital payments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits and broadly reducing the friction and moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate with Zelle transactions up 46% from a year ago.\nWe are also taking a very different approach in that we believe that for us to be successful, we must consider a broader set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. This is not in lieu of shareholders. In fact, we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. We have taken significant efforts to support small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic and recently fulfilled our roughly $420 million Open for Business fund commitment to assist small businesses in recovering from the pandemic, by working with not-for-profits to offer capital, technical assistance and long-term programs. The fund was created by donating the gross processing fees we made from administering the Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020.\nAdditionally, we made significant climate commitments in 2021. In the fourth quarter, we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their financing with the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. And last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions attributable to financing by 2050. We expect to announce our first finance emission targets for the oil and gas and power sectors later this year.\nWe made our first solar-plus-battery-storage tax equity commitment. Once it is operational, it will be one of the largest solar and battery projects in the company. Last year, we surpassed $13.3 billion in cumulative tax equity investments in nearly 600 wind, solar and fuel cell transactions. These investments have provided 13% of all utility scale wind and solar capacity in the U.S. over the past 16 years. We continue to be one of the top investors in affordable multifamily housing in the U.S. as well as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments.\nAdditionally, we're committed to expanding affordable homeownership. For example, in the fourth quarter, we committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low and moderate income residents in Houston with home payment down assistance -- I'm sorry, home down payment assistance. We've also supported our employees and in December, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefits and competitive pay, we're increasing U.S. minimum pay hourly pay levels to a range of $18 to $22 effective at the end of this month.\nJust this week, we announced new efforts that will roll out over the course of 2022 to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs, building on other changes we've made over the last several years. The changes we announced include the elimination of transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, the elimination of nonsufficient fund fees, early access to direct deposit by providing customer access to funds up to 2 days before their scheduled deposit, a 24-hour grace period for customers that overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee, and a new short-term credit product for customers to meet personal financial needs.\nThis builds on existing features we already have in place, including Clear Access Banking, our no-overdraft checking account that we launched in September 2020, and we now have over 1.1 million outstanding customer accounts. Overdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, which automatically rewinds overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning, which were replaced by our expanded 24-hour grace period. Balance alerts that help customers avoid overdraft by sending more than 1.3 million alerts every day. Putting all of these changes in perspective, these fees are down significantly since the financial crisis. We have alternatives for both customers that do not want to overdraft and those that do. This is a competitive marketplace. We continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customer.\nAnd let me make a few comments now as we look forward. While there is a risk with the continued growth of the Omicron variant or potentially other variants later this year, I expect to see continued strong economic trends in 2022. Consumers' financial condition remains strong. Modest debt growth, strong asset appreciation and higher deposit balances have left household balance sheets in excellent condition, which should help drive continued strong consumer spending.\nCorporate America has demonstrated the ability to adapt to the ever-changing pandemic conditions. Inventories remained unusually lean as businesses adopted a defensive posture and supply chains have been disrupted. This is expected to result in substantial gains in industrial production as they continue to restock. We're beginning to see loan growth and expect this to continue.\nIn a moment, Mike will provide our thoughts on net interest income and expenses for 2022. I commented earlier that we remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis at some point this year. And that once we've achieved this goal, we'll discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. But at a high level, we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors including: a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve; ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives; a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses; continued execution on our risk and regulatory control framework; and moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted. It's important to note we currently have the ability to grow loans even under the asset cap.\nThe changes we made to the company and continued strong economic growth prospects make us feel good about how we're positioned entering 2022. We also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements with setbacks likely to continue along the way. And we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us.\nAs we look forward, we will continue to be aggressive in driving progress and improvement in our performance, embrace our responsibility to our customers and communities, and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future. I want to conclude by thanking our employees who continued to serve our customers through another challenging year. I appreciate their hard work and their resiliency while we made progress on making Wells Fargo better. I look forward to all that we accomplish in the year ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael P. Santomassimo\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everybody. Charlie summarized how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year on Slides 2 and 3, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4.\nNet income for the quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.38 per share -- common share. Our fourth quarter results included a $943 million net gain on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. There could be future gains related to these sales due to post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions; an $875 million decrease in allowance for credit losses as credit trends continue to be strong; and a $260 million impairment of certain leased railcars due to changes in demand for these cars.\nWe also had $2.5 billion or $1.9 billion after noncontrolling interest of equity gains, primarily from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, the third consecutive quarter of strong returns in these businesses. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, including the discrete impacts related to business divestitures. Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting share repurchases and an increase in risk-weighted assets primarily from loan growth in the quarter.\nWe repurchased $7 billion of common stock in the fourth quarter, partially offset by $1.4 billion of new issuances, predominantly for the annual matching contribution for our 401(k) plans. As a reminder, the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower G-SIB capital surcharge.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 6. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points in the fourth quarter. Commercial credit performance continued to be strong with net loan charge-offs declining $10 million from the third quarter to 2 basis points. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, the commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well. Commercial real estate valuations and investment activity has rebounded off their lows across all property types, although there is still some risk in office and select hotel and retail segments.\nConsumer credit performance also remained strong with higher collateral values for homes and autos, and consumer cash reserves remain above pre-pandemic levels. Consumer net charge-offs of $393 million increased $172 million from the third quarter. $152 million of the increase is related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets increased $145 million or 2% from the third quarter, driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals, primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Loans that were modified in 2021 upon exiting forbearance are reported as nonaccrual until they perform for a period of time.\nOverall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have been aligned with our expectations. After increasing during the first 4 quarters of the pandemic, commercial nonperforming assets have declined for 4 consecutive quarters, and we're back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the ongoing economic recovery and the uncertainties that still remain. If the economic recovery continues, we would expect to have additional reserve releases.\nOn Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 2% from the third quarter with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We had strong growth late in the quarter and period-end loans grew $32.6 billion or 4% from the third quarter with broad-based growth across most of our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth geographies over when discussing business segment results.\nAverage deposits increased $89.9 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate, investment banking and in corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 8. A year ago, we provided our expectation for 2021 net interest income to be flat to down 4% from the originally reported annualized fourth quarter 2020 level, and we ended up being down 3% for the full year. Fourth quarter net interest income was down $93 million or 1% from a year ago and grew $353 million or 4% from the third quarter. The increase in the third quarter was driven by higher loan balances, including higher interest income from loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. We also benefited from higher trading assets and a favorable funding mix.\nIn the fourth quarter, we had $318 million of interest income associated with EPBOs, and at year-end, we had a total of $17.3 billion of these loans, down from $34.8 billion a year ago. And as I highlighted last quarter, we expect these balances to decline substantially by the end of this year. We also had $130 million of interest income in the fourth quarter from Paycheck Protection Program loans or PPP loans, and were outstanding -- and are outstanding decline to $2.4 billion at year-end. We've reflected the headwind from these portfolios running off in our 2022 net interest income waterfall that I will review later on the call. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points from the third quarter, 3 basis points of which was due to higher interest income from EPBOs.\nNow turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 11% from a year ago. The decrease reflected progress we made on our efficiency initiatives, including reductions in personnel costs, consultant spend and occupancy expense. I will provide specific examples of the progress we made in our efficiency initiatives in 2021 later on the call before updating you on our expense expectations for 2022. We also had lower restructuring charges and operating losses in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago. Fourth quarter expenses included 1 month or approximately $100 million of operating expenses from our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management prior to their sales on November 1.\nNow turning to our business segments, starting with Consumer Banking lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit-related fees as fourth quarter 2020 included some COVID-related fee waivers. Fourth quarter 2021 also reflected an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions compared with a year ago, and the benefit of strong deposit growth was largely offset by lower spreads.\nCharlie highlighted the enhancements and changes we're making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. The impact from the fees that will be reduced, including the elimination of nonsufficient fund or NSF fees as well as overdraft protection transfer fees, is estimated to be approximately $700 million annually. Also, we expect that they may be partially offset by other fees due to higher levels of activity as well as the expiration of various fee-related waivers that were in place in 2021. In terms of new features to be rolled out in the latter part of the year, including a 24-hour grace period for overdrafts and a new short-term loan product, we will have to observe how customers respond.\nHome lending revenue declined 8% from a year ago, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain on sale margins and origination volumes. Even before the recent rate back up, we started to see a drop in application volume in December, and we expect originations to decline in 2022, which will put pressure on margins as the industry adapts to the lower volume. Credit card revenue was up 3% from a year ago, driven by higher point-of-sale volume, partially offset by higher rewards costs, including promotional offers on our new active Cash Card. Auto revenue increased 17% from a year ago and higher loan balances with the average balances up $6.8 billion.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 7% from the third quarter. We expect our first quarter originations to continue to decline due to lower refinance activity and the typical seasonal slowdown in the purchase market. We increased our nonconforming originations in the fourth quarter and have grown our nonconforming portfolio for 7 consecutive months, reflecting the improvements in our capabilities as well as the reintroduction of cash-out refinancing late in the first quarter of 2021.\nTurning to auto. Limited vehicle inventories continued to constrain industry new car sales. However, we had our third consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 77% from a year ago, with the majority of our originations coming from used cars. Originations also benefited from the enhancements we continue to make in our capabilities. Importantly, we are maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so.\nTurning to debit card. Transactions were relatively stable from the third quarter and up 10% from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories. Credit card point of sale purchase volume continued to be strong, was up 28% from a year ago and 11% from the third quarter. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 5% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts more than doubled from a year ago, driven by our new active cash card, and we're pleased by the quality of the accounts we've been attracting.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago. Results included higher deposit balances and modestly higher investment banking fees, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments, partially offset by lower loan balances.\nNoninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and consulting expense due to the efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense. Loan balances started to increase late in the third quarter and now have grown for 4 consecutive months with growth accelerating in December. As with other portfolios, we are adhering to the same credit risk appetite. Increases in the Middle Market Banking were driven by growth from our larger clients, a modest uptick in revolver utilization and strong seasonal borrowing. Growth in asset-based lending and leasing was driven by new client wins as well as increased levels from higher prices and some increases in inventory levels.\nTurning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago. Investment Banking had a strong quarter, with higher debt origination and advisory fees. Banking results also benefited from higher loan balances. Commercial real estate revenue grew 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial real estate financing activity. Loan originations returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we had a healthy pipeline as we started the new year.\nMarkets revenue was relatively stable from a year ago. It was down 14% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower trading activity in spread products and equity derivatives. Average deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down $23.7 billion from a year ago, driven by actions taken across all lines of business to manage under the asset cap. Average loans increased from both the third quarter and a year ago across all lines of business. On a period-end basis, loans grew every month since June and growth accelerated in December.\nWealth and Investment Management on Slide 14. The revenue grew 6% from a year ago as higher asset-based fees and market valuations more than offset a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue. This increase was partially offset by lower salaries expense, reflecting progress on efficiency initiatives. Client assets reached a record $2.2 trillion, up 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by strong results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenue in 2021, excluding net gains on sale and $1.5 billion of noninterest expense. We expect approximately $200 million of these expenses associated with transition services agreements to remain in 2022, with offsetting revenue so it's P&L neutral. We also expect approximately $300 million of corporate overhead expenses related to these businesses to remain in 2022, which we expect to manage down over time.\nTurning now to our expectations for 2022, starting with net interest income on Slide 16. As the last couple of weeks have demonstrated, it's challenging this early in the year to predict the rate environment, loan demand and other variables that impact net interest income for the full year. But let me highlight the key drivers of our net interest income for 2022.\nWe are assuming the asset capital remain in place throughout 2022, moving left to right on the waterfall. As we have discussed previously, we have a headwind this year from the runoff of PPP and EPBO loans. However, our current outlook loans is for average balances to grow low to mid-single digits from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Along with other balance sheet mix changes, this is expected to more than offset that headwind. This net result would increase net interest income approximately 3% in 2022 from the $35.8 billion we generated in 2021.\nMoving to rates and repricing. The recent forward curve includes approximately [3 25] basis point rate hikes this year beginning in May. Assuming this were to play out, net interest income has the potential to grow up to an additional 5%, resulting in approximately 8% net interest income growth in 2022 versus 2021. That said, the implied forward curve has changed a lot over the last 1.5 months, so it's very hard to forecast with any certainty.\nAnother way to view our asset sensitivity is from the disclosure we provided in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It showed that the estimated impact of our -- of an instantaneous 50 basis points increase in short-term rates would increase net interest income by approximately $2.7 billion over the next 12 months. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2022 will depend on a variety of factors, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan demand and cash redeployment.\nNow turning to expenses on Slide 17. We made progress last year on our efficiency initiatives and we continue to identify new opportunities. Our portfolio of initiatives that includes realized and identified potential gross saves has grown from approximately $8 billion to $10 billion, and we are continuing to work across the company. We expect to execute on our remaining identified initiatives over the next 2 to 3 years, and we'll continue to invest across our businesses. Importantly, similar to last year, we are excluding from our efficiency initiatives the resources needed to address our risk and control work, and we'll continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work.\nWe've been reducing expenses across our businesses, but let me highlight a few examples of the progress we made last year. We eliminated management layers and increased bank control with a 20% decrease in managers with (inaudible) of control. We completed approximately 270 branch consolidations in 2021, a continuation of the progress we've made the last few years with branches down 11% since 2019. We've also optimized branch staffing levels to better reflect our customers or how our customers are using our branches.\nWithin our technology organization, we reduced nonengineering roles by approximately 40%, driven by accelerated adoption of the agile framework. And headcount across the company declined approximately 6% from a year ago, excluding divested businesses. In addition to reducing the number of branches, we also reduced our office real estate portfolio by approximately 7% and occupancy expense was down 9% compared with a year ago. This year, we expect to continue to realize savings from these initiatives, including an incremental 5% reduction in office real estate. Additionally, the investments we're making in technology should drive improvements in operations, consumer banking, consumer lending, commercial banking. Importantly, these efforts should not only reduce expenses but also improve the customer experience with enhanced fraud detection, more service self-service capabilities and faster underwriting decisions.\nNow turning to our 2022 expense outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $53.8 billion of noninterest expense in 2021. This was largely in line with our most recent guidance, except for higher operating losses. We had approximately $500 million of expenses in 2021 related to business exits and restructuring charges and the civil money penalty associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. We also had approximately $1 billion of expenses in 2021 from the Wells Fargo Asset Management and our Corporate Trust Services business, which were sold and that will not continue in 2022.\nSo we believe a good starting point for the discussion of 2022 expenses is the $52.3 billion. We are assuming a modest increase in equity markets this year and expect revenue-related expenses to grow by approximately $300 million. This includes expected increases in Wealth and Investment Management and Corporate Investment Banking, partially offset by expected declines in home lending, reflecting lower origination volumes. Higher revenue-related compensation is a good thing, and the associated revenue will more than offset any increase in expenses.\nWe also expect approximately $500 million of wage and benefits-related inflationary increases in 2022 above and beyond the normal level of merit and pay increases, driven by higher personnel expenses, including the minimum wage increase that Charlie highlighted and other compensation changes. Through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize approximately $3.3 billion of gross expense reductions from 2022. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by approximately $1.2 billion of incremental investments primarily related to higher personnel in expenses in commercial banking, corporate and investment banking and technology as well as increased spending on risk management.\nWe also expect approximately $500 million in increased spending in other areas, including higher FDIC insurance assessments, higher travel and entertainment expenses, which were significantly lower in 2021 due to the pandemic. Accordingly, our full year 2022 expenses are expected to be approximately $51.5 billion, a net reduction of approximately $800 million versus the $52.3 billion. Embedded in our assumptions are approximately $1.3 billion of operating losses for 2022, which is the amount we had in 2021, excluding the $250 million associated with the OCC enforcement action. While we've made significant progress on working through legacy issues, as we've previously disclosed, we still have outstanding litigation and regulatory issues, and related expenses could significantly exceed the levels we had in 2021.\nWe made substantial progress last year in executing our efficiency initiatives, but we still have significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. We are focused on achieving net expense reductions while appropriately investing in our businesses. This remains a multiyear process, with the ultimate goal of achieving an efficiency ratio in line with our peers and based on our business mix. We'll now take your questions.",

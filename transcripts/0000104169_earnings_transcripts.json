At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Steph. You may begin.\n\nStephanie Wissink\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Walmart Inc\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Joining me today from our home office in Bentonville are Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, and CFO, John David Rainey. Doug will begin with remarks about our upcoming leadership transition. We will hear from John Furner, recently named as CEO of Walmart Inc. beginning 1 February 2026. Doug and John David will then share their views on the Q3 and our business trends. Thereafter, we'll open the line for your questions.\nDuring the question-and-answer portion, we'll invite segment leaders to join in responding to your questions: John for Walmart US, Kath McLay for Walmart International, and Chris Nicholas for Sam's Club US. We will make every effort to answer as many questions as we can in the hour we have scheduled for this call. As a courtesy to others, please limit yourself to one question.\nFor additional detail on our results, including highlights by segment, please see our earnings release and supplemental presentation on our website. Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.\nPlease review our press release and slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. That concludes my introduction. Doug, it's my privilege to turn the earnings call over to you one last time.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. The team delivered another strong quarter. Our associates have us well positioned to finish the year with momentum. It's been an honor to serve them as CEO, and I'm as excited about the future of this company as I've ever been. John's ready. He knows our business so well, and he has the characteristics to lead us into the future. I couldn't be happier for him and for our company. Congratulations, John.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nThank you, Doug. I'm excited about our future. I'm appreciative and humbled by this opportunity, and look forward to accepting the responsibility to serve Walmart more broadly as president and CEO. I love this company, and I love our associates. I believe in our values, and in our purpose to help people save money and live better. I believe we're well positioned to fulfill our purpose.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nYou'll be great. Back to the quarter, the team delivered strong sales and profit growth across each of our segments. Sales grew 5.9% overall in constant currency, and adjusted operating income grew even faster at 8%. We drove positive transaction counts and unit volumes, and we're gaining market share in grocery and general merchandise, including here in the US, where we saw strength across income cohorts, and especially with higher-income households.\nIt's great to see the positive general merchandise sales across the company, and I'm excited about what we're seeing with our fashion categories in Walmart US in particular. E-commerce was a highlight again in Q3, up 27% in total. Each segment delivered growth in e-commerce above 20%. The way we're driving growth on the top line is helping us strengthen and differentiate our bottom line. Globally, advertising grew 53%, including Vizio, and membership income was up 17%.\nLet's talk about each segment. I'll start with international, which continues to lift the growth rate for the company. International drove the strongest performance with a sales increase of 11.4% in constant currency, and adjusted operating income grew 16.9%. We continue to benefit from business mix changes and lower losses in e-commerce. Transaction counts and unit volumes are up across markets, and we're gaining market share.\nE-commerce sales for international were up 26%. That included our Flipkart team in India executing a record Big Billion Days event. Almost 1/3 of our business outside the US is digital, with e-commerce in China at 50% penetration. The team in China is delivering orders fast. Nearly 80% of digital orders arrive in under an hour. In October, I got to visit three Chinese cities.\nIn Hefei, a city of about 10 million people, we visited a relatively new Sam's Club that was outstanding. We now have 60 Sam's Clubs in the country, and a healthy pipeline of new clubs coming. China is more advanced in terms of digital retail than anywhere we operate, and there's always a lot to learn that helps inform what we do around the world. I also got a chance to visit our team in Canada last month.\nI'm excited about the leadership team, and the opportunity we have to grow market share, reinforced by EDLP, and tapping into our omnichannel advantages. For Walmart US, we drove comp sales of 4.5%, and we grew e-commerce by 28% with marketplace sales growth of 17%. We continued to deliver the value people are looking for, with healthy growth in both transactions and units sold.\nComps were good across each month of the quarter, and share gains were consistent with what we've seen this year. Delivery speed matters, and we're delivering faster than ever. For Q3, 35% of digital orders were delivered in under three hours. At a category level, sales and general merchandise were positive, with fashion, home, and automotive leading the way. Grocery performed well with good unit growth, and health and wellness was up low double digits.\nFor Sam's Club here in the US, the team delivered comp sales of 3.8%, with strength across categories. The comp was driven by transaction counts, and we're gaining market share in grocery and general merchandise. Sam's continues to do a great job of engaging our members digitally. We have a profitable e-commerce business that outpaced our expectations again this quarter, up 22% in sales.\nFor Sam's membership, we see good growth in member counts, renewal rates, and plus member penetration. As we look at our customers and members here in the US, they're still spending, with upper and middle-income households driving our growth. We continue to benefit from higher-income families choosing to shop with us more often. Middle-income households have been steady, and while lower-income families have been under additional pressure of late, we're encouraged by how our teams are meeting them with greater value across necessities, and doing what we can to help them stretch their dollars further. For the quarter, like-for-like inflation in Walmart US was 1.3%, with food and general merchandise up low single digits. We continue working to resist the upward pressure on our cost of goods and to manage our mix. We have about 7,400 active rollbacks in Walmart US.\nRight now, with more than half of those in the grocery category. Often, our 90-day rollbacks lead to a permanent price reduction, a new EDLP. Since the beginning of the year, more than 2,000 rollbacks have become the new everyday price. We'll keep strengthening our ability to save people time and money, and we'll keep finding ways to keep our prices as low as possible, and being strategic in our pricing actions. Everyone wants value. Inventory management is always important, and it's especially important in this environment as we reduce markdown risks to help fund stronger price gaps. Our team continues to do a great job. The ability of our Walmart US team in particular to make good quantity decisions and manage pricing and mix well has been impressive. Both Walmart and Sam's US delivered strong seasonal sell-throughs for back to school and Halloween.\nThe results we're delivering today are powered by our people and by technology. We continue to get better at putting our data to work, building more capable tech products and platforms, and by deploying physical automation. The investments to automate our supply chain continue to go well. The team is delivering according to plan, and it's helping our associates and our stores receive and manage inventory better than before.\nAs it relates to AI, we continue building towards an e-commerce experience that is, one, more personalized and relevant; two, multimodal, meaning a voice, text, image, and video experience that is more conversational. Interacting with our app will include improved imagery, short-form video, live streaming, and interaction with influencers. Ads will still be present, but in a more contextual and helpful way, surfacing as recommendations or sponsored bundles that add value. There'll be attention capture and decision influence through data.\nThe new experience will be contextual, understanding customer intent and anticipating needs to save them time. As we think about new tech products and capabilities, sometimes we build our own tech, and sometimes we partner. Our recent announcement with OpenAI is an example. This new partnership will allow customers and members to purchase items from Walmart and Sam's Club directly through ChatGPT.\nThis starts relatively simplistically with the checkout process, but it'll become more immersive, integrated, and seamlessly connected experiences that bring Walmart closer to customers in new ways. We're adopting artificial intelligence and its various forms across the company. Take software development, for example. When AI is used for software development, more than 40% of the new code is either AI-generated or AI-assisted.\nWe're helping our associates build the skills they'll need to thrive in an AI-powered workplace through things like embracing OpenAI certifications and rolling out ChatGPT enterprise licenses. I'll wrap up by saying thank you and conveying my excitement about our future. Our strategy is clear, and we're focused on innovating, and consistently executing to deliver greater sales, margins, and returns. Our associates continue to impress.\nThey care. They learn. They step up and change. They're moving forward. They bring our purpose and our values to life. This company and our team's ability to change should not be underestimated. That ability enables us to adapt and thrive. Our timeless purpose and values, combined with the ability to innovate, ensure our strong future. John David, over to you.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nThanks, Doug. We're pleased with how the team executed this quarter, with the strength of our business across markets, continued share gains, and disciplined cost control. Our results were better than expected on the top and bottom line, and reflect the advantages of our omnichannel model and the diversified nature of our profit streams. As we indicated earlier this year, we're playing offense, accelerating our growth, reinforcing our customer and member value proposition, evolving our model, and diversifying our profits. Importantly, we're delivering on our financial framework of growing profit faster than sales.\nOur strategy of offering everyday low prices, while leveraging our physical and digital assets to provide greater convenience, is clearly resonating. Now I'll get into some of the details of our Q3 performance. Consolidated revenue in constant currency increased 6%, or more than $10 billion, led by continued e-commerce momentum with 27% growth.\nIn all of our markets, we're getting faster with delivery speeds, reaching more households across a broader assortment, and improving execution. For example, in Walmart US, approximately 35% of store-fulfilled orders were expedited or delivered in under three hours, and sales through these expedited channels increased nearly 70% this quarter. The notable thing about our e-commerce growth is the consistency of it across our markets. In Walmart US, comp sales grew 4.5%, with traffic growth both in stores and online.\nE-commerce sales grew 28%, led by strength in pickup and delivery, and advertising. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of e-commerce growth above 20%. We're encouraged by the share gains across grocery, health and wellness, and general merchandise categories. Fashion, in particular, has been a bright spot with improving comp trends throughout this year. The US.\nteam continues to do an excellent job balancing price and mix to reinforce our value proposition. We're leaning into price rollbacks and making both everyday essentials and seasonal celebrations more affordable for customers and members. Walmart's Thanksgiving meal basket is a great example. It will feed a group of 10 people for less than $40. The international segment delivered over 11% sales growth in constant currency, led by strength in Flipkart, China, and Walmx. Flipkart had strong results aided by the earlier timing of the Big Billion Days, or BBD, sales event.\nThe BBD event saw strong customer engagement, with sales growth led by mobile devices, electronics, and fashion. At our peak, we delivered 87 orders per second, with the fastest delivery in about three minutes. Sales in China increased 22% in Q3, reflecting ongoing strength at Sam's Club and more than 30% growth in e-commerce. Sam's Club US.\nComp sales ex-fuel increased 3.8%. Recall that we're lapping a multi-day period of strong comps in Q3 last year related to a port strike that equated to an approximate 120 basis point benefit to comp sales in last year's period. Members continue to engage more digitally, both inside the club using Scan&Go, as well as through the convenience of curbside pickup and delivery options. Member adoption of Scan&Go reached 36% in Q3, an increase of 450 basis points versus last year, and club-fulfilled delivery grew triple digits again this quarter.\nThe Sam's team continues to enhance member benefits related to e-commerce. Curbside pickup is now free for all members, with no minimum purchase requirements, and we've accelerated the speed of delivery by leveraging Walmart's Spark Driver platform to pick and fulfill delivery orders. These actions have contributed to stronger e-commerce sales and improved average delivery times.\nConsolidated gross profit was relatively flat year-over-year. Walmart US increased 19 basis points as a result of disciplined inventory management and favorable business mix. This was offset by pressure in the international segment from channel and format mix due in part to Flipkart's Big Billion Days event, as well as ongoing price investments in Mexico. Merchandise category mix in Walmart US remains a headwind as sales growth in grocery and health and wellness outpaced general merchandise.\nAcross the enterprise, our business model continues to evolve, with operating income increasingly influenced by improved e-commerce economics, particularly in Walmart US and Flipkart, with growing contributions from business mix, most notably in higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees. This quarter, the combination of advertising and membership fee income represented approximately 1/3 of our consolidated adjusted operating income. With continued strong momentum in e-commerce, our advertising business globally increased 53%, including Vizio.\nWalmart Connect in the US ex-Vizio grew 33% as we continue to grow advertiser counts, including through our third-party marketplace. We also saw 34% growth in international advertising, led by Flipkart. Membership income increased 17% across the enterprise, led by 34% growth in international, primarily due to Sam's Club China. In the US, Walmart Plus membership income continued to grow at a double-digit pace. Across all income cohorts, we saw membership income growth accelerate, with overall Q3 net ads our strongest on record, supported by new benefits like our OnePay cash rewards credit card, and expanded streaming services.\nSam's Club US membership income grew 7%. We're encouraged by the strength of new member acquisition at Sam's globally, particularly among younger demographics. Adjusted SG&A expenses leveraged slightly in Q3. Expenses are being well managed across the business. Technology and AI have been enablers of efficiency gains.\nWe're using AI across the organization to manage costs effectively and to accelerate our growth. As we continue to invest in supply chain automation, we're also seeing improved efficiency in fulfillment economics. In Walmart US, more than 60% of our stores are now receiving some freight from automated distribution centers, and more than 50% of our e-commerce fulfillment center volume is now automated, which is driving better unit productivity and helping to lower the cost to serve.\nEnterprise adjusted operating income increased 8% in constant currency, growing faster than sales across each of our operating segments. International delivered strong operating income growth of nearly 17%, reflecting contributions from business mix, improved e-commerce economics, and growth of membership income, while we saw mid-single-digit growth from both of our US segments. Adjusted EPS was slightly better than we expected, up nearly 7% to $0.62.\nOur Q3 GAAP results include a charge of approximately $700 million related to our PhonePe subsidiary in India. This was a discrete non-cash charge related to share-based compensation expense and contemplation of a potential IPO. Our teams continue to do a great job managing inventory in this dynamic environment. Inventory levels increased approximately 3% for the total company, with Walmart US inventory up 2.6% despite higher costs from tariffs.\nWith our growing 3P marketplace, we have the ability to better balance owned and third-party inventory, improving our working capital efficiency, while still offering the customer a broader assortment. Return on investment, as measured over the last 12 months, declined slightly, primarily due to the PhonePe charge discussed earlier. Underlying ROI performance continues to improve, supported by capital discipline and operating cash flow strength.\nThe business continues to generate strong cash flow, with year-to-date operating cash flow of $27 billion, up $4.5 billion compared to last year. This provides flexibility to reinvest in the business while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $13 billion through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, Q3 results demonstrate the underlying strength and resiliency of our business model. Our diverse portfolio of businesses, our scale, and our commitment to innovation give us confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable growth.\nNow turning to guidance. Recall at our Investor Day in April, on the heels of the tariff announcements, we said that we're going to play offense. We said that we would look to gain share. We said that despite some of the obvious headwinds, we're not giving up on our goal of growing profits faster than sales.\nGiven the year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, we're raising our guidance for sales and operating income for the year. Full-year sales in constant currency is expected to grow between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from 3.75% to 4.75% prior. This reflects our confidence in our team's ability to continue driving share gains in Q4. Q4 constant currency sales guidance is for growth of 3.75% to 4.75%.\nNotably, if currency exchange rates stay where they are today for the entire Q4, we would expect a $1.1 billion benefit to reported sales growth. For operating income, we expect full-year growth in a range of 4.8% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, with Q4 growth in a range of 8% to 11%. Currency is expected to be an approximate 100 basis point benefit to Q4 reported operating income growth.\nImportantly, despite 150 basis points of headwinds from the Vizio acquisition and lapping leap year, as well as higher-than-expected claims expense, we still expect to grow operating income faster than sales for the year, which aligns with our longer-term financial framework. For Q4, our operating income guide reflects the timing shift of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event, as well as the lapping of wage investments in Sam's Club US. Business mix will continue to be a margin benefit, and we expect merchandise category mix to continue to be a headwind. For adjusted EPS, we expect the full year to be in a range of $2.58 to 2.63, with Q4 in a range of $0.67 to 0.72. The consumer environment remains dynamic, and we continue to monitor customer and member behavior alongside tracking the macro environment.\nWe're entering Q4 with strong momentum, healthy inventory, and a clear focus on our value proposition, price, convenience, and a broad assortment. I'd like to extend my gratitude to our associates who are serving our customers and members every day during a busy holiday season. I'd also like to share that we're excited to announce that our stock listing will be moving to NASDAQ, aligning with the people-led, tech-powered approach of our long-term strategy.\nWalmart is setting a new standard for omnichannel retail by integrating automation and AI to build smarter, faster, and more connected experiences for customers, while enabling our associates to deliver even greater value at scale. We are appreciative of our long partnership with such a storied institution as the New York Stock Exchange, but we're excited about partnering with NASDAQ on this next chapter of our growth story.\nLastly, I'd like to say a couple of comments about our leadership change. I think I speak for many people at Walmart when I say that it has been the honor of my career to work alongside Doug. His mark will forever be on Walmart. This company would not be what it is today without his leadership. Doug, we will miss you. At the same time, I can't think of a better leader to hand over the reins to than John.\nJohn was the first person on the Walmart management team that I had the opportunity to meet several years before coming here, and he's a big reason why I am at Walmart today. Every company should be so fortunate to have such a capable and qualified leader to transition to. John, you have 2.1 million associates standing behind you as you lead us in this next chapter. We're now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star one from your telephone keypad, and the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.\nYou may press Star 2 if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the Star keys. Thank you, and our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Congratulations, Doug and John. I have one question, and there might be a part A to it. The question is, do you think Agentic will supercharge Walmart's e-com growth? In that answer, talk about the advantages that can uniquely help Walmart. For part A, I know, John, you just mentioned that you feel strong heading into the—or a good start, or I think strong heading into the Q4. Do you have enough read from Q3 and Q4 to date to predict how the consumer may perform over the holiday? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nThanks for the question, Simeon. I'll kick off this Agentic discussion, but invite my colleagues to chime in with me. I'm really excited about what's possible. We're always trying to find ways to serve customers better, and I think the advantages that we have include our breadth of assortment, being so close to people, which will help us with delivery speed, and, of course, everyday low prices. I wouldn't underestimate the physical aspects that kind of underpin the advantages that we have.\nAt the same time, we've gotten so much better with technology that we have the ability to execute a vision that will be multimodal, more personalized, understand context, and it'll help people save time and have more fun shopping. I think when we put all those things together, it'll be a very important growth aspect or channel for us. It won't be the only one. We say omnichannel these days, and I think people frequently think of just stores and e-commerce, but social commerce and all kinds of forms of shopping are happening today. I think we're well set up to be able to participate in all those channels going forward.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nYeah, Simeon, this is John. Doug, that's really well said. We're really excited about some of the capabilities that our customers are engaging in with what we call Sparky today, our digital agent that's live in the app. We continue to hit new milestones. I'm also really excited about some of the new capabilities coming over the next few months as Sparky can take more action on behalf of our customers.\nWhen you put that on top of this platform that Doug described with physical assets, with forward deployed inventory all around the country, increasing the speed of delivery, we're using Agentic AI to help people think about the things that they may want to reorder. In other words, give them nudges about staying in stock. There are so many ways that we can serve customers, which is very different than where we were 5 to 10 years ago. We can serve people in minutes.\nWe can keep you in stock at home. We have a really broad assortment, and having a digital agent that is there working for you, we think is going to be really powerful. There are a couple of things behind the scenes that Agentic AI and other types of technology are helping with, things like maintaining the accuracy of our catalog, helping us know where there are gaps in our assortment so that we can serve people however they want to be served or whatever is going on in their lives. I'm really excited about how this is all coming together. I think it's going to be a really strong enabler, and I think it'll take a lot of time and friction out of customers' lives as they shop with us.\n\nKathryn McLay\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart International\n\nI would just add to that too. We have all of the data from our customers who shop with us in store every day, and all of that transactional data is really helpful for us to be able to predict baskets for our customers. One of the things that's useful about having an international segment is that we have markets where we can trial new capabilities.\nWe've been trialing something called Corrido Listo down in Chile, where we actually create customers' orders for them, send them a WhatsApp prompt to ask them if they're interested in buying that basket. They go onto the app, and they can see we've created a basket for them that actually has all the brands that they normally buy in the kind of intervals that they like to buy it.\nThey have full agency over whether they want to accept that basket, whether they want to add to the basket, whether they want to take from the basket. What we're seeing is that is really attractive, and it's become up to about 20% of our e-commerce business in Chile already. We're excited about that capability. We're bringing it to other markets, but I think we know our customers. We know what they want, and we can anticipate that and make their lives easier.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club US\n\nYeah, and for Sam's Club, I think there's probably just two quick points to make. The first is it looks like a really smart decision that we leverage the Walmart enterprise capabilities so that Sam's Club gets access to everything you just heard about. The way you should think about Sam's Club is that the member data that we have is richer than any other form of data we have across the enterprise because we have complete understanding of what the member wants, and that allows us to personalize at an even deeper level.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nSimeon, this is John David on the second part of your question regarding the read on the consumer in Q4. We'd say that overall, the environment feels pretty consistent. There's certainly some pockets of moderation that we're keeping an eye on, but if you look at our guidance for Q4, it would indicate that we have an expectation that it's going to look pretty similar to the other quarters this year. Holiday is off to a pretty good start. Back to school tends to be an early indicator for how that goes.\nHalloween, likewise, for Thanksgiving, and everything that we've seen so far makes us optimistic and encouraged about customers and members leaning into the seasonal events and holiday shopping period. There is one thing to note as it pertains to our business. The maximum fair pricing legislation that was enacted and goes into effect in January will affect our health and wellness business, specifically our pharmacy business. That'll influence the comp in January a little bit, but all in, if you look at our revenue guidance, it's very much in line with the first part of the year.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. First, Doug, just want to thank you for all your leadership, not just to Walmart the last decade, but I would say society. It's been a wild time, and you've been great to have there, so thank you. John, congrats. You'll get sick of us soon enough, so I'll launch into my question that way.\nI go from an unpack Walmart Plus membership. It's that nice growth. It seems like an acceleration. I guess, what are the constraints to getting that to grow even faster? Is it logistical? What do we have to do to see that really take off?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Greg, John, thanks for the question. We're excited about the momentum in Walmart Plus, and you heard in the comments earlier, John David noted that this was the best quarter we've had in terms of net addition since we launched the program. There are really a couple of things that are driving that, and I want to congratulate the team for. The first is delivery and delivery speed.\nYou heard this morning also that about 35% of our deliveries that are coming from our stores are sub three hours, and our fastest growth channel is sub an hour. That's holding up, and it's growing at a fast pace. Providing this flexibility to our members is really important. The second thing is our NPS levels on total delivery and shipping are the highest we've seen. That's highly correlated to speed and accuracy.\nThese investments we've made over the last few years that we're excited about in terms of supply chain and inventory accuracy, the digital agents that are helping us understand how our assortments can improve, all of that is working to help people be able to find the things that they're looking for, the things that they need, and they can have those delivered whenever they want, whether that's keeping in stock or it's really quick.\nWe're really proud of the launch of the OnePay credit card. That's featured prominently on our homepage even this morning, where members can earn 5% back on all their purchases. We've had really good uptake with the program, so I think it's an exciting time when there are customers who are, of course, always looking for value or proud of our price position with 7,400 rollbacks.\nThat's another way to reinforce that there are great values at Walmart. We did add a streaming option for customers to be able to choose. We think that's important as well, but I'd really pull it back to the work and the progress that we've made with delivery, with speed, accuracy, and the launch of the credit card.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Doug, just wanted to thank you for some really great years here. It's been a lot of fun covering Walmart under your leadership, and John, just wanted to wish you a really big congratulations as well. With regards to our question, you mentioned the level of inflation across the store was about 1.3%.\nCan you talk about how you've managed higher costs through price increases and what elasticity impacts you've seen, and how should we think about where prices should go in Q4 and early 2026?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nKate, it's John. Good morning. First, we are seeing inflation in the low 1% range. That's pretty consistent across the business, including food, and slightly higher in general merchandise. I would first point to, I think the team has done a really nice job managing inventory, and that's been a consistent trend for a few years. Inventory closed the quarter up 2.6%, so roughly half the rate of what we're growing sales, and we feel good about where the inventory is positioned.\nCategories like fashion, where we've seen higher growth rates in the quarter, we're really proud of our fashion business. Our inventory is in good shape. What that does is it allows flexibility and takes pressure off any indices and markdowns. We've been disciplined over the last few quarters of ensuring that at the end of each season, whether it's back to school or back to college, Halloween, that we end clean and we move on to the next season.\nThe third thing, and I think the last thing I would say is the team has also done a nice job of managing mix throughout the last couple of quarters. We've been thoughtful about how we adjust our buys in terms of what we think people will buy in seasons. Things that are for kids, obviously, have run strong. People tend to prioritize their families in times where there could be cost pressure.\nAll those put together have put us in good shape to where we can keep our inventory in line. We can maintain margins with low markdowns on the backside.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Doug, John, congrats to both of you guys. I wanted to talk about operating leverage and how you're thinking about the Q4. It does imply an improvement in the operating leverage here. Can you just bridge that? How much of that is the shift in Big Billion Days versus other drivers? Related, you guys have done a really good job of managing tariffs.\nHow are tariffs starting to show up in the model? Should we assume that the tariff impact continues to increase, but you are able to offset that? Maybe walk us through how you're doing that. Thank you so much.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nSure, this is John David. I'll take the first part of that question, and maybe a couple of us will address the second part of it. We're really pleased to be able to demonstrate that we had leverage in the business this quarter. I believe that's the first time in two years, given some of the mixed changes that have been happening with our shift of e-commerce to a shift from in-store to e-commerce.\nThere are a number of areas where the team is really performing well. I talked about the use of AI and technology, but an example I would give you, I'd point to our supply chain. Roughly 50%, in fact, more than 50% of our volume from fulfillment centers is coming from automation, and that translates into lower shipping costs.\nOur shipping costs have been down consistently for many quarters in the 30% range. This was another quarter where we saw double-digit improvements, and that really helps our e-commerce economics, but also helps the overall SG&A of the company. I think there's sometimes a bit of a sense of there needs to be a trade-off between value and convenience.\nI think that's a false choice at Walmart. We've demonstrated for years that we can provide value through everyday low prices in the items that we sell. We're doing the same thing now with convenience. By continuing to lower our cost of delivery, it helps customers have the ability to have the value that they want with the convenience that they expect.\nWhat we're seeing is that customers are willing to give their business to those companies that, one, provide value, two, give the convenience they expect, and three, are executing consistently well. We feel good about going into the Q4. Costs are always going to be an issue that we're trying to be more efficient and bring them down, but I think we're in a better place right now than we have been at some point.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nYeah, John David, I think those are really important points. The points you made on value, convenience, and execution, hopefully it's just building trust, a trust that customers can depend on us for whatever it is they're looking for in their lives. In terms of the impact of tariffs, certainly I think we have seen less impact than what we thought we would have expected early in the year.\nThere has been some relief on some key food categories, which certainly is helping. You also heard earlier the 7,400 rollbacks. About half of those are in food. Really, the only price pressure that we're seeing in food generally right now is in the beef category, which is largely a reflection of a commodity and the cyclical nature of the herd size in the US.\nCommodities do what they tend to do, but the team has done a nice job all across the business at creating great value on particular items like the price of turkeys for Thanksgiving. We have the ability to sell customers up to 10 people, $4 a person for their meal.\nWe have a Vizio television that's 50in for $128. Really proud of the value that exists all throughout the assortment, and I think we can become and continue to be a great place for customers to find what they need for the holiday season.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nI'm really impressed with how the team has managed through tariffs this year. If you look at it holistically, the job they've done to manage inventory, to manage price gaps, to improve our mix with categories like fashion being so strong, that combined with the business mix shifts in the company have enabled us to get through this year and become even stronger as we've done it.\nI'd just also add our appreciation on the relief we're seeing on things not grown in the US. That's really appreciated. I think our customers will appreciate that too.\n\nKathryn McLay\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart International\n\nCan I take a little tangent on that too? You did mention BBD, and I think it's worth noting that BBD is housed within our Q3 result this year, and our operating income was up 16.9%. It's quite a change in kind of what we've seen of the impact of BBD in a quarter.\nWe also saw a lot lower losses from e-commerce in international, and probably the best Big Billion Days that we've experienced in the history of the company. I was reflecting the other day that we did over $1 billion of sales in the first day, and I think we did something like 700 orders per second during the first hour of the event. It was an extraordinary event, and yet despite that, we had lower e-commerce losses, and we had an uptick for growth for international adjusted at 16.9%.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nIt took Walmart a lot longer to get to $1 billion in a day than it did for a carton.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club US\n\nThis is also relevant to Sam's Club too. I do need to take this opportunity to thank our associates, though, for a really strong quarter, and maybe just touch on something John David talks about, which is the headline comp for Sam's Club may look a little off, but we're lapping a lot from last year. We talked about it, two storms and the port strike that impacted us disproportionately.\nWhat I'd ask you to do is look through that. Our two-year stack is consistent with Q1 and Q2 at around 11%. It's consistent, good momentum. I think just to push in, Seth, into your question, we're working really hard every single day to take cost out through using AI, using leverage, taking the benefits we're getting from ads, and we are going on the offense on things like price and on experience.\nWe've seen really incredible growth in e-commerce too, and the innovations that the team are landing every single day. Leveraging the Walmart app has increased conversion materially. We've changed the value proposition again because we are restless on behalf of the member. We reduced basket minimums for our club members for curbside pickup, and we saw a 20%+ pickup, which is just great. In the Q4 now, from a delivery point of view, it is the Q4 in a row that we've seen triple-digit growth. I think some of that is how easy it is and how sharp we are on price, but some of it is just great items too.\nI would just touch on we've got some great GM items coming through: Pokémon, LEGO Game Boy, Disney Princess Parade, and the Mahjong set, which I don't know if you all know, but Mahjong is the new pickleball, so please go out and invest in that item too.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nYeah, just one thing to add to what Chris said, because I think it's important to note, I think it's fair to say, and the team could disagree with me here if they feel differently, but I think we're better leveraging the assets of the various segments than at any time in history. Whether you look from a technology perspective, a supply chain perspective, even a people perspective, there are synergies with what we're doing in leveraging some of these platforms and technologies, and that's really starting to translate into improved financial results.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Doug and John, just want to echo the comments from my colleagues and add my congratulations to both of you. I think we've all learned a lot from your leadership, Doug. My question and more observation, I guess, is just how incredibly consistent so many of the key metrics are really across the board.\nI think it's just particularly notable at a time when there are more complaints about the US consumer, signs of pockets of weakness. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about how much month-to-month volatility you're seeing, if there's any signs of trade-down or changes of behavior underneath the hood. If you can add to that, how much flexibility are in your plans to be more aggressive with pricing or other elements of your model?\nIf there is, by chance, any delayed consumer reaction to either the tariffs or the cost of living dynamics, not only in the Q4, but into next year?\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nKelly, this is John David. I'll hit on that and maybe start with the last point. I think the team here feels really good about where our relative price gaps are right now, and the value that we're providing to our customers and members. We have over 7,000 rollbacks in place in Walmart US. John talked about the value of a basket of items for a Thanksgiving dinner and how that compares to prior years.\nI think we're feeling really good about this, and we're seeing that customers are moving their business to companies that provide that value with that convenience. In terms of the month-to-month volatility in the business, the quarter was actually quite consistent. When we look across the entire business, there wasn't necessarily one month that was an outlier. There are pockets of moderation when we look by income cohort.\nI don't want to sound alarmist in any way here because, again, overall, the business is very consistent, and that's our outlook into the Q4. When we look by low-income cohort versus middle versus higher income, we have seen some moderation in spending in the low-income cohort, and that's consistent with things you've seen from a macro perspective. In October, the disparity in wage growth between those cohorts was as large as it's been in almost a decade.\nWe're seeing the same things that others are, and we're keeping a watchful eye on it. Again, I think Walmart is better insulated than just about anybody, given the value proposition that we have. If pocketbooks are being stretched and consumers are being choiceful and value-seeking, it stands to reason if there's more pressure on the consumer, they're only going to become more so.\nWe like the value proposition that we're offering for our customers, and you see that's why we're gaining share.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nJohn David, something you said earlier is important, that more than one thing can be true at a time. The flexibility that we are offering, the breadth of assortment, helps us have an appeal to a lot of customers all around the country. While everything you said is true, what's also true is we saw accelerated gains with higher-income customers throughout the quarter. I think you can see that in categories like apparel that grew over 5% every month of the quarter, and continues to be one of our best categories.\nOther categories like home hard lines are in that mix. We're seeing a lot of growth in general merchandise that has a wide appeal to a lot of income levels. It is interesting that all income levels are participating in delivery and faster delivery choices. I think it's just great to see that whatever it is a customer is looking for, we built capabilities over the last few years that can help them experience our great assortment and great value, however they choose to.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nOne of the things with our marketplace business, it's really allowing us to provide a much broader assortment than we have historically. If you look on a category-by-category basis, there are places in our marketplace business like automotive, toys, electronics, and apparel that are all growing north of 40% year-on-year. It really shows that customers are coming to us with this broader assortment, and it's allowing us to cater to a broader set of customers than we have historically.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club US\n\nI think it's really worth pointing out that this is the moment for a business like ours. Sam's Club, we are trusted for great value. When we give people an end of great value, but with incredible assortment and incredible experiences, people really value that. When they do have to make choices, we're the place they're coming to.\nReally great items that, where you drop the price, you do see a response. I'll give you an example. We reduced our incredible, very big box of croissant, a bit of fresh baked-in club, by a dollar from $5.98 to $4.98, and the volume doubled. It's incredible. We had to remove the shelf that we put them on because the volume that we were selling was so huge. I think people really respond to great items at great prices.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question, and best wishes to everyone. How do you respond to those who say the timing of this leadership succession is a signal of an inflection point where Walmart will usher in another phase of investment that will pressure the company's profitability, either because of the need to support the top-line growth or be prepared for the next phase of retail, such as attentive commerce?\nIf this is anywhere near the case, could it delay the potential acceleration in operating income growth over the next few years as alternative revenues gain, scale, and make up a growing portion of the company's overall profitability? Thank you very much.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Michael, good morning. It's John. I want to say a couple of things. First, I'm really excited to be a 32-year Walmart associate. I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the work that our associates have done for so many years around the country.\nWe have a strong purpose, and I love our core values. As far as the strategy, I've been here at this table with this team for a long time. I'm in my seventh year in the role of Walmart US CEO. I've been a part of developing our strategy on capital for automation, the transformation from having a store business and an e-commerce business to becoming omni.\nWe have a lot of momentum, and I think that strategy is solid. We're looking forward to making improvements to the strategy as we go. Just specifically on capital, we take a really disciplined approach to capital. Over the last few years, we've been really transparent about the things that we're developing. A lot of those investments are going to remodels and stores. We're on about a seven-year cycle. I think that's about right, and we want to maintain that.\nThe capital investments we've made in our supply chain, we're even more optimistic about the returns that those can create, which leads to the final point. When it comes to capital investments and operational investments in the business, we'll take a disciplined, measured approach to those investments, and we'll ensure that they provide the right returns for our shareholders.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc",
    "content2": "Can I? I'd like to add one thing, just my perspective as a CFO. I've been in finance for three decades and in a role like this for about half of that. I've never worked on a management team that has more alignment around the financial metrics on how to run the business, focusing on the top line, making sure that those sales are profitable, and also focusing on ROI. We're going to continue to do that.\nWe recognize that we've spent more capital than we have historically, but there is universal alignment with this management team that we need to make sure that those investments pay off for investors. The goal that we have, or the metric that we hold ourselves to, is we need to make sure that ROI is going up every year. You've seen that performance been demonstrated here after some of the important investments that we made a decade ago.\nThose are starting to pay dividends. I hope I can allay any concerns that there's going to be some dramatic shift in our posture on this.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks and good morning. Congratulations to Doug and best wishes in the next part of your journey, and John, as well as you take over the reins. A bit of a multi-part US grocery question. The low single-digit performance in Walmart US in the quarter, to what extent did the port strike and SNAP impact the trend?\nWould you expect this to revert back to mid-single-digit range, or does disinflation on eggs and perhaps tariff changes inhibit that? The related question, it's clear that you've been investing in price grocery inflation of around one versus what's being reported externally. You're driving price gaps. Is that because you felt they were narrowing, or you were intentionally widening the gaps in anticipation of some disinflation? Thanks very much.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nHey, Chris, let me take part of the question or the first part of the question on grocery. In terms of where we are pricing, we're always looking for ways that we can keep prices as low as we can and invest in price. Walmart has provided an everyday low-price value for many, many years, and that certainly is relevant now for food pricing. For the holiday season, we're proud of the offer that we have.\nYou can feed 10 people for just under $4. I think that's really exciting. Items like turkeys, Butterball turkeys will be $0.97 a pound. That's the lowest price we've had on turkey since 2019. Our strategy has always been, the philosophy has always been to keep prices as low as we can on a basket of goods over time, and we will continue to do that. As far as how the mix is coming together, our merchants, they start every week talking about unit growth.\nWe focus heavily on how we're growing units. We think about unit share in food, particularly in fresh food, where there are commodity prices that do what commodity prices do over time. We want to ensure that we have a value, but we look at unit share. Our unit share growth has been strong. It was stronger in the quarter than our dollar share.\nOver the long term, we'll take the units and we'll focus on that, and then the dollars will tend to work their way out. The last thing I'll say, there likely is some egg deflation right ahead of us. That isn't our forecast, and we're thinking about that. We do have some inflation in the beef category that we think will take a bit longer to work out.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Robert Holmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobert Holmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Doug, congrats. You will be missed. I will miss you personally. John, congrats. I honestly can't imagine anyone better to follow Doug. Just congrats to both of you. My question is on merchandise category mix. You guys mentioned that you expected merchandise category mix to still be a headwind in the gross margin in the Q4.\nYou've got really good commentary on early holiday spending. You've got good performance in apparel and home doing better. What will it take for merchandise category mix to not be a headwind to gross margin? What's the secret sauce?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Robbie, good morning. I think the comment is reflective of the fact that health and wellness has been stronger, and our pharmacy business has been stronger, and we think that will continue into the Q4. You did hear John David mention some impact we may see in January related to the top line in health and wellness. The comment is really reflective of that overall category mix.\nWe are very encouraged by the fashion business, the fact it grew over 5% in the quarter, and we see more and more customers choosing Walmart for their source of fashion, and the unit growth across basics for kids, men's, women's. The growth was really consistent across the categories, which I think is encouraging. In an overall business mix, it is also encouraging that e-commerce has shifted from loss to profitability. Over time, we think the mix, we will definitely see improvements between the channels.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nRobbie, if you were to go back and pinpoint when we started seeing merchandise or the merchandise category mix pressure, it really goes back to a couple of years ago when we were seeing inflation in the high single digits. I think it's reflective of the macro environment much more so than anything that's happening at Walmart.\nAs pocketbooks have been stretched, you're seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items. I think fortunately for us, we've done a great job of improving our assortment. The example I gave earlier with some of the categories that we're selling in our marketplace, you're seeing that we're doing a great job there of growing some of these categories where there has been pressure.\nJohn noted, if you just take apparel, apparel grew over 5% each of the three months of the quarter on a unit basis. If you go back a year ago, that was an area that we were really pressured with. Walmart is doing the things that it can to influence this, but I think what's happening here from a merchandise category mix is really more of a macro phenomenon than anything.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, thank you, guys. Doug and John, big congrats. We'd love to hear a little bit about elasticity, any early signs based on price increases that you've taken, which categories you might be seeing greater elasticity or lower elasticity than you might have thought.\nJust a quick one, if you could give an update on marketplace, number of SKUs that you're at right now, where you expect that to go next year, and how important will marketplace be this holiday season compared to the first three quarters of the year? Thanks, guys.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nHey, Paul. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, I was just going to address elasticities. It really differs by category, but maybe one category that is a little more pronounced for us is electronics, toys, and seasonal, where we've seen some of higher AURs. I think of that being in the high single digits, and units are kind of in the flattish range.\nThat's been one where I think you've seen higher price increases overall, where on other parts of the basket we've not had the same pressure from tariffs, and we've been able to mix out the baskets in a way that has minimized the impact on consumers.\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nOn marketplace specifically, it is important that we, as we've noted, that customers can find a really broad assortment at Walmart, whatever you're looking for. We've been focused on ensuring that customers can trust us for a broad assortment. We're still in that 500 million or north of range. It fluctuates month to month, quarter-to-quarter. We're really focused on ensuring that now that we use things like AI to determine where there are gaps in the assortment to ensure that customers can get their entire basket from us.\nThat could include whether it's an item for a specific event or part of a basket or regiment. We want to make sure that the assortments are complete. The next few quarters will really be focused on ensuring that it's the right number of items and the right quality of SKUs that are listed in the assortment.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nI think great innovation is so important, along with price. Where we see growth in general merchandise, for example, and higher AUR items, it's where we see great innovation too. I think we just need to keep our foot down, our pedal on the gas, on driving really great innovations with really great items.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats to Doug and John. I guess for me, the international side of your business continues to see significant strength. It's trending above, I think, the algorithm that you guys laid out earlier this year. How do you feel about the sustainability of the top line momentum you're seeing in your key markets there?\n\nKathryn McLay\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart International\n\nThanks for the question. I think we've just seen really consistent results in international from a top and a bottom line, or sorry, from a top line perspective. We took a moment in the first half of this year to invest into convenience and speed, and into price, and we're seeing that kind of come back in this back half. We continue to feel really strong about the top line trajectory that we have in international.\nIt's a mix of being in high-growth markets like India and China, as well as truly kind of maturing our omni playbook in other markets like Mexico, Canada, and Chile. Really good things to see in International.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question was from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nAnalyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, thanks a lot. Good morning. Congrats, Doug. Great career. John, at a hunch when you ran Sam's Club, this would happen. Congrats to you as well. With greater visibility here on tariffs than a few months ago, have you made any changes to assortments for the holidays? One follow-up for John David. On the maximum fair pricing change in January, any idea how much that could potentially cap health and wellness sales, not necessarily for Q4, but also into 2026?\n\nJohn Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nHey, Chuck. Good morning. It's John. Thanks for the question. No big changes on assortment for the holiday. I think many customers will follow through traditions. I think many customers are looking forward to a great holiday. Throughout the summer, we did make some adjustments on the quantities that we decided to purchase and prioritize things like gifts, backpacks, back-to-school, things for kids. We, in some cases, even increased those. It was really more of a shift in the quantities that we bought, but no big change in assortment plans.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nOn maximum fair pricing, I believe that there's still information coming in on this in terms of which drugs they're applied to. Probably a little premature to give you a number on the impact. Overall, the health and wellness business is still going to continue to grow. It's been the part of our business that has seen the most growth over the last couple of years, and we still expect that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, this concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Doug McMillon for closing comments.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart Inc\n\nHey, thanks, everybody. I really appreciate the relationships that we developed over the years. Appreciate how closely you followed the company, the pressure, healthy pressure you put on us, the critical thinking tests you've given us. I think the company's better off because of your engagement.\nJust want to say thank you. I'll miss you guys. As it relates to the company, what a great business this is in any environment. You've seen times when the customer has more money and how Walmart's well-positioned, and times when people are pressured, they come to us.\nThe business is stronger in terms of our ability to make it more convenient to shop with us. I think that's been a big development. We're not just known for price, we're known for more than that now. The runway looks like a long one to me. I have a high degree of confidence in the potential and what this company will deliver with John's leadership and with this leadership team. I'll be cheering them on and helping in any way that I can. Thank you all.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

Doug, that concludes my intro. We're ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Our team delivered strong top-line results again this quarter, with sales up 5.6% in constant currency. Growth in transactions and units is helping drive our performance. We grew e-commerce sales by 25% globally, with all segments exceeding 20% growth, led by Walmart US and Sam's Club US at 26%. Customers are liking our faster delivery speed. From a segment point of view, we grew international sales by 10.5% in constant currency, led by China, Walmex, and Flipkart. International continues to help lift our top-line growth rate. Sam's Club US delivered a strong comp of 5.9%, driven primarily by unit growth. Walmart US sales were stronger than we expected when we started the quarter. We grew comp sales by 4.6% with consistent strength throughout the quarter.\nSales and general merchandise were positive in every segment and across categories in the US, led by apparel, media, gaming, and automotive. Again this quarter, we gained market share in the US and across markets internationally. Globally, we grew our marketplace by 17% and membership income by 15%. We grew global advertising by 46%, including Vizio.\nWalmart Connect in the US was up 31%, and that excludes Vizio. These strong growth rates in our newer businesses continue to change the shape of our income statement. Looking at profit for the quarter, adjusted operating income grew 0.4% in constant currency. This is below what we expected going into the quarter as we absorbed a headwind of 560 basis points for the expenses related to general liability claims in the US. Our business was able to overcome the additional expenses and still deliver profit growth.\nThe model we're building gives us more price and wage flexibility, and it also means we're better positioned when unusual items come our way. John David will talk to you about our annual guidance in a minute. We're still driving towards growing profit faster than sales this year, and that's reflected in our guidance. Importantly, the composition of our inventory is in good shape as we start the back half of the year.\nWe're up 3.8% globally and up 2.2% in Walmart US. With regard to our US pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we're doing what we said we would do. We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.\nThey've done a terrific job managing pricing and mix across merchandise categories. They managed to generate rollbacks. They've made good quantity and flow decisions, and they've set us up well as we start the back half of the year. As it relates to what we're experiencing with customers and members here in the US, their behavior has been generally consistent.\nWe aren't seeing dramatic shifts. The way things have played out so far, the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted. But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into Q3 and Q4. Not surprisingly, we see more adjustments in middle and lower-income households than we do with higher-income households.\nIn discretionary categories where item prices have gone up, we see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items or, in some cases, categories. As always, our customers are aware, smart, and value-conscious. We have approximately 7,400 price rollbacks across our assortment, which is about 2,000 more than last quarter.\nOur rollback count in grocery was up 30% in the quarter compared to last year. Back-to-school is usually something of an indicator of how the holidays will go, and we feel good about how it went for us in terms of units, dollars sold, and inventory sell-through at both Walmart and Sam's Club. Our top back-to-school items had a lower price than last year, and we offered a basket of everything students need for their first day of school for under $65.\nWe had our Walmart US store managers together last week for our holiday planning meeting, where they got to see many of our new items and pricing for the upcoming season. We liked what we saw and heard, and we liked our position for the back half of the year. We're expecting to have a good holiday season at Walmart. For a few quarters now, I've been commenting on our use of artificial intelligence.\nOur enthusiasm for how AI can help us serve customers and members better, improve the experience for our associates, and increase productivity continues to grow. It's been years since we made a structural change for a role reporting to the CEO, and we've done it in this case because we're clear on a path to accelerate. Daniel Danker joined us to lead AI acceleration, product management, design, tech prioritization, and AI-related change management.\nDaniel brings tremendous expertise and experience from places like Instacart and Uber. We also announced a new role reporting to Suresh Kumar, our Chief Technology Officer, that will focus on AI platforms. This role will help us increase innovation, speed, and productivity, own the AI platforms, and architect our intelligent system stack.\nWe're building agents into the core of how we operate, including four super agents. There will be many agents that roll up to these super agents that our customers, associates, and other stakeholders experience. First is Sparky. Sparky is the customer-facing assistant you see smiling at the bottom of our app. Today's Sparky takes us from traditional search to intelligent AI-powered assistants. Sparky will develop agentic capabilities over time. Customers are giving us positive feedback, and we're excited about the roadmap ahead. As we improve and scale Sparky, we'll make it even smarter and more personalized.\nIt'll be the primary digital vehicle for discovery, shopping, and for managing everything from reorders to returns. We see Sparky becoming an indispensable part of how people shop with us. The other Super Agents we're building include one for associates that'll bring everything into one place, from scheduling to sales data. One for our suppliers, sellers, and advertisers that they will use to manage things like onboarding, orders, and campaigns. And lastly, a developer agent built to scale innovation across the business by speeding up how we test, build, and launch new products.\nThis is just the beginning of how we'll deploy AI over time. We see lots of opportunities, whether that's with Digital Twins of our facilities, which can help predict or prevent issues before they happen, or the accuracy of dynamic delivery windows, which we'll provide to 95% of US households by the end of this year.\nOur opportunities are numerous. We're seizing the moment with AI. I'll close today by thanking our associates for their hard work and ability to change. Since we shared our Q1 results, I've had the chance to visit with our associates in stores and clubs here in the US, India, and Mexico. Those conversations have left me feeling so encouraged. Our associates are leaning forward, and they're excited about our future. They're doing a great job, and I'm confident they'll continue to learn, change, and strengthen our business. John David, over to you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. I also want to extend my appreciation to our associates. The setup going into this quarter was more challenging than normal, and they did a great job executing, focusing on what we could control by reinforcing price leadership, strengthening customer experience, and managing cost and inventory. Here's what I'd like you to take away from my remarks. First, our core business is strong and growing with accelerating e-commerce momentum.\nWe told you that we expect to gain share during this period of economic uncertainty, and that's what's happening. As a result, we're raising our sales guidance for the year. Second, we're navigating this dynamic operating backdrop very well. We said we would play offense to keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can, and that's what we're doing.\nThird, growth in our higher-margin businesses is contributing to our profit transformation, providing the financial flexibility to aggressively pursue share gains in the near term. We're maintaining our full-year guide for operating income, even with some additional cost pressures this year, and we're raising our guide for EPS to reflect lower headwinds experienced year-to-date from currency. And lastly, we're playing for the long term, balancing the pursuit of share gains while investing in our associates, in our supply chain automation, in stores and clubs, and in AI and technology.\nNow I'll get into the details of some of our performance. Consolidated Q2 revenue increased 5.6% in constant currency. These results were better than we expected, with each of our business segments delivering stronger sequential sales growth than in Q1.\nE-commerce was a big contributor, with sales up 25% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand from customers for convenient and fast delivery, with order volumes increasing across our segments. Walmart US top-line outperformed our expectations as Q2 comps accelerated, even when facing a more difficult year-over-year comparison versus Q1. Comp sales grew 4.6%, reflecting ongoing share gains across key categories and all income cohorts, with upper-income households contributing the largest gains.\nCustomers are responding as we lean into value with more rollbacks while also providing the convenience they desire. We're encouraged by the improvement in general merchandise sales trends, which delivered a low single-digit positive comp in Q2, reflecting strength in fashion, media, gaming, and automotive categories. Walmart US e-commerce sales grew 26%, stepping up from the low 20% growth range we delivered over the prior four quarters.\nAll fulfillment channels increased, led by delivery from store, which was up almost 50%. Speed of delivery is important to customers, and we're continuing to get faster. Approximately 1/3 of deliveries from store in recent weeks were fast delivery in three hours or less, reinforcing the value of our store network and driving speed. 20% of those deliveries arrived to our customers in 30 minutes or less. Meanwhile, marketplace sales grew nearly 20%, with more sellers utilizing our fulfillment services.\nApproximately 44% of marketplace volumes flow through WFS, an increase of 250 basis points versus last year. International was once again growth accretive to the enterprise, with sales up more than 10% in constant currency, led by strength in China, Walmart, and Flipkart. We saw broad-based growth across product categories, and seasonal event sales were strong. Sales in China grew 30%, and Walmart grew over 6%.\nE-commerce growth was up more than 20%, with penetration approaching 27% of segment sales. Across markets, this momentum continued to be led by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in 3P Marketplace. Sam's Club US comp sales ex-fuel increased nearly 6%, with strong growth driven entirely by units sold. We delivered positive comps across all key product categories, including another quarter of growth in general merchandise.\nThe quality and value of Member's Mark products continue to resonate with members as sales penetration increased 140 basis points. E-commerce grew 26%, with club-fulfilled delivery representing nearly 50% of this increase, even while curbside pickup was up double digits. Members are finding more ways to shop the club in an omni way, and we're pleased to see unit growth accelerating, along with spend per member frequency, and renewals all driving Sam's Club US results. Earlier this month, we opened a new club in Tempe, Arizona.\nIt's the second club to feature a digital-first experience, leveraging the convenience and popularity of our Scan&Go app with members. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased four basis points on a reported basis and was up nine basis points on an adjusted basis when excluding an $80 million one-time restructuring charge at Sam's. We saw improved business mix across our segments.\nIn Walmart US, margins also reflected the benefits of strong inventory management, while merchandise category mix remains a headwind as sales growth in grocery and health and wellness outpaced general merchandise. In International, gross profit rate declined with continued pressure from channel and format mix, as well as strategic investments in price across markets and our quick commerce capabilities in India.\nAs we indicated exiting Q1, our decision not to give Q2 operating income guidance was predicated on the dynamic cost of goods backdrop, principally to preserve flexibility to drive share and price leadership. Given the uncertainty around the cost and price environment when we reported last quarter, we flagged the potential for a higher level of markups on our Walmart US inventory. We ultimately realized lower markups than anticipated, and therefore the effect on our margins under the retail method of accounting, or REM, was also less pronounced.\nOur merchants did an excellent job managing inventory and price levels, which has resulted in strong sales and more normalized margins. As our business model evolves, contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce economics and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.\nWalmart US e-commerce profitability continued to increase in Q2 as we make progress on improving net delivery costs and see strong momentum in advertising. We invested in marketing to improve awareness of Walmart's value, convenience, and assortment, and saw growth in active customers and frequency. With strong growth in e-commerce, our advertising business globally increased nearly 50%, including Vizio.\nWalmart Connect in the US, ex-Vizio, grew more than 30%. Advertising at Sam's Club US was up 24%, and we saw 15% growth in international advertising led by Flipkart. Membership fee income was up over 15% across the enterprise. In the US, Sam's Club continued to see steady growth in member counts, renewal rates, and increased penetration of Plus members, resulting in 7.6% membership income growth, while Walmart Plus membership income grew double digits.\nI'm also really excited about the upcoming launch of our new OnePay Cash Rewards credit card, which should be available before holiday. Cardholders will earn 3% unlimited cash back at Walmart, and if you're a Walmart+ member, that will jump to 5%. The card also provides 1.5% cash back for non-Walmart purchases. This is another great example of the increasing value of a Walmart+ membership.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses deleveraged 35 basis points in Q2 due primarily to higher claims expense in the US, as I previewed in our last quarter's remarks. This expense pertains to general liability and workers' compensation claims for which we self-insure. While this claim count has decreased year-over-year, the cost to resolve claims has risen, both for us and across the retail industry, and we've increased our accrual to reflect these trends.\nWe accrued an additional $450 million over and above our planned expense in Q2, which equates to a headwind of 560 basis points to adjusted operating income growth in the quarter. We have and continue to take actions to mitigate the number and cost of these claims. Our full-year operating income guidance, which is unchanged, contemplates the business fully absorbing the $730 million of incremental expense in Q1 and Q2, as well as continued inflation in claims cost in Q3 and Q4, although we do not expect the same magnitude of increases as we experienced in the first half of the year.\nUnexpected costs are part of managing a business of this complexity, and while these costs put pressure on operating income growth for the quarter and for the year-to-date period, they don't change our annual or long-term outlook, nor our conviction in our profit growth trajectory.\nQ2 adjusted operating income increased about half a percentage point on a constant currency basis, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and continued progress on underlying operating margins, offset by higher claims cost. Adjusted EPS was up 1.5% to $0.68. We had discrete charges related to legal matters and restructuring in the quarter, and those have been adjusted out of operating income and EPS for comparison purposes. Importantly, as we begin Q3, momentum has persisted, and our inventory is at a healthy level, up about 4%.\nThe year-over-year increase in inventory is primarily attributable to higher cost of imported goods and timing of receipts. In this tariff-impacted period, we're closely monitoring customer demand and managing quantity decisions as we measure the price elasticity of impacted items. Now, turning to guidance.\nToday, we're raising our full-year sales growth guidance in constant currency by 75 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4.75% growth. This reflects our year-to-date performance and confidence in our team's ability to continue driving share gains in the back half of the year. For Q3, we also expect constant currency sales growth of 3.75% to 4.75%. Notably, if currency exchange rates were to stay where they are now for the entire Q3, we would expect a modest headwind to reported sales growth.\nBusiness mix will continue to be a margin benefit, and we expect merchandise category mix to continue to be a headwind. While the cost of goods backdrop remains fluid, it appears clearer directionally than a quarter ago, although still unsettled. We await final tariff resolution across some of our largest import markets. The US is, by far, our number one market for sourcing.\nFor the less than 1/3 of what we sell in the US that's imported, China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Canada are our largest markets. Q3 operating income is expected to be in a range of 3% to 6% growth. This guidance reflects a wider range of outcomes than our prior approach, which we believe is prudent given the ongoing trade policy discussions, a demand backdrop that remains somewhat uncertain, and a desire to maintain flexibility to invest for share gains.\nBased upon our experience in Q2, we believe the impacts on margins and earnings from higher cost of goods and how they flow through our inventory accounting method will be less pronounced than previously anticipated. At the low end of 3% operating income growth, we assume sales moderate quarter-over-quarter and unit sales slow, requiring us to take markdowns against higher prices to calibrate to demand.\nAt the upper bound of 6% OI growth, we assume customer and member behavior remains consistent with year-to-date observations, and our approach to pricing on a relative basis continues to drive share gains across channels while inventory turns remain healthy. Our annual guidance for adjusted operating income growth remains unchanged at 3.5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, despite the negative impact from higher claims expense than originally anticipated, implying the underlying structural margins of the company continue to advance.\nRecall this guidance also includes 150 basis points of headwinds from the Vizio acquisition and lapping leap year, consistent with our original guidance issued in February. Importantly, if we were to achieve the midpoint of our updated guidance for FY2026, sales would grow 4.25% and operating income would grow 4.5%, or 6% growth when factoring in the 150 basis points of callouts.\nThis aligns with our financial framework of operating income growing faster than sales, and we're especially pleased in this uncertain backdrop that we can grow share at an accelerated pace while growing OI ahead of sales.\nWe have, of course, hoped to deliver better results, but feel it's prudent at this point in the year to preserve maximum flexibility. Like you, we continue to monitor customer and member behavior on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, alongside tracking macro indicators such as CPI, job growth, and wage growth. We know from history that when Walmart leans into these moments of uncertainty, we emerge stronger on the other side. Driving share gains this year positions us well for sustained sales growth momentum and stronger omnichannel advantages into future years.\nAs the cost of goods environment settles, we expect the transformation of our profit mix to be even more pronounced, and we're confident in a return to operating income growth more consistent with the multi-year trend. We appreciate your interest in our company and are now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. So that we may address questions for as many participants as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, and thank you. I have a two-part question. First part is the top line is impressive and as good as one could hope. Can you talk about how much of the underlying profitability is being masked by temporary factors and if anything is not working in the flywheel? And then the second part, more for you, Doug, you mentioned the AI hire, and perhaps this is first for a retailer to even have such an officer. Is AI already accelerating Walmart's top line and margin gains? And if not yet, when do they become more material? Thanks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHey, Simeon, and this is Doug. I'll take the second question first. As it relates to AI, I don't think it's lifting our top line sales yet. I think this is very early days, but I am excited about the roadmap, as I mentioned. I think what lies ahead is really exciting for us, given how our assortment's grown and our capabilities today as it relates to tech. And Daniel's going to do a great job. Suresh and his team are doing a great job of laying out the architecture and the plan for us to drive sales.\nAnd maybe lastly, I'll just say that from a bias point of view, we're biased towards growth as it relates to AI. It's exciting to think about the productivity opportunities, but when we wake up in the morning, we're thinking about how we can serve customers better using AI. Just think about all the inventory management improvement that we can make with it, for example.\nAs it relates to the flywheel and what's underneath, John David can certainly comment too, but I don't see anything that I'm worried about. I feel as good about what's happening in the business mix of our company as I ever have. We shared all the growth rates across marketplace, advertising, membership, all those areas. That story still seems very much intact to me, and it's disappointing that we have some noise in our numbers this quarter, but when you get past it and see all the things that are happening, I think you'll feel the same way.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nI would just add to that, Simeon, and it is kind of a nuanced earnings report given some of the cost pressures, but when you dig into the details, particularly of the e-commerce business, you look at things like membership growth of 16%, advertising growing 50% year-over-year, 30% in the US.\nYou can go line by line, and you can see why we're excited about the momentum in the business. We said that we're going to play offense, and we see that we're accelerating some of the share gains. Our business is strong, and we feel good about the back half of the year, particularly in light of what is still a rather uncertain environment. But I think we're positioned to win, and we feel good about how the business is performing, and you see that with the increase in guidance and the maintained profit guidance, even despite what is roughly $0.75 billion of cost pressure that was not anticipated when we gave that original guidance this year.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, and thanks for taking my question. So there was recent news about your largest competitor expanding grocery delivery. It's a bit of an open-mic question, but how do you think about the dynamics of this announcement? How does it change the advantage that you have given the convenience of stores and how local fresh is typically? And then, on the other hand, does it necessitate faster investment on your side to remain competitive that perhaps affects that second P&L and the accelerating margin and cash flow dynamics over the next few years? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nWhat goes through my mind is that, gosh, I've been doing this for a long time now, and competition just keeps getting better. So that's kind of factored into our plan. What do we expect people to do? We expect them to get better, and the best will get stronger. So that means that we got to keep doing the same thing.\nAnd we know what our plan is, and we know what customers want, whether it's price or the growing assortment, the way we improve the experience of shopping. You guys know that convenience has been driving our business for a while now, and I think that'll continue. So I read, just like you do, what's happening at competition, but we stay focused on what's happening with the customer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. One of the reasons why Walmart's multiple has expanded so significantly in the last couple of years is the market has come to rely on the consistency of Walmart's sales and profit performance. This quarter's gross margin result in the US and some other factors within the P&L has really tested that assumption.How do you dispel this concern and make the case that this is a one-off rather than the beginning of a trend? Thank you very much.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nMichael, good to speak with you. Thanks for the question. Look, the first thing I would say is that the reality of managing a business of our size and complexity is you're going to have unexpected expenses that occur from time to time. A couple of years ago, we encountered a higher level of shrink in the business. We demonstrated that we navigated that really well. I think we're going to demonstrate that we're navigating this current environment pretty well also. So I tend to not worry so much about quarter-to-quarter and look at the long-term trend.\nIf you look at what we've done over the last two years, we've grown the top line 5% or 6% and profits at almost 10% over that period of time. As I alluded to in my remarks, that's the way that we think about our multi-year trajectory that we're on. To suggest that we can do that every quarter is just not a reality given the complexities of our business.\nI should pause on that for a second because if you think about the backdrop that we're in right now, when we last released our earnings, we were roughly three weeks into this new tariff environment. I think I would argue very strongly that we've navigated that very well, both in terms of managing the impact on our financial statements, but also minimizing the impact to our customers and members.\nAnd so I would encourage people to look at the full-year guide, which we raised our revenue guidance, and we're keeping our operating income guidance the same in the face of these higher costs. When you look at the fundamentals of our business and how we're gaining share with customers, how our value proposition is resonating more strongly than it ever has, I would argue, we feel really good about this. We've got a lot of conviction in our strategy and our plan, and we've got a team that's executing on that.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much and good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I was hoping to focus on inventory. So inventory management continues to be strong.How are you feeling about the health of your inventory and in stocks as you enter the back half of the year, including in some of the more tariff-impacted categories?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nHey, Rupesh, good morning. It's John Furner. First, obviously, we're really proud of the team and the performance in the Q2. As the quarter moved along, I would say the quarter was consistent with prior quarters, but what was particularly helpful was the improvement in general merchandise as the quarter progressed. We had strength in GM really across the board, but in particular, at the end of the quarter, with some strong events led by our e-commerce business and marketplace. Our e-commerce business has accelerated. I'd say that's one difference in the quarter, the 26% growth rate, which compares to 20s in previous quarters.\nThe team has obviously operated in dynamic environments for some time, and this quarter was impressive the way that they managed inventory almost on a daily basis. I've been in stores all over the country the last few months, and I'm really pleased with the inventory levels on the floor, in the supply chain. The backrooms are in great shape. So I feel really good about the way we exited the quarter.\nWe exited with 2% inventory growth. A lot of that growth is what we would describe as in transit rather than being in the store. And then just one other highlight in terms of positioning inventory at a clean sell-through early and back to school. Our fashion business in particular has been great. More and more customers are choosing Walmart as a destination for fashion, and that's exciting.\nWe've had growth across the board from shoes to ladies, to men, to kids, and baby. We have a lot of great work in style. We have a lot of great work on our inventory, and it's delivering a great experience for our customers. So as we enter the Q3, I would just start with how we exited the second. Our sales are up 4.6% on a comparable basis. Our inventory is up 2%. Our inventories are clean, and we have 7,000-plus rollbacks, a dramatic increase from the Q2. So we feel really good about our position going into the quarter.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO of Sam's Club, Walmart\n\nHey, Rupesh, Chris Nicholas here from Sam's Club too. I think just a lot same as with John. I'd like to say that I'm really pleased with the continued strength of the business, top line and underlying bottom line after you adjust out for the complexity. When you look at the composition of our sales, comp sales were up 5.9%. That was entirely unit-driven. What's really interesting about that is that that's an acceleration of units quarter-on-quarter. That's really exciting. E-com plays a really big part of that. 26% growth in e-commerce is good. 2/3 of the sales growth actually was e-commerce, and delivery was a powerhouse within that.\nFrom an inventory point of view, then, we have to buy to hit the growth that we're seeing in those units. We pay, of course, very close attention to units, and we feel really good. We need the growth in inventory to support the unit growth. We've made some tactical buys, of course, but our terms and days on hand are flat, and units are accelerating. So just a lot of gratitude for our members and our associates in helping us maintain this momentum.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGreat. Thank you for all the color.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the price changes that you started to make this quarter and the consumer response. Doug, I think you talked about maybe some elasticity at the item level that you were starting to see. And then how do we think about the general philosophy across categories? For example, I think it was notable that rollbacks in grocery being up 30% right now. Do you see opportunities to lean in on price, perhaps in certain categories, to, I guess, offset the inflationary pressure the consumer is seeing in other places? Thanks so much.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, from a business model point of view, the fact that we have businesses like advertising and membership growing obviously helps with flexibility as it relates to when we decide to absorb part of a tariff cost increase. We also have, thankfully, general merchandise business positive. I think what John covered just a minute ago is really encouraging as it relates to mix.\nThose things help us with flexibility. You're right. We do see as costs go up, units change, but that is always true. Customers, as I mentioned, they're so quick, and they understand what's going on, and they make rational trade-offs as they move from one category to the next. As I've said to you many times, I think one of the things I love about our business is the ability to manage mix. It gives us a lot of flexibility.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on your international strategy, if you could provide an update on the international portfolio, particularly Canada, India, and Mexico. What are the strategic priorities in those markets, and how are they fitting into the long-term growth algorithm? Thank you.\n\nKath McLay\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nHey, Corey, it's Kath. Thank you for the question. And I do want to just start by appreciating our associates and everything they've done over this quarter. This quarter for us, Corey, was really one where we took the opportunity to lean into momentum as well as differentiating our capabilities. I'm going to talk about that, and then that'll help you understand how we're thinking about Canada, Mexico, and India. This quarter, our e-com growth was up 22%.\nAs you kind of look at that, that's really being bolstered by both store-fulfilled pickup, delivery, and marketplace. If you look at our business in China, we opened 33 clouds, which now means that we have 455 clouds. As you remember, over 50% of our sales in China is online initiated. That's enabling us to be able to get to the customer in less than an hour. Seeing strength coming through that business. If you look at kind of India, we now have 300 minute FCs, which enables us to get to the customer in less than 15 minutes. We have 60 MFCs for Myntra, which enables them to be able to get to the customer in under 30 minutes.\nSo we're beginning to position ourselves to be able to really take advantage of this growth into the quick commerce channel, but to do it efficiently by ensuring that our third-party inventory is placed closer to the consumer. Then if I think about Mexico and Canada, we have talked previously about the fact that we're bringing global platforms, so the best of our tech to the markets.\nOver this quarter, we really focused on how do we bring our Walmart Commerce Platform to both Canada and to Mexico. So in Canada, that is now up and launched. In Mexico, that means that we're bringing a merged hallway so that the customer can experience both 1P and 3P in a unified experience. As we've done that, we have increased our sellers this quarter by 75%, and we've increased the SKUs by 40 million.\nA lot of work this quarter, particularly to reposition and make sure that we are investing in differentiating our capabilities across Mexico, Canada, India, and China to position ourselves for strength.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nIf you look back at the last two investor conferences, we've talked about what the longer-range plan looks like and how profitability is going to grow faster than sales in international. So not only are we getting top-line help from international, but the bottom line will lift return on investment even more than the other segments.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We know Walmart's US e-commerce profitability continued to increase in the quarter, driven by better net delivery costs and advertising. But could you comment on e-commerce profitability globally? Is there any quantification of how much it's contributing to operating income dollar growth in the quarter and what you expect for the year?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Kate. Good to speak with you. Globally, we continue to make progress on our e-commerce business. It's roughly as I described in the last quarter's earnings call, where we have a small profit in the Sam's segment. The US segment is continuing to add to their profits there. The international segment operates at a loss, although it's a contribution margin positive operation, and we continue to see improvements there year-over-year. If you look at the most recent quarter, maybe one way to think about our e-commerce business, and maybe even more broadly, all the diversified new businesses that we have. For purposes of this, I'm going to exclude the incremental claims costs.\nI think that's probably a better way to look at this part of our business right now. But 50%, 50% of our incremental profit, excluding claims, was related to advertising, membership, and marketplace. And I'm even thinking back to Michael's question about the multiple of our business. I think of our earnings multiple as something that is a factor of both the growth of the business as well as the certainty of the business. And it's pretty rare to find a company of our size with a roughly $700 billion revenue base that is growing organically 5% to 6% each period. We're really pleased with what we're seeing there. And if you look at the contribution to that growth, it's primarily e-commerce. So this is fantastic.\nWhat we realize is we have a set of assets that really plays to our hand here to be able to expand this offering to customers. The other part of that question on the multiple is I talked about growth, but certainty, or maybe said differently, durability of our earnings stream.\nWe are more than just a standard brick-and-mortar retail business. We have a much more diversified set of profit streams now that are both higher growing, as well as higher margin. I think that is reflected in our multiple. So this has been kind of a challenging quarter. It's one of the reasons that we did not give guidance going into it because we knew it could be a wide range of outcomes. When you look at the core fundamentals of our business, at the profit composition changing, we're really excited about the progress.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nKate, it's John. For the US, with the growth rate at 26%, I think a couple of things that are really helping. One, of course, we're leaning into growth. It's exciting to see the growth rate. It's exciting to see that the growth rate has accelerated from previous quarters. Within that, the mix has been better. I mentioned General Merchandise and the strength of apparel. That is true online. It's true in stores.\nSo having better mix, obviously, is a big contributor here. Another way to think about mix is the mix of business units. Digital services like advertising with a 31% growth rate also help contribute to profitability. But if there's one thing that I think I'm most excited about, most proud about, is that Walmart is getting faster. Our customers are responding to our delivery speeds.\nWe see billions and billions of units at a high growth rate being delivered same day. And within same day from our store deliveries, about 1/3 of those deliveries are under three hours, and 20% of those units are delivered in less than 30 minutes. So I'm excited about what the team has done to lean into speed. We're now covering 93% of the country under three hours. We think that will be 95% by the end of the year. So our reach is getting better. Our speed is improving, and customers love being able to deliver with speed.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nFor a while now, we've described our business as being two P&Ls, the traditional store P&L and then the new digital P&L, which has got marketplace, marketplace commissions, membership, advertising, all those kinds of things in it.\nAnd what we were pointing to is we think that the second P&L over time can be more profitable than the first P&L and lift the total. And I think what you're seeing now is what we've been seeing coming for a while. And I would add that that's global. The business model that we're talking about applies across countries, which gives us the opportunity to build tech more often that's common across markets, which gives us more leverage and more speed eventually. We're working hard on speed. So I am very excited about that. I think that the future, our long-range plan and the way this business model looks are really exciting. And then you layer on top of that what AI will do to help us kind of further those efforts. And it's really exciting.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up, or see if I could follow up and get you guys to talk a little bit more about gross margin scenarios in the back half. When you guys reported the Q1, you said there were some different potential scenarios. And one of them was that maybe gross margin could be better than expected in the Q2 because of Retail Accounting Method and timing of price increases and things like that. Now we're heading into the back half with more rollbacks.\nCould you guys just talk about the sort of do you guys have? I know it's still uncertain, but have you gained more certainty on what competitors are doing with price or just how your elasticities are telling you things that you're setting up well for the second half here on a gross margin standpoint?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, Robbie, this is Doug. I think that's a key question, and you're probably going to be dissatisfied with our answer because we have to be flexible. I really, as several of us have said, am very impressed with how our merchants have been navigating this so far.\nBut just imagine for a minute being one of the category buyers and having to think through what the impacts are from a cost point of view, from an elasticity point of view, how are customers going to respond for Halloween and Christmas as well as off-the-side counters every day. As we said at the beginning of this quarter that we just finished, we want to preserve the flexibility that we have to be able to make decisions and item at a time. Managing markdowns and sell-throughs are another key component.\nThe team did a great job managing back-to-school sell-throughs. They did a great job managing summer seasonal and categories like toys. I expect that'll continue. Our team, as we've been saying all along, is able to manage this well. They've got the tools. They've got the experience.\nAs we go through the quarter, we'll be watching price gaps. We'll be watching gross margins. We'll be watching bottom-line profitability. We'll do what we need to do to serve the customer and make sure we preserve top-line momentum and, as our guidance reflects, bring profit in to grow profit faster than sales by the end of the year. That's our focus.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our question. Wanted to also kind of dig in on the gross margin, the US gross margin a little bit. You mentioned you ended up with some lower markups, I think, than planned. And can you just talk about why that was?\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nIs that due to your ability to mitigate more of the tariff-related costs, or you found more ways to offer more rollbacks than planned? I'm just trying to understand how much price has been already passed on to the consumer and how that might change in the back half. I believe the general merchandise category went from negative mid-single digit or mid-single digit deflation to low single digit deflation. Just trying to understand if that's just due to the tariff-related impacts and what that could look like in the back half.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart",
    "content2": "Hey, Kelly, it's John. I'll pick up where Doug left off. Our merchants have a lot of capabilities in terms of being able to mix their business out. Being competitive in the market is really important. You alluded to the 7,000-plus rollbacks that are out today, offered in stores and online. We're excited about that.\nWe see customers respond each time that we're able to invest in the customer value overall. The second thing I'd say is we are really focused on inventory management. How you close a quarter has a lot to do with how you'll get into the next quarter inventory plus drive sales and margin. It can create markdowns and shrinkage. We do have some tailwinds with markdowns and shrinkage because of the inventory management. We're really proud of the improvement in days on hand in stores, the supply chain, and our fulfillment centers. So as turns continue to increase with sales growing 4.6%, it puts us in a good position to manage our way through it.\nAnd as you look at the rest of the year, I'm particularly excited about the values that we intend to offer in key categories and key events for customers coming up over the next couple of quarters. So I think we're positioned well going into it.\nWe will watch our competitors really closely. We always do that. We want to maintain price gaps, ensure that we have value for customers. And lastly, having this ability to deliver at the scale and speed that we are, we're really proud of the dollar share gains we see in key categories like our food areas, and we're getting closer to customers. So we'll continue to manage through this. Of course, there'll be some uncertainty. The environment is tending to move around like it has been over the last few quarters.\nBut we have a team of people who are experienced, and they'll be able to manage it. So pretty consistent quarter to quarter from a merchandise margin standpoint. I think you see that in the numbers, and that'll be our focus going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will be coming from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, Doug and John Rainey. Thank you. Regarding artificial intelligence, you've had a nice history here with loyalty, adaptive, and using LLMs as well as using this with employees. What would you say are your competitive advantages and how you might contrast this relative to competition within AI? And then within AI, what might be harder versus easier and lower-hanging fruit that you see ahead? A lot of progress with Sparky. A quick follow-up as well.\nAs you build Walmart into an ecosystem and a lifestyle brand, and thinking about the progress you've made with higher-income consumers and style, what's on your mind for the roadmap with respect to that aspect of the brand and the customer experience? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nI'll kick off the first one. John, you may want to help out with the second one. All of you are welcome to join in this response. When I think about AI, Oliver, one of the things that we've obviously got is a ton of data. And it's not just product catalog data these days. It's delivery data. It's real-time data. And the way that we can put that to work to understand the context in which someone's shopping is really exciting to think about. I think it's compelling.\nThere are times when you want to replenish your home with the things you buy all the time. There are other times when you're browsing for fun. I think we're going to do a better job of understanding what the moment calls for and being able to meet the need, whether it's delivery speed or it's the breadth of the assortment. One of the interesting things about our advantages is the physical nature of them.\nIf we can compete as it relates to the digital aspects, but we bring a customer service culture, a lot of great associates that bring that culture to life, the physical supply chain, being able to fulfill the order across the breadth of our assortment that's online is something that not very many people can do. So it's one thing to know what intent is. It's another to be able to close it out.\nI think we're in a position to be able to do both of those things. This omni nature of our business proves to be an advantage once again.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nDoug, I think it's really exciting at the stage that we're in to be able to understand customer intent and customer preferences at a one-to-one level. So helping customers take time out of their day so that we can understand what it is they're trying to accomplish, whether it's plan for a meal or create a solution for an event. Then having memory to be able to help us anticipate what customers need. So if they want to stay in stock in their home, we'll be able to do that in ways that we haven't been able to before. I'm really excited about where Sparky is today.\nWhen we had our managers together last week, we talked about some of the things that Sparky will be able to do in the near future. I think those are important developments as we look forward. This will be an enabler for our customers. It's also an enabler for our associates, being able to help associates throughout the supply chain and the stores know what the next best action to take is.\nIt will be particularly helpful when it comes to serving customers, managing inventory, and preparing ourselves for the next couple of quarters.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO of Sam's Club, Walmart\n\nI feel really good about all of that as it pertains to Sam's Club too. The one thing I'd add with Sam's Club is I'm really excited about the level of digital engagement we're seeing in our clubs. We've got well over 40% now.\nWe're trending to 40%, well over 40% at the weekends of people using Scan&Go and the Just Go arches. What's really cool about that is it's bringing AI and computer vision and bringing them together to make our associates' lives easier and our members' lives easier. It's really resonating. That's one of the big reasons we're trending so much younger with our new members that we're acquiring. I think it's online, and I think it's physical too. I'm excited about what the future looks like for Sam's Club.\n\nKath McLay\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nThis might sound a bit intangible, but I also think trust is a competitive advantage. We've been serving customers across kind of all of the markets and giving them access to get better prices through everyday low prices.\nI think you're building a relationship over many years where they know that they can trust that we'll have the best price for them. I think that trust transfers in an AI world to being a part of our competitive advantage as well.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThe second part of the question was plans related to higher-income customers.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nLook, I think customers in every part of the value chain are looking for ways to save time, and they're looking for more flexibility. We've talked about this for the last few years. We have gained share, and we've earned the business of customers who are higher-income. At the same time, we've continued to maintain and grow with other income levels.\nIn particular, the higher-income customers, the flexibility that we offer, whether it's the marketplace with over half a billion items, which is growing well, our ability to deliver faster, the growth in same-day and next-day delivery is particularly helpful. And then channels like fast delivery, which we've talked about with over 20% of our store or 1/3 of our store deliveries coming in our three hours, and 20% of those under 30 minutes is particularly helpful. So whether you're planning out what you're going to do this week, whether it's fashion that you're looking for, which is accelerated here at Walmart, or it's an ingredient or something you're missing and you need in the next few minutes, we can help accomplish all these things for customers.\nso excited about the growth across income groups, but I'm also particularly excited about the number of customers that we have met, acquired, seen who are higher-income that are transacting more frequently with Walmart.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO of Sam's Club, Walmart\n\nYeah, we see the largest proportion of our members are those higher-income members, and they're still growing. One of the things I'm excited to see is the growth in our GM business. So we're in our Q5 of positive comps in GM. Units are growing ahead of comp. Apparel is doing really well. Seasonal is doing really well. But I think it's worth bringing a bit of focus on. We brought 50 new brands into GM this quarter. These are brands that maybe Sam's Club wouldn't have gotten before.\nJust this last couple of weeks, Vera Bradley, Outdoor Voices, CurrentBody, these are cool, interesting items, and our merchants are finding them, and it's bringing in the kind of members that you'd hope you would see.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPeter Keith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the new ad campaign called Who Knew, which I think is pretty good. It launched in mid-June, so it might be a little bit early, but I think it does a good job of highlighting the broad selection and the delivery capability. So I was wondering if there's been any initial reaction you've noticed with the ad campaign. Certainly, the acceleration in e-com growth might be coincidental, but it is interesting.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nHey, good morning, Peter. It's John. We're really excited about the campaign. It's been a lot of fun. I think the team is particularly excited about the messaging. You mentioned a couple of points. What we were obviously hoping to do was help people see Walmart a bit differently and help explain to people that may not know. A lot of people do, but a lot of people do not know that we have such a broad assortment, which would include our stores, our first-party commerce business, and marketplace.\nCertainly, as the campaign kicked off in June, we had a lot of excitement around it. We were able to introduce it in front of all our associates here in town. But since that time, hard to measure at this point, I'll say that first, but our e-commerce business and the channels that we talked about, the breadth of assortment and speed of delivery have accelerated.\nThis is a great quarter for the team, up 26%, which is 5% to 6% above where we've been trending. We'll continue to monitor the results. We're happy with the progress. We have some exciting plans for the campaign in the back half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\n[Analyst] (Gordon Haskett)\n\nAnalyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHi, this is Eric for Chuck. Earlier in the call, you mentioned that the lower-middle consumers are feeling the pressure of higher prices. Curious if you're seeing positive comps from all the different income cohorts? If there's been any divergence in the trends of those cohorts? And also just curious if you're seeing any changes in sort of how you're thinking about capital location now with tariffs being a bigger impact going forward?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, first on the customer, we are always focused on opening price points and having what we would call a ladder in our assortment to ensure that we're offering opening price point, good, and better qualities. We've seen growth in all three. We mentioned early in the call that we have over 7,000 rollbacks, about 7,400. That's up almost 2,000 from the prior quarter. So our merchants will continue to focus on mixing out categories. We want to be the price leader in opening price point.\nWe want to have great values in food and consumables, general merchandise. Our food business, again, in units and fresh food in particular, had a strong quarter. Our ability to deliver has worked for all income groups. There may be some assumptions that one group would take delivery more frequently than others. We see that being much more balanced as we look across.\nSo we're particularly excited about the growth of all. We did highlight high-income customers, and that's great. I think that's a response to some of the better brands that we're now offering, including private brands like Better Goods. But it's been pretty balanced, and look forward to serving customers at all income levels as we look ahead.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nOn capital allocation, I think we're very fortunate to be a company that has so many opportunities to invest a dollar for high returns. As I've said before, though, every dollar has to compete for that highest return. I think we're fortunate to have opportunities to invest in ourselves and things like technology, AI, and supply chain automation to drive returns in some cases in the 20% range. But we also, because we generate a fair amount of free cash flow, we have an opportunity to be balanced there.\nIn the most recent quarter, we also were aggressive in buying back more stock. Year to date, we've bought back over $6 billion of our shares, and that's 50% more than we did all of last year. So as the market dislocated a little bit with some of the concerns around tariffs earlier in the year, we were more aggressive. We'll continue to be aggressive buyers of our stock when we see prices dislocate because of all the things that you've heard today. We have a lot of conviction in our plan. We like where we're going. We like our strategy, and we believe that that's going to generate returns well in excess of what we've done historically. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will be from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Feldman\n\nSenior Managing Director and Assistant Director of Research, Telsey Advisory Gorup\n\nYeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to, I think, something Doug mentioned. You feel pretty confident about the holiday season and think it should be a pretty solid one, which I think is welcome news to a lot of investors. So I was curious, maybe you could say why you think that, given all the cost pressures across retail in general, and maybe it's that people will be shopping more frequently at Walmart, but wanted to ask about that and maybe any changes to your approach for the holiday season and maybe for both Sam's and for Walmart. Thanks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHey, Joe, this is Doug. What I said was Walmart's going to have a good holiday season. I think if you look at what happened with back to school, it's usually an indicator of what will happen with Halloween and Christmas. I think the other thing that's gotten us excited is we had a chance to be together, John, with all the US store managers last week and to see the items and to see the prices that we've got coming for holiday.\nSo I feel like that when I look at the rest of the year and as reflected in our guidance, that we're going to finish strong and we're going to be in good shape. In particular, we got to keep a close eye on inventory management. Obviously, pricing and sell-throughs matter, but as we've been talking about during the call, I think we're well on top of that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nAs always, thanks for your time and attention today. I hope you can tell we're focused. We're focused on the customer, kind of the fundamentals of the business, whether it's pricing or inventory management. It's great to have top-line momentum, and we want to keep that going, keep the share gains growing. We've got good growth in e-commerce at 25%, but we have a lot of headroom. Our share in e-commerce is still relatively low, so there's a long runway there.\nIt's good to have Rollbacks in the mix as we get cost pressure on some items. It's nice to be able to have some relief for customers in other places. Really nice to have general merchandise performing well. Pleased with how inventory management's gone so far. I think strategically just continuing to focus on strengthening the business model and growing those newer businesses like advertising and membership is obviously key. We did that this quarter.\nWe've been doing that for quite a while now, and I expect that to continue. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. We disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."

Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that concludes my intro. We're ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart Inc\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. I'll start today by thanking our associates. They continue to drive results for today while changing to strengthen our business for tomorrow. We have more than 475,000 associates participating in our Walmart Share Purchase Plan, and 81% of them are hourly. For all those associates that are listening, nice job, everybody. For our first quarter, we grew sales 4% and profit by 3% in constant currency. We grew International sales by 7.8%. We drove a Sam's US comp of 6.7% excluding fuel, and a Walmart US comp of 4.5%. Though strong Q1 results were not driven by inflation, transactions and units drove our top line. Globally we grew eCommerce 22%, with each segment delivering growth of at least 20%. Inventory is in good shape.\nSo the first quarter was what we expected on the top-line and better than what we expected on the bottom line. It was a good first quarter. There's a lot to like about how we're changing and where we are. We feel great about our team, our strategy, and our stores and clubs. We feel great about how we're driving eCommerce growth in a way that not only serves customers and members better, but reshapes our business model, resulting in a more profitable business with higher returns over time. Delivery speed continues to help drive our business. We'll soon reach 95% of the population in the US with delivery options of 3 hours or less. For Walmart US, the number of deliveries in less than 3 hours grew by 91% for Q1 versus a year ago.\nAnd in China and India, we're frequently talking about delivery times that happen in minutes. We're confident in our ability to strengthen this business even as we navigate cost of goods changes. Our short- and longer-term opportunities are clear. The immediate challenge is obviously navigating the impact of tariffs here in the US. Our mindset and approach haven't changed since our investor conference last month in Dallas. I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Bessent for the progress made recently. We're hopeful that it leads to a longer-term agreement between the US and China that would result in even lower tariffs. We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible, but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\nIn retail, managing inventory is always important. In this situation, it's even more important and even more challenging. It's helpful that we're entering the second quarter with well-managed inventory. It's helpful that we're crossing the threshold of profitability with eCommerce globally and that we have these newer higher-margin businesses growing like membership and advertising. It's helpful that we sell a broad assortment that includes food, consumables, and general merchandise. It's helpful that so much of our assortment is replenishable, which means we can flow it. We don't have to make a one-time call on a quantity. Instead, we can adjust the forecast and partner with our suppliers to adjust quantities over time as we navigate tariff impacts on costs. It's helpful that we have so many talented and experienced merchants and replenishment associates. Treating our suppliers well is a priority.\nWe've worked with most of these companies for many years, and we'll be doing business together for many years to come. So, we'll have that longer-term mindset as we work together through this year. It's helpful that more than two-thirds of what we sell in the US is made, assembled, or grown here. In recent years, our US percentage has grown. Last year we purchased $296 billion in the United States, and we made a commitment back in 2021 to add another $350 billion in incremental US volume over the following 10 years. We recently announced additional support for US businesses in the form of Grow with Us, which will provide small businesses in the US with the education, training, and resources they need to help them get started with us.\nYou might be surprised to know that nearly 60% of our suppliers in the US are small businesses. We'll also continue to hold our Open Call event in October where we invite US companies that aren't doing business with us to introduce their company and their products. That is one of the most fun days of the year for us as merchants. The merchandise that we import comes from all over the world, from dozens of countries other than the US. The other large markets are China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Canada. China in particular represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff-impacted markets started in late April, and it accelerated in May.\nLet me describe how we think about that and what we're doing about it. First, we want to keep our food and consumables prices as low as we can. Food prices in the US have gone up in recent years, and our customers have been feeling that all along. We won't let tariff-related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices, but as it relates to food tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia, are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses. We'll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible. An example would be controlling the amount of fresh food waste. In some cases, we're holding our retails where they are despite the tariff cost pressure.\nFlowers for Mother's Day at Sam's Club US is a good example when it comes to the general merchandise categories that are impacted. We'll move production where that's possible. That isn't easy or fast, but we've been working on that for years, so it's not like we've just started to make adjustments. In some cases we'll absorb costs within a category or department and not simply pass on a tariff cost attributable to each item individually. We'll be managing mix across items, categories, and businesses. We also have suppliers shifting materials from tariff-impacted components like aluminum to fiberglass where there is no tariff. Our merchants, sourcing team, and suppliers are being creative. It's been impressive to watch our team identify opportunities and adjust as we continue to diversify our profit streams. Through our e-commerce offering, our marketplace, membership, and advertising, we have some room to absorb costs.\nWe're committed to growing profit faster than sales. There isn't anything about this quarter or anything about this coming year that shakes our confidence about growing profit faster than sales over the term of our long-range plan. The strategy and business model are set up to do that. In summary, the takeaways from my remarks today are: One, we delivered a good First Quarter, Two, our strategy and omnichannel capabilities are strong, we'll keep getting better in terms of assortment, delivery speed, and we'll keep scaling our newer businesses. We'll keep driving growth, and we'll control what we can control. We continue to be confident in our ability to strengthen this business even as we navigate cost-of-goods changes, our short- and longer-term opportunities are clear, and Three, we're positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone.\nBut even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices. The timing of the tariffs and our inventory receipts matters as you interpret our results by quarter. John David will say more about how retail accounting and timing will play out through the year. I'll wrap up my remarks today the same way I opened by thanking our associates. Our store, club, and supply chain associates are working hard and learning new capabilities. Our home, office, and tech associates are partnering to manage the short term while building for the long-term. We've been operating in challenging environments for years now and we'll come through this one stronger than ever. Just as we have before. We have Associate and Shareholders Week coming up. It's my favorite week of the year. I look forward to seeing so many of our associates and many of you here in Northwest Arkansas. John David, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nThanks, Doug. Our First-Quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our business and the relevance of our omni-strategy in the context of a highly dynamic backdrop. I'm pleased with the continued sales momentum across the company, and it speaks to the competitive advantages that set us apart in the retail marketplace. Our commitment to delivering value and convenience to our customers is resonating more than ever, at the same time we're driving progress in high-growth areas like advertising, membership, and marketplace services. Our April results were better than we had expected, particularly in Walmart US.\nSales across segments improved as the quarter progressed, including strong Easter seasonal events, and our teams did a nice job managing inventory and controllable expenses leading to a stronger than forecasted performance in both gross profit and SG&A. Consolidated revenue increased 4% in constant currency despite lapping last year's leap date driven by strong growth in eCommerce of 22%. Currency headwinds reduced reported sales results by $2.4 billion or 150 basis points of growth. Walmart US comp sales grew 4.5%, aided by strong eCommerce sales growth of 21%. Momentum in grocery sales continued with a mid-single-digit comp and ongoing share gains. Health and wellness sales increased high teens reflecting higher prescription volumes and over-the-counter sales while general merchandise sales declined slightly with softness in electronics, home products, and sporting goods.\nWe're focused on value and managing our relative price position, while also saving customers time with our eCommerce options. In Walmart US, we have more than 5,000 price rollbacks across our assortment, and we've seen private brand sales outperform with grocery private brand penetration up 60 basis points versus last year. Our International business grew sales 7.8% in constant currency, reflecting strength in China and Flipkart. eCommerce was strong with double-digit growth across markets, led by pickup and delivery in marketplace. We're increasing speed of delivery for customers. In International, items delivered same or next day increased by 35%, with about 45% of those items delivered in under three hours. At Walmex, lapping last year's government stimulus payments, the Easter shift and some early quarter softness tied to a weaker and uncertain macro environment led to slightly softer sales than anticipated.\nWe're encouraged by the pickup in business more recently with sales back in line with our expectations. Sam's Club US comp sales ex-fuel increased nearly 7%, with strong growth in transactions, including strength in Member's Mark. eCommerce grew 27%, led by triple-digit growth in club-fulfilled delivery and double-digit growth in pickup. Members' value the convenience of Scan and Go and their usage of this tool continues to grow, with penetration increasing 600 basis points versus last year. Over 50% of our members now transact digitally in some form with Sam's Online or using digital solutions in Club.\nFrom a margin standpoint, consolidated gross margin increased 12 basis points due to better-than-expected results at Walmart US, partially offset by lower-than-expected results in International, which saw increased pressure from channel and format mix changes. Gross margins in Walmart US increased 25 basis points, reflecting continued disciplined inventory management, including a lower level of markdowns and improvements in business mix that have offset increased pressure from merchandise category mix. As our business model evolves, contributions to profitability are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of drivers, including improved eCommerce economics and business mix. We achieved eCommerce profitability both in the US as well as for the global enterprise in Q1 for the first time, an important milestone for our company.\nIn the US eCommerce net delivery costs have declined as we've continued to densify our last-mile deliveries and as customers pay fees for faster delivery. Business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees, also contributed to the improvement in Q1 profitability. Our advertising business across markets increased 50% including VIZIO. Walmart Connect in the US, which doesn't include VIZIO, grew 31%. Sam's Club US ad business was up 21% and we saw 20% growth in our International markets led by Flipkart. Membership fee income was up nearly 15% across the enterprise. In the US, Sam's Club continued to see steady growth in member counts, renewal rates, and increased penetration of plus members resulting in membership income growth of 9.6% while Walmart+ membership income grew double-digits, within International membership income from Sam's Club China grew more than 40% as member counts continue to increase.\nSG&A expenses deleveraged 6 basis points, including the benefit from lapping last year's business reorganization cost. As expected, International and Sam's Club US expense deleverage reflects planned investments in associate wages. Walmart US deleverage reflected increased depreciation expense as well as VIZIO operating costs post-acquisition. As we previewed at our Investor Day, we experienced higher-than-expected casualty claims expense. We're accruing a higher rate for claims cost based on the industry trends that point to higher risk adjustment factors. We expect this trend to persist for at least a few quarters. Adjusted operating income was better-than-expected with growth of 3% in constant currency, and adjusted EPS of $0.61 was higher than our guided range. Importantly, our inventory is at a healthy level, up 3.8%.\nThat's obviously as important as ever as we head into a tariff-impacted period where cost pressures will impact item pricing and make it more challenging to anticipate demand by item. This is a highly fluid situation and we'll need to manage quantity decisions as we measure the price elasticity of impacted items. I'm grateful that we have a team of experienced merchants, various levers we can pull, and the tools available to manage this in a thoughtful and proactive way. Our cash position provides the flexibility we need to lean into opportunities to grow share while also continuing to invest in areas with long-term strategic value such as supply chain automation, store growth, remodels, and tech. In April we completed an approximately $4 billion debt issuance at attractive terms. We continue to expect FY2026 CapEx to be in the range of 3% to 3.5 of sales.\nDuring Q1, we repurchased $4.6 billion in stock, an amount equivalent to our share repurchases for the entire year last year. We have a lot of confidence in our business and will continue to be opportunistic with buybacks when share price dislocations occur. Now turning to guidance, as a matter of practice, we provide an update on our full-year outlook at the end of the second quarter if appropriate, but I'd like to give some color on how we're thinking about the impact from tariffs. I want to start with reiterating our message from our Investor Day in early April. We have a lot of confidence in our strategy and there is nothing about this current period that makes us feel differently about anything we've previously said about our long-term financial framework to grow annual sales about 4% and operating income faster than sales.\nWe've seen during periods of economic uncertainty in the past. We tend to gain share and come out of the other side in an even stronger position. We expect this period to be no different. We'll play offense and may opportunistically invest in areas to improve our value proposition, but we're not fully immune from the financial impacts in the short term. We've done work internally to model various scenarios related to the ongoing trade policy discussions. These scenarios involve making assumptions about how long tariffs persist at certain levels versus coming down to some lower level. Once bilateral trade deals are completed, we also must make assumptions about the elasticity of demand as well as the overall macro backdrop in this environment.\nPerhaps it's obvious but worth stating, the range of possible outcomes is much greater than when we originally provided our annual guidance. That said, in what we believe are the most likely scenarios that we've modeled, we still have the ability to achieve our full-year guidance for both sales and operating income. These scenarios involve the belief that trade policy discussions will result in bilateral agreements in principle for the existence of good faith discussions moving toward agreements that could result in tariff levels lower than those initially proposed in early April. However, if we see a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels, the impact on our financials could be significant and even jeopardize our ability to grow earnings year-over-year.\nIn any case, we're comfortable with our ability to grow sales in the range we've guided for the year, though the mix of AUR versus units may be much different in these scenarios. While the swings from quarter-to-quarter could be large, we still think we can achieve our operating income guidance for the year given what we know and our assumptions that I referenced. Should more progress on trade in the next several weeks be favorable, there could be upside. If elevated tariffs remain in place for an elongated period, there would be downside risk. We will know a lot more in a couple months, but we are equipped to manage this as well or better than other retailers. Turning to the second quarter, the operating environment is highly fluid, and it makes the very near term exceedingly difficult to forecast.\nThe level and speed at which tariffs-impact prices could go up is more extreme than in normal periods. The US is by far our number one market for sourcing for less than one-third of what we sell in the US that's imported, China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam, and India are our largest markets. As Doug noted, we're encouraged by the recent trade negotiations, especially concerning China. The level of tariffs that result from those discussions and the timing of when they ultimately become final may cause larger swings in our financial performance from one quarter to the next. Moreover, there are two specific accounting methods that make these swings more difficult to forecast. I want to take the time to explain these because they may impact the second and future quarters given cost pressures caused by tariffs.\nThe first relates to our method of accounting for the cost of inventory for the majority of our US business, the Retail Inventory Method, or RIM for short. We've always used RIM in Walmart US. It's not new for us, and it's a common method of accounting in the retail industry. RIM accounting applies a ratio of the actual cost of the inventory to its retail price to calculate ending inventory and therefore derive cost of goods sold. As prices go up, this can result in the potential for markups on our inventory and increased merchandise margin gains relative to periods of more constant price levels. To the extent that later markdowns need to be recorded, it can have an offsetting effect.\nThe magnitude of these swings both positive and negative given the level of additional costs that could be applied to the inventory that we're purchasing right now are unprecedented in our business and could result in swings in margin and earnings by quarter. The second is the possibility of LIFO-related charges as prices go up, which we experienced in Sam's Club US during a sustained inflationary period in FY2024. We currently expect that sales growth on a constant currency basis will be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5 for the second quarter, though the composition of sales through AUR versus units may be different than what we expect today. Notably, if current exchange rates were to stay where they are right now for the entire second quarter, we would expect a headwind of approximately 120 basis points to reported sales growth.\nFor operating income, the range of outcomes for the quarter is much wider. The information related to the trade discussions taking place is changing by the week, and in some cases, by the day. Importantly, we also want to provide flexibility for us to play offense in this environment. And lastly, our method of accounting for inventory could have a larger impact on our earnings than in normal quarters. For these reasons, the range of outcomes for the quarter is so wide that it would be impractical to provide a range of operating income guidance that investors could credibly rely upon. I want to encourage you to think about the next couple quarters in the aggregate. We may experience larger gains related to markups in the second quarter, and some of those may be offset by markdowns in the third, and fourth quarter.\nThis is why we've underscored the importance of managing inventory well in this environment. In total, though, we believe that we can still achieve our operating income guidance for the year. In closing, as we look ahead, while operating conditions are expected to remain dynamic, our strategy is clear. Our top-line momentum is strong, and we're flexing into our advantages to protect margins as we grow. History tells us that when we lean into these times of economic uncertainty, we emerge on the other side as a stronger company. We expect this time to be no different. We appreciate your interest in our company and are now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question today, please press star one from your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone to indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to withdraw your question from the queue. Participants are using speaker equipment. It may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys so we may address questions for as many participants as possible. We ask you, please limit yourself to one question. One moment, please, for our first question. First question today is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, thank you guys. Thanks for all the detail on your pricing philosophy tied to tariffs. Very helpful. My question is on eComm, big milestone for the company, achieving profitability in the eComm business. Just curious what finally got you over the hump and where to from here in terms of where margins in that business can go relative to the rest of the business? And what do you see as the key drivers of further improvement to eComm profitability from here? Thanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nPaul, thank you for your question. This is John David. Let me start with just giving a little bit more detail on the global eComm profitability. We noted that we achieved it on an enterprise basis globally as well as for the US segment. And so, if you to break that down by segment, the US was profitable; Sam's was profitable; and the International was slightly unprofitable. But if you take all of those together, we had a profit for the quarter. So we're really pleased with that. There are a few things that have driven the performance, notably in the US, and John will talk more about this, but one is the densification of our network.\nAnd what I mean by that, as we have more customers that are coming to Walmart now and taking advantage of our eCommerce offerings. We're able to spread those deliveries over multiple households. So think about the opportunity to deliver a package to five houses on a street versus one house on a street. And so as we grow, we continue to spread those costs over more volume. The second is delivery cost. And this is where John and his team have made a tremendous amount of progress in reducing the unit costs. And this is a lot of the supply chain infrastructure that we've implemented. But part of that too, is the willingness that customers have shown to be able to pay for expedited delivery. And what I mean by that is delivery within one hour or within three hours.\nWe noted in the last quarter that fully a third of our customers are taking advantage of that option. It shows the relevance of convenience. We've seen an uptick in that even in the most recent period. So John, maybe you want to add a little bit more, but to me those are a couple things that stand out to help improve the profitability.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nYeah, thanks, John. John David. Paul, a few things. If you look back over the last few years, I think it's a combination of investments we made for about the last decade. And those investments would include, getting our applications to a single app, building new fulfillment centers, enabling stores to be part of the omni solution, the speed of delivery has been encouraging the last year, our sub-three-hour deliveries are up about 91% year-on-year. John David mentioned also the scale of the operation. It has taken a number of years, but we're pleased with the progress and the growth. We've been running 21% growth for multiple quarters in a row. For customers, in particular, what the team has done that I've been really impressed with is providing customers flexibility to serve customers when they want to be served the way they want to be served.\nSo a Walmart customer can shop at the counter. They can shop with curbside pickup. We have in-home delivery. Our first- and third-party delivery options including fulfillment services for our sellers has been on a strong growth rate for the last few years, and that has resulted in, as John David said, lower delivery costs due to density and frequency. All of that put together has enabled us to, has helped us enable business mix with advertising, our data businesses. And when you put it all together, just really proud of the team to be able to sit here today and announce a quarter of profitability for the first time, as we told you just just a month ago, we were together in Dallas. And importantly, the team has exited the quarter with momentum. There was a strong April. We had a strong Easter.\nOur omni capabilities enabled us to deliver floral and other things that people need last-minute for the Easter holiday and Mother's Day. So we'll keep working on better ways to serve customers. Improving speed, improving density, and working efficiently across all the channels.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThank you guys. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone, and good quarter. So, Doug and John David, you both touched on this. You built this business and financial model now that your margins could go up and invest faster for growth at the same time. I've asked you in the past about the toggling that balance. And I kind of heard some of the prepared remarks on this, I'll push back and say, why not toggle it in favor of investments even more in this environment. We know how important it is getting more gross profit dollars, especially in gen merch. Why not lean into there? And you said it yourselves, Walmart should be better positioned than most to navigate this environment? Thanks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart Inc\n\nYeah. Thanks, Simeon. This is Doug. I'll go first and then John David can comment. I think with our guidance where it is for the year, we positioned ourselves to be appropriately aggressive. I think as the quarters play out, we may make different choices depending on what's happening with pricing. It is fluid. You know, we're watching what's happening with cost of goods. There are a lot of moving parts as it relates to merchandising these days. And as it relates to the retail prices, we'll watch where our price gaps are, but we'll also watch what customers are telling us and the response that we get from them and the pressure that they're feeling. So the bottom line is if we need to invest more, we can. Having said that, I really want to grow profit faster than sales.\nLike we've been working on this for a long time. I think we deserve that. You guys deserve that. And we can navigate this in a way as we balance all the interests between customers, shareholders, and everyone else such that we can keep prices low enough to help people and grow profit faster than sales. That's what, that's what winning looks like to me.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nYeah. I would underscore the points that Doug made. I feel, Simeon, that we are striking the right balance between investment and growing profits. If you look over the last two years, we grew operating income about 10% on average. Our guidance is, let's call it roughly half of that this year. So this is a year of investment. But even while doing that, we are hopeful to be able to grow profits faster themselves. If there's to me a story about the quarter from a financial perspective, it's really one of the diversification of our income streams. So you're seeing all these things play out. If you were to just take advertising and membership as an example, that's a quarter of our profits. Membership was really strong in the quarter, we grew each segment, membership double-digits, International was north of 20%.\nSo you're seeing this diversification of our income streams that allows us to continue to take a very long-term perspective and invest in this business. So, these are always a little tricky, in terms of what striking that right balance. But we feel like the plan that we have right now is the right one for us.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wanted to ask a question about the consumer and the upper and lower end. You called out strong gains with upper income households. Is that coming through on the eCommerce side mainly in addition to what's going on in the store? And then, on the other side, there's been a dialogue in the market that maybe the lower end consumer is getting weaker and seeing some incremental pressure and perhaps leading to some bottom-of-funnel loss where they're trading out of Walmart to lower sort of unit, lower average cost locations and doing smaller shops. So can you talk about what you're seeing on both sides in terms of the health as well as the share performance? Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nChristopher, it's John. I'll first anchor on comments that John David made early this morning which are that customers, in some cases, we've heard of some concern, they remain choiceful and consistent. And we continue to see customers prioritizing value and speed of delivery. We have seen growth across all income cohorts in the quarter. Fortunately, and proud of the fact that in April we saw a number of new customers and probably, it's probably a good time to remind you just the shape of the quarter in terms of the calendar. This was a calendar where we had leap year last year, and then we had a very late Easter.\nSo, February was softer than we expected. March was back to normal, and we exited the quarter with a very strong April, including a strong Easter holiday, which is a reminder that customers are prioritizing seasonal events, getting together, having meals at home. Importantly, we want to be very flexible for our customers. If customers choose to shop in store, we want to have a great store experience. We're very pleased with our remodel program. We continue to see accelerated results and high NPS scores after remodel. Our fast delivery scores are some of the highest scores that we have in the company. Over the course of the rest of the year, you will continue to see us expand our capacity and capability to deliver from FCs quickly, including same day, next day, and two days.\nWe are growing our fast delivery options almost 100% year-on-year. You heard that this morning, growing 91%. So, we'll continue to focus on value with great products and meat produce, our better goods line, really proud of the progress in apparel. Toys has had a strong quarter, particularly the holiday. And then we'll remain very, very flexible for our customers as we move throughout the year.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club\n\nI think from a Sam's Club point of view, I underline everything that John just said. Right now, I think we're leaning into the power of the model, of the membership warehouse retail model. We have incredible prices because we've curated items for members. And what we find is that this resonates whether you're earning a lot of money or whether you're working through how you spend your money each toward the end of your pay packet. We're seeing growth in convenience.\nWe really see that convenience is something that resonates for everybody. And in fact, what we give them back is the power of time. So if we make things easier for people, they have more time, and that's incredibly valuable to people. So I would just close by saying that the growth in our membership, the 10% growth in our membership income, is driven by more people renewing, more new members, and a higher mix of plus participation, and we're seeing that across all of our income cohorts.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Baird\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So mine's kind of on capital allocation. You talked about CapEx 3% to 3.9 of sales. Sounds like that probably trends towards the upper end of that range this year. I'm wondering if you could frame where we stand with the automation investment and the spend on that, on that front? Should we be thinking CapEx in dollars is kind of at a peakish level here, at least for the intermediate term? And then, on the buyback, great to see. In first quarter, it looks like you spent, as you said, more than last year but also more than two years ago. Any way we should be thinking about that going forward and your willingness to commit more to buyback? Thanks so much.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nSure. Peter. Thank you for the question. On capital allocation, I'll start with CapEx. The right way to think about that level for our business is in the 3% to 3.5 of sales. So, that should grow with revenue as we go forward. It may vacillate a little bit between the top end and the bottom end of that. But given what we know and the opportunities that we have to drive improved returns through some of this investment, we're not shying away from this and we're taking a very long-term perspective even in this current operating environment we see some of those costs are coming in higher. We look at capital allocation as every dollar has to fight for its highest return. And this is one of the best ways that we can spend a dollar.\nThat said, we saw significant price dislocation in the quarter as some of the uncertainties filtered through the market. And we were very aggressive in our share buyback. As I noted, buying back more than we did in the entirety of last year. And we'll continue to do that as we see price dislocation because we have a lot of conviction in our strategy. We have a lot of confidence in the plan that we have, and we believe there's a lot of shareholder value to be created here. And so as we see these types of dislocations, you're going to see us be more aggressive. I think it's fair to say, obviously we're going to use, we're going to spend more in share buyback this year than we did last year, given that we've already done that one quarter into the year. The total amount of that, you know, is to be determined. We'll see where prices are. We need to balance this with both increasing our dividend as well as investing in ourselves through CapEx.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question from the line of Brad Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrad Thomas\n\nManaging Director, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning. The Walmart Connect growth was particularly impressive this quarter and showed some acceleration for you. I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on the strength in advertising? And any incremental learnings you've had so far as you continue to integrate VIZIO? Thanks.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nHey, Brad, it's John. We had a good quarter with Walmart Connect, as you mentioned, up 31% year-on-year, and also a strong quarter around the world in the other advertising businesses that we operate. We're in the initial stages of integrating VIZIO. I'm excited about the plans we have for VIZIO the rest of the year. It's a great operating system, very frictionless, easy to sign up, and we're looking forward to the contributions of the VIZIO team going forward. In terms of the core advertising business, we've had strength with the growth of advertising with our marketplace sellers. Our GMV and marketplace has been very consistent in the mi- to high-20s. Last quarter was in the mid-20s as well. We also have had continued strength with first-party and third-party suppliers, so it's a broad mix of capabilities.\nAdditionally, this quarter, we launched pharmacy delivery, and that's another opportunity for our customers to enjoy the flexibility that we offer. Ans so there will be new opportunities, I think, as we go forward and look ahead. But in general, we're really pleased with the progress, the momentum, and the team that we've established in Walmart Connect.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Hardlines, Broadlines and Food Retail, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. John David, in your remarks, you said if elevated tariffs remain in place for an elongated period, there would be downside risk. Now, you guys are astute poker players and probably will not clearly define what elevated tariff rates are. But would you consider the current level of tariffs to be elevated, meaning that there could be downside risk if they do not come down? And more importantly, over the long-term, is there anything about this tariff situation that would existentially impact Walmart's margins? Meaning that given the opportunity of time and flexibility, you would be able to fully mitigate all that you see in front of you and such that you would be able to have margin rates that are consistent with what you would expect to do over the longer term? Thank you very much.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nThanks for the question, Michael. Let me start with the second part of your question first. We don't see anything, and this is, we indicated this in our prepared remarks. We don't see anything that changes the way that we think about our business long-term related to the current environment that we're in. And so we think that we can navigate this. I think the thing that everyone is focused on, certainly the Fed, is to make sure that these are a one-time price increase and not something that persists and bleeds into wage growth and other things that have a more longer-term effect. In terms of the first part of your question, what I was referring to is the level of tariffs that were announced at the beginning of April. Keep in mind, a week ago, we were at 145% tariffs in China.\nAnd certainly, you know as well as anyone the preparation that goes into this day for us. And so when we started the preparation around earnings, that's the construct that we were working under. And in a 145% tariff environment, and tariffs at a level that are approaching 50% for other countries, is not a good outcome for retailers, not good outcome for the economy. We're very pleased and appreciative of the progress that's been made by the administration to bring tariffs down to this level, and the guidance that we gave today, the affirmation of our full-year guidance, is with tariffs at this level. But let me emphasize, we still think that's too high. There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we're dependent upon to import from other countries, and prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that's not good for consumers.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on another tariff question and inventory planning. As you stated, you know, it's a difficult backdrop for planning inventory. Tariffs, obviously, moving target, you know, I think uncertainty around elasticities. Against that backdrop, how are you thinking about the planning of the inventory? Do you stay lean, hoping that tariffs come down? Do you get aggressive because we're on a 90-day pause? Bigger picture question that I have related to this is, you know, can you avoid the risk of another 2022 scenario, given the dynamic backdrop? do you think that that's a risk for retail? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart Inc\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Edward. This is Doug, and you guys can chime in if you want to. I think the way to start is to remind you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have a lot of replenishable items at Walmart. It's such a strength to be operating off the side counters rather than some sort of high-low marketing-driven model, where we're focused on features in the action alley and end caps, for example.\nSo, on replenishable goods, we have the opportunity to partner with our suppliers to see what happens with sales as cost and then eventually retail adjusts and then manage that through the weeks and months ahead. So that's a great position to be in, and our merchants and our replenishment team are really good at that, and they're managing that on a daily basis. As tariff numbers have changed, they've done a great job of pivoting, recalculating quantities, and thinking through it again. Where it can get more challenging is we make decisions related to things like Halloween and Christmas farther out, and how do you make a quantity call and what tariff number do you use?\nThe best answer we can give you is we've got a sales plan, we're operating against that sales plan. Some of the quantities will be adjusted based on what we think the tariffs are going to be. We've made some tariff assumptions, and then we'll partner with our suppliers to flow that, and if we need to chase goods, chase some goods. The bottom line is, yeah, we want to avoid what happened back in 2022, and by paying close attention to our unit decisions, that's how we'll do it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk about how the tariff situation is impacting your sellers on marketplace both from an inventory standpoint, and you think about the contribution to advertising as a result of this more difficult environment?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nIt's John in terms of overall inventory management, Walmart, along with our capability to serve sellers, we've built a number of tools in the last three years that are particularly helpful. And for sellers in particular, having services like Walmart Fulfillment Services with heightened visibility of their inventory, where it is, our ability to move around the country so particularly helpful as. As we sit here today, the ports are flowing, inventory is moving. So, we don't have any concerns at this point about port backups in the United States, so our inventory is flowing through. I did mention earlier that our GMV growth rates in marketplace, in particular, have been consistent over the last few quarters. You saw that in the release. We're also seeing that again as you exit the quarter.\nSo we had a strong April in eCommerce. And this is a big contributor to the overall health of the eCommerce business with the 21% growth rate that has been in place for some time, which we are pleased to see. And then finally, adding together our stores, our first-party eCommerce business, our new automated fulfillment centers, distribution capabilities, our third-party business, and fulfillment services that has enabled us to have this ad business and data business, which has helped us mix out to achieve our first quarter of profitability in the United States.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please receive through your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGood morning, everyone. I know you talked about 50% growth in advertising and 15% in membership. Can you help reconcile those figures against what looks like just under 4% growth in the membership and other line in the P&L just so we can better understand the components there? And then secondly, now that eComm has turned positive, can you provide any color on the magnitude of losses you had incurred over the last, call it, year or two just so we can better understand the size of the profit improvement. Thanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc",
    "content2": "Sure. I'll take the question first on advertising, really pleased with the growth that we've seen there. It was inflated this period because we've got VIZIO in there versus comparing, I guess, a period that we don't. Our overall advertising on an apples-to-apples basis was 27%. We feel really good about that. On membership, we felt really good about the progress there. As I noted, we had international that grew north of 20%, both Sam's and US grew double-digits. The line that we have in our P&L includes other. It says membership and other, and that includes things like sustainability income. Think about recycling revenue, things like that. That's probably a larger figure than what some people expect. That's the reconciliation to, I think, the 4% number that you quoted there. Overall, membership is actually, it's really one of the shining points of the quarter.\nWe're doing really well there. eComm losses, I don't think I want to get into the magnitude of some of the losses that we've had historically. We've consistently, though, for years seen improvements there. You'd have to go back several years to see. The depth of sort of where losses topped out. But John and his team, and it's really all segments, so if you look at what Flipkart's doing in India, look at what Sam's has been doing, we've continued to see contribution profits be positive. With the digital platform, as you grow that at a positive contribution profit, you ultimately get to overall profitability, which is where we are today. You know, this is kind of a milestone moment for us as a company. Hopefully we don't talk about it every single quarter, but I think it's notable this quarter that we've reached this milestone, and we've achieved this level of profit, and we're looking forward to continuing to have that grow into the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Pleased to see you with your question.\n\nRobby Ohmes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you guys could talk, give a little more detail on general merchandise. You guys had deflation in general merchandise in the first quarter. Can you help us think about deflation versus inflation and tariffs. For the outlook here for the next three quarters? And also is there any, are there pretty significant differences between mix of general merchandise or changing in mix of general merchandise for in-store versus what you guys are doing in eCommerce?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nRobby, thanks for the question. I'll start, and some of the others may want to jump in. General merchandise has been deflationary for over a year right now, and we've seen the impact of that. And think of it as deflationary, inflationary, and low single-digits in the quarter. Importantly, though, we grew units in the quarter, so we continue to see progress there. You know, the consumer is pressured. We've seen for a couple years now a shift in the baskets away from general merchandise to those items that are more necessities versus discretionary. People are spending more on food. We'll continue to monitor that going forward. The team in particular has made really good progress on the assortment that we have advancing general merchandise. John, you want to.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nSure, sure. Robby, good morning. We did see strong growth in categories like toys, kids apparel, and our baby categories, and others across the business. We do have stronger growth rates in eCommerce. In the total, you can see that as well with 21% growth rates, which would reflect really a strong mix across categories. As we look at where we ended the quarter, we were softer in February. Just a reminder, we had really tough weather. It was lapping leap year. We had snow across the country, including the Southeast and on beaches across the Southeast. We had unusual weather in February.\nMentioned this earlier, March felt like more of a normalized month, closer to what we expected given the flip in leap year and a much later Easter. And the as we got to Easter holiday, the units strengthened pretty significantly. We reported this morning that we were slightly negative in general merchandise with deflation, but was really encouraged by the results that we had from the Easter holiday until the end of the quarter.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club\n\nYeah, in Sam's Club, we hit a positive quarter of GM sales back-to-back in a deflated environment, so units are the driver of that performance.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to strong momentum in the health and wellness category. I just want to get a sense of how you guys feel about the sustainability of the momentum? Ans then as you look at the pharmacy rollout, how is that trending versus expectation? And any sense of whether it's driving new customer acquisition at this point?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nHey, Rupesh. Thanks for the question. When we look at the pharmacy business and you saw in the reported results this morning growth in the mid-20s, when you strip out the impact of GLP-1s, we saw prescription growth over 10% growth in the quarter, which is very encouraging. That result is inclusive of market share gains, and it's driven by a few things. First, I would just like to compliment our pharmacists, our pharmacy techs, the team in the field who do such a great job, helping customers and patients with whatever they need help with.\nAnd then the second was the initiative of pharmacy delivery, which we launched in the first quarter, which has been helpful not only for customers to receive their prescriptions the way they want to receive them, but it has resulted in growth of new digital users in our eCommerce business. We've had a digital business with text message for some time where you could renew. Now that you can deliver, we see people signing up for an account on walmart.com in our app, and we're looking forward to being able to serve them in more ways across categories.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club\n\nI think it's worth mentioning that Sam's Club once again for the ninth year in a row won the J.D. Power Pharmacy Company of the Year, and the ex-GLP-1 growth is still double digits, so it's over 10%. We're feeling really good about that business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDavid Bellinger\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for the question. First one, just on understanding outcomes for Q2 are so wide on the guidance right now and you can't give us a definitive range there on profitability. Can you just walk us through your positioning on the full year guide? Why are you still confident to keep that range? Do you expect these wide swings you talked about on margins and operating income, could those be contained within the combined Q2 and Q3 timeframe? Just anything on the international and the momentum you're seeing there, especially on the operating income side? Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart Inc\n\nI'll start with the first part of your answer, then kick it over to Kath to talk about International. It's hard to predict. We don't know the level of tariffs or where the bilateral agreements are going to finalize at. We do know that we're probably going to be in a period in the second quarter. We're going to see more markups than normal. It's why Doug and others have mentioned that it's so important to get inventory right in this environment, because that reduces the likelihood of taking markdowns in the third quarter and potentially even into the fourth. It remains to be seen what the elasticity of demand is. It's something that's 30% higher or, in other cases, 10% higher in certain items. We'll have to see that. Got a really, really good team of merchants, and we have a lot of confidence in their ability to navigate this environment.\nFortunately or unfortunately, depending upon how you look at it, we've got some experience here from a couple of years ago, so we'll try to navigate this. As Doug said, I like our hand here. I think we can navigate this as well or better than anyone, but there's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of volatility. It's a dynamic and fluid environment, and we feel confident that we can land the year in the range that we've talked about. The swings from quarter to quarter are a little harder to predict, and we'll have to see how that comes.\n\nKathryn Mclay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nYeah, if I pick it up from there because definitely foreshadowed that we have swings by quarter in International when we're together in Dallas. If I was to characterize the quarter, I would say it was a good result, but I think we can still do better. I don't think my team would be surprised to hear me say that because I think that's the constant posture we typically have when I look across the composition of the market. We had a couple that had a weaker backdrop, which would be more Mexico and Canada. I think we made strategic investments in high growth markets like India. You heard Kalyan, our CEO at Flipkart, talk about that when we were together at ICM. I think we also had some choppy calendar results, leap year, Easter, et cetera.\nWhen I step back and kind of look at the overall results. I think we're in high growth markets, we've got really strong businesses, and we're in a leading omnichannel position in those markets. I think, you know, holistically still feel really good about leading the enterprise from a growth perspective and growing profit faster than sales across the full-year.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart Inc\n\nThis is Doug, it's probably worth just repeating one more time the point about retail accounting as it relates to the timing between Q2, Q3, Q4. In Q2, if we have a markup, we take it on all the inventory we have on hand, even if we don't sell it in that quarter and even if we don't ultimately sell at that price. You could get a situation where Q2 earnings look unusually high and the range of outcomes is wider, which is why we're not providing guidance for the quarter. Think about Q3 and Q4. Can you sell it at the price that you marked it up to? Yes or no? What do the resulting margins look like? How do you manage markdowns? How do you manage inventory effectively through the Q3 and Q4 period? There may be more markups in Q3 and Q4.\nWe don't know right now because this environment is so fluid. I hope that helps everybody. I just want to make sure that you all understand this is an accounting issue, a timing issue, but it ultimately boils down to how well do we forecast sales, manage inventory, and make quantity decisions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks for all the detail on the tariffs. I guess, Doug, I almost want to follow up on that last point. Given where we are today with the tariff rate, the 30% incremental China, and then the 10% seems to be the baseline, what's the time lag that you would expect to see that show up on the shelf? Is it three months? Six months is when the peak effect would be? There's another question. What's the sort of magnitude? Are we talking 50 or 100 bps if it had to pass through at current rates?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart Inc\n\nYeah. Greg, it happens gradually. As we mentioned earlier, you know, we started to see increases happen in April and through May. We've been really focused on back-to-school receipts. You know, when you have an imported item, you pay the tariff at the time it comes through customs, and so the cost is higher even if the tariff rate comes down later, the cost has been elevated. I wouldn't think of this as a moment-in-time necessarily, except when you think about seasonal things like back-to-school. I think it'll feel more gradual. As we've been saying to everyone, the first thing that goes through my mind is food inflation.\nYou know, we've been through a number of years here where prices have gone up on food, and our customers have felt that, and they don't want any more food inflation. What we hope happens is that there are changes from a policy point of view that help us get prices back. X tariffs on bananas and things that we don't grow here. Food inflation is very much on our mind. As it relates to GM, it'll vary by category. Which country is it? If it's from China, obviously it'll have a higher amount, and this reset-of-costs will play out through the year. We'll have seasonal items that'll be higher than they would have been otherwise. I think what we're looking at is upward pressure that began in April and plays through the entire year on things that are important.\nWe've been working for years to try and make sure that we've got surety-of-supply. We're sourcing from the right places, create a more flexible supply chain, and we've made progress on that. I think relative to others, we're well-positioned.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Broadlines and Grocery, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the evolution of marketplace, specifically, what your strategic priorities are for the current fiscal year as it relates to seller additions, where you are looking to expand the depth or breadth of the assortment? Just given the cost of tariffs, how are you thinking about general merchandise elasticity for the in-store business versus marketplace in the back half of the year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nHey Krisztina, it's John. I think the first thing that is important to note is we want to be flexible for our customers and deliver what they want, when they want it, however they want it to be delivered. What you'll see in the coming months, quarters, and years is a continued focus on expanding our assortment to be able to deliver our customers what they're looking for without the need of looking at another app or going to another location. Our supply chain capabilities that include our new next-generation fulfillment centers, our ability to use our stores for delivery in a very dense, local, low-cost way are all parts of the solution. To be able to serve customers flexibly, assortment would be first. Second, we want to ensure that we have the right suite-of-services available to our sellers.\nOur sellers need to know where their inventory is, their rate-of-sale. We have an application they can look at on their phone that tells them a lot of the critical information that they're going to need. Third, our sellers who are launching brands, developing brands, or selling someone else's product are looking for ways to connect to relevant customer cohorts that are interested in their product. Being able to use our data to help them access cohorts who are interested in their categories, and then advertise through Walmart Connect, is a big part of the solution that all of our sellers are going to need. In terms of elasticity, we watch elasticity, and we are constantly reforecasting quantities and placement. This is something that we do each and every day, every week, every month, every quarter.\nThere'll be a period here where we'll be watching this, and we are watching this very closely with much better tools and visibility to know what we own, where it is, and where it's moving. We'll continue to ensure that, just as we talked about earlier, the supply chains continue to flow. We're in stock for our customers in the store, at the counter, we have great quality produce and fresh. Finally, our fulfillment center inventory is placed well so that if a customer places an order, we'll be able to deliver it in a very fast manner and meet the promise that we told them.\n\nKathryn Mclay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nIf I can just chime in from an international perspective, we're very proud of the progress we're making, Flipkart. If I focus on our other marketplace businesses in Canada, Chile, and Mexico, our total Marketplace GMV grew over 30% year-on-year. A lot of that is because in this quarter we signed up over 4,000 new sellers in Mexico and Canada. We also launched Walmart Connect for our marketplace sellers in Canada, and we've seen really high engagement with that. Our SKU count grew over 80% in Canada and Mexico over this last quarter. A lot of upside and a lot of growth and momentum in our marketplace business across International.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. Doug?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart Inc\n\nThanks again for dialing in and asking great questions. We have momentum, and that momentum continues. We feel good about our ability to win with customers, to serve them how they want to be served. We're encouraged by the fact that eCommerce growth across all three segments continues to be strong, all three segments growing more than 20%. Secondarily, we're strengthening our business model, playing that through. Regardless of what's happening with tariffs, the 50% growth in advertising, the 15% growth in membership, I think, are really encouraging. Thirdly, as it relates to the short-term environment, we think we are positioned to manage this as well or better than anybody. We will do our best to serve our customers well, to help keep prices low. That's really important in an environment like this, and it's our purpose. That's what we're here to do.\nWe believe we can do that while continuing to execute the strategy, change the business model, and grow profit faster than sales. That's our consistent message, and we're confident in our plan.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart U.S.\n\nHey everyone. Welcome to The Hub. It's really great to be with you again. It's been a little while, but we have a really cool guest today. This is Azita Martin, and I want to talk about her in just a second. But the subject today is artificial intelligence. All of the new capabilities, products, the things that we're seeing around the world that are changing AI. And AI is changing so much of what all of us do and what we will do in the future. I thought that it would be a great time to have Azita here. Azita is an executive at NVIDIA who is all over the space in AI and chips and started in."

Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that concludes my intro. We're ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. We finished the year with another quarter of strong results. Our associates are doing a great job serving our customers and members. For the quarter, we had sales growth of 5.2%, and adjusted operating income was up 9.4% in constant currency. We continue to gain market share across countries and income levels. As with the first three quarters of the year, transaction counts and unit volumes were up across markets. As we look at our results for the quarter and the year, we're pleased to see, first, a healthy top line. We're strengthening our ability to serve people how they want to be served in the moment. That's what's driving our growth. Our prices are low, and we're becoming more convenient.\nCustomers are shopping with us more often and buying more items, including in general merchandise categories, which were up low single digits in Walmart US and Sam's US for the quarter. Second, we're growing profit faster than sales, and we have runway to scale our higher-margin businesses like membership, marketplace, and advertising. We're mixing ourselves up while simultaneously investing in lower prices and associate wages. Third, we're able to improve ROI even as we invest higher levels of capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see to strengthen the company. All three segments of our business had a good year. I'm proud of our leaders and all of our associates. They earned it. They're learning, they're acting fast, and they're working hard. For the quarter and the year, we're pleased with our performance during the holiday seasons around the world.\nWe performed well in the US, Mexico, Canada, and in China, where Sam's Club just wrapped up a strong Lunar New Year. We also performed well in India, and I'd like to share the news that PhonePe, our fintech business, is making preparations for an IPO in India. Our PhonePe team has long aspired to be a public company, and we're excited to be taking these early steps. As a company, we drove a lot of volume during the holidays and ended with our inventory level in good shape, up 2.8%. As always, we're working hard to help bring down prices. In Walmart US last year, we had over 22,000 rollbacks. We're wired to help people save money and live better. The work we're doing to expand our assortment is another reason for our growth, as more customers are finding what they're looking for.\nIn addition to low prices and a growing assortment to choose from, we're focused on delivery speed and accuracy. If I could change anything about how we're perceived today, it'd be that more people know about our breadth of assortment online and our increasing delivery speed. For Walmart US, we recently announced same-day pharmacy delivery, and the early response has been strong. Customers love being able to get a basket of items delivered to their door that includes fresh, frozen, general merchandise, and now pharmacy. And because we're so close to them, they can get it fast. Sam's Club recently launched a new shipping offer, including free same or next-day delivery from the club. Members asked for it, and the team delivered.\nListening to our members and solving for what they want is a big reason why Sam's was recently ranked number one in customer satisfaction for retailers in the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index. Around the world, we're making great progress on delivering goods faster to customers and members. We're taking learnings from markets like China and quickly standing up fast delivery solutions in other markets. We continue to be excited about our investments in supply chain automation, and we'll share even more on that topic during our Investor Conference in April. These past few quarters, we've talked about how we're using AI. The progress we've made over the years with technology has put us in a position to leverage today's fast-moving capabilities closer to real time. I'm very proud of Suresh, our tech team, and all our leaders for how they're leaning in to adapt quickly.\nToday, I'd like to share two more examples. The first is related to a new AI agent for our merchants called Wally. Wally's learning to help us get to the root cause of issues related to things like out-of-stocks or overstocks with more accuracy and speed. Second, for developers on our tech team, we now have new coding assistants and completion tools that are helping streamline deployments and deliver code faster with fewer bugs. Last year, these tools helped us save about four million developer hours. This year, we plan to make these tools available to all developers in North America and India. As we become more productive and reduce the amount of time we work on routine tasks, that gives us time to develop tools that help us grow the business and move faster. I love how we're changing how we think and work without changing who we are.\nI can see us getting faster. Earlier this year, we began opening some of our new home office buildings in Bentonville. We'll be transitioning to the new home office throughout the year. It's an exciting time. It's also a time to remember the special things about this company that we want to strengthen and perpetuate. Moving to a new location doesn't change who we are. Cultural characteristics like servant leadership, humility, and a sense of urgency remain critical. Operating with an Everyday Low Cost culture and mindset is as important as ever. We have a meaningful purpose of saving people money and helping them to live better. And we have a set of timeless values that shape our culture regardless of the address of our home office. Characteristics and beliefs like these drive our results and make us unique.\nI hope you'll come see our home office when you visit during our Associates and Shareholders Week in June and that you'll feel the momentum. We know who we are, and we like where we're going. We feel like we're just getting started. Here's John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. I'm excited to discuss our Q4 and full-year performance, provide some context on how we're executing against our strategic priorities, and offer our outlook for Q1 and full fiscal year 2026. Let's start with the headline. Walmart delivered another strong quarter, exceeding our sales, profit, and earnings expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our business model and the dedicated work of our associates around the globe. Our focus remains on delivering value to customers and members while driving sustainable growth for shareholders. Customers continue to respond to our value proposition as we provide lower prices, a broader assortment, and greater levels of convenience. With improved customer experience, we're earning their trust and seeing share gains as a result. Looking at the full year, consolidated revenue grew 5.6% in constant currency, adding approximately $36 billion versus last year.\nAdjusted operating income increased nearly 10% in constant currency, and adjusted EPS was up 13%. Currency was a headwind to reported sales of approximately $3.2 billion, or 50 basis points to growth, and pressured EPS by about $0.02. Our business model is delivering as it's designed to do. This is the second consecutive year that we've grown sales more than 5% and operating income meaningfully faster. Relative to our plan, outperformance has been broad-based across segments. E-commerce economics continue to improve, most notably in Walmart US. Our newer digital businesses have contributed to faster growth and more diversification of our product mix. Over the last year, global advertising grew 27% to about $4.4 billion. Walmart US marketplace revenue grew 37%, with nearly 45% of orders fulfilled by WFS. And lastly, global membership income grew 21% to about $3.8 billion.\nOver our planning horizon, the growth of this portfolio is expected to be one of the largest drivers of operating income growing faster than sales. These new profit streams allow us to fund investments in our core business while also expanding our operating margins. Return on Investment improved approximately 50 basis points to 15.5%, a level last achieved in 2016. CapEx totaled $23.8 billion. Our investments in stores and clubs through remodels and new construction have improved customer and member experience and have enabled us to broaden our last-mile catchment area for digital orders. Investments in supply chain automation and productivity are expected to lower our cost to serve, which supports our EDLP commitment. Cash flow remains strong, and as we announced this morning, we're pleased to raise the dividend by 13% this year, the largest increase in over a decade, reinforcing our commitment to strong cash returns to shareholders.\nOur business has transformed over the past five years, and we're benefiting from the investments we've made in our core omni-retail business. Global e-commerce penetration is now 18% of sales, about 1,100 basis points higher than it was in FY20. In the US specifically, we've built marketplace capabilities to broaden our assortment while also growing the average number of e-commerce orders fulfilled from stores by over 500 million orders without new store growth during that time period. We're utilizing our stores in new ways to serve more customers and maximize returns, but we obviously don't have a stores-only approach for fulfillment. We're growing our fulfillment center capacity, including through investments in FC automation in parallel.\nWhile the shift in channel mix creates some cost pressure as we fulfill more orders through eCommerce, we've seen improved profitability during this period with efficiencies gained as we densify our delivery routes and with the contributions from newer businesses that are enabled by eCommerce growth. We've achieved this despite the margin pressure from merchandise category mix of sales shifting toward grocery and health and wellness and away from general merchandise as consumer wallets have been stretched over the past couple of years. The way we've designed and grown our evolving business model with more diversified and durable sources of profit like advertising and membership has enabled us to grow operating income faster than sales despite these headwinds. Turning to our quarterly performance, for Q4, consolidated revenue increased more than 5% in constant currency driven by strong results across segments, aided by 16% eCommerce growth.\nCurrency headwinds reduced reported sales by over $2 billion, or 120 basis points of growth. Walmart US comp sales increased 4.6%, including e-commerce sales growth of 20%, with ongoing share gains across categories. Comp growth was led by increased customer transactions in both stores and e-commerce. Grocery remains a standout category with mid-single-digit growth, and we saw mid-teens growth in health and wellness due largely to GLP-1 sales, which contributed about a point to the segment comp, consistent with prior quarters. We're encouraged by the improvement in general merchandise, where we had low single-digit comp sales growth for the second consecutive quarter, including strength in hard lines, toys, home, and fashion. US customers remain resilient, exhibiting behaviors that have been largely consistent over the past year. As always, people are looking for value, and they want to save time. Becoming more convenient is helping to drive our growth.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded our store-fulfilled delivery catchment areas to now reach 93% of US households with same-day delivery. The popularity of expedited delivery has resulted in more than 30% of orders coming from customers and members that elected to pay a convenience fee to receive their scheduled delivery in less than one hour or less than three hours. We're also encouraged by the initial response to our launch of same-day pharmacy delivery. We're the first to integrate pharmacy, general merchandise, and grocery in a single online order and have gained new pharmacy customers with this service. Our focus on bringing down pricing through rollbacks continues despite pockets of food inflation in areas like eggs, bacon, and ground beef. Like-for-like pricing in general merchandise and consumables was deflationary, while food remained inflationary in the low single digits.\nWe're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of share gains. Our international business in constant currency delivered sales growth of 5.7%, reflecting strength in China, Walmart, and Canada, while operating income grew faster. We saw positive traffic and unit growth across markets, with sales strength in general merchandise during festive events. As expected, the timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event negatively affected year-over-year sales comparisons. Outside of India, e-commerce sales grew more than 20% across all markets. Speed of delivery continues to be important to customers. In the past 12 months, international delivered over 2.3 billion items same day or next day, which is an increase of over 30%, with about 45% of those items delivered in under three hours. Our business in China continued to grow double digits with strength in Sam's Club and e-commerce.\nSam's Club US comp sales ex-fuel increased 6.8%, with strong growth in transaction and unit volumes, including increased penetration of Member's Mark. E-commerce grew 24%, including triple-digit growth in club-fulfilled delivery as new perks like express delivery and the elimination of curbside pickup fees for the club membership level continued to resonate with members. With tech-enabled convenience prevalent both inside the club through Scan & Go and Jesco exit towers, as well as via e-commerce, we're deploying digital solutions to differentiate ourselves in the warehouse club channel. From a margin standpoint, consolidated gross margin expanded 53 basis points. In our press release and earnings presentation, you'll see new disclosure regarding gross margins by segment.\nIn Walmart US, improved gross margins reflected strong inventory management, as well as lower levels of markdowns and improvement in business mix that has allowed us to manage pricing aligned to competitive price caps and offset sustained merchandise category mix pressure. Gross margins in international benefited from the timing shift of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event. As our business model evolves, it's encouraging to see our profitability improve from a diverse set of offerings. Globally, e-commerce economics continued to improve in Q4, aided by an approximately 20% reduction in US net delivery costs per order. We also continued to diversify our profit composition through business mix as we scaled advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights. Our global advertising business increased 29%, led by 24% growth from Walmart Connect in the US.\nWe're making good progress on expanding the number of US marketplace sellers that also utilize Walmart Connect advertising, with seller advertising counts up about 50% versus last year. We're also excited about the addition of Vizio and its SmartCast operating system to our portfolio of advertising capabilities. Vizio will help us serve customers in new ways to enhance their shopping journeys while also creating new opportunities for advertisers to connect with customers and boost product discovery, empowering brands to realize greater impact from their advertising spend with Walmart. Membership income was up 16% across the enterprise. In the US, Sam's Club continued to grow membership count and increase its penetration of Plus members, resulting in more than 12% membership income growth, while Walmart+ membership income grew double digits.\nWithin international, membership income from Sam's Club China grew more than 35% as member counts continued to increase, helped by the opening of four new clubs in Q4. For marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services in the US, marketplace grew 34%, continuing the strong trends we've seen all year. With the broader assortment of the general merchandise brands and items customers want, marketplace sales in home management, automotive, and seasonal all grew more than 20%. And with our low-cost fulfillment offering for sellers, WFS penetration reached record highs of nearly 50%, which is up nearly 600 basis points versus last year. Outside the US, we're seeing similar encouraging trends in both Mexico and Canada. The number of WFS sellers increased over 20%, and sales of items delivered through WFS grew over 85%. Within data analytics and insights, Walmart Data Ventures continues to grow rapidly, with net sales up double digits.\nOur client base nearly doubled over the past year, and we're excited about continuing to broaden our reach to new markets with the launch of the platform in Canada. SG&A expenses deleveraged 46 basis points in the quarter. Walmart US deleverage was primarily driven by the timing of tech investments, increased variable pay as we exceeded planned performance, and higher marketing and utilities costs. Transaction-related expenses for the Vizio acquisition also impacted the quarter and were not considered in our guidance. In addition, international was impacted by the timing shift of Flipkart's BBD event. Sam's Club US was affected by the previously announced wage investments. While wage investments will pressure profit at Sam's for a couple of quarters, we're pleased with the member response tied to increased renewals, as well as the improvement in associate turnover.\nWe're continuing to optimize our business to deliver greater efficiency, and we're committed to balancing ongoing investments with improved returns for customers, associates, and shareholders. Our business model provides the ability to fund wage investments for associates and price investments for customers while also delivering on our financial framework. Summarizing the quarter, in constant currency, sales grew over 5% and adjusted operating income grew more than 9%, both exceeding the upper bound of our guided ranges. Adjusted EPS of $0.66 compared favorably to our expectations and reflected strong underlying business performance and lower tax expense. Reported EPS included headwinds of approximately $0.01 from currency and nearly $0.01 from cost related to the acquisition of Vizio. Now let me turn to guidance. We've been operating in a highly dynamic backdrop for several years, and we expect this year to be no different.\nOur outlook assumes a relatively stable macroeconomic environment, but acknowledges that there are still uncertainties related to consumer behavior and global economic and geopolitical conditions. As a result, we've taken a similar approach to our initial guidance view for the year as we have in the past couple of years, balancing known risk with what we can control. We remain confident that Walmart is well-positioned to navigate as it has over the last several years while continuing to deliver value for customers and shareholders alike. For fiscal year 2026, we expect consolidated net sales growth of approximately 3% to 4%, including the negative impact from lapping leap year and the favorable contribution from Vizio sales.\nOperating income is projected to grow faster than sales at 3.5% to 5.5%, including 150 basis points of negative impacts for the Vizio acquisition related to integration investments and transition costs, as well as from lapping leap year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.50 to 2.60. This includes a headwind from currency of approximately $0.05 per share and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Recall that we guide sales and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Volatility in currency rates had a meaningful impact on last year's results.\nIf current exchange rates were to prevail for the full year, we would expect a headwind of approximately 100 basis points to sales growth and approximately 150 basis points to operating income growth, with more significant headwinds in the first half given the degree of change in exchange rates versus last year. We expect CapEx to range between 3% and 3.5% of sales as we invest in technology to optimize our supply chain, remodel stores, and open new stores and clubs in both the US and certain international markets. For Q1, it's important to note that our year-over-year comparisons can have an outsized impact on quarterly growth rates. We expect consolidated net sales growth of 3% to 4% in constant currency.\nThis includes the negative effect of approximately 100 basis points to sales growth from lapping leap year and accounts for the shift in Easter timing from Q1 into Q2 in our international portfolio, namely Walmart. Operating income is projected to grow 0.5% to 2% in constant currency, including the approximately 70 basis points headwind from the Vizio acquisition, as well as the 250 basis points headwind to growth from lapping leap day. Our operating income guidance also takes into account the Easter timing shift in lapping last year's consumer stimulus timing in Q1 for Walmart. All of these items affect the year-over-year growth rates, but let me emphasize, our core business is still performing very strong. On a two-year stack basis, the midpoint of our guidance would suggest operating income growth of 15%.\nReflecting strength and consistency in the underlying business, we expect enterprise net sales and operating income growth to be relatively consistent across quarters after adjusting for calendar impacts. Additionally, we expect first half sales and operating income to grow in the range of our full-year guidance. Notably, if current exchange rates were to stay where they are for the entire Q1, we would expect a headwind of approximately 150 basis points to sales growth and approximately 250 basis points to operating income growth. Q1 EPS range is expected to be $0.57 to 0.58. This includes a headwind from currency of approximately $0.02 per share and a higher effective tax rate versus last year.\nAs we've said in the past, the relationship of operating income growing faster than sales may not occur every quarter, but we expect the framework to hold on an annual basis at the enterprise level. Before I turn it over to questions, I want to take a moment to thank our associates around the world for their hard work this past quarter and throughout fiscal year 2025. Their dedication and commitment to serving our customers and members every day is what makes Walmart such a special company. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2026, and I speak for the whole team here, we're incredibly excited about our business. It's not to say that there aren't challenges ahead, but our strategy is the right one. This team is executing on it. We're serving our customers and members better than ever before, and our associates and shareholders are benefiting.\nAnd yet, in some ways, it feels like we're just getting started. We appreciate your interest in our company and are now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, you may press Star one from your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone to indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. So that we may address questions to as many participants as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\n\nMichael Lassen\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question.Over the last several quarters, as Walmart was in the early stages of generating returns from the longer-term investments that it's been making, it appeared that the company was more insulated to the macro as it was gaining significant market share. Now, is Walmart entering a phase where there's just simply more economic sensitivity to the model, or perhaps even less of a countercyclical benefit? And how is this factored into the sales and EPS guidance for 2026? And if this macroeconomic sensitivity results in a sales shortfall, what will be the course of action? It may be helpful to frame this with some insight into how the exit rate for fiscal 2025 unfolded. Thank you very much.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHey, Michael, this is Doug. I'll respond quickly and then hand it over to John David. Basically, we feel the same way we have been feeling. Customers, members, are going to be looking for value. They're going to be looking for convenience. The changes that we're making in the company continue to have us appealing to them in those respects in an even better way. So our confidence level is high. I'm really pleased to see such a strong quarter. Being up five and up nine on the bottom line feels really good. Great to see that the momentum is still there. Stores and clubs still driving volume. E-commerce changes are happening. So I think it's really consistent in terms of our view of how we look at the external environment.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Michael, this is John David. With respect to the sensitivity of our model to the macro environment, I hope investors think differently about Walmart because our customers and members are telling us that they do. We're not just known for value.\nWe're also increasingly known for convenience. Our business is performing well. You asked about how we exited the year. January was actually our strongest comp in the US business. But this increased relevance translates into improved financial performance for us as well. As we grow these digital businesses like e-commerce, the incremental margins in our e-commerce business globally for us in the quarter were 11%, over twice the rate of what our overall margin is. But let me address what is maybe the question behind the question as it relates to the outlook for next year. Our business outperformed on virtually every operational and financial metric in the quarter. We feel like we're performing exceptionally well. The guidance that we provided, we feel, is very consistent with what we've done in prior years.\nKeep in mind, each of the last two years, we've guided operating income of 4% to 6% growth annually. This year, if you normalize for the effect of leap day and the Vizio transaction, our guidance suggests an outlook of 5% to 7%. That reflects how we all feel about this business. We're really excited about what the year holds for us and what we can do there. We're one month into the year, so I think it's prudent to have an outlook that is somewhat measured. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. There is certainly some unpredictability in any environment that we have, but we feel really good about our ability to navigate that. We feel really good about our relevance with customers, and we feel really good about how our business model is changing to inflect our profits upwards.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, when you take that noise out of the guidance, you can see that we're stepping things up a bit. I think that reflects our confidence. To be in the position we're in right now with this momentum on the top line, the bottom line, and inventory levels being so healthy, we feel like we're in a great spot to start the year. The 2.8% increase in inventory is what we would want. Our in-stock levels look good. We did pull a little bit forward around the edges, but we're selling through that stuff quickly. So really in a good place to begin February.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate Mcshane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You had mentioned in the prepared comments that gross margins are still being impacted by mix. How should we think about the mixed impact to gross margin in this upcoming fiscal year, especially as general merchandise growth continues to improve? And just as a second question to that, for your alternative revenue businesses, have any of those businesses now reached scale? And if not, would you expect them to reach scale in fiscal year 2025? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nI think we got a lot of room to run on the newer businesses. I mean, you can see our shares are really low. It would be great to have general merchandise be strong. You guys might want to comment a little bit on what you're seeing right now.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nSure. Sure. Good morning, Kate. It's John. Thanks for the question.\nI would just start by saying I'm really proud of our associates and our team for the quarter that they just had, up 4.6% that compares to 4% a year ago, and really excited about the way they're taking care of customers, momentum that they have. In terms of mix, we did have in the material that we are encouraged by the recent couple quarters in general merchandise. We're seeing better sales, better units. We're seeing unit flow through all across the box, which is great. We measure ourselves in units to ensure that we're delivering for customers. Doug mentioned inventory performance being up just about 3%. We're really pleased with that performance. As mentioned, our in-stock is better. Selling through and seasonal sell-through has been really strong the last couple quarters, which has helped our gross margin. Obviously, that results in savings of markdowns.\nOn pricing, I would just say, again, thanks to the team. We have over 5,800 rollbacks in stores today. Over 1,000 of those are new in just the last couple weeks. So we remain focused on value, and I think we're in a really good position to be able to deliver flexibly for customers any way they want to deliver. And the team has done a great job understanding all the moving pieces and how they build that into the cost structure. And I'm really proud of the way the team's position going into this year.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nDeputy CFO, CFO for Walmart International and, CFO of the US segment, Walmart\n\nYeah, I think Chris Nicholas here, Kate. What I would say is we are seeing a lot of momentum. John David talked about January being the strongest month of the quarter, and we saw the same thing too.\nWe're investing across the member value proposition, and it's really paying dividends and making it easier through digital engagement, making it easier through the member experience we're creating to buy everything you want, whether it's groceries, whether it's consumables, whether it's general merchandise, or apparel. We see it all resonating. It's interesting. We're seeing our third quarter of GM comp growth, even though it's still a little deflated. Units are running ahead of comps, and we're seeing strength in TVs, technology, and apparel. We're seeing good strength on incredible items at incredible value. It's not getting old.\n\nKath McLay\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nYeah, and I would just say across international, as I look at kind of GM sales, we had really strong GM sales in Q4, particularly in events. If I look across Mexico and Canada, we saw really strong response from our customers. We had our largest sales day ever in Walmart during El Fin Irresistible. A lot of the sales that we saw, particularly, were coming through GM and apparel. So happy with how that's all mixing out.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nKate, this is John David. We obviously have a lot to say about this since we're all talking, but I want to directly answer your question. Over the last year, the mix change for general merchandise in our business was down about 100 basis points. We're assuming this year it's about half of that. But we're quite excited about what we're doing in general merchandise. One of the things that we didn't mention was the benefit that our marketplace is providing there. We have categories in our marketplace business like automotive, toys, patio that are all growing north of 20%.\nSo these are good examples of things that are specific to Walmart, and maybe not just a general macro effect of customers maybe not having their wallet stretched as much, but things that we're doing to provide better assortment, where our customers are buying more general merchandise.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. My question is on reinvesting and growing the business faster. It was mentioned that the e-commerce incremental margins were 11. It looks like the enterprise in Q4 was seven. We think there's upward pressure on this over time. So the idea of reinvesting at a healthy rate and growing earnings faster, you can clearly do both, which Doug called out a couple of years ago. The question is, why not invest faster?\nBecause if incremental margins are rising, then top-of-funnel things like marketing and plus and anything related to e-commerce should be even more profitable and higher returns. I think John David said we're leaning in a little bit. If you can speak to that and then talk about this debate of investing at a faster rate.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nSimeon, thanks for the question. I feel that we're striking the right balance right now between investment and margin expansion. There are some table stakes items in our business, and that's investing in price, investing in our associates. We're always going to do that. Over the more recent years, we've invested a lot in our technology platform as well as supply chain automation. But those investments are actually driving the improvements that you see in our results this quarter.\nYou don't deliver the bottom line at twice the rate of growth as the top line without some of these investments that we've made. So as we look forward into the coming years, we certainly see the type of opportunity and incremental margins that we've had this quarter and maybe even something beyond that. But we can do that while investing for the business. We don't want to get overly focused on one quarter's performance at the expense of investing for the long term. We're trying to build a great company here, continue to build a great company, and drive these kinds of returns for a long period of time, and that requires investment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Doug and John David, you framed the 5% to 7% constant currency EBIT growth, kind of excluding the noise from the Vizio and leap year. It is consistent or maybe even slightly better than the past few years originally, but it does seem a little conservative relative to what you achieved this year and to the momentum you have in the business. So I was wondering if you could just touch on two factors, a couple of factors. One, the tariffs and just what you're assuming and how the consumer responds to that, how you're planning on passing that through, and if that is assumed to be any sort of headwind to earnings this year. And then also the demand for expedited orders that you're seeing, that continues, I think, to be helping the eCommerce profitability.\nAre you assuming that that continues at the same pace or any changes there on that front?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, let me talk a little bit about tariffs and expedited orders. John David, then turn it over to you. As we've been saying, tariffs are something we've managed for many years, and we'll just continue to manage that. We've got a great team. We know how to do that. We can't predict what will happen in the future, but we can manage it really well. And we're wired to try and save people money. So that'll be our ultimate goal. And as it relates to delivery speed, it's important. And we're seeing behavior with our customers and members around the world that causes us to be excited about what's possible. And having these assets so close to people is such a big advantage.\nAnd the stores are doing a great job of improving order quality and delivering with speed. And I think that will just get better and better as things go through the year. We will have, as kind of Simeon was pointing to, flexibility. We manage the year. We don't just start the year with a plan and execute the plan. Things change. I mean, look at what's happening with generative AI right now and the opportunity to build code in different ways. We've got opportunities to save money, get faster. And we're making fluid decisions about how much we invest in technology, what do we put into wages and where, what needs to be done on prices this week.\nAnd to have the business model be morphing the way it is just gives us the room to be able to do what we want to do strategically and manage the business for the mid and longer term, not just the short term, while we deliver results each quarter, growing profit faster than sales.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nKelly, a couple of things. We don't have any explicit assumption in our guidance around tariffs. We feel like we'll be able to navigate that. Will it turn out differently than maybe what we expect today, perhaps? And we feel good about our ability to do that, though. With respect to the guidance, look, I think similar to last year, the last couple of years, very consistently, we have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time. And we don't want to get out over our skis here.\nThere's a lot of the year to play out. Again, we feel good about our ability to navigate the environment, whether it's tariffs or other macro uncertainty. On delivery with eCommerce, overall, you're continuing to see this diversification of our business that is improving our profitability. The newer businesses, and by newer businesses, I'll just suggest like advertising, membership, WFS, and some of those categories, they contributed to over half of the operating income growth this quarter. So you're seeing this change in our business as we leverage more of these digital channels. A lot of the faster growing parts of our business are the higher margin ones. Densification of our network is one.\nSo you're seeing as more customers avail themselves of the services that we provide, same-day delivery, things like that, and even paying for that if they want it within one hour or three hours, that's continued to improve our e-commerce profitability. Just in the US alone, just in the US alone, we saw an 80% improvement in the level of e-commerce losses in the last year. So we feel really good about how the business is changing here.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nThis omnichannel position really is an advantage. We're still seeing curbside growth. We're seeing in-store, in-club growth, and we've got this growth in delivery. And being able to do all of those things all the time is a big advantage.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director of Broadline and Hardline, Gordon Haskett\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter and a great year. I was hoping you could discuss what you're seeing in Walmart+ membership and whether that's accelerated or held steady in recent quarters, and then how much of the growth in Walmart+ is being driven by Walmart+ Assist. And then separately, can you talk about the underlying assumptions you have in the next year for like-for-like inflation, both in grocery and within general merchandise? Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\npresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nHey, Chuck. Good morning. It's John Furner. Good to talk to you. Continue to be excited about Walmart+. We've had consistent growth over the last couple of years, last couple of quarters. The number of deliveries and the number of orders they're placing continue to rise, which is great to see. I just want to pick up one point we were talking about with the last question with fast delivery and then our same-day.\nOur deliveries are under three hours and under one hour. We grew 180% year on year, which is really exciting. So we see that offer continue to grow. And a large part of that offer is Walmart+ members. So + members are seeing the value. We see the repeat rates coming through. Our same-day delivery over five billion units last year, over 100% growth for the year. And then the third thing that we mentioned this morning, which is really exciting to see how strongly it started, is our pharmacy delivery program. We are seeing a lot of members and customers participate in this program. We think this will have a lot of momentum as the year goes. And it's exciting to see the number of customers who are building baskets while they have their prescription delivered.\nThat's true for both acute prescriptions where maybe you have a sick child and you need groceries with it, or it's your regular prescription. So that's exciting to see. Then the second part of your question in terms of inflation, we planned a very, I'd say, normalized year. I know this is 1% to 2%. There will always be some anomalies like what we're seeing right now with eggs as a result of avian flu last fall. Those things tend to work themselves out over time. So we don't have a large inflation number planned into this year.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nDeputy CFO, CFO for Walmart International and, CFO of the US segment, Walmart\n\nYeah, maybe. I know, Chuck, you didn't ask about it, but seeing as we're talking about membership, membership in Sam's Club is at all-time highs as are renewal rates. And the reason for that is because of our incredible associates, and because we're investing across the member value proposition.\nSo our first-year renewal rates this year are up hundreds of basis points. And so when we've talked to you all about the associate investments and the wage investments, we're seeing that paying dividend with turnover down 1,700 basis points year on year. So yeah, good things still to come for Sam's Club too.\n\nKath McLay\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nAnd then if you think about membership from an international flavor, if I look at Sam's Club, we're a straight membership. Membership income grew there by over 35% this year. So a strong resonating CVP with the Sam's Club China business. But we also think about membership from a know-your-customer perspective. And over the last year, we launched a program called Beneficios in Mexico, and we have had over 45 million customers sign up for that, which enables us to know them, to enable us to also personalize services and offerings to them.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question has come from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, DA Davidson Companies\n\nGreat. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the overall consumer environment, what you're seeing. I think after last call, it was right after the election, you had said that there was a little bit more consumer confidence after the election. Doug, in December, you had said something about storm clouds lifting or something along those lines. Are you still seeing that? Has anything changed in the last couple of months? It seems like the environment maybe has gotten a little bit more volatile. And related to that, I know this is asked a lot, but I'll ask it again. The rollback number of 5,800 seemed to be a little bit less than it was in the last few quarters. Remind us how we think about that. I don't think it's that you're investing less in price, but love to hear that explanation again. Thanks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nMike, this is Doug. Let me clarify the storm clouds thing. What I said was we had seen clouds on the horizon, and they never came. I kind of feel that same way right now. We're just seeing a lot of consistency.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nDeputy CFO, CFO for Walmart International and, CFO of the US segment, Walmart\n\nDoug, I agree with the consumer environment. Very consistent. We mentioned the word resilient. MIX has shifted slightly throughout the year, but really encouraged by the trends we saw in the last couple of quarters. So we're optimistic given all the things that we've done to improve our strategy. Working in omni is an exciting way to work on behalf of customers.\nWhat that means is we'll be ready to fulfill customers' wants and needs any way they want to, whether it's in the store, at the curb, or at their home. We're seeing growth rates across those. So we're ready for any environment. This is a team that's experienced. They've been through a lot of changes in the economy the last five to 10 years, and they know how to manage things really well. So we'll react accordingly. But again, we see a consistent, resilient consumer.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, thanks, guys. You mentioned seeing lower markdowns in the fourth quarter. Curious how that came in relative to your plan, and also what you assume about the promotional landscape for F26, whether you build in significant price investment into your guidance. And just remind us how that all shook out this year versus what you thought coming into the year. Then just a bigger picture question. You mentioned some increased investment in Canada a few weeks back. Just curious how you view the long-term opportunity of that market. Thanks.\n\nJohn Furner\n\npresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nThis is John. Let me pick up the question on margins markdowns first. It's really important for us that we control and manage our inventory based on what our customers are wanting to buy, the teams, and the supply chain and stores, fulfillment centers that are really nice job flowing inventory. We've made a number of improvements with technology, both in-store and across the supply chain, to have a really accurate understanding of what we have, where it is, how quickly we can deploy that inventory for customers.\nSo the results did show an increase in gross margin that we're proud of, but there's some pieces there that are important. There's gross margin for merchandise. There are also some other things in there, like ad revenues and some things that increase margin that are part of our newer businesses, our new digital services. So our core margins, our core markdown management, we're proud of the way that we've managed that. I feel great about inventory going into this year. The number of 1,500 rollbacks is a large number of rollbacks historically. That'll fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, we've added about 1,000 the last few weeks. We're prepared for all sorts of environments, whether it's more promotional or less promotional. We're going to focus on value for our customers, and we're going to do everything we can do to control prices and keep prices low.\n\nKath McLay\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart International, Walmart",
    "content2": "If I pick up on Canada, I would say we're pleased with the top-line growth we're getting in Canada, but one of the real highlights for me has been the e-com performance, which has been up 30%. Their growth has accelerated every quarter over the last year. So we are seeing our offering in Canada really resonating with the customer. We're focused on value. We were able to offer a Canadian Thanksgiving lunch for CAD 40, CAD 40 for four people. Really leaning into making sure we have the price positioning right, but also the customers really responding from a convenience perspective. We're excited about the business we have in Canada.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Vizio. Could you talk about some of the details around the dilution that you've embedded here, and then perhaps discuss plans to integrate that? How do you expect to leverage their platform? And in general, as you think about Walmart Connect, pretty incredible momentum there. You've been really disciplined in building that out. I'm just curious, how do you think about the growth outlook? Thanks so much.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nSure, Seth. We're really excited about having the Vizio team join Walmart and what that new platform will do for our customers. We do have some dilution related to the transaction cost with that in Q1, about 70 basis points. But we expect this transaction to begin being accretive to Walmart next year. So this will create new channels for us to reach out to our customers and allow them to avail themselves of all the things that Walmart and Sam's provides. But John, you want to add anything else?\n\nJohn Furner\n\npresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nSure, sure. I'm really excited about the addition of Vizio to the Walmart family. I've known William and the team for a long time, and it's just great to have them a part of the team. The operating system in Vizio is an impressive operating system. It works with very little friction. It's easy to set up and install. I have several of these personally, and I've acquired more since we started talking about this acquisition. I'm just really pleased with the way it works. For the Walmart Connect business to have more ways to distribute advertising for sellers and suppliers, that's really exciting for them. We hope to be able to do that in a very efficient way. So we're starting the process of integration, and over this next year, we'll be working on bigger plans for the brand as the teams get more time to work together.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Zihan Mott with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, thank you very much for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow up on the e-commerce side. If you could just help us understand what are the top three drivers of you improving e-commerce profitability between the alternative revenue streams and also reducing core e-commerce costs. And you mentioned retail media membership kind of driving more than 50% of EBIT growth. Are you able to share what proportion of EBIT dollars are now coming from the high-margin alternative revenue streams? Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nLet me give you a couple of data points here, starting with the last part of your question. So if you just take advertising and membership, just those two categories, that was a little more than a quarter of the overall operating income for us in the quarter. So really encouraged about these new parts of our business. In terms of the drivers of e-commerce profitability, in no particular order, there are a few things that I would call out. One is the densification of our network. So think of this as one of our drivers, instead of delivering a package to one house on a street, is now hitting four or five houses on that street. So we're able to spread those costs over more volume. As more customers come to us, this is really improving the unit economics here.\nThe second area would be the fact that over 30% of our customers that are having something delivered from a store are paying something extra to have that delivered within one hour or three hours. On Christmas Eve, 77% of the orders were this express-type delivery. So that certainly helps with the unit economics there. And the third area are these newer parts of our business, like membership, like advertising, that continue to have a lot of runway and improve our margins.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start just with a follow-up on that question around e-com economics. So incremental margin of around 11%, obviously good margin. But what does that look like over time? Does that grow? How do we think about e-com overall returning to profitability, or I should say attaining profitability? And then as we look out over time, in addition to that, just kind of curious, issues like immigration, how are you thinking about that? Any impact that you think that might have this year?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nEd, this is Doug. When you look at the second P&L, as we've described it, it ends up being more profitable than the first P&L. First P&L being kind of the traditional retail store P&L. When you put together e-commerce components like membership, advertising, and data monetization, all the things that we get to do as we scale an e-commerce business, it's both first-party and third-party, by the way. It just lifts the overall operating income percentage of the business, and that's what's happening.\nSo the key is keep the foot on the gas as it relates to e-commerce growth, serving people how they want to be served. And as I mentioned a minute ago, the great thing about omni is however someone wants to shop in the moment, we can help them. You want to go to a store or club, we're there and we're close to you. You want to do curbside pickup, you can. You want to get delivered in a variety of forms, we can do that too. As it relates to immigration, it hasn't been anything that's impacted us in any way that we could share anything interesting. It's a non-event for us so far.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobert Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, thanks for taking my question. I think this might be for John David Rainey. Just operating expenses delivered, I think it was 50-plus basis points in Q4, excluding the opioid settlement. Can you just help us tell us how we should think about the SG&A ratio for Walmart, the puts and takes for opportunities to be better than expected this year versus worse, but also the sort of way we should think about that long-term for Walmart?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Robbie, it's good to speak with you. To start with, I think we need to be grounded in how our business is changing. I talked about in my prepared remarks that our business is 18% e-commerce right now. That's 1,100 basis points higher than it was five years ago. The SG&A related to a digital transaction, an e-commerce transaction, is higher than it is for brick and mortar.\nSo historically, we thought of our business when it was more brick and mortar as 20% or maybe slightly below that as a good way to think about the cost profile of that business. As our business moves more digital, it's going to create pressure there. It's just a channel mix equation. But at the same time, we've got a hyper-focus, as we always have, on everyday low cost. But we have an opportunity to make investments in the business as well. If you look at Q4, marketing is an area that stands out that we invested a little bit more heavily into. It also drove some of the improvement that we saw in general merchandise. But fundamentally, as you think about our cost structure going forward, one of the big drivers is going to be the improvements that we see in supply chain automation.\nWe're already seeing that. We're encouraged by some of the early productivity metrics, but still today, less than half of the stores in the US are served fully by automation. And so there's a lot of benefits still to come here as we automate our supply chain, as we continue to automate our stores that will drive improvements in SG&A.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nWe're excited to show you a few facilities in Dallas in April. You'll remember the trip to Florida. Those of you that came, I think we're going to have a similar positive experience when you see what we're doing there.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nLead Equity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Doug, you mentioned some exciting news regarding PhonePe. I was wondering if you could share any details around the business, around the growth or profitability today. And then, just as another question, John David, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that ROI was an interesting stat that I think it's the highest it's been since 2016. Is there a way to maybe put into context just how high you think your ROI can go and where some of these newer investments rank as you think about the trajectory for your return on investment? Thank you so much.\n\nKath McLay\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nI'll pick up the one on PhonePe. I mean, the PhonePe business, by the end of 31 January, hit 1.7 trillion TPV, and they have something like 310 million transactions daily. It's a very strong business, and we're excited to make the announcement that they are going to commence their preparation towards IPO. That's a significant milestone for PhonePe, I think, who's also going to celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year. So their business spans both financial services through to technology solutions, and excited to be able to make that announcement.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nOn ROI, first, I think we're fortunate to be a 63-year-old company that has the type of opportunities to invest in itself and drive the returns that we see. I mentioned supply chain automation as one example, but there are many. But these are returns that are approaching 20% in some cases. The standard that we're holding ourselves to is that we want to see our ROI go up every single year. And we've seen that result over the last couple of years.\nAnd so I'd hope that we'd be able to get to historical highs over some period of time, but we want to continue to see these investments pay off with our ROI going up.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nLead Equity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Openheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I'll be quick here. Just as we look forward, this year, I think free cash flow was down versus last year. I just want to get a sense if we're getting closer to positive free cash flow inflection. And then we did see an increase in the dividends. So just any updated thoughts on capital allocation going forward?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nSure, I'll take that, Rupesh. Good to speak with you. We do feel like we're getting really close to both an earnings and a free cash flow inflection as you look at the benefits of a lot of these changes in our business, just becoming larger as the composition of our overall business. And hopefully, our capital allocation reflects the conviction and excitement that we have in our business. We announced a 13% increase in our dividend. Our plan this year assumes that we're going to buy back more stock than we did last year. And certainly, if the early reaction to today's announcement is any indication, we have an opportunity to right now. But we're also going to invest in our business with CapEx. And so I think we can be very balanced there going forward with both returning cash to shareholders and investing in ourselves.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question and answer session. I'll turn the call over to management for closing remarks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, this is Doug. John David just mentioned health. What went through my mind was we feel young. If you look at what's happening around the company, whether it's what we're doing with tech or moving to this new office location, there's a lot of freshness and newness, and the momentum is helping to fuel that. We're really pleased to see that the consistent momentum in Q4 showed up in our results. We're obviously known for saving people money, but we're increasingly saving them time, and that matters, and it's driving our growth.\nNot only is the team executing in the short term with things like unit growth, market share improvements, pricing investments, and inventory management, but they're building for the long term and seeing ROI grow at the same time. I'm really impressed by that and grateful for that. It's awesome to be in the position we are for international. International has got a really bright future, had a really strong year yet again on top of strong years in the past. All three segments had a good year. We feel like we're in a good spot to start the year, and we'll just stay focused on playing offense and making the most of our opportunity. Thank you all for dialing in.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Doug, that concludes my intro. We're ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. We had another good quarter with strong sales growth and even stronger profit growth exceeding our expectations. The team not only drove our short-term results, but they also continued to drive change, setting the stage for our future. Their good work is resulting in our customers and members not only being able to save money on an increasingly broad assortment, but also to save time. Convenience matters, and we're uniquely positioned to provide it. When I'm out in stores and clubs around the world or shopping on our app, I'm seeing the benefits of doing the basics well. Inventories are in good shape, merchandising is improving, and our associates are making good things happen. The strength we saw for the quarter was broad-based. Our business outside the U.S. continues to lift the total company in terms of sales and profit growth.\nWalmart had another strong quarter, and in India, Flipkart again delivered positive contribution margin, and PhonePe continues to deliver amazing growth in total payment volume. In China, strong membership trends and Sam's Club continue to drive double-digit sales growth, and about half of our sales there are digital. We continue to gain market share, including in general merchandise, and transaction counts and unit volume are up across markets. In the U.S., for both Walmart and Sam's Club, comp sales were fairly consistent throughout the quarter. Food continues to be strong, and it's encouraging to see improvements in general merchandise. Our U.S. health and wellness business in Walmart and Sam's Club, primarily due to sales of GLP-1 drugs, is contributing to our strong comp sales. So far, we aren't experiencing a weaker consumer overall. Around the world, our customers and members continue to want four things. They want value.\nThey want a broad assortment of items and services. They want a convenient and enjoyable experience buying them, and they want to do business with a company they trust. These four things are constant, but the way we provide them is changing and changing fast. The results we're delivering are due to real progress across these dimensions. As it relates to value, we're lowering prices. For the quarter, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. were slightly deflationary overall. Walmart U.S. food prices were slightly inflated as we exit Q2, but down 30 basis points versus Q1. In Walmart U.S. , we have more than 7,200 rollbacks across categories. Customers from all income levels are looking for value, and we have it. As it relates to assortment, our item and seller count continues to grow. Walmart U.S. marketplace sales grew 32% for the quarter.\nIf you're a Walmart customer, you have so much to choose from, and if you're a seller, you're going to want to be on Walmart.com. As it relates to the customer or member experience, e-commerce sales grew about 20% for each segment and 21% overall. Sometimes it's most convenient or enjoyable to visit one of our stores or Sam's Clubs. Sometimes it's more convenient to pick up an order, and sometimes it's more convenient to get it delivered. Our store and club businesses are growing. Pickup is growing faster than our in-store or club sales, and delivery is growing even faster than pickup. Delivery accuracy and speed continue to improve. Our e-commerce progress creates more optionality for our customers and fuels the growth of our newer businesses. Globally, membership income grew Walmart+ memberships were up double digits, and Sam's Club U.S. achieved a record high member count.\nGlobally, advertising grew 26%, including 30% growth for Walmart Connect in the U.S., Advertising sales driven by marketplace sellers were up nearly 50%. As it relates to strengthening our business for the future, we continue to be pleased with the automation work happening in our supply chain and our progress with technology overall. We're finding tangible ways to leverage generative AI to improve the customer, member, and associate experience. We're leveraging data and large language models from others and building our own. One example is that we've used generative AI to improve our product catalog. The quality of the data in our catalog affects nearly everything we do, from helping customers find and buy what they're looking for to how we store inventory in the network to delivering orders. We've used multiple large language models to accurately create or improve over 850 million pieces of data in the catalog.\nWithout the use of generative AI, this work would have required nearly 100 times the current headcount to complete in the same amount of time. For associates picking online orders, showing them high-quality images of product packaging helps them quickly find what they're looking for. Customers and members are already enjoying AI-powered search on our app and site, and now they'll have even more help with a new shopping assistant that provides advice and ideas, answering questions like, \"Which TV is best for watching sports?\" Looking ahead, the assistant will be able to respond with more specific follow-up questions like, \"How's the lighting in the room where you'll place the TV?\" Helping our sellers on our marketplace is also an area where we see opportunities to be better using generative AI.\nAs we work to do all we can to help our sellers grow their businesses, we're testing a new experience to select U.S. -based sellers that allows them to ask us anything. We want our sellers focused on selling, so the more we can make it a seamless experience, the better. The new assistant will quickly summarize and provide the seller with succinct answers without them having to sort through long articles or other materials. The use cases for this technology are wide-ranging and affect nearly all parts of our business, and we'll continue to experiment and deploy AI and generative AI applications globally. We're anchored in the responsible use of AI while also moving with speed and in an EDLC way to meet our future needs and scale these experiences. Today's Walmart is different. We are people-led and tech-powered.\nWe put ourselves in a position where we can continue to grow because we're serving people however they want to be served. We can grow profit faster than sales while investing in our associates and lowering prices for customers and members, and we can grow ROI as we make the right capital investments and grow profitability. Before I close today, I'd like to welcome Bob Moritz as the newest member of Walmart's board of directors. Bob brings more than 38 years of global business experience, including as the Global Chair of PricewaterhouseCoopers until his retirement in June of this year. Bob's experiences and skills are highly relevant to the oversight of Walmart's governance and strategy, and we're excited to have him. As always, I'd like to thank our associates. They've delivered a great first half of the year, and we're looking forward to a strong second half.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. I want to start with thanking our team for delivering on a good quarter. We're pleased with our results and the continued progress we're making executing our strategy. Since we shared our financial outlook at our investor day in April of last year, on average, we've increased our quarterly sales by more than 5% and our quarterly operating income by 9%. These financial results reflect that our value proposition extends beyond great prices into convenience. Our combination of price, trust, assortment, and experience has made us more relevant with our customers and members than ever before. Q2 sales, operating income, and EPS all exceeded the top end of our guided ranges. Second quarter total net sales growth was 4.9% on a constant currency basis, with all three operating segments outperforming our expectations, aided by strong global e-commerce growth of 21%.\nIn Walmart U.S., comp sales growth of 4.2% was driven primarily by strong traffic and unit growth across both stores and digital channels. Customers continue to be discerning and choiceful, looking for value to maximize their budgets while leaning into seasonal celebrations. The pace of sales was largely consistent by month during the quarter. Across categories, we're providing low prices and winning customer consideration, including in general merchandise, with Walmart U.S. comp sales growth in hard lines, home, and fashion. We're also seeing higher engagement across income cohorts, with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of gains, even while we grow sales and share among middle and lower-income households. We're seeing private brand penetration continue to increase, and we're highly encouraged by customer uptake of our new food brand, Better Goods, and the early excitement surrounding the relaunch of our young adult fashion brand, No Boundaries.\nE-commerce sales in Walmart U.S. were up 22%, and weekly active customers increased 20%. In addition to the great progress we're making in our fulfillment centers, the close proximity of our stores to customers has also unlocked new capabilities and enabled faster delivery times. Store-fulfilled delivery was up about 50% in Q2, with customers increasingly choosing and paying for delivery of their e-commerce orders in under one hour or under three hours. Our international business delivered constant currency sales growth of 8.3%, reflecting strength in Walmart, China, and Flipkart. Across markets, sales were strongest in food and consumables categories, and we're encouraged that general merchandise growth has improved year-over-year. Our private brand penetration increased in multiple markets as customers continue to focus on value. In our Bodega and Walmart formats in Mexico, nearly half of customer orders included a private brand item in Q2.\nE-commerce sales in our international markets were up 18%. Customers are responding favorably to the increased convenience as we scale pickup and delivery capabilities. In China, we increased e-commerce orders delivered within one hour by 28% to 59 million orders. In India, Flipkart grocery grew over 50% while providing next-day delivery in over 200 cities. In Canada, our delivery pass members drove more than 40% of grocery delivery sales, with order frequency significantly higher than that of non-members. Sam's Club U.S. comp sales ex-fuel increased 5.2%, including e-commerce growth of 22%. Digital engagement remains strong with Scan & Go penetration surpassing 30%. With our increased convenience of our JustGo technology now operational in 325 clubs, over 50% of our members can exit without a check, improving member NPS by more than 800 basis points compared to the clubs without this technology.\nThe Member's Mark private brand continues to drive excitement as sales and digital penetration increased during the quarter. Sam's is also growing membership across all income levels and with younger demographics, with Gen Z and millennials constituting about half of new members in Q2, a positive signal about the future growth of the business. From a margin standpoint, consolidated gross margins expanded 43 basis points led by Walmart U.S. and international segments. We're focused on providing everyday low prices for our customers and members, and we're managing U.S. pricing aligned to competitive price gaps. Customers and members are responding to our value proposition. We're seeing continued sales growth, share gains, and higher gross margins. We're demonstrating that we're able to grow our business on a sustained basis in the absence of price inflation. Global e-commerce losses continue to narrow, most notably in our Walmart U.S. and Flipkart businesses.\nWhile improved business mix is helping, we're also encouraged by the progress in core e-commerce margins due largely to another quarter of nearly 40% reduction in U.S. net delivery costs per order. Flipkart's contribution margin also expanded significantly in the quarter. Scale and delivery density are key. As more customers are shopping with us more often across more categories, we're improving delivery density and transaction-level margins. With improving business mix, we're continuing to reshape our profit composition as we scale growth drivers such as advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights. Our advertising businesses around the world continue to scale with global advertising up 26%. This was driven by another strong quarter from Walmart Connect in the U.S., which grew 30%. We're also pleased with the trends in our membership programs.\nIn the U.S. Walmart+ membership income grew double digits again this quarter, and Sam's Club U.S. reached another record high level for member counts and plus member penetration, resulting in 14.4% membership income growth. Within international, membership income in China from our Sam's Club business grew 26% as member count continues to increase. And in May, we opened our 48th club in China, and we welcomed around 50,000 people on opening day. For marketplace and Walmart fulfillment services in the U.S., we've now seen more than 30% growth in each of the past four quarters as we continued to increase seller counts on the platform by double digits. Growth from sellers using our marketplace fulfillment services increased 800 basis points in Q2, surpassing 40% penetration. Sales in fashion, toys, hard lines, and home all grew more than 20%.\nOutside the U.S., we're seeing similar trends as we enhance our capabilities and product assortment. For example, Flipkart delivered double-digit top-line growth and more than doubled the number of units they delivered same day. In Mexico, we grew marketplace items and sellers by around 60%. In Chile, we launched cross-border trade, adding sellers from China and the U.S. to our local marketplace offering. Within data analytics and insights, Walmart Data Ventures continues to see strong results as clients value the insights we provide, bringing together consumer behavior with omnichannel sales, and inventory trends across our platform. Our client base has increased nearly 200% versus last year as we launched new tools and enter new markets, including the expansion of our Walmart Luminate product in Mexico in May. We're also optimizing our business model to deliver greater efficiency.\nI've been encouraged by how our teams have renewed our long-standing everyday low-cost operating mindset. Ideas are being implemented across the organization, and they're beginning to yield tangible results. By leveraging our scale as a global enterprise, we're finding savings in supplies, transportation, storage, third-party service contracts, and various other expense categories. In other areas, we're maximizing the utilization of our assets and using tech to streamline our operational processes. Together, these efforts translate into meaningful savings. We're also making good progress on our supply chain transformation, and we're seeing the direct benefits to customer experience. In Walmart U.S., more than 45% of our e-commerce fulfillment center volume is now automated, and we have about 1,800 stores receiving some level of freight from 15 of our regional distribution centers that are in varying stages of automation implementation.\nAnd as a result, our supply chain teams are processing more units through our DCs and FCs. And while we're spending more on CapEx than we have historically, we're pleased with the returns from these investments, particularly the automation of our supply chain. We expect these investments to yield returns that will allow us to increase our return on invested capital each year. Importantly, our evolving business model with more diversified and durable sources of profit has provided the ability to fund investments in prices for our customers, wages and benefits for our associates, and leading-edge technologies to power our growth, all while delivering on our financial framework of operating income growing faster than sales.\nWrapping up Q2 results, consolidated adjusted operating income grew 7.4% in constant currency, reflecting strong growth in sales, gross margins, and membership income, partially offset by expense leverage across segments, largely related to increased marketing and higher variable pay expenses tied to our above-planned performance. Operating income also benefited from reduced e-commerce losses during the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.67 per share was above the upper end of our guidance of $0.62-$0.65. Turning to the guidance, for the first half of the year, we reported net sales growth of more than 5% and adjusted operating income growth of almost 10%. We are raising our full-year guidance to reflect strong first-half results. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect the business to achieve sales growth in line with our financial framework and for sustained structural improvements in incremental margins.\nThis should result in operating income growing slightly faster than sales when looking at the second half in total. We now expect full-year FY25 sales growth of 3.75%-4.75% and operating income growth of 6.5%-8% versus our prior guidance of growth of 3%-4% and 4%-6%, respectively. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.35-$2.43 versus prior guidance of $2.23-$2.37. We're focused on executing on the things that we can control, focused on our business and serving our customers and members. But the economic and geopolitical backdrop that we operate in is perhaps more uncertain than normal, and we're not completely immune from the volatility that can result from this.\nWhile we have not seen any additional fraying of consumer health in our business, other economic data out there, as well as the state of affairs globally, would suggest that it's prudent to remain appropriately cautious with our outlook. Reflecting these considerations, our guidance is for growth in Q3 sales of 3.25%-4.25% and operating income of 3%-4.5%, with EPS expected to be $0.51-$0.52. There are two primary factors influencing Q3 operating income growth. First, as is the case in most years, the timing of festive events in our international segment has a bearing on sales and profits by quarter and can affect year-over-year comparability and growth rates. And second, the timing of planned expenses is more concentrated in Q3 versus Q4.\nIn closing, with the results we've delivered through the first half, we're in a good position to achieve our financial goals for the year. Our business model is delivering strong momentum, e-commerce is sustaining its strong growth, and pulling new value streams and profit pools along with it. Simply put, our value proposition is broader and more relevant to our customers and members than ever before. We appreciate your interest in Walmart and are now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.\nFor participants that are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. So that we may address questions for as many participants as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your line will then be muted afterward. One moment, please, for our first question. Our first question is from the line of Michael Lassar with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Can you frame or quantify how you have factored in things like the election and other distracting events into your guidance for Q3 and Q4? And if you haven't seen an impact from these distractions as of yet, whereas many others who are serving the consumer have, why would you experience an impact from that as you move through the rest of the year? Thank you very much.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nMichael, this is John David. Good morning. Thanks for your question. The good thing about elections is they come along every four years, and we get to have a lot of history with what was seen in the impact of that. As I noted in my prepared remarks, given the state of the economy, the election, and state of affairs globally, there's reason to be appropriately measured in our outlook for the back half of the year. But effectively, nothing has changed for that period of time relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. Our business is executing very well. We're gaining share. We're seeing that our value proposition is resonating with customers. And so we feel good about what we can control and the performance of the business.\nWe'll continue to monitor what happens over the course of the coming months, and we think that we are positioned very well, irrespective of whether we're in a more recessionary or more expansionary type period and some of the volatility that may result from that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thank you. In your remarks, you mentioned that you aren't experiencing a weaker consumer. What does your guidance assume in terms of your outlook on the consumer? And related to that, as general merchandise, the flat performance was impressive given the trends and what we're seeing. What do you see happening within that category, and will that momentum continue? Does your guidance assume that stays flattish? Lastly, just on e-commerce, you continue to make really nice strides on the density and scale.\nWhat's ahead in terms of profitability drivers and how much more room there is for delivery density? I imagine that can just get better and better. Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nOliver Chen, I'll try to address each of those questions real quickly. In terms of the outlook for the consumer, let me characterize this or give some context in the second quarter. Each of the months of the second quarter were relatively consistent. If you were to look at the pure comps for each month, July was actually slightly higher, but we think that that's largely a result of where the days of the week fell in the last month of the last week of the month. We did not see a step down, and our outlook for the back half of the year is really for more of a continuation of what we've seen.\nEven in the first couple of weeks of August here, things have been remarkably consistent. So I know everyone is looking for some piece of information that maybe indicates further weakness with our members and our customers. We're not seeing it, but we feel like we're, as I mentioned in my prior response, measured in our outlook and positioned well. With respect to general merchandise, I'll make a couple of comments, and maybe John or Doug wants to jump in, but we like what we're seeing in general merchandise. First time in 11 quarters that we've seen positive inflection there. I think some of this is not so much what's happening broadly in the economy, but specific to our business. If you take our marketplace business as an example, there are many categories that grew over 20% in the quarter.\nAs we're expanding our assortment, we're more relevant to customers, and I think that's driving some of what we're seeing in general merchandise. Lastly, on e-commerce, I would say that that continues to have an outsized contribution to our results. If you look at the second quarter and you were to parse out the various pieces of our business, for example, advertising, membership, fulfillment services, core e-commerce, without the benefit of any of those, was the single largest contributor to our year-over-year operating income improvement. So we really like the progress that we're making there. John may want to comment on some of what's happening in the U.S., but continue to make good progress there.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Morgan and Oliver, it's John. Thanks for the question. I'll just pick up a bit where John David left off.\nAnd first, really proud of the progress the team's made, Tom Ward and others who have done a great job with e-commerce. The 22% result is impressive, and we're proud of it. The progress behind it, maybe we'll just start with customers. The thing that Doug mentioned in his earlier remarks about using GenAI for the catalog has been a great enabler over the last few months. It's about 100 times more productive to use GenAI versus having people work through each product display page. And that's really important in the context of the marketplace where we've had so much expansion in terms of the number of sellers and the number of assortment, the number of items in the assortment. So for customers, more and more, we are really feeling like Walmart can sell you anything that you want to search for.\nAnd for the sellers that are coming on, it's an exciting time because there is so much momentum in the business all around. So the GenAI product that we're using has helped us populate the attributes and the characteristics of hundreds of millions of items, and that would have taken, as I said, 100 times longer if we had tried to do that manually. So when we're trying to really understand the intent a customer has in each session when they're on the site or in the store, then we're able to match the catalog to their intent in a much more effective way because the detail of each item in the product display pages has gotten so much better. So that's one example of using the latest technology that we can to try to improve customer experiences. And so customers, in many cases, start shopping in the store.\nWe know there's much more value when a customer is shopping both in the store and there in e-commerce. Third, when they Walmart+, we see even more frequency. And then the last thing I would say is something that we said earlier about convenience. The number of customers who are enjoying the benefits of convenient on-demand deliveries, and when I said in a minute, I mean less than three hours, that has grown at a very high rate over the last few quarters and this last year. And so the flexibility that the team has been able to offer to customers, whether it's in the store, at the curb, delivery, or with Plus, or in this on-demand channel, which is really fast, in many cases, it's less than an hour for the full store assortment across the country, has been great.\nAnd so we'll continue to lean into these areas, number one. And then second, you mentioned density and frequency. We just recently expanded our delivery catchments to include about another 15 million homes across the country. And that's a result of the density and the business that the team has built. And all those things added up are helping us with this core e-commerce profitability improvement that John David mentioned, which has been really helpful for the total P&L.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club\n\nYeah. And hey, Oliver, it's Chris Nicholas here from Sam's Club. Just to build on that answer from a Sam's Club point of view, our incredible associates have delivered great value and done a great job for our members, and our results are reflecting that. And if I think about how we've done that, digital engagement has been a really big part of it.\nSo we take a look at the numbers. John David talked about some of them, but e-commerce is up 22%. That's delivery from Club, that's delivery from fulfillment centers, and that's pickup from Club. And all three of those are resonating really well. On top of the e-commerce piece, we have a digital engagement in Club with our Scan & Go up 190 basis points. Our JustGo frictionless exit that John David talked about is really resonating. I think last when this went to print, it was 325. We're now at 380 clubs. So we're feeling really good about that. And what that does is it helps drive just a much deeper engagement with our members. They're spending more. They are more prone to renew, which we feel really good about.\nAnd it's worth mentioning, and it's something we've talked about before, that the Sam's Club e-commerce business is profitable, and it's growing rapidly. So we're feeling good about the mix. We're feeling good about the offer, and it's across the membership base too.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nOliver, this is Doug. One of the questions we used to get was, how do you feel about e-commerce as it relates to impulse sales? People walk into stores and clubs, and they buy things that they didn't necessarily have on their list when they came in. Can you do that with e-commerce? And one of the interesting things that's happening with generative AI is that cross-category search is more effective, which serves up more general merchandise items, and it helps drive e-commerce profitability, as you were asking about earlier.\nSo we're in this situation where we've got the best e-commerce food offer, and new tools are helping us connect impulse items that are general merchandise in some cases, which helps us improve both sales and profitability.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Membership growth was noted as one of the drivers of operating income dollar growth during the quarter, and there did seem to be an acceleration from Q1-Q2, especially at Sam's Club. I wondered if there was something meaningful that had changed from a quarterly standpoint or a sequential standpoint. And you flagged increased marketing as part of the reason that operating expenses deleveraged in the quarter. Did that have anything to do with some of the increased membership that we saw? Thank you.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club\n\nOkay, Chris Nicholas here from Sam's Club first, and I'll just touch on the membership growth piece. We are seeing all-time high membership growth. We're seeing all-time high plus penetration too, so the health is really good. We're also seeing growth across all income cohorts and all generations. One of the really exciting things we're seeing is that 50% of the growth that we saw in the quarter was Gen Z and millennials. That really talks to a really strong health for the future. We're getting people early in their lives, and we see them continuing to be sticky. The reason that it's working is we're focusing on all parts of our value proposition. We're focusing really hard on enhancing the core value proposition. We're focusing really hard on that deepening of digital engagement, and Member's Mark is doing really well as well.\nYou saw that in terms of transactions. Our units were ahead of comps too. What's good about that for a membership model is the more engagement you have, the more frequently that they engage with you, the more prone they are to renew. So just good quality health of the Sam's Club business drives more members in and drives that renewal rate up.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nKate, it's John. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me address the marketing question in addition to the comments Chris made about membership. If you step back, what we open the call with is we know what customers are interested in around the world, and those are the four things we talked about: value, assortment, experience, and trust.\nAnd while, of course, we have always focused on being a great value with everyday low price, and we're driven to an everyday low-cost culture to support everyday low price so customers can always depend on us for the best value of our basket of goods, what's happened in the last couple of years is a really rapid expansion in assortment. We've talked about that for the last few quarters on calls like these and other places. But as the assortment has expanded, our ability to show those items in a very high-quality way using new tools like Generative AI and improving our search has enabled us to understand better what customers are looking for by season, by session, by time of week. And it felt like it was the right time given this increase in convenience in addition to pickup and delivery.\nSo you can shop in the store, you can pick up on a schedule, you can deliver on a schedule, deliver on a schedule. And then this acceleration of this convenience experience felt like the right time that we need to be more bold about telling our story to our customers. And so starting late in Q1, we decided intentionally to increase our marketing investment to tell the story to our customers about all the things that we can do for them, which has led to what we feel good about are some really important early positive signs in general merchandise, including unit growth, which led to the results we talked about at the end of the quarter. But seeing things like marketplace and specifically fashion within marketplace lead the way is encouraging. So this could be something that we continue over time. We'll learn as we go.\nWe'll be very thoughtful about how we manage mix, how we manage expenses, and how we manage our costs across channels. But seeing customers respond to these new offers that we have in marketplace and with apparel, home, other categories has been really exciting.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nWe still have lots of room to improve, but the progress we've made on the e-commerce experience across businesses, across markets, puts us in a position where we can play more offense and be more aggressive as it relates to marketing. So whether it's that or the capital investments in supply chain, what you're seeing is that we are playing offense.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to the momentum you're seeing in the health and wellness category.\nJust wanted to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about the sustainability of strength that you're seeing there, and then anything outside of GLP-1 that's contributed to that momentum. And then just from a gross margin perspective, as you look at stronger growth in grocery and within health and wellness, how is the mix product mix impact on gross margins playing out versus how you thought about for the year?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Rupesh, it's John. I'll take that. So let me start with mix in general. In the quarters, we noted better results in general merchandise, which is, of course, helpful. We have strength in food and consumables. We also talked about inflation really being exiting the quarter roughly flat, slightly down in some areas. So we're growing the business with higher transaction counts and higher unit growth, which, of course, is encouraging.\nOur merchants have a lot of experience over the last few years and the last few decades, maybe is the best way to say it, at managing mix in any kind of situation. So yes, there is growth in health and wellness led by GLP-1s, but there is other growth in the category like supplements that we're proud of. This is a time of year as people go back to school, back to college; you can lean into categories like over-the-counter supplements, and we can do really well. But when you step back and look at the entire business, inventory is down 2% across the business. That's a decrease on top of a decrease last year, and we're proud of the in-stock results that we have. So our merchants have a number of levers they can use. First, of course, they want to be a great value to customers.\nWe have 7,200 rollbacks. And then our merchants can mix across categories. In many cases, by taking a high-margin item and taking a rollback on it, you can shift sales to items within a category to bring the category up, and you can do that while you have pressure in other places. So at this point, we're managing the margin. We're managing mix. I don't have any concerns about our ability to do that at this point. We'll see growth. Perhaps it's uneven in certain cases. That's always been the case. But we're in a good spot in terms of inventory, in-stock, value, being ready for customers so that we can manage our mix.\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Thanks, everyone.\nMy question. It's on the spread between U.S. EBIT growth and U.S. comps or U.S. net sales. It looks like the first half of the year you're running four-ish and change comps, and you're doing EBIT growth of about 7%-8%, so about a three-four-point spread. My question is two parts. First, are there active decisions of reinvestment that we can do both, reinvest and grow? Curious how much reinvestment's happening. And second, that three- to four-point spread, is that representative of the business's run rate, or is this still scaling, and then that spread should continue to widen going forward? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nSimeon, this is Doug. We are being thoughtful and deliberate about reinvestment. We start out thinking about the customer first, what's the level of price investment, where are our gaps?\nAs we've been saying for some time now, we're feeling comfortable with where our gaps are, and we'll continue to support those as needed. It is great to see prices come down. We are wired to help bring prices down, and we'll continue working on to get more rollbacks to help customers and help members save money. The second thing we think about is our associates and where's our level of compensation, what investments need to be made there. You've seen now for years a string of different investments that we've made in our associates, whether that's hourly or management. We obviously think about shareholders all the time, and it's not lost on me that our operating income percentage came down for a period of years as we made investments.\nAnd it feels good to have turned the corner on that and have a healthy business mix so that we can do both in parallel. So whether it's a one-year operating plan or it's a five-year plan, we're kind of in that season right now where we think about a five-year view. We're trying to be deliberate about reinvesting in the business so that the momentum continues and we don't find ourselves having managed the short term to the detriment of the long term.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. You talked about the U.S. e-commerce business turning profitable, perhaps in the next one-two years. After Q2, is there any refinement to that timeframe?\nThen related to that, in Q1, you talked about, I think, total contribution, $300 millon-400 million in alternative profit pool growth that you saw in that Q1, is that improving? And can you talk about how that arc of improvement trends as we look out into the future? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nChristopher, this is Doug. I'll go first, and others can join in if they want. As it relates to e-commerce profitability for some time now, I've been trying to stress to everybody not to get too hung up on it. We've got a business with a lot of variables here, and we're going to manage them all. And there are going to be new businesses that we invest in that, in the short term, don't make money but make money in the mid to long term.\nAnd at some point, we'll tell you that we've crossed a threshold and that e-commerce is profitable. We'll then talk about whether that includes advertising or does include advertising. You heard John David say earlier, we saw a lot of progress in core e-commerce during the quarter, which is absent advertising, and we focus on that, and we're seeing really great improvement there. And so I'm encouraged by it. But with Walmart, I wouldn't get hung up on one metric too much, whether it's advertising income, membership income, or e-commerce profitability. Look at the omni total. We have a great and huge store and club business around the world that is profitable. We make money in food. We make money in consumables. We make money in general merchandise. And we'll eventually make money in e-commerce. And we're getting into that zone where it's going to cross a threshold.\nWe'll talk about that at some point, and then we'll put that to bed, and we'll be talking about something else.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nI'll just add on the newer businesses. We continue to see great progress there in the quarter. Just to maybe cherry-pick a couple of them, if you took advertising and membership, those two alone accounted for over 50% of our operating income growth. So, as Doug and others have alluded to, all these things work together. We've got to be really good at the core basics to have those work, but continue to be pleased with these faster-growing, higher-margin parts of our business that you all are seeing are changing the reflection in terms of how our financials look. Our margins are inflecting higher.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nCan I just add too? As I look across international business, there's so much balance across the markets. And we do have markets where we are e-comm profitable. We have channels where we're e-comm profitable. But what we see holistically is that while with the value and convenience play that is growing density, it's helping our fulfillment costs come down, and it's helping the overall profile. But it's just a very balanced result across markets as we're seeing that omni continuing to increase as a component of our business and seeing the profitability mix really balance out.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats on really strong results. I wanted to ask on the momentum in membership. You have done a lot to enhance Walmart+ business. You added many new features. So one is, what have you found to be working best not only in attracting but also retaining members?\nAnd in fact, can you update us on the uptake of Walmart+ Assist program and how you think about the sustainability of that growth as we think about the low-income consumer taking advantage also of convenience and value? Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Krisztina, good morning. It's John. I'm happy to address the question. Of course, I'd say we're proud of the progress Walmart+. The team is working really hard on ensuring that, number one, the offer is built in such a way that it's very relevant to our customers all across the country. The core of the offer, of course, is delivery without cost from either the fulfillment centers or stores. Our ability to attract people starts with the offer. Our ability to retain people ends with how well we execute that proposition. So we spend a lot of time and energy.\nWe start every week going through all the metrics on how we did on the week before, the month before, the quarter before, and then building roadmaps to ensure that any friction that we are putting in front of customers, we're doing everything we can to try to eliminate that. We know that when we deliver what we call a perfect order, which is part of our overall customer experience score, that the likelihood of repeat and renewal goes up significantly. So we focus a lot on ensuring that customers get what they ordered when they ordered it with only appropriate substitutions when those are absolutely necessary, and those are all helping. In terms of assist and other things, we have a membership program that should and is, we believe, very applicable for customers at all income brackets.\nWe have members who are delivering very frequently who are below $50,000 a year in income, and we have members who are delivering frequently and growing above $100,000. So this flexibility is super important. As I said earlier, when a customer moves from just shopping in the store to stores in eCommerce or stores in eCommerce and they become plus, and then within plus, they use what was described earlier as on-demand sub-three-hour delivery, we really see spend rates and the amount of time, energy, and money people are spending with us go up significantly. So it's about the entire journey. As Doug said earlier, I wouldn't weigh too heavy on one metric in Walmart+ is an important part of our program. It's not the only thing we do. We do a lot of other things.\nBut for the people that join, we want to make sure that we deliver the very best experience that we possibly can that's within our control.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nThanks. Good morning. Great results. On automation, where are we on that journey today, and how much of the benefits are we seeing in the P&L over the past couple of quarters versus what you expect to flow through over the next several years? And then separately, on August, comps sound solid. Any early thoughts on back to school, back to college? Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Chuck, John, I'll take that first. I'll start with automation and talk about back to school for a second.\nAs you know, we have a number of facilities and a number of types of facilities around the country that we are automating in the supply chain. We have our regional distribution network, which is primarily an ambient network. Progress there is right where we planned it to be. Continue to be pleased with the progress of our provider in the space. And by the end of the year, roughly, we should see about 3,000 stores of the 4,600 having deliveries from automated facilities in some way. So the progress is good. The ability for a store to get a load in that is palletized, it's by aisle. And as we build more density in these centers, not only is it by aisle, in many cases, it's by section when an associate needs to stock a pallet is so helpful.\nI mean, I remember working in stores years ago, and it was a bit of a treasure hunt to try to find the items you needed, the cases you needed. But not only our automation, but then the in-store technology to help us locate what we own and know where it is makes it much easier for our associates to access inventory and get those things in front of people. The second type of automation, of course, is perishables. That's a network that we're pretty new in. We have about three facilities that are underway. And then our fulfillment center network is probably the farthest along with the highest percentage of buildings that have converted. And we're really pleased with the accuracy, the number of steps it takes an associate to run inventory through, and our variable cost per unit is showing significant improvement in those centers.\nThe last part of your question, back to school, it started off strong this last couple of weeks. I've been, and a number of operators have been, in stores all over the country where we're looking at how ready they are for back to college and back to school. About 50% of our customers still say they have a lot of shopping left to do. We have over 2 million school lists uploaded on the site. So we still have a lot of trading ahead of us. So good start. We have to continue to execute really well, clean up, come out of the season strong so that then we can move to the next holiday, which will be Labor Day. We take all these one at a time. We focus on what we can control. We execute. We clean our inventory up, and then we move forward. So good start, but a lot of trading left to do.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP, Jefferies",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you and good morning. So Doug, a couple of quarters ago, you had mentioned to us that deflation could be a real possibility. And now in the prepared remarks today, I think for the quarter, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, you mentioned were slightly deflationary overall. So I'm wondering, what do you think this means for the trajectory for pricing as we look ahead? What does it mean for your price gaps? And then additionally, how do you think private label plays into this as I think we've continued to see those price gaps widen as well, and that also is continuing to increase in terms of penetration in the business.\nSo how do you see that adoption unfolding in the midst of, in the broader context of pricing potentially being slightly deflationary?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. Corey, first, I would say we want to sell brands. It's important to Walmart to sell brands and show a value. And so we're hoping that our branded suppliers do the right things with both quality and price to get to the value that our customers want to see. I would guess that private brand continues to grow, although it'd be okay with us if the percent of total leveled out for the reason that I just mentioned. Our teams are doing a better job with private brand as it relates to both the development of the product, the quality of it, and the value. So that's good and helpful for customers, and we'll keep doing that.\nLooking ahead from a pricing point of view, fresh food is behaving like it does. Supply and demand moves faster and things adjust, whether it's the proteins or it's fruit and vegetable. General merchandise has come down. My guess is it doesn't come down a whole lot more, but it's great that the prices are down and that rollbacks are being reflected. In dry grocery, processed food consumables are where inflation has been more stubborn. And as we mentioned, we still have slight inflation even in last quarter in the food categories. So I'm hoping that what we see from our branded suppliers is investment in price, and we're seeing that from some of them and not others. We have less upward pressure, but there are some that are still talking about cost increases, and we're fighting back on that aggressively because we think prices need to come down.\nSo I don't forecast that we're going to see a lot of deflation in our number looking ahead. It probably levels out about somewhere near where we are with the mix being reflected as I just described.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, thank you, guys. Following the gross margin expansion in the first half, how are you thinking about gross margin in the second half? Which drivers of the first half margin expansion stay the same? Which fall off? And are there any new drivers of gross margin that we might see pop up in the second half? And then maybe related to that, what are your expectations for the competitive landscape relative to what you've seen in the past several months? Thanks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nPaul, John David will respond to the gross margin question, but I just want to jump out in the front part of that and say we're not raising prices. We're lowering prices. But we don't want product margins to go up. When we talk about margin improvement in our company, it's business mix, mix of geographies. It is not that we are increasing product margins.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nEVP and CFO, Walmart\n\nYeah. I'd just add to that, Paul, that if you look at some of the drivers of the gross margin improvement, as Doug noted, business mix drives a large part of that. We've also seen improvement, as I mentioned earlier, in just core e-commerce losses. Within the core merchandise mix, we had a little bit of benefit from improved shrink in the quarter, similar to what we saw last quarter as well as we were at higher levels last year.\nBut as Doug noted, we're advocating for our customers. We want to drive everyday low prices, and we're not intending to achieve any of our margin performance by passing this along to our customers and members in the form of higher prices.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nI'd probably just call out too. We had talked. We had a really strong uptake result in Q1, and we called out that Q2 would moderate. It did, but it was still a really strong result in Q2. But one of the things that I'm finding in international is that there is a significant amount of impact from events. And we will have BBD in the back half, which does change the profit profile of the back half. But we're still really optimistic and bullish about the results we're driving in international.\nIt's just recognizing that those big events do kind of have a disproportionate kind of impact on the ratios across between top line and bottom line.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nWhat does BBD stand for?\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nOh, BBD is Big Billion Days, which is a really big sales-driving event in India that happens around Q3, Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I was curious. You talk a lot about the share gains by income cohorts and how that's primarily driven by upper-income households. But would you be willing to kind of give color on comps by income cohorts? And I think a lot of investors are just really curious if you are growing comps with low-income households or how much of comps are being driven by that upper income.\nMaybe if you could tie in any color between grocery spend and general merchandise by cohort, is it really that upper-income cohort that's starting to turn the needle here on general merchandise? Any color there I think would be helpful.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nKelly, this is Doug. I'll go first. If anybody wants to add, they can. I don't know that we can add a whole lot more color except to say that value matters to everyone, whether you're above or below $100,000 in income. We do see behavior differences in the lower-income levels, more focus on opening price points. End-of-month behavior looks different, all the things that you would expect. But they still need us for general merchandise price points. As it relates to higher-income people, they can buy more discretionary goods, and they can pay more for convenience. We're offering all of it.\nSo I think our future looks like it's got to spread across income levels, that's different than our past because of convenience. I think Walmart+ membership, delivery, the things we're doing with remodels, John, and the U.S. stores, I think all these things are coming together to give us a shot at continuing to have growth with higher-income levels regardless of what happens in the economy.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I just was wondering from the team with the back half guidance, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on what kind of holiday Walmart is planning for this year in the U.S. and even globally.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nIt's going to be great, Robbie. We're all smiling at each other.\nI mean, you guys know what we know about the volatility, the environment, and all the things that are in front of us. But the good news is we have a long history of dealing with volatility and surprises of all forms, especially in more recent years. It is nice that the early days of back to school went well. Sometimes, most times, I guess that does give some indication as to how Halloween and Christmas will go. We bought increases, and we're playing offense. So we're expecting to have a good holiday. And we look forward to serving our customers and members through all the holidays around the world.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. As always, thanks for your time and attention.\nWe're feeling pretty good about where we are. We believe we're making real progress, not only as it relates to saving people money, but growing our assortment through both first-party and third-party. And importantly, saving people time. Regardless of your income level, you need to and you want to save time, and convenience is a big deal. And we're improving that part of our experience. The team's driving results right now, the unit growth, market share growth, pricing improvement, really good inventory management. It's great to see. And it's also great to see ROI up 230 basis points in the quarter. At the same time that the team's doing a great job driving short-term results, we're building for tomorrow. The e-commerce growth is strong. That includes the marketplace business, which helps pull through things like membership, advertising, and fulfillment services, resulting in that new business model.\nI'm also really excited about international as it relates to building for tomorrow. We're in a great position in the right markets. This business is more than a domestic business. It's got global leverage, global benefits. Kath and the team are figuring out ways to help make that be true across markets where they see benefits by being part of Walmart. 8% operating income growth for the quarter was really good. We're trying to do a good job of both managing the short-term and building for the long-term at the same time. I think that's what we're seeing happen. I'm just really grateful to the team. Thank you all.\nThis concludes today's conference. We may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC.\nPlease review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that wraps my intro. We're ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Our team delivered a great quarter to start the year. Our results were stronger than we anticipated with sales growth of 5.7% and adjusted operating profit up 12.9% in constant currency. All three operating segments performed well. The momentum we see across the business is driven by growth in units sold and transaction counts as well as market share gains, including general merchandise. These are not inflation-driven results. In the US, like-for-like sales, inflation was about 40 basis points for the quarter, including mid-single-digit deflation in general merchandise and low-single-digit inflation in food and consumables. Together with our suppliers, we're making progress lowering prices. Our rollback count is up and customers are responding to our price leadership.\nThe first highlight I'd like to call out is the improvement in customer experience scores that has a lot to do with our associates. I get to visit with a lot of them as I travel this quarter. I've been in stores and clubs in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Toronto, Nashville, Los Angeles, Austin, Oklahoma City, and Dallas. Before we get too far into the conversation about our performance, I want to thank all our associates everywhere. They deserve all the credit. They're managing the things we've always managed while simultaneously building new capabilities and driving change. Here's what they're doing to drive our business. First, we're providing value. Low prices on quality merchandise are always important to our customers and members. Our combination of everyday low prices plus a large number of rollbacks is resonating.\nDuring the holiday, we offered a basket of Easter items with a lower price than a year ago in the US and Canada. Customers responded and we saw strong sell-throughs. Our merchants are doing a great job including managing inventory where we finished down 2.7% globally. Second, we have the selection people are looking for. In the US, the number of marketplace sellers grew about 36% for the quarter with a SKU count now sitting at more than 420 million. In Mexico, the number of marketplace sellers grew by more than 50% with SKU count up nearly 80%. More often, our customers are finding what they're looking for when they shop our app or site. eCommerce penetration is up in all our markets. Third, we're improving the experience of shopping with us.\nOur store remodels look good and are performing well, plus our curbside pickup and delivery capabilities are improving as indicated by our customer experience metrics. Globally, we completed nearly 70 remodels during the quarter and we're on track to do more than 900 this year. We're making it more convenient to shop with us and our customers and members are rewarding us with growth as we save them time. We expect to continue to earn healthy levels of sales growth and simultaneously grow profit faster than sales this year while managing our price gaps, and investing in our associates at the same time. This quarter's results were driven by a combination of strong core performance and the growth of our newer businesses as it relates to the core. Strong same store sales growth combined with good inventory management resulted in strong profit flow through in our newer businesses.\nAdvertising and membership were both up 24%. Today we announced that we're expanding our data analytics and insights product Walmart Luminate into Mexico and Canada. Our technology team continues to deliver the innovation that helps us drive our business. We're bringing new experiences to life like generative AI driven product search that helps our customers shop more intuitively. The team continues to build and improve the platforms for marketplace and data that we're using across countries, and they're building and improving the operating system that enables us to create a more intelligent, flexible, and automated supply chain. The implementation of our automated storage and retrieval systems in our DCs and FCs is on track, and we're as enthusiastic about the impact of that work as we've ever been, turning to our segments. In Walmart US, we recently announced a new private brand in food called Better Goods.\nIt's our largest food private brand release in 20 years. The brand focuses on today's trends and premium quality, but at the same time, 70% of Better Goods items are priced under $5. This is the type of quality and value that will resonate with customers across income spectrums. We also introduced on demand early morning delivery to customer doorsteps as early as 7:00AM and as quickly as 30 minutes. Globally, same day delivery is available from more than 6,500 locations in Walmart US. Over the last 12 months, 4.4 billion items were delivered same or next day with about 20% of those delivered in under three hours. Delivery times are getting faster and the cost of delivery is coming down at the same time. During the quarter, we made the necessary but difficult decision to close our US healthcare clinics.\nThere were a number of aspects that were going well, and we really want to be part of the solution to improving healthcare in this country. But the reality is that given reimbursement rates and cost to serve, we could no longer see a path to achieving an acceptable level of profitability, and we're committed to being disciplined with our investments. We're grateful to our associates that worked in this area. They did their part. We'll continue to build our pharmacy and optical businesses, and we'll find ways for our pharmacists to help as they've done with immunizations and vaccinations. Earlier this week, we also shared decisions to eliminate some home office roles and reduce the amount of remote work. The vast majority of our home office associates have been back together in offices since we came back from the pandemic, and we want to see even more of that.\nBeing in person is important. Our culture is stronger when we're together, we make decisions faster, we're more creative, and we help develop the next generation of talent. We'll continue to make changes to ensure we're best positioned to serve customers and support our store, club, and supply chain associates. Moving to Walmart International, we continued to deliver strong results with double-digit growth in sales and profit, lifting our company growth rates. Strength was broad-based, led by Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Results for the quarter included strong growth in eCommerce, led by store-fulfilled orders and marketplace. We saw improved sales growth in general merchandise categories as we focused on celebrations across the world like Chinese New Year, Easter, and Walmart Canada's 30th anniversary. Like the US, the international team is improving speed of delivery across markets.\nSame day delivery orders in India grew by over 150% in the quarter and is now available across 20 major cities. One hour delivery in China grew to 55 million orders as customers sought convenience during Chinese New Year, and in Chile, 60% of e-commerce orders are delivered same day with Sam's Club US. It's exciting to see how the team is using Computer Vision to make it faster for members using Scan and Go to leave the building once they're done shopping. I'm referring to the Computer Vision and AI-powered exit technology that allows members to leave the club without having to stand in line to get their receipt check that we announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. Since then, we've deployed it in about 20% of our clubs, and we're on track to have it in all US clubs by year-end.\nIn addition to this being better for members, the technology identifies more items than we could with our previous process. This is a great example of people led tech powered solving for technology that benefits the member experience. It was a strong start to the year. We'll remain focused on improving customer and member experiences, being great merchants, building our newer businesses, and improving returns. With that, I'll hand it to John David to share more about the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. Our strong results this quarter clearly demonstrate our ability to deliver on our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales. This quarter's results reflect strong execution from the team across virtually every aspect of our business, share gains, and improving NPS scores from our members and customers that are increasingly looking for value and convenience, and the power of our Omni retail model. I'll discuss our quarterly results using our framework of growth, margins, and returns. We experienced ongoing sales strength with all three operating segments outperforming our expectations. We're growing traffic and units, and our inventories are in excellent shape. We're on a multi-year journey to reshape our profit profile and operating income growth trajectory, and this quarter reflects the benefits of improved margins in our core retail operations, as well as contributions from business mix.\nWe're investing in areas that have strong capital returns like automation, store remodels, and digital tools and technologies. Combined, these investments are widening our competitive advantages, providing us levers to also invest in people and price while achieving our sales and margin objectives. Before I provide more color behind the strength of our financial results, I want to remind you that there is a supplemental presentation on our IR website with additional information beyond my remarks. Q1 total net sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis ahead of our guidance of 4 to 5% growth. As a reminder, the leap year this year contributes approximately one point to our year over year sales growth. International led the Enterprise with constant currency sales growth of 10.7% reflecting strength in Walmex, China, and Flipkart. Across markets, seasonal events were strong and were encouraged by early improvements in general merchandise sales.\nInternational eCommerce sales were up 19% as we continue to expand our capabilities. In Canada, the majority of our marketplace growth came from items serviced by Walmart Fulfillment Services, and in India, Flipkart same-day delivery became available to millions more customers as they expanded the offering to 20 cities. Walmart US also delivered better than expected growth with comp sales up 3.8%, including strong eCommerce growth of 22% led by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery, marketplace, and advertising. Traffic and sales growth were strong across both stores and digital channels, and we're pleased with the unit growth. We're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts with upper income households continuing to account for the majority of the share gains. Sam's US comp sales ex fuel were also strong at 4.4%. The Sam's team continues to make progress on quality and value with Member's Mark, our private brand.\nThe team is doing a great job of being on top of product trends with the Sam's Club members. Sam's Club drove high single digit growth in Q1 and is a growing reason why members join and renew alongside digitally enabled solutions such as Scan and Go and curbside pickup. Next to sales, gross profit growth was the key driver of upside in Q1. Consolidated gross margin expanded 42 basis points, led by Walmart US across segments. We benefited from lower markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management and favorable business mix enabling strong margin flow through from sales. Consolidated adjusted operating income grew 12.9% in constant currency, more than 700 basis points higher than our sales growth. This reflects better than expected sales growth and higher gross margins, and membership income. This was partially offset by expense deleverage in our US.\nSegments related to higher variable pay expenses from our outperformance. Walmart US was the primary driver of outperformance, but all segments contributed to operating income growing faster than sales. Taking a closer look at margins, as we continue to work closely with our suppliers to lower cost, we're managing our Walmart US pricing aligned competitive price gaps, and customers are responding favorably, resulting in sustained sales growth and higher gross margins. Our price gaps to the retail market remain strong. Improved inventory management and favorable business mix allowed us to optimize our pricing on everyday essentials, and we're investing further in value within our private brands. Our Rollback program is driving customer engagement and supporting our volume growth, with grocery Rollback counts up 45% year over year in April, carrying forward the success we saw last year in our seasonal programs.\nWe're using celebrations and festive events to reinforce our value proposition and customers are responding. Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, and Easter drove stronger sales across categories including general merchandise. We're also working with suppliers to bring innovation to US customers while leaning into our own private brands as sources of value, quality, and newness. As a result, we've continued to see strong momentum in private brand sales with grocery penetration up 30 basis points in Q1. While private brand penetration is in the low 20s as a percent of sales, more than half of all customer grocery baskets over the last year have had a private brand in them. Our inventory levels continue to come down, with Walmart US declining about 4% and Sam's down nearly 5% at quarter end.\nWhile we sustain strong sales and healthy in stock rates, having the right inventory in the right categories and the right places has allowed us to not only minimize markdown activity but also support higher in stock levels with goods flowing more smoothly through distribution centers into stores. Importantly, the business is realizing efficiencies while both customer and associate NPS scores are rising. Global eCommerce growth was 21% in Q1 and eCommerce losses continue to narrow, most notably in the US, net delivery cost per order improving nearly 40%. More customers are shopping with us more often across more categories, moving us along the pathway of delivery density and transaction margins that give us clear visibility into profitability in this channel over time.\nMany consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix as they're spending more of their paychecks on non-discretionary categories and less on general merchandise. This merchandise mix remains a headwind to margins, but it's consistent with our expectations. Our Walmart US team is executing strategies to improve general merchandise sales and to increase the visibility of our growing eCommerce brand assortments in fashion, home, and electronics. We have the opportunity to grow general merchandise sales in stores with our first-party eCommerce assortment and especially with our marketplace. We were encouraged to see share gains in fashion, home, and hard lines in Q1. In addition, marketplace sales in categories such as furniture, sporting goods, kids, apparel, and home grew more than 20%. In addition to sales growth and gross margin improvement.\nThe reshaping of our profit composition is an exciting part of our strategy. We're enhancing capabilities and higher margin growth drivers such as advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights and seeing the corresponding improvement in our business mix. Global advertising grew 24%, led by 26% growth from Walmart Connect in the US, and International's 27% growth. Walmart's US ad sales reflected more than 50% growth from Marketplace sellers, while overall active advertiser counts increased nearly 19%. Sam's ad business now has 30% more active advertisers versus last year. We're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club US reached another record high level for member counts and Walmart+ member penetration, resulting in membership income growth over 13%. Sam's China member count grew 25% with increasing active and renewal rates.\nIn addition, Walmart+ continued to grow double digits as members engage with us more frequently and spend more than other customers for Marketplace. Within International, all markets grew double digits, led by Flipkart and Walmex, reflecting the strength we're experiencing across markets. In the US, Walmart's Marketplace delivered strong results, aided by 36% more sellers on our platform, with 28% of sellers using our Marketplace fulfillment services. To give you an example of the benefit of our Omni model, in April we launched a new service enabling customers to order from an extended assortment of nearly 40,000 tires on our Marketplace and have them installed at one of our 2,300 auto care centers and stores in the US.\nIt's a great example of how we're leveraging our unique omni capabilities to remove friction for customers. Within data analytics and insights, Walmart Data Ventures continues to see strong demand from clients for their insights on consumer behavior and trends in our omnichannel operations. In Q1, this business doubled versus last year. In April, we announced a new self-serve integration to make it easier for supplier advertisers to combine Walmart Luminate's Insights with Walmart Connect's closed-loop omnichannel retail media solutions to help drive product, brand, and category sales. This is the first time we're bringing these two solutions together, creating greater cohesion between both offerings and helping suppliers deliver more relevant shopping experiences for our customers. Beyond executing on our operating strategies, you're also seeing a discipline from us to address areas of our business that have not performed as well.\nYou should expect this discipline to continue concentrating our efforts and capital on clear drivers of incremental value. This requires us to be bold enough to step back from areas that at one time were clear opportunities or were strategically or financially accretive but now have diminishing value. It was through this lens that we made the decision to close all 51 Walmart health centers. As Doug mentioned, total business reorganization costs resulted in a charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter. Wrapping up Q1 results, below the line items reflected slightly higher interest expense on relatively flat net debt balances and a lower tax rate year over year. Based on changes in the fair value of our equity investments, adjusted EPS of $0.60 per share compared favorably to our guidance of $0.49 to 0.52. Turning to guidance, our team is executing at a very high level.\nQ1 results exceeded our expectations for both sales and operating income growth, and while it might be a little much to expect every quarter to be this good, we feel really good about the performance and it demonstrates how this business can perform when we're firing on all cylinders. Consumer economic conditions have been relatively consistent since the start of the year. Many of the value seeking behaviors we witnessed last year have continued, particularly around seasonal events. Our focus on providing customers with value and convenience is resonating and we're gaining share. That said, we're one quarter into a year that still has some degree of uncertainty and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.\nWe currently expect Q2 sales to increase between 3.5 and 4.5% and for operating income growth in line with that at roughly 3% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.62 and $0.65 per share. In Q2, we expect operating income growth to be impacted by timing of tech and wage investments. Combining Q1 results with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance would suggest first half sales would grow nearly 5% and operating income would grow about 8%. We feel really good about our start to the year, and our outlook for the second half is consistent with 90 days ago. Our Q1 results and the midpoint of our Q2 guidance suggest that we should be at the high end or even slightly above our sales and operating income guidance for the year. We'll revisit our full year guidance as we exit Q2.\nThis is more aligned with our historic cadence of updates and consistent with the philosophy we have as a management team to recognize early momentum but to also maintain prudence early in the year given the macro uncertainty and so much of the year is still ahead of us. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our results this quarter. They demonstrate what our team is capable of when we're laser focused on the member and customer, disciplined on cost and leveraging the technology investments we've made. Profits are growing, customer NPS scores are increasing, and we're running a great operation. We like our position, we like who we are, and we like where we're going. We appreciate your interest in Walmart and are now ready to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session.

We ask you please limit yourself to one question. One moment please for the first question. Thank you.\nOur first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning everyone. Thanks so much for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk a little bit more about what you saw with the lower end consumer throughout the quarter and how you think about their contribution to comp for the rest of the year, especially when it comes to general merchandise?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nHey Kate, it's John Furner.\nGood morning.\nI'll start. Well, first I'd just like to say thanks to the entire team for what they did in the quarter and the execution. It's great to see so many of our associates making such a difference, and it's also encouraging to see our store managers really focus on in-store merchandising. In the quarter, we saw big improvements all across the US, and that was really exciting. In terms of the consumer, it's been pretty consistent, I think, is the best word we would use: consistent spending. Across income groups we've had more growth, as we mentioned in the earlier remarks on the high-end consumer, and that remains true. We're very focused on value, flexibility, and convenience, and that's working across income segments. It's great to be in a position where we have store conditions that we're proud of with growth.\nIt's great to be in a position where our pickup business is growing. Then as we mentioned, our delivery business has now exceeded our pickup business in size, and the run rate remains strong. So I think what we can say at this point is things have been consistent. What is also helping us is on our food categories, broadly across the store, we have almost 7,000 rollbacks. That's really helping that in our food categories we see an even larger spread between eating at home, preparing meals at.\nHome and eating out, which we think.\nCan help Walmart over the remainder of the year.\n\nKate McShane\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please, please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning everyone. I have one question. I'll make it in two parts. First, to diagnose the consumer not raising yet. It sounds like you sort of want to, but there is something holding you back besides it is early in the year, but curious if there's anything on the consumer side. And then the second part of this is how Doug has talked about doing both investing and then driving value today. And curious in this environment, if you have the flexibility and even the desire to lean in even more, it looks like it could be a choppy year. So ability to continue to drive the do both driving these impressive share gain profit margin expansion while continuing to invest in a value proposition. Thanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nI'll start with the first part of the question, Simeon, then hand it over to Doug for the second piece on guidance. There's nothing to read into that with. First, like, we feel really good about the performance in the first quarter. These are strong results across the board. We think it's prudent to be patient on this performance. And as we noted we'd update at the end of the second quarter. I think we'd all agree that we're in far from a certain environment around the consumer. It's, you know, the health of the consumer is something we read about every single day and keep. Given that we're one quarter into the year, we just want to be patient on this.\nThat should not take away from our conviction in the results and our team's ability to continue to execute, and in our strategy that's continuing to drive results here.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nSimeon, I think I'll be a bit repetitive with our previous conversations, but if you look back over the last few years, you'll remember that we've made price investments, we've made wage investments, and for a while we've been telling you that we think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to that. We use the term managing our price gaps deliberately because that's how we think about it. If we do need to make further price investments to drive growth or to ensure those baskets are in good shape, we can do that. Investing in our associates is always part of our plan. So I think you guys can expect that we'll continue to do it.\nWhat's happening with business mix and this quarter, in particular with inventory management, puts us in a position where we do have even more flexibility to make a variety of choices. And so we're doing that every week and every month as we manage our business through the quarter and through the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please receive your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, good morning and thanks for taking my one question. You know, my question is that during the commentary, you know, Doug and John David, you guys talked about deflation in both general merchandise, in food and consumables. And then you talked about rollbacks in April being up 45%. And then you also talked about gross margin strength in the Walmart US business. Can you help us think about that going forward?\nShould we?\nAre you? And how are you doing that? Is it really just the advertising, digital advertising, and marketplace fulfillment, and all those things are helping the gross margin so much that it's more than offsetting gross margin core gross margin weakness? Maybe help us think about how to think about that going forward.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nRobbie, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to gross margin, we're having a conversation inside the company about the fact that the composition of it is changing. We don't want to confuse people about what's happening. We are built. Our purpose is to help people save money and live better. We'll manage our merchandise margins like we always have and make sure that we're providing value. But as we report gross margin, it does reflect newer businesses that are helping us mix things up.\nAnd so we're using terms inside the company like our merchandise or product margins as distinguished from gross margins. So maybe, John David, as we think about our future reporting, we should help kind of clarify that a bit so that people don't have the wrong perception that gross margins are going up as a result of price. They're not. If you look at rollbacks, for example, as John mentioned in the US and as we mentioned earlier this morning, we're seeing a lot of rollbacks. Suppliers participate in a majority of those, but not all of them. We're going to lead on price, and we're going to manage our margins, and we're going to be the Walmart that we've always been. But it's also great news that the business mix is changing, which does change gross margin performance.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYeah, Robbie, there's maybe three points that I'd make in response to your question. The first is that overall inflation level for the business was up about 40 basis points for the quarter. That's half the rate of increase that we saw last year. So we're driving this revenue growth through more units, more foot traffic in stores, and feel really good about that in stores, that we're just becoming more relevant with consumers. So that's the first point. Second point around gross margins is we've mentioned several times that inventory is in a much better place. One of the key consequences or results of that is we see a lot less markdowns in our business. So that drove some of the improvement in the first quarter.\nThe third point and the one that I'd want to emphasize the most here, if you look at the composition of our operating income improvement year over year, roughly $900 million, about 1/3 of that came from our newer businesses like Advertising, membership, Data Ventures, and we're quite excited about that. But combined with that, we're seeing improved eCommerce losses. And one of the things that I focus a lot on in our business is what is the incremental profit from that additional revenue that we have each year. So incremental margins. And if you just focused on our eCommerce business in this last quarter, the incremental margins around that business were 12.5%. So think about that. Roughly 3x our overall margin.\nThere's not, to me, a more compelling data point that supports the strategy that we have and our execution around that and, importantly, how that's changing the margin profile of our business going forward.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nThat sounds great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning.\nThank you so much for taking my question, as hard as it is to dimension. How would you break down the factors that are driving Walmart's business that are related to its actions and strategies versus those factors that are more of a function of the environment, such as high.\nInflation in a moderating labor market?\nWhat two or three metrics is Walmart?\nWalmart monitoring to internally gauge this? Obviously the point of the question is.\nTrying to understand not only the sustainability.\nOf the performance if the macro does.\nGet better, but also the prospect that the outperformance could exceed expand if the environment weakens.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThank you so much, Michael.\nI probably ignore the external environment more than you do. We are focused on what we're doing and how we earn business with customers and members. And if you look at what's happened, we've been known for price forever, but we're increasingly known for convenience. So whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary, whether customers have more money or less money, if we're doing a good job on the items, prices, and the service we provide, saving them money with pickup and delivery, for example, we can continue to grow share. So we're merchants at the core and we've added through the technological changes that we've made and the service changes that we've made a dimension to the business that's driving that growth. I don't know what the future looks like in terms of what pricing is going to look like a year out, two years out.\nI don't really worry about that very much. I worry about our own execution.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nCEO, Sam's Club\n\nNot much to add there, but I think the results this quarter are really a reflection of execution across the team. We're laser focused on the things that matter most to our customers. One data point that I'd share just in the US business and John might want to chime in on this, but you know Michael, that we grade ourselves by a Perfect Order and what a Perfect Order is for us is when you come to our virtual store online, do you find the things that you want? Do we have to replace those? Is it delivered when we say it will be delivered year over year? In Q1 we saw an almost 900 basis point improvement in our Perfect Order scores. To me, that's a great example of how the team is continuing to execute. This is resonating with customers.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nHey Michael, good morning. It's John. I'd say something similar to what Doug said. We're always focused on value, and over the last few years we've been talking about flexibility and the ability to be convenient whether a customer wants to shop at the counter, at the curb, or delivery. It's been exciting to see just these last few months that delivery is now exceeding the other channels, which is great. Which gives the customer a lot of optionality. And then the number that Doug mentioned earlier, 4.4 billion units delivered same day, next day, is exciting, and it's growing quickly. And as he also mentioned, about 20% of that is sub three hours, and we've expanded that service earlier in the morning, later at night.\nSo we're becoming even more convenient for individuals, for shoppers, and families in terms of being able to serve all of their needs.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nThose underlying input metrics we're focused on around the world in our Sam's US business and international. The commonality between the strategies, first party, e-commerce, marketplace, advertising, and membership causes us to increasingly be thinking about the same thing as we build these new businesses.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nYeah, I mean I would just add in like, you know, you look in Chile is probably our market that's had the least amount of growth. The economy has been tough. There, as we focused on input metrics like NPS, in-stock, our price perception, price gap, market share. If you focus on those things when the economy starts to recover, the business lifts with it. While we're doing that, you're also getting in and making sure that you're building out more sustainable businesses around eCommerce. So over 60% of our eCommerce orders are same-day in Chile now. So I think we have shown that we can prosper and thrive in kind of multiple different versions of how the economy plays out across the world.\nI think during this time as we're focused on building out our e-commerce omni business, we're being more and more relevant to consumers in different markets.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nI think for Sam's Club it's very similar. We've got, we had a really balanced set of results in Sam's Club and you know, as John mentioned, you know, it's all in the hands of the associates and the hard work that they did. But the value proposition is really resonating with the club model. It's great items at great value and we'll just never relent on that and members are thanking us for it. Plus membership is an all-time high. Plus membership is at 54% of our member base right now and it's up 330 basis points in the year.\nWhy?\nBecause we're focusing on the things that really matter. Deepening digital engagement with our members. 18% e-commerce growth and 1/3 of our members are using Scan and Go now, which is really exciting. We are enhancing our member value proposition constantly. Prices is part of it, but value is an important component too. I think you've all heard that we've got 120 of our stores or our clubs today that have got the new exit technology that's powered by AI and computer vision. That's really exciting. And then Member's Mark, which is our own brand, is really setting the bar for quality as well as value. It's now over 1/3 of our sales, and we are seeing really strong participation in the quarter. So people just want really great items at really great value, and we just continue to give them that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats on a great quarter. So, Kath, I wanted to ask you on international opportunities. In particular, the performance was really strong. I think you put up your best operating margin over six years. So can you talk about the sort of the main drivers behind the improvement, just how you're thinking about international structure on a go forward basis as you have alternative value streams that are ramping. eCommerce contribution is improving. All regions are posting very strong top line growth. And I just wanted to ask if there's anything you can share regarding Flipkart's contribution. How has that changed relative to the acquisition as we've been reading reports that at one point you're ramping up for an IPO. Thank you.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. There's quite a few components to that. I'll try and take them in chunks. First of all, I want to recognize all of our associates in International for the extraordinary strong result that we've been able to deliver over the last period. You're right, it is a really strong result. Top line was up 10.7%. Bottom line, operating income was up 27%. Now I would like to call out that. That's not. That's kind of extraordinary. There were some one-offs that went into Q1 operating income, which aren't repeatable, but we are holding to the ratio of bottom line growing faster than top line. So we see strength in International, particularly in the way that we are turning up as kind of more of an ecosystem.\nSo if you look in Walmex, while we have grown the traditional business, we've been looking at how we make sure we're relevant to consumers. In areas like where we had consumers that couldn't engage with us online, we've been able to provide a service that enables them to get digital connectivity. And what that means is that we now have different revenue streams coming in. I think we have over 13 million customers who've engaged with us on Bait, which is our digital connectivity. We've sold a number of health memberships. So the composition of that business as well as having our Cashi financial services looks different, and that's helping drive the different kind of economics and more richer operating income. As we look at then at e-comm across the globe, I probably call out China.\nI know I've called out the China market before, but really strong growth in Sam's Club and that business is almost 50-50 offline and online. While we're doing that, I think this quarter our bottom line grew faster than our top line in Sam's Club. So really good strength because they've worked out a model of dark stores that give them access to a larger addressable area of the market and allow them to deliver really, really efficiently. So our e-com omni business is growing in a sustainable way. Then as you talk about Flipkart, I think the things that we've seen with Flipkart that we really like is as their business has grown, we've seen Myntra get to EBITDA.\nPositive.\nFor the last two quarters, we've seen a growth in some premiumization, and all of that is lifting the profile of the Flipkart business. And so where they're on track to the growth trajectory that we had them on. And, you know, we are looking and exploring when would be the right time to IPO that business. But now there's strong growth in Flipkart and in PhonePe, and we're excited about the India market.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please receive your question.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi.\nThank you.\nWithin General Merchandise, what categories are you most excited about? What do you see happening with innovation opportunities and or opportunities for improvement? As we think about General Merchandise as well, the intersection of artificial intelligence, large language models, and also really changing the way consumers think about shopping. Just what's on your mind for enhancing that and embracing the marketplace as you've been doing, to continue to elevate the brand.\nThank you.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nCEO, Sam's Club\n\nYou know, general merchandise is a really core part of all of our businesses. And it's something in Sam's Club that we're really excited about. We have brands that are extreme value, and we feel really good about that. And we've got Member's Mark, where we have incredible value and quality. And what we're seeing is that members are opting into us as a brand and renewing membership with us because we offer such high quality at such high value. So what we're seeing is that people are continuing to opt into us. Our units are running ahead of our sales on general merchandise because of the value. So we, you know, we feel really bullish. You think about apparel, jewelry, home hardlines, auto, and consumer electronics. We're seeing really strong unit growth in there, and it's just been followed.\nIt's because of value and it's because of innovation. You know, we remain really bullish in that space.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nHey, Oliver, it's John. Good morning. We've talked about a couple of things in GM, and I think at first, start with eCommerce. The strong performance at 22% growth is, is very helpful. We've picked up momentum in the marketplace. Really, really pleased to see a number, a really large number of new sellers come on board and assortments well over, well north of 400 million. We spend a lot of time talking about our customer experience score, which starts with the top of the funnel. Then we work our way all the way down to conversion. As John David mentioned earlier, one of the components is perfect order, and as you look through results, it's exciting to see more customers shopping more often, particularly in the marketplace. The categories that are really strong that are standing out is apparel and fashion online.\nI'm really excited about what's happening in men's, women's, and kids apparel. We've seen growth there, and then our hardlines business has been strong over the quarter. It was helpful in the quarter to have Easter early and strong weather in March. That gave us a strong early start. These businesses we call Omni services, like tire installation as we mentioned earlier, having your prescription ready by ordering online or cake decorating. These are all great services that are relatively unique to Walmart to be able to enable those from a digital standpoint all the way through the store and then deliver to people's homes. So I really am excited about the convenience, the expansion, and assortment that we're offering.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nWe've punched below our weight on general merchandise, specifically in apparel and home, for a really long time, maybe forever. I think the progress that we're seeing now is driven by the in-store remodels and in e-commerce. The marketplace is a great opportunity, but 1P will be important too. We've now got tools that we can use to grow the general merchandise business that we didn't have before. As it relates to the other part of your question, I think the thing worth mentioning is the progress we're seeing on search. I'm really excited about a solution-oriented search and this migration that many of us are on to try and create a personal assistant so that we can be more anticipatory, save people more time, and help them with solutions more than what our previous search capability could do.\nSo, I think that's going to be on a maturity curve from now until the end of the, and Generative AI has helped us step change that, and I expect that that improvement will continue.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\nBest regards.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning everyone. I wanted to focus on operating expenses and thinking about the investments planned for this year.\nIf I recall, there was a first.\nHalf weighting in the guidance originally. I know some of that was a year-over-year dynamic. Any update on how to think about that? And more specific to the second quarter? It looks like you set up guidance very similar to how you set up Q1. I'm just curious, is there anything different about the opportunity in Q2? In other words, could there be a bigger step up in spending or anything else that may limit the flow through that we were able to see here.\nThanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Seth. Happy to take the question. This is John David, so when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year in last quarter's call, we talked about the first half of the year. We'd likely see that sales would outpace operating income. Maybe that's unlikely now with this result in Q1, but we did have some planned investment in Q2 related to some technology investments. We've also got a little higher depreciation year over year in terms of the opportunity in Q2 relative to Q1. There are a couple things I want to call out in Q1 that likely would not repeat themselves, but I don't want to take away from the team's strong performance.\nThe first of those is just strong seasonal events in the first quarter in International that helped us, and we also lapped a LIFO charge last year at Sam's, which contributed to some of the operating income growth. Those are likely not to repeat themselves, so the possibility for outperformance in Q2 may be less than what it was in the first quarter. That said, I don't want to take away the headline here, and we feel really good about how the team is operating, feel really good about what the year holds for us, and the opportunity to outperform the guidance that we've given.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please receive your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, good morning.\nThanks for taking our questions. Wanted to just go back to business mix, I guess with the continued strong growth in marketplace, I guess when you look at the performance of general merchandise and Walmart US, that marketplace sales would obviously skew higher towards those discretionary categories. You noted the 420 million SKUs there. So I guess the question is, is the impact of 3P marketplace growth at all starting to cannibalize, maybe in a good way, the general merchandise comps that you provide? Or would the performance of general merchandise be stronger if you looked at it more holistically from a total GMB standpoint?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nLet me start on this, and others may want to jump in. So first of all, as you think about the mix of our business, we've continued to have a headwind as consumer wallets have been stretched, and for us that's resulted in about 100 basis points shift away from General Merchandise to other categories of our business in the first quarter. We expect that to continue or some magnitude of that for the balance of the year. But to me the real story here around General Merchandise is the progress that we're making in our marketplace. And so while General Merchandise is call it roughly flat digital, there are categories like pets and beauty where the growth in the marketplace is in excess of 30%. There are other categories like furniture, sporting goods that are in excess of 20%.\nI think this shows that consumers, customers are coming to us thinking of us very differently than what they have in the past. It's also an indication of how and where we're gaining share in our business. General merchandise being able to offer third-party assortment is giving our customers a lot more options than what they've had in the past.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart",
    "content2": "I think general merchandise mix was impacted by food inflation to a degree. You know, when food shot up to mid double digits, there are a lot of customers that had their paycheck allocated that direction. And now that food pricing has calmed down some and we've got rollbacks happening in food and you've got a deflationary situation with gm. You've got the opportunity given elasticity to grow more units, which we're doing. And the fact that we're growing share feels good. So I don't get too caught up, Kelly, on whether the sales come through stores, clubs, first party, or marketplace. We just want to have what people are looking for and we'll manage the mix on the other end of it in a way that generates more profitability, which is what you're seeing in this quarter.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, thank you guys. You mentioned that within Walmart US that.\nYour share gains were led by the higher income households, I believe.\n\n[Company Representative] (Walmart)\n\nCompany Representative, Walmart\n\nCurious how you define that?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nWhat percent of your customer base the.\n\n[Company Representative] (Walmart)\n\nCompany Representative, Walmart\n\nHigher income households comprise and how you're targeting that consumer.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nAlso curious, how does that consumer's engagement with Walmart changed?\nThanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYeah, this is John David. I'll start. So we define where we stratify the income groups roughly as $50,000 and below, $50,000 to $100,000, and then $100,000 and above. As a general rule, our customer base breaks down about 1/3 in each group. So in terms of what we're doing to be more attractive to that higher income household, I think this is really the story or the word we've been using here is convenience. We are not just a play for value anymore. We talked about the number of units that we've shipped in the last 12 months, which is on par with any eCommerce player in the world. That shows that customers are coming to us and we're a consideration where we haven't been before. Convenience matters to someone, irrespective of what your paycheck is, irrespective of what your income level is.\nWe expect that to be durable. We don't expect that to change.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nYeah, John David, I just added that it's also been encouraging to see the improvements in fresh food. We've definitely experienced benefit from improvements in quality. The supply chain's gotten tighter. Many of you have seen the work we're doing in supply chain, but produce has been really exciting to see the progress over the last couple years. The same sort of quality improvements are coming through in the meat department. You can see that in the types of items and categories that we're selling in store and those in pickup and delivery and in the delivery business, where we are stronger with higher income consumer, that's where we've seen a lot of growth. I'm really excited, Doug. What you mentioned earlier is Better Goods as being a way to sell better quality, better taste profiles, and at values that really matter.\n70% of the items under $5 is exciting. That appeals to all income groups. And so if you're trying to feed a family of four or five or six, and prices in restaurants have gone up, and Walmart it's beginning to come down, and we're really proud of the rollbacks. I think our value message is strong, and having the ability to deliver flexibly is going to work out really well for us.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nWe're not trying to chase higher income.\nCohort sales. We just offer value. If you look at what's happened historically, people with higher incomes have shopped Walmart. They've just been selective in their categories that they buy and the items that they buy. So if we offer them the right items at the right prices, whether that's in store, first party or marketplace, they'll respond to that. And so as we've been able to expand our assortment online, we can appeal to more people. And then you layer on the convenience dimension and you get a good outcome.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThank you, Dennis.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nGood luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nAnalyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a really great quarter. Just wondering if you can discuss trends you're seeing within general merchandise between smaller ticket shorter replacement items versus higher ticket longer replacement items, and if any shifts in spending within the categories reflect anything about whether the consumer is making any incremental changes in their discretionary spending. And just as a quick follow up, just curious if there was any deviation or big change in trend throughout the quarter by month.\nThank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nYeah, Chuck, good morning. It's John. I'll take it. I think the best way to describe the consumers; it's been remarkably consistent over the last couple years. Mix has changed but hasn't changed that much. We've seen growth in both brands and private brands. We have seen a wide, wide range of price point selling in the quarter. March was a strong month given Easter was in the month. We had leap year in February. That was also helped make it stronger. So the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that surprising. It was strong in February, strong again in March. Weather was favorable in March, a little bit colder, and then April was softer without Easter in it. But we walked out of the quarter into the month of May with similar trends that we've been seeing.\nSo the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that different than we expected. I think as you know, looking forward, the consumer is consistent. Our inventory is in good shape. Our merchants, we said this a few minutes ago, they have the ability to mix out. They're managing their price gaps and value; they're managing initial margins. Their markdowns have been lower due to stronger inventory management. A little bit of improvement this year in shrinkage from prior to the previous years. We've been going up for the last three years, and it's good to see that starting to come down in some places in the country. But we'll mix this out. Our merchant team, they've done this for a while, and in any situation with the consumer, we want to focus on value and be there for them, and we'll manage the mix on the backside.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nAnalyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nThanks, Sean.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So just going back to the commentary on Walmart+, it sounds like it's growing double digits as we look at the backdrop out there for membership and subscriptions. You're clearly seeing a more crowded landscape. So just want to get a sense of how you guys feel about the value proposition today and then further opportunities to differentiate Walmart+ going forward. It's John. I'm pleased with the progress in Walmart+. It is an important part of what we do, and it is a great way for customers to save time and save money. By joining Walmart+, you get access to unlimited deliveries, which is great. And I talked to a lot of people across the country that use it all the time.\nIt's also been important for us to improve the Perfect Order. As we mentioned earlier, we launched Walmart+ in 2020 at a time when the supply chain was difficult. And so the continued momentum and improvements and being able to fulfill customers' orders with what they ordered, when they ordered has been important. But again, it's an important part of what we do. We think it's a great solution for customers and it's been exciting to see the progress.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nGreat.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO, Walmart US\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Greg Melick with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGreg Melick\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks.\nI'd like to pivot a bit back.\nTo the top line. I think you said inflation was 40 basis points in the quarter. If you look at your guidance for the rest of the year, do you expect it to settle at that kind of low level or even fall further?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nGreg, we expect it to be relatively close to what we saw in the current quarter. You know, it's a mix across the baskets. We've seen general merchandise be more deflationary, but consumables and food are hovering slightly above flat to up 1. So we generally expect it to be in this level.\n\nGreg Melick\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we've reached the end of the question and answer session, and I'll turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nThank you all for joining the call. Again, thanks to our associates for a really strong quarter. When I think about the headlines in the quarter, what goes through my mind is first, the eCommerce growth. I think the progress we're making on convenience for customers is a big deal, and that's happening through our store fulfillment as well as through fulfillment centers. The marketplace is growing, and that brings along with it growth in advertising and membership. It was great to see both of those up 24%. Second, headlines really did good inventory management, and the third headline is related to pricing. I think the number of rollbacks that we have and the value that we're offering to customers and members is resonating, and those really set this quarter apart. Big picture, our thought is the same as it has been.\nWe're going to be able to grow sales because we're positioned to serve people how they want to be served. We're going to grow profit faster than sales because of business mix, and we're going to be able to grow returns as we make the right capital investments. So we'll be really consistent as it relates to that through the year. We appreciate your time and attention.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\n[Company Representative] (Walmart)\n\nCompany Representative, Walmart\n\nSee y'all in chat. We're here. It's 8 o'clock.\nClock.\nI made it. Okay.\nLet me make. Let me get this all set up. How are y'all doing tonight on this fine evening? Not been a fine day. It's been a really horrible weather day. We all been in, like, horrible weather situations. Hey, girl. Hey.\nHi.\nHi, girl. Hi, Susan.\nOh, no. It takes me a second to get all situated.\nHi. Hi, Sarah. Hi, Melissa.\nY'all, we're just going on. We're gonna have a real chill time tonight. It's been.\nA day. It's really today. No, today's Tuesday. It felt like a Monday, for sure. Hi, Leanne. Hi, Ludy. Hi, Ashley. Hi, Kim. Hi, Kyla. Your power's out. I would be in a hot, hot mess and more of a hot mess than I am in every day if I had no power right now. Hey, Sherry. Hi, Connie. Hi, Lisa. Thank you. I do look so cute, don't I? I'm telling y'all, I need to navigate to these first. Literally Walmart. Literally Walmart. Even my shoes.\nBut they're out of stock. But these pajamas. Let's see if we can. Let's see if I can click on this first. If you didn't get them on my story, like if you did not. What? What are you waiting on? Let's go ahead and just pull that. You get them right now because they are $6.45.\nOh, no.\nHold on, hold on. They were $6.45 earlier.\nAre they not?\nOh. Oh. Well, if you didn't buy one my stories, you missed the boat, honey bunches, because they're now back up to $14.98. It's fine, though. I paid $14.98 for these. It wasn't until I looked up these to share with y'all and I'm like, oh, my God, I got ripped. And y'all are getting a deal.\nOh, they're sold out. Oh. And your size are in all sizes medium. If you're a medium girl, hop on it. Hi, Denise. Hi, Carol. Okay, so, yes, these come in this pink leopard. They come in a regular gray leopard, I think. Yeah, yeah. And y'all can navigate to the colors. I do believe.\nThat green is real cute. Can y'all see that green or do I have to navigate?\nSorry, I'm malfunctioning. Malfunctioning Barbie.\nWe watched it several times. Okay, so I'm in the small. And I would say they're probably pretty true to size.\nLet me see if I can get y'all a little.\nShow. This is where they hit me. The bottoms are like a jogger, so they kind of have that, like the elastic of the ankle. They get tighter. Then there's kind of loose things throughout.\nHave this little tie. I have mine tucked, but I also got them in.\nThe pink, the solid pink, which I'm pretty sure all of the solid pinks are sold out in every size. But they're like super buttery soft. I love the ribbed material.\nIf I was a pajama, like, I could never walk by these and not, not grab them. Oh, Lord. Sorry.\nThis is not an easily movable chair. All right.\nYou got them for $648. Well, praise God. I'm glad a lot of y'all did, based on my.\nInsights, whatever you call them. So, yes, grab these. I'm gonna go ahead and move on to the next. Some of y'all are probably a little sick of this already. I got a size small. I would say they're pretty true to size.\nLet me see if I can show these next pajamas. Next.\nThese.\nYep, here they are. Okay. These pajamas that you've seen in my last two reels.\nOur same material, same brand, same.\nWell, they're not ribbed. Same material as in, like the soft, stretchy. These aren't ribbed, but they're the same brand. Absolutely adorable. I got the medium in these because these button down shirts.\nTend to run a little short. Not necessarily small, but short. I like some length on it.\nI was sized up to a medium, and I'm glad I did. A small would fit me, but I prefer medium. Does that make sense? This is the shirt and the bottoms. They also have these in a long sleeve.\nYes, Joyce Bun. Yes, Chrissy. They do have it in a dress. Yes. At the end, I might be able to go and like navigate to the other styles in this pattern, but they also have a cherry.\nLook.\nHow cute. It's like a little. I mean, it's kind of like that. Kind of like this. This is cuter in my opinion, but I love that. Super cute.\nOkay, so yes, Joyspun Walmart. Joyspun pajamas. You can't go wrong buying any of them. They are all wonderful.\nRemember, I got. Was it the pumpkin pie ones for Thanksgiving?\nLove this. All right, like, I'm now collecting these for like every season. I'll have me a valentine. Hopefully they'll come out with a leprechaun.\nWhat else? Easter bunnies. All right, so we got these.\nI left my rack over there. Doing a little different, different tonight.\nOkay.\nNext. What I would really love to pay. I'm going all out of order.\nIt's fine.\nSomething that will be great to pair with those pajamas that I just shared is this. You guys. This is under $20. And it is.\nThat same material. I think I share something from Walmart in this material. Every live that we all love. This little cardigan.\nCan y'all see the texture on the screen? Plush, super, super soft material that you could wear with your pajamas if you have the short sleeve version. Some people are like real.\nCutting my head off.\nIf you are hot natured and you prefer to sleep in a short pajama, but you want that you're cold like before you go to bed. This is super cute. So just a little cardigan with the pockets and it's like you're just sitting in your blanket. It's literally like a blanket.\nYes, yes, yes, yes. So cozy. And it comes in.\nWhite like a rose pink. What I call it pink.\nYeah. Under 20. So love, love, love this. I'm gonna take it off because I get real hot with these lights and showing all this, y'.\nAll.\nOkay, next up, let's see.\nOkay, so this top I shared several weeks back, maybe like a month or two ago. Y'all loved it, so I found it, or I thought I found.\nIt in another.\nLet's see.\nLet me just tell you that you can't get this one. The purple is gone.\nBut it's a lot like this.\nWinter white one. A little bit different stitching, but I meant to bring that one in here. It's in my other closet. Love, love, love that sweater. If it's true to size, I'm pretty sure I got a medium in this one. I want to say I got a small in that one. Anyway, all of these just mixed stitch sweaters are amazing. And you can dress them down with leggings and just like chill. Or you can totally dress them up with a bunch of jewelry.\nBoots, a fur coat, and make them super cute.\nLet's see if it'll show me on here. I think most colors are sold out, though. Oh.\nIt's telling me it's having technical issues.\nThere we go. Yeah. If you happen to be in Excel, looks like that's in stock.\nYeah. So, love that. It was one of my favorites and it was one of my top sellers for like two weeks.\nDid I get?\nI get so messed up when this stuff goes out of stock and had this whole plan, and then it's gone. Okay, here's this one. Okay, so purple. On the topic of purple. Subject, topic. This cardigan is adorable. I love the.\nLike, pastel purple. And while it is not this one.\nThis is the closest they have. So my store had this. I immediately got it. And the pink, because, I mean, how cute. And they said they don't sell this item online, so this is the closest I could find. Tried and true. Tried and true. This one's just a little bit more sheer.\nYeah, I guess sheer. It's not going to keep you quite as warm. It's going to be more of like a for looks, for style.\nBasically the same colors. Also comes in the pink. Like this one.\nI sized up to a medium in these just because I like more of an oversized fit for my sweaters.\nBut the small would have fit, so it's just, again, personal preference. However you like your item to fit you. And then it also comes in black.\nBlack and cream. It's not white. All right, let's do a poll and see the last two favorites.\nI wish we could do one of these in the store. How cool would that be? Actually? Wouldn't be cool. People be staring. People stare all the time. The pajamas. Knew it. You cannot go wrong. Cannot go wrong with those.\nAll right.\nNext up, we have.\nOkay. If you like the pink color.\nI got you just a little bit of a different style. So this is basically like that cardigan, but it goes all the way down, and it's a dress. How cute is that? So I guess it depends on where you live, but you could take this into the spring. If you live in a little bit of a colder climate, you can throw on your denim jacket and call it Easter.\nOr you can wear it with your tall boots and be a winter pink snow queen, which is how I plan to wear it.\nIt comes in this really pretty teal color. The paint color.\nBlack.\nAnd.\nAre y'all still here?\nI hope you are. My line just went black.\nDoes it run to the size? Yes. So I tried this on. Like I said, I guess my true size is more like a small now, and it fit me good. It's not going to be loose. It's going to be more of like a fitted dress.\nAre y'all still here? Can someone just raise a hand?\nDo the hearts need? Okay, you're here. Okay. I don't know why mine went black. And it's like completely gone. It's fine as long as y'all are here. All right.\nSo, yeah, there's that. And again, under 20. These are all great deals.\nOkay, I know a lot of y'all are here for today's ootd, which is this supercharged pink puffer.\nY'.\nAll.\nIs this not the best freaking pink? I love, love, love, love, love it. So the one that I had from the other retailer that y'all loved that has been sold out. I actually think this is a prettier pink. It's like a. It's bright, but it's not as deep. It's so, so pretty.\nIf pink is not your thing, it comes in.\nThe sea turtle, which I love. A good green, black, and white. And I love the black stitching on the white. Is that not adorbs? So cute with black leggings and your black and white on cloud. Yeah, love, love. But of course, pink is my fave. Comes in extra small through 3x, and I believe it's fully stocked in all sizes. And obviously you can see that the pink is a lot more bright than what it shows. It's not like a. That's like a fuchsia. What? It's shown online. And this is like a hot bubble gum. It's good. It's good, y'.\nAll.\nLove, love, love it. And it's also not going to be super short. It's not like a cropped vest. I wouldn't say it's super long. I mean, if you saw it on me today, you'll know. But.\nThis is.\nAbout where it comes.\nSo cute. This is a small. It's got pockets. The pockets are actually.\nFleece lined, so you're going to stay nice and cozy.\nI burned up. I burned up all day wearing this. Now, my office does stay a little hot, but love it. It's got little neck things. Got the hood, which I utilized this morning. It was downpouring, absolutely monsooning.\nIs the hood removable? Good question. Tammy, is the hood removable?\nThe hood removable? Yes, Tammy, the hood is removable.\nYes, girl, I got you.\nYay. That's cute. So, like, if you like, like the less bulky up around your neck.\nLove. Oh, Lord. I've been exposed and tracks.\nOh, if you know, you know. Bless. Okay. Yes, I am in the small. I would say it's true to size.\nAnd then it's also got these little cinch things you want to, like, cinch your waist in.\nI ain't got time for all that. I just hadn't even pulled those. Okay.\nThe knees, girl. You know, if you know, you know. I tried to hide them with the head. Headband. Worth riding over here. Okay. Has everyone added to cart? Okay, moving on.\nOkay, this got here today. I was hoping it would get here on time. This pink waffle shacket, y'all, if it's waffle, I want it. Whether that be food or clothing. Love a waffle.\nYou can wear these so many different ways. Unbuttoned with the tank, buttoned. Buttoned with a vest with a denim jacket. This is just like a good staple piece to have in your closet.\nCan y'all see this? It keeps blocking me. Okay.\nI did size up, so I got the medium.\nWe're just having a little try on sesh tonight, aren't we? I usually don't have stuff that I can, like, put on as much as I do tonight, but it also comes with. Pink's not your thing. Don't know why you're here. Just kidding. Just kidding. But it also comes in green, navy, and beige. Love a good beige. Goes with everything.\nAlright.\nI need an assistant to come unbutton all my stuff and hang on my stuff so I don't have these awkward pauses. All right.\nAm I taking too long? Should I be doing this?\nSo you can see.\nIt's got booty coverage.\nSee how the hem, it's like a high, low, so it covers your booty. No need to worry about that.\nIt probably covers the situation too. But I'd be a little bit more wary about all that. But for sure, for sure. Your booty. Or maybe it's because I have no booty anymore. If you know, you know.\nSo there you go. This is the medium in something like this. I definitely would want the medium. I would not want to size down to the small. I would not like the way that that fits just for this particular style. So size up. If you like the waffle knit, I love it. And it's not super heavy. It's not super light. I would say it's about a medium, medium weight.\nThese are so nice because they go with leggings, jeans.\nReally. Any kind of bottom. Then you can either dress them up or dress them down with your shoe. Whatever shoe. You decide.\nNext.\nNext. Oh, this is gonna be depressing. I don't know that this one's in stock, but I know it's in stock in some people's sizes. So.\nIf you are 1x.\nToday is your lucky day. I think 1x 2x 3x, it's all in stock.\nThe pink one, same for the pink, 1x, 2x, 3x.\nFor sizing reference, I got the medium, and I would say I could fit in the small.\nSo if that gives you any help on sizing.\nThis.\nis how the medium looks. This one will fit. This is going to be more of like an oversized cover-your-booty fit, versus like a short, more fitted sweater. But the sleeves are nice, bell sleeves. I love a good bell sleeve. And then it's got the hearts.\nAll over it. I knew. I knew it wouldn't last. I knew it wouldn't last, but I had to get it because, I mean, cute.\nAnd then comes in black.\nNo.\nLooks like 2x and 3x.\nIs that one as well?\nBut hey, grab it up, girl. Grab it up if that is you, because that is adorbs and $20. Can't beat it.\nOkay, this is more of a.\nSorry, I'm getting sidetracked.\nOkay.\nThis is like a little more casual option. I love everything.\nHow do you say it? Aviation Avia.\nIt's Walmart's, like, main athletic brand.\nGreat, great.\nThis is just kind of like a little purpley.\nMore of a fitted. This is kind of like a spandex material. Can y'all see?\nSpandex material? It has the thumb holes in the arm. It's got the little cinch thingies. I guess if you wanted to.\nCinch in, like an estimate while you're running. I don't buy this stuff to work out, and I buy this stuff to look like I work out. I love. I love it, though. Like, just chilling mom uniform.\nYes.\nBut, yeah, there's no pockets. It's just like a normal top. Nothing too special about it, but it's nice to just have something to grab and go and throw on. That doesn't take much effort or thought, but it's so cute. So comes in this color. A gray.\nOh, that would be pretty. Of course it sold out. Look how pretty. What is that, Peri? Like a periwinkle. Love that. Maybe you can find it in your local store. Or the gray. I didn't even check the size, the availability.\nOkay, so here's this.\nI have another little kind of athleisure set to share.\nThis. This haul has been a lot of kind of like chill, chill things. That's what we're all doing at the beginning of the year, right?\nChilling, trying to make it. All right, so here's the top.\nThis is just a little basic hoodie and pant outfit. Now, they're not that they're sold separately, so they have the joggers and the coordinating hoodie. This material.\nIt's not spandex.\nBut it's not 100%.\nCotton, I do not believe. But it's like super soft. Super super soft. And the inside is fleece-lined, so whatever kind of soft, minimal stretch material on the outside, fleece on the inside. And I love a matching set. I mean, you can't go wrong. I think it comes in black, gray, camo, that's your thing. And maroon, merlot.\nBut the pink and black are my faves. And I got the small.\nThese look a little big. I've not tried these on yet. I was actually going to wear this today. Then I was like, no, I'm wearing that, wearing that vest because I need the hood and the water repellent because it was horrible. But these are again, like, a jogger style. And jogger styles are always like bigger. They're not fitted like leggings. So. But I like the little design on the booty, kind of just how it has that little piece of trim.\nI don't know if you can see that.\nAnything to help the buttocks area. Right?\nSo yeah, it's got a little pocket, simple as that. Let me navigate over to the.\nPants. It washes. Has this, you guys. It washes well. Thank you, Sam. Very good info. We always need to know wash. And so. This Joy spun stuff washes great as well. My Christmas pajamas.\nMy Joy spun Christmas pajamas that I got like in every Christmas pattern. They've all washed great.\nSorry. Here we go. Here's the pants. Fuchsia burst. So, yeah, let me just show you if anyone is still pondering the vest, the difference in the color to see how like bubble gummy hot this is. Freaking love this. It's almost like my headband. And this is more of like your traditional fuchsia. So I don't know why the vest looks fuchsia-ish.\nOn the online picture.\nJessica says it runs bigger on the bottom, true to size on top. Okay, well that would make sense then.\nActually, so the black set I was wearing today.\nIt's Athletic Works. I think that's on here. Let me go ahead and go to that.\nYes. Okay, so this is also the black stuff that I have today is also Athletic Works.\nHowever, it's about half the price. That's because.\nI'll go get it. It's over here in a pile because I wore it today and stripped it right on off. But this one is going to be more of your traditional, like Gildan sweatshirt material. You know what I'm talking about. When you order a sweatshirt that has, like, a company name, that. That material, that is what this is. The ones that I just shared are more of, like, a luxury, like a soft tee, like a step up. And that's why they're a little bit more expensive, but it's more quality, so love them both. But what tipped me off on this was.\nI had the small in these as well. And.\nFirst off, y'all know me buying smalls. I'm like, what? But when I put these on, and they were, like, big and baggy, and like, well, dang, I need the extra small tall. Must be freezing over.\nI would size down in the joggers.\nIn both sides. Yes, yes. They're all saying that. Yes. Size down.\nLike, I don't know. I guess pair of joggers is always good to have. I don't love. Like, this wouldn't be my first pick. I would go for a true legging, but.\nThis was super comfy today, and pairing it with that vest was just the cutest little casual fit.\nAll right, let me click the shirt that goes with it. It's also on sale. $8. I think this is cheaper than a Chick-fil-A number one.\nSkip lunch tomorrow and buy yourself a shirt.\nThat one's pretty. Another.\nTalk. That periwinkle blue is really pretty.\nThe traditional gray is really pretty, too. We all need, like, a gray. A staple gray piece.\nAll right.\nNext up. Do I have a next up? I threw some shoes in here.\nI don't have them, but y'all always obsess over my sneakers. While these are not the ones. Let's see. Where did I put those? Let me grab them. I have. So let me navigate to them. If y'all can see this, I have this pair. Don't get excited. You can't get that pair. But you can get the sister pair that looks like this. And let me get.\nThem. I think.\nMaybe, like, my first live I ever did, maybe I shared these on, and I was like, they're fully stacked. I would buy them because they ain't gonna last, and they didn't last. I've kind of turned them into my own Golden Goose because they're a little dirty. They don't come dirty. They come very clean. And I made them. I inevitably made them dirty. But, yeah, a great pair of shoes. Love these. I wear these all the time. But if, you know, you know, I.\nI'm trying to wear shoes that I can link now, so I just got some new ones, but these are available, and they are true to size. If you are size six, seven, eight, nine, 10, or 11, they are in stock.\nMost wanted item. Let's see what that's gonna be for this live.\nAm I supposed to vote?\nDefinitely. A pajama.\nWell, I'll be. The basic sweatshirt wins today's ootd. Not the best. The best is the best part. Okay. Sorry.\nCassie. Good job, girl. She bought the leopard shoes when I first shared them. I'm telling you, these things do not last. They do not last. You've got to get them before the rest of the world finds out. And that's when. When we can't get our hands on anything. All right, then. These shoes are more of, like, a dressier pair. I thought they were pretty. For Valentine's Day at work, if you're wearing, like, black slacks and needed, like, a little shoe to pop out the pink heart of your.\nSweater that you're wearing. These are cute. They're $20. They're on sale. You'll save $12 from what they were back at Christmas time. They also come in a black. I love the toe as well. It's not pointy. It's not round, but it's kind of like. What is the nail people. Coffin. The coffin shape. It's trending. It's trending. You guys super cute.\nRed. Are we all ever red? Well, after Valentine's Day, I get over red, but I'm more of, like, a pink Valentine's girl. All right, Regina, pink leggings. Can you share again? Wide leg.\nThey are not wide leg. They are joggers.\nThe set.\nYes. Did y'all get the Walmart? I wonder if I can. Hold on, hold on. We're just gonna. We're gonna go out of the little lineup here. If you did not get yesterday's webcast.\nLeopard cardigan. Get it now. It's $12.98.\nLooks like it's available in every size. Yes. Let me go get in case you miss my yesterday. I had this on yesterday.\nGot so many compliments.\nYes, I hung it back up without washing. Call me dirty. Where's Karen? But I didn't get it dirty. Sorry. Here it is. It's so cute. And this is the medium because I actually bought this.\nMonths ago.\nWould be like a perfect time to wear it. It fits fine. I think the small would fit too. You know, it's just kind of like your average oversized fit.\nAdorable. It looks just like the picture. Absolutely.\nAdorable.\nI think the other patterns are mostly sold out.\nThat one's kind of cute. That one's kind of cute. Pink plaid. Oh, and it comes in a gray leopard too. If you're not like, this is a little much. I love stuff like this.\nDid y'all hear her? Okay.\nIs that everything I did? The shoes.\nCardigans.\nAll right, let me go find those pajamas real quick. Just because I said that I would.\nThey are the Joy. Fun.\nJoy.\nWhat would you call those?\nI have the black. I have the basic long sleeve shirt in pink.\nWe have the basic long sleeve shirt in pink.\nRefresh me. I'm not the basic. The ribbed one. The No Boundaries one.\nBecause I wore the No Boundaries ribbed tank with this yesterday.\nYes, yes. Yesterday's tank top. Let me just pull it right on up.\nThis is a great option because this is like less than a large Diet Coke.\nYou can get all the colors.\nJust have them. Staples for all your cardigans. Yep. 298. Here it is.\nThat's it. That was right. The pink that I wore is sold out, but see if you can add it to cart and pick up at your local store. The color I wore yesterday is called.\nHere. This one. Sandstone pink.\nSandstone pink. It looks like it's out of stock online, but you might could add it to cart for local pickup and $2.98. Come on. It's a great deal.\nAnd I also have the tan, the black, the white, the green. I have the brown. I have a bunch of colors. They're great.\nThe basic tea.\nGirl, I'm gonna have to look that up myself because I don't know what you're talking about. Influencer of the year.\nWhat size are you in the tank?\nI buy large in those because they are a juniors brand. So No Boundaries is juniors brand. So it runs a little smaller than like Time and Tru, which is a women's brand.\nHowever, yesterday I think I could have, like, it was kind of baggy. I think I could have done the medium, but that's still a size up from what I'd wear in women as a small. But these are the long sleeve. Is that what Cassie? Is that what you're talking about? The.\nI'm sorry to be calling you out.\nThe ribbed long sleeves just like this one.\nLet me grab this.\nI should have added them.\nBefore we got on.\nThey've got. So Walmart has like third-party sellers on here. So the best thing to do when you're like browsing Walmart site is to filter it.\nBy.\nNot brand, but I think seller.\nNo, I can't see it on here. Anyways, retailer. Thank you, Samantha. Thank you. I don't know. Okay.\nThe cotton pattern, did I share that? I'm completely drawing a blank. Oh, I had it in that rust color, the orange.\nI bet you that's what you're talking about. I wore it with that denim jumper.\nWhat was the original question? You have the basic. Honestly, pink.\nLong sleeve shirt. Pink, if it's that kind of like soft.\nPetals. Rose pink. If it looks like the.\nTank top, yes, I believe it would go.\nAre y'all seeing lingerie?\nThis is not where I'm supposed to be. I don't know if y'all can see what I'm saying, because I'm browsing, trying to find those pajamas, but I'm about to get. I'm gonna have to.\nShut this down here in a minute. Let me just see if I can. I think this might be it.\nIs this it? Is this it? No, these are. This is back to the originals. These, if you're just getting on. If you miss these, add the cart. Add to cart. Add to cart. Freaking fabulous.\nAnd honestly, like, if they don't have your size, that they have your size up, buy them and just run them through the dryer like that. If you love them, that's better than nothing, right?\nWhy can't I find those other ones?\nMaybe right here.\nI know y'all love when you get me blank staring into it. Scream.\nNo, that's all the Christmas ones.\nJoan, the pink vest. Yes, I can go back to the pink vest. Of course.\nLet me just try one more.\nLet me do joy on my scale.\nI can't believe y'all are still on here. All right, okay. I'll link them on my story, or I'll see if I can add them to this for when I post the link to reshop the live.\nWhen I can go find them. All right, let me get back to the pink vest real quick.\nPink vest. Pink vest. Pink vest.\nAnd if you are just getting on or if you got on late and missed the initial share of this, the online picture looks very fuchsia. In person. It is a really, really pretty bright pink.

Okay, where did I put that?\nThat was a No Boundaries. Y'all can. Y'all can exit if you want to. This is not gonna be any kind of riveting content, but that was one that I bought for my next live, not knowing when it was gonna be, but I knew that y'all would love it. And then it's still. Every time I scan it with my app, it says, we don't sell this item. Let me just take No Boundaries Heart.\nKeyhole sweater.\nI don't think it's going to be on here. I've scanned that thing so many times trying to get it to pull up. But look in store. So I've seen it. I've gone to multiple different Walmarts and multiple different cities, and I always see it. I thought for sure it would be online by now, but.\nIt might just not. Might just be one. It's not going to go online.\nSorry. That stinks. Because I love that sweater. I bought it in both colors, the pink and the cream.\nHave you seen the leopard sweater with the red heart? No. Tell me more.\nYes, for the leopard or for the pink? Athletic joggers, pink and black, size down.\nThey do run pretty big. But stay true to size in the tops or if you like your athleisure to be more kind of baggy, I would size up in the top.\nNobody's leaving. Are you?\nAll.\nAre y'all entertained right now? I was gonna wait just a second and see if.\nKim.\nCan you point me in the direction to show y'all this leopard sweater with red hearts? Sounds amazing, right?\nI believe this. That's what the customers they're looking for.\nWhy am I not following anything?\nWhat page am I on? Am I missing part of the chat?\nOh, is this something that I linked? Lord, Lord. I just need, like, a Walmart brand. What's the brand? What's the Walmart?\nOkay. Time and True. Time and True or No Boundaries. No Boundaries is the brand of the little heart rhinestone keyhole. But Time and True.\nTime and True. You said leopard.\nLeopard. Whether with heart.\nWoman's print cream. Next. There we go.\nNo, no. Sorry.\nNo, this is not what we're looking for. Yes. Yes. Did I. Am I.\nI wish we could, like, physically talk.\nYes. Yes. What? Yes. Oh, look at this one.\nThat one's cute.\nThat's cute. That's Time and Tru. I always like buying, like, the trusted brands like Time and Tru, No Boundaries. Tara Sky is one of the plus-size brands. But they're zero X's. I used to buy all kinds of stuff in the 0x that kind of just fit, like an extra large.\nThat one's super cute. But is this the one you were referring to? Love that. I'm loving like, all of the pink and red combos.\nNot it. I didn't think so. I didn't think so.\nI'm not seeing.\nI promise. Y'all can, y'all can leave. The number just keeps growing. Nothing. Nothing.\nCommentary. Women. Balloon sleeve.\nCheetah. SW. Unless you're an ex.\nThat's cute.\nCassie, girl. I know you're gonna have to get in my DMs after this because I'm obviously not following.\nI keep wanting to click and I can't tell if this is.\nOkay, well, I'll link it on Stories.\nIf I can find it, because I'm not. I can't navigate outside of Walmart and get on like to know it even though it's a Walmart item.\nAll right, thank you all again for joining. Hopefully I'll be back with more items soon.\nI think I'll do it on Stories. I think most of y'all vote for fashion every time.\nSamantha and Kim.\nWhat?\nOkay, hold on. She's got the link.\nI think y'all prefer fashion over, like, home. I really want to, like, get some home stuff going, but I think fashion. Fashion is where it's at.\nAll right.\nAwkward, awkward.\nYou like home better because most is not out of stock. True that. True that.\nAre y'all, like, doing any home organizing in the new year? Maybe I could do one with, like, some organizational items.\nWhat is the paint? Wow. There is literally, like, that pink heart. This one just a different color.\nIs it not available online anymore? Because that was the only.\nThe only option. Color is ant.\nOh, that's what I'm like. What is ant? When Kim said it. Okay, okay, Kim, the color is called ant.\nNo, I can't see your link. If you want to DM it on Instagram, these people are going to get mad at me. I gotta wrap this up.\nThe only color it's showing me is brilliant red. I don't see a color called ant.\nHere you are. Isn't she, Kim?\nYes. Okay, hold on, hold on.\n\nOperator\n\nAll.\n\n[Company Representative] (Walmart)\n\nCompany Representative, Walmart\n\nWe're about to find one final sweater.\nAll right, here we go.\nKim.\nOh, hi, Kim. You cute girl. Oh, Lord, I've missed your messages.\nI've not gotten back to you since September 28th. Sorry about that. I'm so sorry. Okay, I'll go read all these in a minute. Let me see. Oh, my God. That is adorable.\nLet me see what I can type in. Hold on, hold on.\nThe color really is called ant. I'm dying. I am dying. Okay, time is your woman's print.\nTime and true woman.\nPrint crew.\nNeck, letter, lid.\nWait.\nAnd.\nNow. That's not right. Now that's not right. Ah, there it is. There it is. There it is. Yes. Look at that. How cute. Oh, yeah. Y'all hit that mullet button. K. Kim, you have saved the day. Kim and Samantha, praise God for you.\nAll.\nYes. You found a valentine in stock. Flutter. That is adorable. Can I add it in my cart? I'm gonna go ahead and add it on my phone where I'm logged in right here. Why would they call that aunt? Whatever, it's fine.\nSo that. Hold on.\nLook at this one. So this must be, like, the new version. This version's brilliant red. That's super cute, too. I love that. Oh, I'm buying this, Ms. Berry. Yeah, it is a hidden gem we're, like, the first to know about. Y'all buy this before we relinquish it out into the interwebs. All the people who aren't on the live.\nAll right, hold on. I'm adding this to my cart. Does one of y'all have this? How's the sizing go? Do we size up, size down, true to size. TTS.\nYes. Samantha, please, never miss a live. You never know what you're gonna get. Sometimes it's meh. Sometimes it's a little out of control.\nTrue to size.\nI don't know what my true size is.\nIt just kind of depends. Okay, I'm gonna do.\nI'm gonna do this. It looks like one that's not super long. It looks like a normal sweater. I'm gonna do small because I'm going to pair with jeans. Not leggings.\nShipping select. It'll be here by.\nThursday, the 11th. That's two days the heck. Well, cash me on Friday in this sweater, y'all.\nAll right, add it to cart.\nAll right. Oh, you got the medium seating content. Oh, good idea.\nI just got some new jeans on the chair. Oh, all right, sorry. I'm thinking. I'm thinking out loud. That's never good. I'm gonna get the small just for how I'm gonna style it. But this is honestly personal preference. Get small. Get the medium however you like your clothes. But you know, we can fit in multiple different sizes. It's just how it fits.\nMore fitted, more loose. Yeah. Now, all right, I'm gonna get off of here because I have done run up all this time. I'm not country. Why did I talk like that? Look at my old face.\nOkay. Thank you all for coming. I had fun. I hope you found something. Hope you got something. Either just a break to talk with a friend or you actually found some type of item that you didn't know you needed. All right, see y'all later."

Welcome to Walmart's Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during today's call, please press star zero from your telephone keypad. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin.\n\nSteph Schiller Wissink\n\nSVP Investor Relations, Walmart\n\nThank you and welcome, everyone. The format of today's call will follow prior quarters. First, our CEO, Doug McMillon, will share his reflections on the quarter and year. Then our CFO, John David Rainey, will review our Q4 and fiscal 2024 Results, provide perspective on the key drivers of our financial framework, and offer initial guidance for fiscal 2025. Following these remarks, we'll take your questions. At that time, we will be joined by our segment CEOs, John Furner from Walmart US, Kath McLay from Walmart International, and Chris Nicholas from Sam's Club. In order to address as many questions as we can, please limit yourself to one question. Today's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, we are now ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to talk about our business. Our team delivered a great quarter, finishing off a strong year. We drove sales growth of 4.9% and adjusted operating profit growth of 10.9% in constant currency. Highlights include higher transaction counts and unit volumes, gains in market share in the US and internationally, improved in-stock levels with inventory being in great shape and down versus last year, strong performance in Walmart US customer experience scores, even during the high volume days before Christmas. Plus, this year, we passed $100 billion in global eCommerce sales for the first time. We had a very good holiday season. We were strong in the US, Mexico, Canada, and India, where we had the best Big Billion Days ever, and we continued the strong performance in China with the start of Chinese New Year.\nTypically, we see some of our customer experience scores dip during the high volume hours and days we experienced during the holidays. But during Q4, the Walmart US team delivered three-year high customer scores in our stores for pickup and delivery from stores, and for those orders that flow directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers. I'm excited about the omnichannel Net Promoter Score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that's resilient but looking for value. As always, we're working hard to deliver that for them, including through our rollbacks on food pricing in Walmart US. Those were up significantly in Q4 versus last year, following a big increase in Q3. Our general merchandise prices are lower than a year ago, and even two years ago in some categories, which means our customers are finding value in areas like apparel and hard lines.\nIn food, prices are lower than a year ago in places like eggs, apples, and deli snacks, but higher in other places like asparagus and blackberries. Dry grocery and consumables categories like paper goods and cleaning supplies are up mid-single digits versus last year and high teens versus two years ago. Private brand penetration is up in many of the countries where we operate, including the United States. During our Q3 call, I mentioned that we might find ourselves in a deflationary position early in calendar 2024. In Walmart US, we're there in general merchandise, but the slope of the decline softened during Q4, meaning the prices are lower than a year ago, but not as much as the trend line would have suggested at the end of Q3.\nWe saw the trend line for food and consumables in Walmart US soften too, resulting in our retail prices in food and consumables being slightly higher than a year ago. In total, for Walmart US, our year-end retail prices on like-for-like items were inflated by about 80 basis points. Importantly, we're encouraged by our strength in terms of units and transactions. Sam's Club US is in a similar pricing position to Walmart US, and outside the US, our pricing comparisons to a year ago are in more of a normal range. We're excited about the momentum we see, and we're pleased with the quarter, but my focus stays primarily on what we're building for the longer term. That future is an omnichannel one, where we simultaneously strengthen our stores and clubs and build a more compelling e-commerce business.\nAs it relates to strengthening our stores and clubs, we're investing in remodels and supply chain automation to improve the customer experience and increase productivity. Those things are going well. We'll remodel 928 stores and clubs globally over the next year, including 650 stores in the US. Not long ago, we shared that we would be building 30 new Sam's Clubs in the US over the next several years, and more recently, we announced we will add more than 150 Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets in the US over the next five years. Most of those are new builds and locations where we need a new store, but a few of them will be discount store conversions to a Supercenter where we're relocating in the same community.\nOutside the US, we'll open around 230 stores and clubs next year, mainly in Mexico and Central America, and in China, where there'll mostly be Sam's Clubs. We ended the year with 47 Sam's Clubs in China, and they continue to be quite strong on the top and bottom line. We are, by far, the leading membership club operator in China with 28 years of experience there. So our physical fleet is getting stronger, and it plays a hybrid role serving customers and members when they visit, and simultaneously enabling an important portion of e-commerce. Beyond our stores and clubs, we're continuing to strengthen our first- and third-party e-commerce capabilities and scale those businesses around the world.\nThe combination of marketplace and the commissions that go with it, fulfillment services, membership, advertising, and our smaller but fast-growing data monetization business enable us to grow our bottom line faster than our top line while delivering everyday low prices for our customers and investing in our associates at the same time. Marketplace is an engine for our business. As we've added more sellers in the US, we've seen more of them use our fulfillment capabilities. Marketplace is also the fastest-growing aspect of e-commerce for us outside the US. That growth helps us drive our global ad business. For now, we see the biggest dollar impact from Walmart US and in India from Flipkart, but as these businesses scale in places like Mexico and Canada, we expect to see a similar relationship. Globally, we drove advertising growth of 28% for the year to reach $3.4 billion.\nOur announcement today that we've agreed to acquire Vizio gives us the opportunity to reach and serve customers in new ways and connect more dots for those that advertise with us. Membership's another area where we'll continue to enhance our offerings. Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much with us as non-members, and they buy more over the course of a year. At Sam's Club US, we're rolling out new exit technology that enables our members to use Scan & Go to just walk out after completing their transaction on their phone, further enhancing their membership. Last year, we began describing ourselves as a people-led, tech-powered, omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. This description's really resonating for us inside the company.\nWe can prioritize our associates, our values, and our culture, and put impactful technology to work to help us fulfill our purpose, strengthen the customer and member experience, and strengthen our company. Here's some recent examples of us being tech-powered. Our new generative AI-powered search on the Walmart US app, which rolled out to iOS users last month and is coming to Android users this month, is a great example. One of the most popular searches this month was, \"Help me buy a Valentine's Day gift.\" And rather than searching separately for things like chocolates, a car, jewelry, and flowers, the search returns a list of results that are relevant and curated. And Flipkart launched a similar generative AI search tool, which was available just in time for Big Billion Days. Another example is our ability to provide customers and members with more convenient and affordable delivery.\nWe already offer express delivery in the US where customers can get their orders delivered fast. But what if you need something faster? There's a pot of chili on the stove, and you realize you forgot chili seasoning. Drone delivery can get it to you in 15 minutes or less. Delivering by drone isn't new to us. Over the last two years, we've operated 37 hubs across seven states, completing 20,000 deliveries. By the end of the year, we'll make it available to about 75% of households in Dallas-Fort Worth. I'm really excited about how the pieces are coming together in the near term. Our customers will have an improved store experience given our remodels. They can pick up an order, have it delivered to their doorstep or into their home, or get a fast drone delivery when they want it.\nThis flexibility is enabled by a more intelligent, more connected, and more automated supply chain. From scaled businesses to our faster-growing newer businesses, we're well on track to continue to hit the financial targets we laid out and make important investments for the future. And while we do this, we can grow in a way that helps us achieve our goals of creating opportunities for our associates and becoming a more sustainable business. In 2017, we announced a bold ambition to work with our suppliers to reduce, avoid, or sequester one gigaton (that's one billion metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We call it Project Gigaton. Our merchants and suppliers got to work and made investments in practical things like energy efficiency, packaging redesign, and load optimization.\nWe've reported steady progress since then, and we're excited to say that our suppliers have now reported projects exceeding that one billion metric ton mark, six years early. We'll continue to work with our suppliers on real initiatives with real-world impacts that make our products better and our business stronger. As we think about developing our associates, we want them to feel, think, and act like owners. The degree to which our team takes ownership will have a big impact on our level of success. That's what motivated us to make shares of Walmart stock part of US store manager compensation. It's also why we decided to do a three-for-one stock split. Today, more than 400,000 associates participate in our associate stock purchase plan.\nThat's a big number, but hopefully even more will choose to participate and take advantage of the 15% the company contributes for the first $1,800 purchased by an associate each year. Psychologically, it just feels better to buy a whole share rather than a fraction. We believe in our plan, and we're looking for ways, in addition to our 401(k) and the match that goes along with it, to help our associates build wealth and do more than just earn a paycheck. I'll close by thanking our associates for delivering a great quarter to end the year where we've accomplished so much. We're out to build on our momentum. We have strong omnichannel businesses globally, and they're getting stronger.\nWe're focused on executing the plans we have for this year and beyond, which we believe will deliver top and bottom line growth within the framework we've discussed and improve ROI over time. With that, I'll turn it over to John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. We're excited about the progress we've made in growing and evolving our omnichannel platform in pursuit of our purpose to help people save money and live better. Our teams did a great job in the quarter, finishing the year strong. For the year, in constant currency, we achieved 5.6% net sales growth and over 8% adjusted operating income growth. We have strong underlying momentum exiting Q4, and are clear about the strategic initiatives we're seeing driving profitable growth in the years ahead. This is reflected in the sustained sales and operating income growth included in our FY25 guidance.\nI'll recap Q4 results using the framework we introduced at our investor community meeting last year: growth, margins, and returns. As a reminder, there's a supplemental presentation on our IR website with additional information beyond my remarks. First, growth. Constant currency sales increased nearly 5%, or almost $8 billion in Q4, with strong growth from all three segments led by increased transactions across in-store, club, and e-commerce channels. International sales grew 13%, reflecting strength in Flipkart, Walmart, and China. International e-commerce sales increased 44%, reaching a penetration level of 25%, which is a record high for us. This included Flipkart's largest ever Big Billion Days event, with 1.4 billion customer visits over the eight-day period. In the US, Walmart comp sales grew 4%, reflecting increased unit volume and share gains. Like-for-like sales inflation was about 1%, moderating approximately 160 basis points from Q3 levels.\nWe saw better-than-expected holiday sales, including two record-breaking volume days leading up to Christmas. Store-fulfilled delivery sales were up nearly 50%, and we reached a $2 billion monthly run rate. Delivery has been a key source of share gains among upper-income households and is also the most productive channel for acquiring Walmart+ members. Sam's Club US delivered comp sales growth of 3.1%, excluding fuel, with strength in food, consumables, and health categories. E-commerce sales increased 17%, and we gained grocery share in both units and dollars. E-commerce continues to be a key point of differentiation for Sam's, with delivery and curbside driving e-commerce growth and in-club Scan & Go penetration up over 270 basis points. Turning to margins, enterprise gross margins expanded 39 basis points. Customers are responding as we continue to manage pricing aligned to competitive historic price gaps.\nIn addition, we had lower markdowns resulting from strong inventory management, with Walmart US inventory down 4.5%, Sam's down over 8%, and international relatively flat, excluding currency. This puts us in a good position to start the new fiscal year. The timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days was a partial offset to gross margins, and while category mix pressure continued this quarter, we're encouraged to see sequential improvement versus Q3. SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis deleveraged 16 basis points, largely due to higher variable pay expenses in the US relative to last year as a result of exceeding our planned performance. One of the areas I'm most pleased about is the improvement in e-commerce profitability within the Walmart US segment, resulting from lower e-commerce fulfillment costs and densifying the last mile.\nOur store proximity to customers is an advantage as we increasingly use stores to fulfill e-commerce orders. We've lowered last-mile store-to-home delivery costs by about 20% in the last year, even as we've shortened delivery times the same day from around 90% of stores. Combining the fulfillment efficiencies with the improved product margins of e-commerce, we far exceeded the 200 basis point goal we outlined at our investor community meeting and lowered e-commerce losses by more than 40% versus last year's level. We also saw another strong quarter from our portfolio of higher growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni-retail model. Global advertising grew approximately 33%, led by international's 76% growth.\nInternational's growth benefited from the timing of Big Billion Days but still delivered full-year growth of about 30%. Sam's ad business achieved a new high with almost 50% more advertisers versus last year. Walmart US Connect ad sales grew 22%, with more than 50% growth from marketplace sellers. We're encouraged by the strong demand from new advertisers as active advertiser counts increased over 20%. We're excited about our agreement with Vizio to bring together their unique operating system and our Walmart Connect advertising business.\nThis combination would create new opportunities for advertisers to connect with customers, empowering brands to realize greater impact from their advertising spend with Walmart. We believe the deal would close during FY25. Due to certain transaction-related costs associated with the acquisition, including for talent retention and technology integration, we expect the deal to be slightly diluted to EPS in the near term. We plan to finance the acquisition to use cash and/or debt. Importantly, we believe the transaction would be IRR accretive, delivering returns ahead of our expected ROI. Within marketplace and fulfillment services, Flipkart's momentum continued with double-digit growth.\nIn the US, Walmart's marketplace delivered strong holiday events, including Black Friday, our largest marketplace sales day ever. Over the past year, we've increased sellers 20%, with approximately 30% of sellers using Walmart Fulfillment Services. We're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club US reached another record high level for member counts and Walmart+ member penetration, which led to membership income growth of 10%, and Walmart+ continues to grow double digits. Strong sales and margins led to Q4 adjusted operating income growth of more than 13%, while adjusted EPS of $1.80 increased 5.3%. Below the line, higher interest and non-controlling interest were headwinds to adjusted EPS. Moving to returns, we generated over $35 billion in operating cash flow this year, an increase of nearly 24% due to strong business performance and improvements from working capital initiatives.\nReturn on Investment improved approximately 230 basis points to 15%, a level last achieved in 2017. Our stepped-up investments aimed at improving margins and productivity resulted in capital expenditures of $20.6 billion. The magnitude of ROI improvements reflects some benefits from productivity initiatives that we initially expected to realize in FY25. As we announced this morning, we're pleased to raise the dividend by 9% this year, the largest increase in over a decade, reinforcing our commitment to strong cash returns to shareholders. As we continue to execute on our long-range plan, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate payout ratio for our business. We have a clear vision to deliver our financial framework of growing operating income faster than sales.\nI'd like to spend the next couple of minutes on the initiatives we believe will drive improved incremental margins in the years ahead, even as we stay customer- and top-line-focused, deliver value for them, and invest in our people. Beyond steady broad-based sales growth across segments, incremental profits will be derived from four key areas: business mix, productivity benefits from our supply chain transformation and automation improvements, product mix, and geographic mix. These areas will contribute to improved e-commerce economics over the next several years, starting with business mix. As I noted previously, we're excited about how our newer, higher-growth businesses are scaling. Together, these businesses have significantly higher structural margins than our core retail business, and they are growing significantly faster, which has the effect of bending our margin curve upward. Over the past year, global advertising grew 28% to about $3.4 billion.\nWalmart US Marketplace revenue grew 45%, with more than 35% of orders fulfilled by Walmart Fulfillment Services. And lastly, global membership income grew 20%. Over our planning horizon, the growth of this portfolio is expected to be one of the largest drivers of operating income growing faster than sales. We believe global advertising and membership alone will represent 20% of annual operating income in FY25. These profit streams allow us to fund investments in our core business while also expanding our operating margins. Turning to supply chain transformation and automation, this was a significant year for the phased deployment of automated technologies to optimize our next-generation supply chain. This program spans several years, with activity stepping up in FY25 and FY26. To date, we've retrofitted 13 regional distribution centers with varying levels of automated storage and retrieval systems.\nThis technology gets product to shelves faster and has meaningful benefits to productivity, both in our DCs and stores. With the progress we've made over the past year, we're on track toward our goal of having approximately 55% of our fulfillment center volume and roughly 65% of Supercenters serviced by automation by the end of FY26. Already, around 1,500 stores are receiving palletized freight from these DCs. There are also exciting benefits from technology being realized in our stores. We're using applications to drive speed and proficiency, including RFID and computer vision, as well as digital displays and labels to remove friction for both customers and associates. New digital tools that automate repetitive tasks or eliminate heavy lifting have increased associate productivity, and customers are benefiting from improved in-stock rates and associate accessibility, leading to customer experience scores up over 140 basis points in FY24.\nWe expect to begin seeing the enterprise financial benefits of upstream automation and cost-to-fulfill, inventory efficiency, store productivity, and wage leverage as we move through FY25 with a more pronounced benefit in the second half. On product mix, continuing to expand our e-commerce assortment is critical to earning first-position consideration among customers. This is particularly true for general merchandise, including our marketplace. We've accelerated visit frequency and built incredible trust through core essentials like food and consumables. In fact, weekly active e-commerce customers grew 17% this last year. We're building on this trust by improving our general merchandise assortment both on and offline. General merchandise also benefits as US store remodels continue to perform well. We'll execute another 650 in Walmart US in FY25 on top of the nearly 700 remodels completed this year.\nWe're also excited to be returning to store growth in the US, as Doug mentioned. Our Supercenter, Store of the Future Design, is resulting in stronger four-wall sales while also delivering a sales lift in the surrounding trade area as these modernized stores offer more capacity for pickup and delivery, are more engaging to shop, and are improving customer perception about Walmart, especially in general merchandise, where we're encouraged by the share gains we're seeing. For general merchandise categories that surged during 2020 and '21 and have longer replacement cycles such as electronics and housewares, we expect relative weakness to persist in FY25, although we're hopeful to see directional improvement in the second half as comparisons ease. Lastly, geographic mix. Our international portfolio is accretive to sales and profit growth and is expected to be a larger contributor to enterprise performance.\nWe're on pace to achieve our goals to reach approximately $200 billion in GMV and more than double profits by FY28 from the FY23 base. This implies high single-digit annual sales growth for the segment. In FY24, international grew constant currency sales 10.6% and adjusted operating income over 15%. India, Walmart, and China are the sales growth leaders. These three markets are expected to account for approximately 3/4 of international growth over the next several years. In India, Flipkart's growth continues to compound in the double digits, while PhonePe is now processing more than $6 billion monthly transactions and has reached $1.4 trillion in annual total payment volume, about 40% higher than one year ago. Walmart continues to go from strength to strength.\nTurning to guidance, relative to prior years, we're introducing a slightly wider range of potential outcomes given the size of our business and a greater degree of variability we've seen. There are three nuanced factors to consider for FY25. First, FY25 is a leap year, which adds an additional day in Q1. I'll refer to this effect in our Q1 guidance shortly. Second, we'll experience a 53rd week for comp sales in Q4. We've included a slide in our presentation to help with modeling this. And third, on 30 January, we announced that the board approved a three-for-one stock split effective 23 February. We're offering full-year and Q1 EPS guidance on a pre- and post-split basis. For FY25, we expect net sales on a constant currency basis to grow between 3% and 4% and for operating income to grow 4% to 6%.\nWe expect Walmart US and Sam's Club US net sales growth to fall in line with the enterprise and for international growth to be above enterprise growth. We expect all three segments to contribute to operating income growth led by Walmart US, Walmart International, and then Sam's US. At our investor day last April, we outlined a multi-year plan of growing sales approximately 4% and growing operating income even faster. We depicted that as a range of 4% to 8%. Looking at our growth over a two-year period, combining FY24 actuals and our guidance for FY25 at the midpoint suggests we will grow sales more than 5% and operating income over 8% on average annually. This is aligned with the framework we laid out, and we're pleased with how we're executing on this plan.\nAt the enterprise level, we expect sales to grow faster than operating income in the first half due primarily to the timing of technology spend. In the second half, we expect operating income growth to exceed our sales growth. On a full-year basis, we expect operating income growth to exceed sales growth by 150 basis points at the midpoint. This spread between operating income growth and sales growth in FY25 is similar to what we experienced in FY24. Adjusted operating income grew 250 basis points faster than sales, including a benefit of approximately 90 basis points from LIFO. As we've noted in the past, this relationship of operating income growing faster than sales won't occur every quarter, but we aim for the framework to hold on an annual basis at the enterprise level.\nWe've provided additional detail on guidance for interest, tax rate, and non-controlling interest in our press release. We expect FY25 EPS in a range of $6.70 to 7.12 on a pre-split basis and $2.23 to 2.37 on a post-split basis. As we continue the multi-year investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain and stores, we expect CapEx to range between 3% to 3.5% of sales for the next couple of years. Importantly, we have good visibility to the ROI on these investments, and we're encouraged by what we're already seeing. For Q1, we expect sales growth of 4% to 5% and operating income growth of 3% to 4.5%. The leap year benefit is estimated to be approximately 100 basis points to sales growth. Operating income growth is expected to be below sales growth this quarter, reflecting the timing of technology expenses mentioned previously.\nWe expect Q1 EPS in the range of $1.48 to 1.56 on a pre-split basis and $0.49 to 0.52 on a post-split basis. In closing, our FY24 results demonstrated our ability to reshape our sales and operating income growth trajectory, and our guidance for FY25 assumes operating income growing faster than sales again. Our value proposition is resonating with customers. We're deploying capital to proven and scalable investments in our people and platform, and our business model is evolving towards higher margins and returns. I'd like to thank our 2.1 million associates worldwide who are indeed making the difference in bringing our purpose and business strategy to life every day. We're excited that by making our stock more accessible to them, more of our associates can become owners and align their interest with our external stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press star one from your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. So that we may address questions from as many participants as possible, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question. Our first question this morning is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is on the outlook for fiscal year 2025. At the outset of last year, Walmart guided to 2.5% to 3% constant currency sales growth. This year, it's guiding to 3% to 4% constant currency sales growth. Presumably, there's some benefit from the extra week and leap year within that outlook for this year. But essentially, on a full-store sales basis, you're guiding to a similar level, yet the impact from inflation is going to be a lot more moderate this year. So what do you see that's driving this, what seems to be a bit more optimistic outlook? And as part of that, if you could comment on what would have to happen in order for you to hit the high end of your operating margin outlook, that would also be quite helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nMichael, this is John David. There's a lot to that question. Let me try to unpack that a little bit. I think it's helpful to go back a year and think about the mood and the tone around the overall macro environment. At that point in time, I think there was largely a consensus that we were going to enter a recession in the last year. Fortunately, we avoided that. And so I think overall, we feel a little bit better about the health of the economy right now. That said, price levels certainly affect our forecast as well. So let me decompose our guidance just a little bit and spend a moment on this. I think there's a couple of important elements to point out. One is that overall, we expect some level of improvement in gross profit. But I want to decompose that further because there's two elements to that. One is our product margin, which we are not relying on raising prices to achieve our long-range plan.\nSo let me be very clear about that. The improvement in gross profit is mostly related to the change in our business mix. As we have these faster-growing, higher-margin parts of our business, like advertising, that are contributing to an outsized part of our portfolio. So we should expect to see some improvement in gross profit. Conversely, on the SG&A line, we do expect some amount of deleverage in our business. And I want to pause on that for a second because we recognize that EDLC is critical to performing on EDLP. And so we have a lot of focus on continuing to become more efficient, to continue to try to leverage aspects of the business that we can. But our business has changed. Just as I noted in my prior comment around business mix, that affects what happens in SG&A.\nAs we rely on things like advertising, some of the expenses related to that hit the SG&A line. So our focus as a team is on growing operating income. You see that in our guidance. I'll also point out that while mix, and I should say product mix, has been a headwind over the last two years, we do assume some amount of headwind going into the coming year as general merchandise will be less of our business relative to food. So there is some persistent tail to that. In terms of what would have to happen for us to hit the top end of our guidance, I think a couple of things. We're most focused on what we can control, and that's the team executing on our plan. So that's our focus. But we're not immune to the whims of the economy.\nCertainly, there are economic outcomes that could cause us to move to the high end of the range or the low end of the range. Given where we are right now, going into the first part of this year, we feel really good about the plan. We feel really good about the way that the team is executing and the way that we're serving our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Similarly, I wanted to start with gross margin, right? It was very strong in the quarter, up nearly 40 basis points for the enterprise. So I was wondering if you could quantify maybe the biggest drivers behind the improvement to look at higher margin services with Walmart retail, and how that gives you sort of confidence in the back half of the year for fiscal 2025. And then John David, you talked about the improvements in digital contribution margin, certainly the drivers behind that. I was wondering if you could quantify it or maybe speak to the magnitude of improvement we've seen, and sort of where that puts you on that path to breakeven or even profitability. Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure. I'll start on the answer to the improvement in gross margin. John may want to jump in there, but we're just in a healthier place than we were a year ago. And I think inventory is a big part of that. As we noted, inventory in the US was down 4.5%, down 8% for Sam's. That just enables us to operate a lot more effectively. We saw markdowns in the quarter be notably less than they were the year before. All those have an effect on gross margin. John, do you want to talk a little bit more about that, and I'll go back to Ecom?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks, John David. Krisztina, thanks for the question. A few things I'd say on margin. Number one, the team is really committed to driving value for customers. They did that in the quarter while improving margin. I want to talk about value just a second. We're really proud about the fact that our rollback count is up significantly from a year ago, similar to what it was in the Q3. Second, the value with customers is resonating well.\nWe saw NPS levels at a high level throughout the quarter and all-time highs for the quarter, which we're also proud of. And then on the gross margin line, as it relates to the overall flow-through, there are two things to consider there. One is sell-through was very strong throughout the quarter. Our inventory closed down 4.5%. This is the first year I can remember in my career being in stores in early December, and they were out of storage containers, product on the counter in the back rooms. The team did a very nice job getting inventory inside, knowing what they owned, and selling through. And the sell-through that was strong at the holiday events we mentioned, two of our strongest days ever, were in December, just leading up to Christmas. The strong sell-through led to lower markdowns.\nThe markdowns were by far the biggest impact on margins in the US. Then the second impact would have been from business mix. So John David said that earlier. But those are the two factors that improved it. We feel good about our inventory position as we begin this year. We ended the year clean. Store managers and associates have back rooms that are quite under control. They feel very good about their inventory levels, and we're really proud of how they performed. Sure.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nKrisztina, I'll address the improvement that we've seen and expect to continue to see in our contribution margin on e-commerce. There's a couple of elements to this. One is I'm really pleased with the way the team has performed on cost of fulfillment. That has gone down 20% in the last year.\nA lot of hard work has gone into making that happen. But the unit economics of delivering a package to a customer or a member have simply improved. So that's a big part of the improvement we've seen, and we expect to see continued improvements there. The second aspect of this is the densification of our network, specifically the last mile. As we have more customers coming to us, using us through e-commerce channels, it enables us to spread that cost of delivery over multiple customers. And so if you think about an item like our weekly active customers on e-commerce, that's up 17%, much more than our top line. And so customers are recognizing that they can come to Walmart for convenience just as much as they can on price, and that actually helps the profitability of this channel for us.\nIn terms of where or when we can get to profitability, we have line of sight to e-commerce being breakeven when we include all the various components of this: advertising, fulfillment services, all of that together. But to be clear, we're focused on getting to e-commerce profitability even without the subsidization of those additional items. That's a little further down the road. We have a lot of work to do to get to that point, but we're really pleased with the progress that we've made and the plan that we have going forward. I think big picture, as it relates to the business model, scale has helped a lot. Getting to $100 billion for the year is a different number than what we were dealing with before, and it's nice to have growth coming on top of that.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nAs John David said, the formula, whether it's in the US or it's in other markets around the world, is now clear to us. We're in execution mode as it relates to these things. Obviously, route density helps, volume helps, mix as it relates to contribution profit as part of the equation. It's exciting to see whether it's at Walmart or it's what's happening in India, in addition to what we've been talking about in the US with Walmart and Sam's, the commonalities that we're now experiencing. It feels like for some time now, we've really kind of known what we're doing. Omni is an advantage. Figuring out how to leverage stores and clubs, what role they play, has been part of that journey as well.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO, Walmart International\n\nIf I can just comment on China. If you look at their progress over the last few years, they had a digital penetration of about 4% in 2019. They're now at 48%. So it's almost 50/50 offline and online. And we're driving a profit through that business. So I think they've shown a path to really growing omnichannel profitably.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Doug, I was going to ask you to kind of keep it high level. For fiscal 2024, the prior year, it was a tough consumer year, but strategically, Walmart made progress on a lot of fronts. If you look at fiscal 2025, can you boil down the year one to three measures of success? And I have some ideas, but I won't preload the question. Then for what will define success in terms of strategic initiatives? And then just secondarily, any evolving thoughts about reinvestments in the business? So the business should continue to see higher EBIT growth over the next several years. Since you have one year or at least a couple of years under your belt now of seeing that evolve, do you find that the reinvestment rate could be any greater such that not all of that flows through?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Simeon. I feel good about the reinvestment rate. If you look at what our plans include, whether it's on the OpEx or CapEx side, I think we're being aggressive. And it is exciting to be in a position where we can play offense on price to the degree we need to. We can invest in associate wages, and at the same time, we can grow operating income faster than sales.\nWhen I look back at last year and then how that plays through to FY25, I think the themes are the same. We got to keep the top line going. This business has always been so fun as it relates to just being a merchant and driving sales. I like the fact that we've got an opportunity across so many categories: food, consumables, general merchandise, apparel. As prices come down on the general merchandise side, there's an opportunity to show off our merchant skills and to drive more units. That's one of the reasons why, to Michael's question, to start this conversation, we have some confidence is because we're seeing our units move and our share numbers look strong. Top line is a focus.\nI think we're positioned to grow that because we can do that in-store, club, pickup, delivery, however people want to be served. The second thing I'd mention is the automation plan. And I think in the US, where we're most aggressive, we'll see over the next few years a higher level of inventory accuracy, improved flow, which will help us with markdowns, associate wage productivity, all the metrics that we've been talking about with you guys in particular for the last year. So I think automation is the next theme. And then the last one that I'll mention is all of the things that flow from marketplace and advertising.\nI think we've learned a lot about marketplace over the last few years, and we're working together to build what is a multi-country marketplace business, which will help us not only with commissions related to marketplace and fulfillment service scale, but it'll also help us with advertising, data monetization, and some of the other keys to changing the shape of the P&L or the business mix, as we refer to it. Those are the things that come to the top for me, and that's what I stay focused on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the Walmart US general merchandise category. Just curious how the remodels have continued to perform as I believe you'll soon be launching the Teter Bar opening. Then as you look at the general merchandise offering, curious if you're seeing any green shoots. Just trying to get a sense of when we can start to expect a return of positive growth. Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nHey, Rupesh. Good morning, John. Really, really pleased with the team. They're growing top and bottom line, and we're investing in the future. As we talked about, this year, we're planning to do 650 more remodels. We did close to 700 last year, which is, I think, our largest year and had a really big month in the month of November. The results are very promising. As you know, there is more space for customers. We opened the store up. We're really proud of the results in apparel and home beauty. We see positive signs out of the pet department. So there are a number of things that are coming together.\nIn the Q4, in particular, we're really pleased with the toy performance, where we saw unit share gains with big brands like Lego, Mattel, Melissa & Doug. So there are some really nice signs coming out of those stores. We're really looking forward to this year to put another, as we said, 650 remodels out in the market. You've consistently performed seasonally. I think as we look forward to this year, whether it's Easter, back to school, all the way through to holiday again, people come to Walmart for seasonal purchases. We've got a great strength there that we plan to build on. We do, Doug. It's been a lot of fun to see how these came together. As I mentioned, the sell-throughs are really strong throughout the Q4. Valentine's Day was a strong holiday early in the year.\nBecause we're so close to customers, we were delivering same day up until 8:30PM that night. I wouldn't recommend that for everyone, but certainly, the capability to be able to take flowers to someone at 8:30PM who had a bit of a moment was a lot of fun. Save the day.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Food Retail & Distribution, BMO\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Wanted to just talk a little bit more about advertising. 28% growth for the year. I think you said reaching $3.4 billion. Just doing some math here, it seems like that could be adding about $3 to 400 million in EBIT on an annual basis now. Just wanted to see if that's in the right ballpark and what kind of magnitude of growth you're forecasting for this coming year and really the next couple of years. Also, if you can just elaborate here on the vision with Vizio as it relates to advertising.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Kelly. This is John David. I'll start. We're really pleased with not just advertising, but a lot of these faster growth parts of our business. Advertising, we've called out. You noted the growth that we had for the year. We have really strong growth in the quarter. You're right. Your math is right in terms of the type of contribution that we could expect there. That segues into the conversation around Vizio. We're really excited about that acquisition. I think it's very complementary to what we're already doing organically in that part of our business, and this is an accelerant. I'll turn it to Doug and John though to add more about that.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US\n\nYeah. We're not going to say too much. Obviously, we need to give that some time for the process to play out. But as John David said, we are really excited about the opportunity to bring together Vizio's operating system with our ad platform. And we can appreciate that you all would probably have a number of questions about it. Marketplace and advertising are key drivers of profitability growth, as we've already discussed. And this acquisition accelerates the build-out of our advertising platform into the connected TV business, which will be exciting. But given that the acquisition hasn't closed, we can only reinforce what we've already shared. So we'll be limited in our remarks today. So you may want to save your questions for another topic. We want to focus for now on our quarter, on the company's strategy, and more broader topics, and then we can come back to you once the deal is closed.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the transaction comps. I think it was 4.3% for Walmart US. That's a pretty strong number in a big quarter for you guys. A couple of things on that. Can you talk about how that kind of played out in terms of the Q4? Was it more grocery-driven and e-commerce-driven and grocery, or did you have really strong transaction growth year over year and holiday? And then in the guidance you guys have given for Walmart US, how should we think about that transaction momentum continuing? Then also probably the biggest drivers for sustaining that kind of high level of transaction growth for this year.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart US",
    "content2": "Hey, Robbie. It's John. Let me start on this, and others can jump in. The 4.3 is encouraging. We're seeing more customers. We're seeing them more often. We're seeing a lot of new customers. The frequency, John David mentioned earlier, the weekly average customers in e-commerce up 17% is a strong number. The mix hasn't changed really all that much. I think if you look at our results by business unit from consumables to food to GM, pretty similar trends than what we've been seeing. I think the big difference that we can talk about is we see more customers using same-day services and express deliveries, and that's also across a broad range of categories.\nIt would be intuitive to assume it's food at times, like the example earlier when you're missing an ingredient. But we're also seeing this happen for birthday gifts and general merchandise items, and other things. So I'd go back to what we talked about at the beginning of last year when we talked about supply chain strategy. Having a short last mile is an important component in e-commerce, and having stores be able to deliver what historically would have been an e-commerce order or a food delivery order or the combination of the two is really helping the brand. And additionally, that's bringing the delivery cost down, which has contributed to the improvement in operating loss in e-commerce. I think the things you've done to make it easier to pick at store level should be mentioned too. RFID and apparel.\nHaving the inventory levels down so that people can find things, I think, helped us a lot when it came time to pick toys at the last minute, for example. Our accuracy, our customer scores reflect that improved accuracy. Combine that with the automation that we're putting into e-commerce fulfillment centers, and you can start to see that there's a great opportunity for us to leverage math and optimize where things come from, but our accuracy is also improving. It really has, Doug. There are a few things that we're doing with technology to help us ensure that we know what we own, where it is, and ensure that it's accessible for the store associates.\nI can't overemphasize the importance of inventory levels being down 4.5% and what that does for a store manager, a team lead, and the coaches that are in the stores who need to take care of what a customer needs right now, and they're able to do that much more accurately. So I think it'll get better over time as the automation continues to come online, but definitely some notable improvements from the store team this quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to double-click on technology and talk about Walmart being a people-led and tech-powered company. But specifically as it relates to AI, what is it in the last 12 months that you've deployed enterprise-wide that's worked well for the business and helped drive better returns?\nAnd then what is it over the next 12 months that you see that could really help to improve results even more going forward? As I know that that's been a continued focus for the enterprise broadly. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. Thanks, Corey. This is Doug, and others can chime in here and help me with this, but we're very excited about generative AI. There are big opportunities for us to improve the customer member experience, improve associate experiences and productivity, and help take costs out of the business. And we're moving. I think big picture, we've got a very clear plan as it relates to what we want to build versus what we want to leverage from others. And we've got good partnerships and good advisors, and we've got a strong tech team that knows what they're doing in this area. So I do expect that it'll have benefits.\nAs I talked to other CEOs and we learn here, I think it's still too early to try and quantify this specifically. I think as we look back on what develops, we can probably tell you in the rearview mirror how things played out from a cost perspective, for example. But the thing we're most excited about that's already happened is the way search has improved. The way generative AI helped us really improve a solution-oriented search experience for customers and members is the thing that we're most excited about. And it happened pretty quickly, and it impacted Super Bowl search results. We gave you an example of Valentine's Day earlier, and the team's learning how to do that across all of our markets and the entirety of the company. So that's also exciting.\nWe also rolled out something we call My Assistant on our Me@Walmart application so that all of our associates have access to generative AI tools and capabilities. So strategically, the way I think about it is the leadership of the company is working through where our biggest opportunities are, prioritizing and resourcing those opportunities. But we're also making generative AI available broadly so that we get surprising good news from the way that all of our associates interact with it. Anybody else want to comment on that technology?\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Sam's Club\n\nFor Sam's Club, we were really excited to unveil at CES the first of Sam's Club's big consumer-facing applications of AI. So our easy exit process, which employs computer vision and AI to allow people to just walk out, is just a really exciting way.\nWhen you watch customers, I was in a club last week watching customers just walk out, members just walk out, and the joy that it gives them that some computer vision and AI is making their lives better without them knowing why or how, it's really exciting. And I think it's just the beginning of a journey in Sam's Club. We like to innovate. We have the opportunity to innovate, and we'll see opportunities for cost out, no doubt. We took 35 million tasks out of the club last year for associates by employing technology. A lot of that is artificial intelligence that helps them manage inventory better. And we're working a lot with our members too on personalizing."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.

Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, over to you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to talk about our Q3 results and how we're seeing the rest of the year. Our value proposition continues to resonate with customers, helping us gain share and drive e-commerce growth. We're on track to grow adjusted operating income at a faster rate than sales for the year, consistent with what we discussed at our investor meeting earlier this year. We had strong revenue growth for the quarter across each of our segments.\nComp sales for Walmart US were 4.9% and 3.8% for Sam's Club US. Sales for Walmart International were up 5.4% in constant currency, led by Walmex and China. Sam's Club continues to perform well both in Mexico and China, and while strength was broad-based for Walmex, our Bodega Aurrera business is worth calling out as it continues to deliver outstanding growth.\nE-commerce sales were up 24% in Walmart US, 16% in Sam's Club US, and 15% globally. Timing of our Flipkart Big Billion Days event, which moved from Q3 last year to Q4 this year, affected comparisons in our international segment, leading to a decline of 3%. So we'll see the benefit from the timing shift as we report next quarter. Across markets, the team did a nice job driving our seasonal events.\nOur in-stock and inventory levels are in good shape. We finished down 1.2% in inventory for the total company, including down 5% for Walmart US. Both our top line and adjusted EPS came in better than what we projected at the beginning of the quarter, but we could have done a better job on expenses, which is reflected in Adjusted Operating Income growing less than we expected.\nWe had a couple of unexpected expense increases in SG&A, and you'll hear more about those when John David walks through the numbers. In the US, pricing levels in many food categories continue to be a concern. Overall, our product costs are up versus last year, and they remain up even more on a two-year stack, which is putting pressure on our customers.\nBeef prices are high, but we're happy to see lower pricing in dairy, on eggs, and with chicken and seafood. The pockets of disinflation we are seeing are helping, but we'd like to see more faster, especially in the dry grocery and consumables categories. The other good news is that general merchandise prices continue to come down. GM is down low to mid-single digits versus last year.\nThat enables us to roll back pricing, which will help our customers during this holiday season when general merchandise is so important for gift giving. We'll still see pressure from mix, including outside the US, which we expected, but I like the market share gains we're seeing in this category. In the US, we may be managing through a period of deflation in the months to come.\nAnd while that would put more unit pressure on us, we welcome it because it's better for our customers. When I look at our P&L, it's continuing to change shape. Mentally, I break it down as a combination of a traditional retail P&L and a newer version that starts with our digital businesses. It flows from first and third-party e-commerce pickup and delivery to businesses like membership, advertising, and fulfillment as a service.\nIt includes some faster-growing, higher-margin components that, combined with the more traditional P&L, gives us a business model that's more profitable in percentage terms as it grows. We saw strong growth in all these areas for the quarter. And when you put it together with the supply chain automation work we're doing, you get a more sustainable business that can grow more effectively over time and create a better mix along the way.\nMarketplace is one of our engines for these mutually reinforcing businesses, meaning that marketplace growth pulls other businesses like fulfillment through. Back in September, we held our first-ever marketplace seller summit. We hosted thousands of current and potential sellers to let them see firsthand our commitment to this business and how we'll grow it together. Since the beginning of last year, we've more than doubled the number of items available to customers on our US marketplace.\nIt's an important piece of what we're building, and it's growing fast, and not just in the US. We have a unique opportunity to grow in India, Mexico, Canada, and Chile. We love the opportunity to grow our assortment this way so customers can get what they want, when, and how they want it. We're making shopping easier and more convenient. Our net promoter scores for pickup and delivery in Walmart US are improving, and we've started using generative AI to improve our search and chat experience.\nWe've released an improved beta version of Search to some of our customers who are using our app on iOS. In the coming weeks and months, we'll enhance this experience and roll it out to more customers. When I step back and look at the company overall, I love what we're building and how we're building it.\nWe've got a good hand to play and a strong team making things happen. It's our recipe for growth, improved margin, and returns we've been discussing with you. Everyday Low Prices are a foundational component of us fulfilling our purpose. We bring EDLP to life on a year-round basis by doing things like offe ring a Thanksgiving meal in the US and Canada that costs less than last year.\nWe're offering tremendous value for things like fashion, electronics, and seasonal decorations, and helping remind people that when they're looking to buy toys, we're the place to come because we have the right product at the right price. This same focus on purpose and execution came through when I was visiting Chile, Canada, and China earlier this quarter. It was my first time back in China since before the pandemic.\nOur team there runs some of the most incredible Sam's Clubs in the world, and they continue to be a leader for us in terms of digital penetration and innovation. As I wrap up, I know we're all concerned about events across the world: war, acts of terror, political unrest, impacts from storms like those in Mexico from Hurricane Otis, the pressure we're feeling from stubborn inflation in some categories, and other challenges beyond our control.\nAs for our company, we care about everyone. We want to be a place where literally everyone feels comfortable and welcomed to shop or work. We want to live our values and create a warm, safe, and fun place for the hundreds of millions of people that will shop with us in the days and weeks ahead. I'm grateful to be part of this big team, grateful to work alongside our associates. Now I'll turn it over to John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nI'd like to start by thanking our customers, members, associates, and partners for helping us deliver a good quarter. We're pleased overall with how the team executed and how our strong value proposition and omnichannel strategy continue to resonate with customers. We're gaining share, seeing strong e-commerce growth, and excited about the contributions from higher-margin businesses like advertising. Sales grew more than 4%, gross profit was better than expected, and we exceeded our guidance for EPS.\nThese results reinforce the benefits of our highly diversified business with broad-based contributions across segments and markets, channels and formats, and strategic growth areas. While we're pleased with our top-line results, operating income was below our guidance due to higher-than-anticipated expenses, largely certain legal accruals. I'll provide more details on guidance shortly, but the key takeaway is that we're raising our full-year sales and EPS guide while reiterating our prior operating income guidance.\nWe expect the relationship between profit and sales growth to favor profitability in Q4 and for the full year to align with our goal of operating income growing faster than sales. Now let me review the key financial highlights for Q3 using our financial framework of growth, margins, and returns. First, growth. Constant currency sales increased 4.4%, or nearly $7 billion. Importantly, we saw traffic growth across both in-store and digital channels.\nAll three operating segments experienced mid-single-digit sales growth, with comp sales for Walmart US up 4.9% and Sam's Club US up 3.8%, excluding fuel. International grew sales 5.4% in constant currency, with Walmex sales up more than 9% and China up 25% with strong performance in Sam's Club and e-commerce. The timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days pressured international sales growth as the event moved from Q3 last year to Q4 this year.\nSo we expect the timing to be a benefit to Q4's growth rate for the segment. PhonePe also continued its strong momentum with annualized TPV, or total payment volume, reaching 1.2 trillion on nearly 5.8 billion monthly transactions. And PhonePe recently achieved an impressive milestone, eclipsing 500 million registered users. We continue to grow share in key categories, particularly in Walmart US grocery, where we delivered positive comps and saw strong share gains in both units and dollars.\nGrocery inflation moderated nearly 300 basis points from Q2 levels to a mid-single-digit increase versus last year, but on a two-year stack, it was still elevated at a high teens percentage. We see our customers showing ongoing discretion in seeking value to manage within their household budget.\nWhile general merchandise sales were down low single digits year over year in Q3, the rate of change was stable to Q2 levels, and we gained share across categories. As we enter the holiday season, we're working hard to lower grocery prices to ease the pressure for customers, giving them more capacity for general merchandise spent. Our business is rooted in a timeless purpose: to save customers money so they can live better.\nAgainst any economic backdrop, we're there for customers how and where they need us, and we're making shopping with Walmart and Sam's Club more convenient. Omni services, including pickup and store-fulfilled delivery, continue to drive strong growth, leading to a 24% increase in Walmart US e-commerce sales and 16% growth at Sam's Club. Multichannel shoppers are more valuable, engaging more often, and spending more with us.\nPickup and delivery for Walmart US has been a key source of growth and share gains among upper-income households and has become the most productive channel for acquiring Walmart+ members. In international, Walmex's expansion of omni offerings led to 1.5 million Bodega Aurrera store-fulfilled digital orders in Q3. In Canada, we continue to roll out our unlimited next-day store delivery subscription called Delivery Pass, which is now available from 2/3 of our Canada stores.\nAnd I was in China recently, where our business is nearly a 50/50 split of physical and digital. I was impressed with how we're serving omni customers with speed and accuracy through new engagement and delivery models. Turning to margins, gross margins expanded 32 basis points, reflecting the timing shift of Big Billion Days in India, and lapping last year's LIFO charge at Sam's Club US.\nWalmart US gross margins increased 5 basis points, reflecting lower markdowns in supply chain costs, but we're still seeing ongoing category mix pressure as health and wellness, and grocery sales outperformed general merchandise. Continued disinflation, along with the success of our merchants at Sam's Club in bringing down the cost of inventory, resulted in us not taking the expected $50 million LIFO charge in Q3. We no longer expect any further LIFO charges in Sam's Club this year.\nAs we've said previously, over the next several years, we expect margins to move higher as we modernize our supply chain and scale higher-margin growth initiatives. We made good progress on both during the quarter. We continue to deploy capital to build technologies and optimize our next-generation supply chain, with automation and productivity benefits starting to appear in our results.\nWe now operate nine regional distribution centers servicing US stores with varying levels of automation, with six more centers in active stages of construction. Currently, more than 15% of stores receive merchandise from these facilities, helping to get product to shelves faster and more efficiently. During the quarter, we opened our third next-generation eCommerce fulfillment center.\nThese 1.5 million sq ft facilities are expected to more than double the storage capacity, enable 2x the number of customer orders fulfilled daily, and will expand next and two-day shipping to nearly 90% of the US, including Marketplace items shipped by Walmart Fulfillment Services. They also unlock new opportunities for our associates to transition into higher-skilled, tech-focused positions. To support the store-fulfilled digital business, we're on track to have seven stores with automated Market Fulfillment Centers, or MFCs, operational by the end of this month.\nThese MFCs stock thousands of the most sought-after items and are expected to increase order capacity and productivity while also increasing inventory accuracy, which helps us deliver perfect orders for customers. As we focus on improving e-commerce margins, we're making good progress in lowering digital fulfillment costs and densifying the last mile by tapping our broad store and club network.\nOver the past year, Walmart US has increased the percentage of digital orders fulfilled by stores by 800 basis points, and Sam's Club fulfills nearly 60% of online orders from its clubs. With the growth of our Spark Driver platform, we've lowered store-to-home delivery costs by 15%, even as we shorten delivery times the same day for more than 80% of our stores, and in some cases, as quick as 30 minutes.\nAs we scale Walmart GoLocal, we're densifying the last mile, and we're approaching a milestone of 12 million deliveries for other retailers with this service. I'd like to touch on our portfolio of higher-growth initiatives. These businesses reinforce our core omni retail model and are key to driving operating income growth ahead of sales over time. In Q3, this portfolio positively contributed to gross margins.\nGlobal advertising grew approximately 20% in Q3, with Sam's MAP growing over 27% and Walmart Connect up 26%. As an illustration of the omni-channel benefits of our ad platforms, more than 75% of Sam's MAP active advertisers are investing in search and sponsored ads, as in-club sales attribution has improved returns of digital ad spend by over 30%.\nInternational's ad revenue growth was impacted by the timing of Big Billion Days, but we're on track to deliver strong growth of approximately 45% for the full year. Moving to Marketplace and Fulfillment Services, customer engagement continues to validate our strategies to invest in ways to grow this business on a global basis. As Doug mentioned, we held the inaugural Marketplace Seller Summit to help accelerate our Marketplace growth.\nFor cross-border sellers in the US, we're expanding access to more customers beyond the US, Canada, and Mexico by opening our e-commerce Marketplace in Chile to cross-border products next year. Over the past year, we've increased Marketplace sellers by more than 20%, and the number of sellers utilizing Walmart Fulfillment Services is up over 55%. Next, membership remains a compelling way we deepen engagement with our customers.\nSam's Club membership income grew over 7%, reflecting record member counts and plus member penetration. During Q3, we held events that were focused on member acquisition and digital engagement. We'll take a similar approach again during Q4, offering discounted access to Walmart+ memberships while providing members early access to the best savings event throughout the holiday season.\nTurning back to the middle of the P&L, SG&A expenses deleveraged 37 basis points on an adjusted basis, impacted by higher year-over-year wage-related costs in Walmart US, including higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance. Store remodel costs were also higher as we rolled out 117 of our flagship design stores earlier this month, and legal expenses increased. Lastly, the timing shift of Big Billion Days pressured international expense leverage in Q3. We'll see the benefit come through in Q4.\nQ3 adjusted operating income grew 3%, including 270 basis points of currency tailwind, while adjusted EPS of $1.53 increased 2% and compared favorably to guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Relative to our guidance, Q3 EPS benefited by $0.01 from releasing the LIFO reserve we had earmarked for Sam's Club. Moving to returns, over the last 12 months, sales have grown more than 6%, and operating income increased about 22%.\nWhen combined with a disciplined capital approach, return on investment improved 130 basis points to 14.1%. The primary driver was lapping last year's Q3 charge related to the opioid legal settlement framework. ROI also reflects some benefits from productivity initiatives that we initially expected to realize in FY25. We continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years.\nIn addition to our strategy, our financial position is an advantage and enables us to compete in an increasingly dynamic retail environment. Turning to guidance, we're confident in our agility and our ability to execute, and we're focusing our investment in areas where we can widen our omni advantage, deepen engagement, and drive sustained growth in new revenue streams.\nWe like our position relative to competitors as we've maintained strong price gaps and increased share while preserving flexibility to respond to competitive dynamics. But we're not immune from the vagaries of the economy. We see our customers showing ongoing discretion and making trade-offs to be able to afford the things they want, given the sustained high cost of the things they need.\nRecently, we've experienced a higher degree of variability in weekly performance in between holiday events in the US, including seeing a softening in the back half of October that was off-trend to the rest of the quarter. Sales during November have turned higher as unseasonal weather abated and we kicked off holiday events. So sales have been somewhat uneven, and this gives us reason to think slightly more cautiously about the consumer versus 90 days ago.\nWe still expect sales growth to moderate in Q4 versus prior quarters as grocery inflation further normalizes towards historic levels, but we're encouraged by the increased traffic and share gains we've seen and expect them to continue. As such, we're modestly raising our full-year sales guidance to 5% to 5.5% from 4% to 4.5% previously, primarily to reflect Q3's outperformance. For operating income, we're maintaining the guidance range of 7% to 7.5% growth.\nIn addition to the 40 basis points of unexpected legal expenses in Q3, we also expect to record charges in Q4 totaling approximately 20 to 30 basis points related to unplanned store closures and recovery costs associated with the recent hurricane near Acapulco, Mexico. This impacted 28 of our stores, and less than half of them have been reopened at this time. Partially offsetting these costs is the approximate 40 basis point benefit from lower-than-expected LIFO charges compared to our prior guide.\nThe net effect is a 20 to 30 basis point headwind to our prior guide, and as such, we currently expect to be in the lower end of the operating income growth range for the year. We expect merchandise mix pressure to continue in Q4, with grocery and health and wellness sales rates outpacing general merchandise and potentially be a bit more pronounced given the uncertain consumer environment.\nBased on Q3 results and less of an increase in interest costs for the year than we previously expected, we're raising our full-year EPS guidance range to $6.40 to $6.48. In closing, let me reiterate what I said previously. Aligned with our financial framework, we expect the relationship between profit and sales growth to favor profitability in Q4 and for the full-year operating income to grow faster than sales. We like our competitive position. Our financial results clearly demonstrate that our omni-channel strategy is winning.\nWe're growing our share across categories, deepening customer engagement across channels, while investing in areas to widen our competitive advantage. The holidays are here, and our value proposition resonates with customers looking to save money as they celebrate. Operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press Star one from your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys.\nSo though we may address questions from as many participants as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I have one question. I'll make it maybe two parts. The first part, the legal expense, so that we can judge whether or not we should keep it in. It sounds like you're keeping it in. I'm not sure you're able to share what the nature of it is, but it seems like it was unexpected. So, if there's any more color on it. And then the second real question is advertising revenue and profit. Was it hidden in any way this quarter? Do we get an inflection into next year? That seems to be the big investment question. And are we going to see it ramp up, and does it happen in a certain period, or it just continues to build? Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSimeon, I'll start, and others may want to jump in. On the legal expenses, those were related largely to prior periods, and that was not anticipated within the quarter. It was around $70 to 75 million, so we would not expect that to recur into the Q4. On the alternative revenue, perhaps I'll start and let others jump in.\nOur plan, that we shared at Investor Day, is somewhat dependent upon the level of investment that we're having and seeing improving unit economics, but it's also growing these parts of our business that are much higher margin. We talked about the growth in advertising across all segments, quite frankly, and international, while it was slower in this quarter, we'll see strong growth for the year. All of these, as they become a larger part of our overall business mix, are going to have an outsized contribution to our margin performance.\nSo if you go back and you think about what we shared at Investor Day saying that we expect over the next several years to grow sales 4% and operating income greater than 4%, we would expect with each passing year, we're going to see a greater contribution from these higher margin profit streams, which help us to improve our margin each year.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nSimeon, this is Doug. I would just add that I think you should have it in the continue to build category rather than an inflection.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just another follow-up, I guess, on the legal expense, assuming that impacted the US EBIT number, but maybe you can clarify that. And just anything in particular that impacted the US EBIT beyond maybe some unexpected expenses, did that come in relatively in line with your expectations? And I guess that's sort of my first question. And then longer term, as you think about this plan to grow EBIT faster than sales in coming years, anything you're seeing with the consumer, and it sounds like it's still choppy, that maybe leads you to reconsider how much you might flow through to the bottom line?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nSure. I'll start, and then John's probably going to want to jump in. Yes, the legal expenses hit the US segment. There were some other items in there. I'll point out that we spent a little bit more on remodels. We did an all-time high level of remodels in the quarter, but this is investing in our business, which we definitely want to lean into.\nWe're excited about the returns we're seeing around that. We're excited about the returns we're seeing on eCommerce. And so there were some investments related to that. But the vast majority of the delta between our guidance and actual performance was related to the legal accrual. In terms of our long-term plan and as it pertains to possible changes in the consumer, I think our value proposition resonates more than ever when the consumer is pressured.\nAnd we've seen this year that they not only are coming to us for the value that we provide, but also for the convenience. And these are areas that we're investing in. So we have a ton of conviction in the strategy that we have in place and in our ability to execute on that. We should separate that from calling out some maybe potential weakness or wobbling among the consumer that we saw in the back half of October. But we're very excited about the plan we have in place.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nHey, Kelly. It's John. Good morning. First, I'm also excited about the top line results at 4.9 and then e-commerce at 24. The team has made a lot of improvements, and they should get the credit for that. I heard a couple of things there. One about remodels, as John David mentioned, we had 117 remodels complete all on 3 November. We think that's the largest number of remodels we've ever had complete in a single day. And then if you add together late October and November, it was 197 remodels. And those remodels have improved apparel, improved home. They have wider aisles. We're really happy with the way the signage layout.\nAnd they also have more investment for our online pickup and delivery business, which is a key catalyst for e-commerce growth and helps us with being flexible for customers and any type of situation they want to shop in. So there are some costs associated with that in the quarter, but we feel great about those being investments for the long term.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nKelly, this is Doug. Related to the last part of what you asked about, I don't think there's anything that causes us to think operating income won't grow faster than sales. We've had really strong sales performance now for a few years. Obviously, we're impacted by what happens in our environment, but we expect to grow share. We expect to have a healthy top line. And as it relates to operating income, we've got a really good multi-year plan with two primary dimensions.\nOne, the automation investments that drive productivity improvements, and the other dimension is related to how the digital businesses change the shape of the income statement. Both of those things will be true, and it's a multi-year plan that shows progress along the way. So you guys, from quarter to quarter, year to year, will see us make progress. Not every quarter may be up and to the right in every category, but if you look at what happens from a trend point of view, those are the things we expect to deliver. And because operating income's growing faster than sales, our plan requires that we grow return on investment at a higher rate over time. That's the plan.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys. You have a really big e-comm business that continues to grow at a rapid pace. I'm curious if you could talk about what's driving that growth from a traffic versus ticket perspective, and how the growth in the marketplace sellers that you've seen are contributing to that growth. Also curious if you could talk a little bit about general merchandise performance online. I think you threw out some numbers last quarter about certain categories on the general merchandise side. Would love to hear how they performed online this quarter. Thanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nHey, morning, Paul. It's John. I'll start with Walmart US and then pass it over to Kath and Chris to talk about the other segments. I think as you step back and look at the growth, one, we're pleased with our online pickup delivery business from stores. We have strengthened food.\nThe team has continued over the last few years to expand our capacity, and more importantly, they've made improvements on key metrics like the one we call perfect order, which is getting customers what they want, when they want. And I think that's a reflection of better in-stock and food overall. And that's helped us with our share gains in the food category.\nWith marketplace, really pleased with the progress the team has made with Tom Ward and Manish having the first summit, as we mentioned earlier. In the quarter, we've seen more sellers come online. Our assortment has grown significantly. And just this week, I was in one of the new fulfillment centers that John David mentioned in Lancaster, Texas, which is a great facility managed by a very qualified team.\nIt's, of course, reassuring to see the amount of marketplace inventory that's coming in and seeing the number of marketplace sellers, which we're grateful for those sellers who trust us to do their fulfillment. That's been promising. Now, the month of November, we had our first event last week in getting into our holiday season. We have a long way to go from here until the end of the holidays, but really pleased with the results in marketplace, which is, of course, reflective of results in apparel, gifting, and other categories that are in line with the question you asked about general merchandise.\nThese are important businesses because they help customers shop the way they shop, the way they want to shop, when they want to shop. Marketplace over time, of course, will be a key driver to some of the other businesses like advertising. As more sellers find customers on the Walmart Marketplace, they'll want to use services like our fulfillment services and our advertising business. So turn it over to Kath to talk about international.\n\nKathryn J. McLay\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. I think if you look at our e-comm result, it's -3%, and that, I don't think, is; it's distorted by BBG. If you actually look at the underlying growth across the businesses, Walmex grew by 16% from an e-comm perspective. Canada grew in e-comm by 16%. A part of that was rolling out Delivery Pass to a significant number of stores. If you look at China, their business grew, their e-comm business grew by 38%. So I think all of the teams are really focused on really getting the disciplines right of a perfect order and making sure that the experience to the customer is delightful.\nI think we continue to learn from each of the different businesses. The Flipkart team were here with us yesterday, and it's fascinating to see what they're learning through using GenAI through Big Billion Days. There's just some really clever capability that makes it very seamless and easy to be able to shop online. And then if you look at it from a marketplace perspective, we launched in Mexico, Canada, Chile, and South Africa marketplace during the last 12 months.\nObviously, Flipkart is our largest and more mature marketplace business, but we're seeing accelerated marketplace growth also through our cross-border trade. We opened that through Mexico and Canada to US cross-border sellers. And lastly, we launched Walmart Fulfillment Services in Mexico, Canada, and South Africa in the past 12 months. So we've seen good results, but we're really positive about the growth potential of both marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nThat's an exciting time. Paul, thanks for the question. I think what's really interesting for all of us, but definitely for Sam's, is that members want this, and so we're giving them what they want. We're at 13% of sales, 16% growth in the quarter, but we think it's a really huge opportunity. As I think about e-commerce and omnichannel sales for Sam's, I think about a digitally connected member. So Scan & Go teaches our members that we're a digitally relevant business, and they look to shop online and rather on the web or on the apps, and we feel really good about that. We've got all-time highs in that space.\nThe other thing that's really interesting is as we look at the new members, we've got an all-time high number of memberships in Sam's, and a lot of those people that are coming in now are digitally engaged members. They're coming in, and they're buying new memberships digitally. So we're feeling good. In terms of mix, GM and Club pick, so grocery, pantry, they're all strong, which we're feeling good about.\nWe don't have a marketplace in Sam's yet. We're very focused on items and on curation of great items. And I think that's going to be really important for the Sam's business as we go forward. And the thing that I'd finish with there is that great items drive organic traffic. So we'll continue to focus on those great items, and I think we'll continue to get a lot of organic traffic there. Oh, you also asked about general merchandise. Would you repeat that part of the question?\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nI was just curious how general merchandise performed online within the US business. I think last time you said there were several categories that were up double digits. Curious how some of those general merch categories perform.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYeah, Paul. Really positive strength in categories like hard lines. Our auto care center is running really well. And the events we talked about or I mentioned earlier, it's great to see momentum with strong toy items. Customers are responding to great gifts like the Barbie Malibu House, which is selling for $69. It was $89 before it went on rollback. So those types of items are working really well. It's also great to see after the redesign of the app, how the team is merchandising general merchandise reflective of the season's trends.\nThe site was really on point for Halloween, before that for Labor Day. You'll see the site flip quite frequently. The team's doing a nice job reacting in categories to the plans that they have. There's some categories there with strength. As I said, there's still a long way between here and the holidays. We have a good plan. Our people are ready. Our inventory's in position. We're ready for our customers.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, thank you. Good morning. We were wondering if you could go into any more detail as to what would explain a softening in late October. Do you think it could partially be due to student loans, or is it more of a function of being a shoulder period or a lull before the holiday? And does the variability you're seeing week to week that you noted increase the risk in being more promotional than maybe was originally planned or expected in Q4?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nKate, this is John David. I'll take this. You're right to call out some of the economic factors that may be driving this. We're seeing credit tightening. We're in a period of time, 12 months after the Fed has begun raising rates. We've seen consumer balance sheets that are getting back close to pre-pandemic levels. You've got the repayment of student loans, which affects about 27 million Americans. So all of these things could be contributing.\nI do want to point out, John talked about the impact that weather can have on our business. I'm learning that that can have profound effects in consumer shopping patterns. And we saw anomalous weather in the back half of October. So there's a number of different reasons. We can't put our finger on it exactly. And so that's why we take a little bit more of a cautious stance as we go into the Q4, calling out perhaps more variability because there are some trends that have been different than what we saw the first 11 weeks of the quarter. Not to be alarmist, I think our business is still performing really well. And it's why we called out what we've seen thus far in November.\nIn particular, the events that we've had in Walmart US, some of the more festive events internationally, we've seen strong response from our customers. But this was the trend we saw in the back half of October was different than anything else we've seen this year. So we simply want to call that out. In regards to promotion, maybe the segment CEOs want to comment on this, but I feel like we're in a good place from overall and inventory level. I don't necessarily see a more promotional holiday season than what we were currently planning.\n\nJohn R. Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nThis is John. Kate. Good morning. I think what's encouraging is that our traffic, our transaction counts remain strong and consistent throughout the quarter. The end of October, we did grow our Halloween business a little less than we expected.\nI'm sure there's something to do with weather and it being on a Tuesday, which is different than prior years. And then as we got into November, with the cold weather, we saw cold weather categories respond right away. Our event was strong. So John David said it right. We're just cautious of the shift that we did see. But overall, seeing the number of customers who shop continue to grow, we've seen new customers all year across a wide variety of income groups.\nWe'll be ready for all of those customers, and we'll be ready for anything that they need at the time. I really like the flexibility the team has built in. We delivered Halloween up until 6:00PM on the date of the holiday, which is something we haven't been able to do before. So our express and same-day delivery service continues to grow, which is helping us right up until the point customers need product.\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Looking towards next year, how linear will the relationship be between Walmart's overall comp and the operating income growth? So if you only comp 2%, let's say, could you still grow operating income at the higher end of your range, call it 7% to 8%? And how does the prospect of broad-based deflation impact that, especially as some of the naysayers say that Walmart's comp in recent quarters has just been driven by the impact of inflation? Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nWell, Michael, it's good to speak with you. One of the things that we're looking at closely in our business is units, and we've seen good growth in units. So it has not been entirely driven by just higher prices. We think we're positioned well as we go into the end of this year and into next year. To answer your question, it would depend upon what's driving the 2% comp. And so it's hard to extrapolate trends from this year into that.\nThe team here, though, is very focused on what could happen in a more deflationary environment and making sure that we have a cost structure that supports the revenue environment that we operate in. And so when you think about the relationship between operating income and sales on a multi-year basis, we actually feel like we're in a really strong position given what's happening in the business.\nFrom one quarter to the next, that may not always be the case as we manage through certain headwinds, but we feel like we're positioned well for virtually any economic environment. I'll remind you, I know there's maybe trepidation or concern among consumer health. This is when we shine. This is when Walmart is at its best, when we can deliver value for our members and customers. So we look forward to being able to put up financial results in any economic environment.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nMichael, we want to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep prices as low as possible for our customers. I'm really pleased in the US business that our rollback count has up significantly over last year. It was a lot of fun to be able to tell all of our customers that Thanksgiving at Walmart this year will be a lower price than what it was a year ago. We worked really hard the last two years to keep it flat, and it's coming down. That's great for customers. You had really stubborn inflation in categories like dry grocery.\nSo I'm excited when I'm in stores, and I was in Uvalde, Texas the other day. The number of rollbacks that we have out on feature in front of customers right up front in categories like dry grocery. A lot of our fresh categories have come in line. Eggs and dairy have come back in line from a year ago. That's great for customers. As John David said, that's the time that we win. We deliver value, and our team's ready to do that in any condition.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. I had a question just on the SG&A line. So at least in the Walmart US business, it appears both wage inflation and remodels appear to be a significant headwind on that line. So I was curious if you expect those headwinds to continue into next year.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nRupesh, good morning. It's John. No, the remodels, really, that was a big number of remodels we hit. I mentioned earlier, 197 remodels completed between late October and 3 November. Of course, we'll continue our remodel program throughout next year. We have a good plan on the number of sites, and we're excited about the results that we're seeing from those.\nWe definitely hear and know that our results change for categories like apparel, home. I think we have a good plan there. It was a higher number at the end of the quarter and into the month than what we had originally planned for. Some had slipped into later periods. I think we'll have a good balance as we move forward. On wages, we're staffed ready for the holiday for the most part. Stores and distribution centers are completely staffed. There are some locations that will continue to hire. We didn't go out this year with a large number of people that we intended to hire for the holiday. We're happy with our full-time-part-time ratio.\nAnd where we need hours the next few weeks, which is really next week for food leading into the event Wednesday, going into the Thanksgiving holidays and Black Friday, we'll be ready to manage the business with our existing associates.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. On general merchandise, the low to mid-single-digit deflation that you're seeing relative to the comp that you put up would imply maybe that the units have improved sequentially. So one, can you talk about what you are seeing in units, your current price gap this holiday, and how might you be thinking about price versus units dynamic into next year? And then, too, I just wanted to see if Kath and Chris would like to share their initial reflections on the new role.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSo the first question's about units and general merchandise. And as prices have come down, are we seeing elasticity in units going up? Thanks for that. Good morning Krisztina. So let's talk about general merchandise first. Customers are responding to rollbacks. I mentioned one earlier in the Barbie category, which is the Malibu Dream House. So we see that consistently across other items and toys. And toys is top of mind because it's the Christmas, whether it's the Melissa & Doug home set that's rolled back by $10 to $25. We have the old classic Furby that's $49 down from $59. Really good unit movements.\nWe're also happy to see, as I said earlier, the number of rollbacks that are across the entire store and the assortment, over 50% over last year. So customers are responding, but most importantly, our team is proud to offer great values and lower prices to customers. We've been in a pretty steep inflationary environment the last couple of years, so it's good to see some of these prices come back in line.\nAnd as far as how we think about that going forward, we mentioned this earlier, that the results in e-commerce are quite encouraging at +24% for the quarter. And the breadth of the offer in e-commerce as it develops, I think, is quite encouraging with growth in the marketplace, continued acceleration of the online pickup delivery business, and our first-party business.\nAs we get into this holiday season, the team has worked really hard on inventory positioning, the condition in stores. Our MPS levels are in a really good spot and have continued to improve. I think the result of that is we've had consistent traffic growth throughout the quarter, and we continue to see that, which is a good sign for what may be to come.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nI think it's going to be interesting to watch how the dynamic plays out between general merchandise and food. So if you've got food prices, if you double-click on that, dry grocery versus fresh, and think about where prices are compared to a year ago, in general, they're still up, and the two-year stack is high. But in some fresh categories, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing prices come down.\nOn the GM side, as things have come down, it's come down kind of steep in the last few weeks, maybe, relative to what we had seen before. So I think it's to be seen. If the food prices come down in dry grocery and consumables and we start seeing deflation in those categories, that'll free up dollars to be spent in general merchandise. With the rollback positioning and some of the prices we're hitting, it makes sense that people would be able to shift back to GM as they shop the box or the app.\nThe great thing about our position is we don't really care. They can buy whatever they want to buy. We're positioned for food. We're positioned with fresh. We're positioned with apparel, with hard lines, and with holiday season with the categories like toys.\nSo we've got a good value, regardless of which category and department you look at, and we'll play to shift as it happens. And if we end up where both sides, food and GM, are deflated, then we just need to focus on driving even more units, to your point. But if they've got dollars to spend, they'll spend them. And we're there for that. And we can do it in store club. We can do it with pickup. We can do it with delivery. So we feel good about our position, and we'll just manage it as the weeks and months play out and are as fascinated to watch it as you are. Kath, how's the job going?\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs",
    "content2": "Yeah. Krisztina. Thanks for the question. I would say, first of all, it's incredible that it's only been a quarter since I stepped into the role. It's Judith and the team have honed a really exciting portfolio of businesses, and it's been great to be able to get out into the markets. I've, over the last quarter, been in Mexico, China, and India. And just looking at the pace of transformation and the way the teams rise to the challenge to be relevant in those local communities is extraordinary.\nAnd the ability to cross-learn between markets is such a great gift that we have in the international business. So I've been impressed by the strength of the teams that we have out there and also just really impressed by how they're translating our purpose and mission to save people money so that they can live better into being really relevant.\nSo whether it's in Canada, where they're able to actually have a Thanksgiving meal at a price lower than last year, whether it was in Walmex or, sorry, in Mexico, where they've held down prices on a basket of essential items. No matter where it is, where you are in the international portfolio, the teams are working really hard to be relevant and help those communities celebrate the holiday and festivals that are rolling out over Q3 and into Q4. So excited to join the team.\n\nChris Nicholas\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kath. Krisztina, thanks for the question. I think probably I'd just like to start with the prerogative that I have of now running this business to thank the Sam's Club Associates for such a brilliant quarter and for the hard work that they have done to deliver that set of results.\nThe team I'm really proud of, and I'm grateful to be part of that club. And honestly, it's kind of a lot of fun to be here, and Kath knows that and told me that that would be the case. I'm really grateful for the strong foundation that the Sam's Club team has built. It's brilliant talent, a deep bench of merchant talent, and it really is a merchant-led business.\nWe've got an amazing member-led culture, fantastic clubs and associates, great items, strong brand in Member's Mark, and the beginnings of a world-class e-commerce business. And all of that drives really strong member value. So I see a really unique opportunity for Sam's to use this momentum as a jumping-off point to accelerate.\nSo driving growth through digital engagement, offering unique value through great items that consumers can't get anywhere else, and a deep understanding of members in a way that will make us more relevant to them, both in club and digitally, so we can appeal to an even broader set of consumers. So yeah, a lot to go for. Really exciting. So thanks for asking.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, thanks for taking my question. Actually, it's a follow-up question on deflation. I was hoping Doug or anyone else could just talk about just to clarify what's driving the LIFO tailwinds. Is it all general merchandise right now, or is there grocery in there? And Doug, you mentioned lowering grocery prices, but you also mentioned, I think, stubborn inflation still out there in your opening comments. Is there just maybe even a little more color? Is dry grocery getting set to deflate? Is that what you guys are seeing? And then also, where do wage pressures come in? Do you think wage pressures are also sort of disinflating now?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nRobbie, good to speak with you. This is John David. I'll start and address the LIFO part of the question and then maybe hand it over to Doug and others. On the improvements that we've made there, that is, as you know, dependent upon the cost of goods that we're buying.\nAnd we've seen the pricing level come down overall broadly, but I don't want to miss the point to mention that our teams have actually done a really good job of working with suppliers to help affect that outcome. So this is not something that just happens to us. The team has worked to actually have this outcome. So it's far better than what we expected when we went into the beginning of the year, and we're actually pleased to see this outcome.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd John David, is that just to clarify, is that general merchandise vendors, or is that all vendors, including grocery vendors?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nIt's across all categories. It probably skews a little bit more to consumables and GM.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nI think, Robbie, this is generally across markets. We have an inflationary environment. The US and what we went through here the last few years is more dramatic than what I'd seen in the US, but of course, had experienced that in Brazil, Argentina, and other places. China is not really inflated. That's an outlier as it relates to this conversation.\nBut in the US specifically, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, in the fresh categories, you see beef up, but dairy, eggs, chicken, seafood down. So commodities will do what commodities will do. General merchandise had been coming down and came down a little more aggressively in the last few weeks or months than the trend before that, which we think is a really good thing.\nBut it does start to have an impact on dollars when units don't go up enough to offset the deflationary impact as it relates to GM. The dry grocery and consumables question feels like the key question. Will it come down? Will those categories come down? We hope they will. On a two-year stack in Walmart US, John, I think we're still mid-double digits, slightly up versus a year ago.\nBut we think we may see dry grocery and consumables start to deflate in the coming weeks and months. So as we look ahead to next year, we could find ourselves in Walmart US with a deflationary environment. John David mentioned earlier that causes us to think about, what are we doing with expenses? Are we ready for that? It's too early to call how dramatic it'll be. As we mentioned earlier, we are happy about it. We want our customers and members to have lower prices, and we'll manage mix, and we'll manage through it better than anyone. It doesn't change anything about our plan.\nAll the things that we've been doing to change to be able to serve people in new ways, like with pickup and delivery, the expansion of the marketplace, all the things that flow from that that help us with operating income, all those things are still true regardless of what the top-line dollar growth rate looks like as a total enterprise. For a while now, we've been talking about four and greater than four.\nIf you look back at the last three years, I'm hard-pressed to remember 2019. It seems like a long time ago, but 2019 grew faster than 2018 on a calendar year basis. So we had a trending growth rate moving the right direction, and then the pandemic hits, and then inflation hits. So if you look back at the last three or four years, we've been growing faster than four.\nIf we find ourselves in a deflationary environment next year and we grow at four or a little less than four or around four, as long as we're growing share and improving what we're doing for customers and members on the top line, that'll be what it'll be. We'll get as much as we earn. But the operating income percentage will still go up because we've got this automation plan, and we've got the digital businesses reshaping the income statement, which will help returns. So the plan is the plan.\nWe are executing. We're just trying to communicate with you today as we release our results what we saw the last part of October in Walmart US in particular, communicate what happened with expenses. But fundamentally, what's happening here is exactly what was happening here three months ago, six months ago. We're executing our plan.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nJust anything on wage pressures, Doug?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nWage inflation is not as bad as it was before. John mentioned earlier what happened in Walmart US. I'm not worried about wages. We've got an appropriate wage improvement for our associates planned for next year. I think we're in good shape. We're staffed. We've got a good plan. I'm not concerned about that aspect of it.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. So another question actually on remodels. I know you had a lot over the last couple of months, as you referred to. But given the strong returns on the remodels, does it make sense to continue to accelerate that process even if it holds back earnings flow through a bit in the near term? Then related to that, if you do accelerate the process, where do you have to go on the timeline to where you start to see more benefit than incremental expense on that basis? Thanks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nI think the short answer is it does make sense to accelerate, and we have accelerated. So we will complete this year a couple hundred more than we did the last few years. So the number of remodels has gone up. The team has gotten much more, I'd say, gotten their arms around the process, the new fixtures, the changes. So the remodels are happening a bit quicker and more smoothly than they were years past. Also, the supply chain's helping. We were doing remodels in 2021 and 2022 where we had a hard time getting fixtures, getting parts, and getting the equipment in on time.\nSo we're feeling better about the way these are all coming together. The performance of the remodels we continue to be pleased with on the top line. We continue to be pleased with the MPS numbers we see. The customer reaction of the new assortment, particularly, as I mentioned earlier, apparel, pets, beauty, home, and a number of categories is really great. And I mentioned I was in one that completed just a couple of weeks ago in Uvalde, Texas. And just such a great investment in the community. It makes the store feel new, refreshed. There's a different look in their eye and a smile. The associates are thrilled with the result, and they were really proud of it.\nAs we go on the holidays, I think that customers will really love to see in these communities all across the US more access to different products than they had before. One of the things that's important in all these remodel processes is that the customer notices the difference, and they notice the difference not only in the facility but in the product. I think we're delivering both of those in the remodel. We'll continue an aggressive plan for the remodel locations into next year.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nSo is there a headwind to profit flow through as that process continues at that pace?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nNo, it's in the plan. What happened in Q3 is a few that had been in process slipped into late October, and then 117 in one day was quite a big number.\nSo what you'll see going forward is a more balanced distribution of remodels completing by quarter. Ideally, we would have liked to complete; we wouldn't want to have those so close to the holiday. I think the teams have done a nice job of finishing the remodels and then getting back right into merchandising for the holiday so to be more even across quarters, but that's all built into our plan.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the gross margin in the US. The margin was off a touch year to year. I think the expectation was that it maybe could have been better than that. I was hoping that you could provide some of the puts and takes around that. I'm not sure if GLP-1 is maybe having a bigger impact there. So just thoughts on the gross margin this quarter and then maybe how we should think about that in Q4. And then a clarification around the legal charge. I think you said $75 million, but then 40 basis points. So I'm not really sure. I'm a little bit confused about that. Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYeah. The legal charge is 40 basis points. Go with that number. And as it relates to our guidance for the year, I'll point out that 7% to 7.5% operating income on our business is $125 million. That is really more, it's kind of a precise number for the size business that we are. The magnitude of some of these things like the hurricane, like the legal charges, push us to the lower end of that range for the year.\nOn general merchandise, we did see some of the impact from business mix in the quarter. We benefited from that. The US was up, I think, five basis points, if I remember correctly. But as Doug noted too, we're certainly trying to lower prices for our customers and make sure that we're providing the value that they need. So there's a balance of all of that that's impacting those numbers.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just GLP-1 just came up here in that last question. Just curious. We hear it's a thing. Maybe expand on maybe what you're seeing there, how it's impacting your business currently, and what you see for that going forward. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nHey, Peter. Good morning. Thanks for the question. No, it's still early, and time will tell how this affects the customer and affects the business. As we said before, we're seeing some shifts in categories, but right now, we really don't have anything else to add above and beyond what we've said in the past.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on the consumer. I know we've discussed quite a few times today, but you guys throughout the year have discussed a number of different signals of sensitivity, buying more around paycheck cycles, seeking more value, and coming out for the promotional events. So just curious if you could provide a little bit more perspective on that and maybe more specifically what you are seeing in terms of market share across income cohorts. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. For Walmart US specifically, John, as it relates to share?\n\nJohn R. Furner\n\nPresident and CEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nYeah. Thanks for asking that. We've been pleased to see share growth all year, and we've talked about that across income groups. And what's been encouraging as of late is a bit higher share growth in general merchandise categories. We saw that month by month throughout Q3.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nI don't know that we have a lot more to add on the consumer than what we've already said. I think we covered it. We're well-positioned, and I think our value proposition across categories and the way we're serving people, which helps them save time as well as save money, causes us to feel good about our position for the quarter.\nWe get a lot of questions about what's happening in the US economy and other economies, and what's happening with the consumer, and we feel compelled sometimes to try and help explain what we're seeing. But to be clear, from our point of view, we are front-footed, offensive, and feeling good about our opportunities. Stores and clubs look good. So that's the way we're thinking about the quarter.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. I'll just wrap up here. We've gone a little over time. I'm as excited as I have been. We're executing our plan. We've got a good plan. Customers and members are choosing us, and I think they have been choosing us not only because of price leadership, which they can count on and will continue, but also because we're making it easier to shop with us. Our MPS scores in stores and clubs are encouraging.\nOur MPS scores, as they're improving across pickup and delivery, are encouraging. We just want to save people money and time, and make this easy, and help them have a great holiday season. And I think as it relates to the top line, we can continue to expect that we will outperform and do well. And as it relates to operating income growth, we'll grow it faster than sales over time because we've got this really good automation plan. The metrics that John David outlined when we started the call are really encouraging.\nWe continue to feel very good about what that's going to mean for our business. Then as it relates to the business mix, having e-commerce grow so much across our segments is awesome and encouraging. As a reminder, that's a combination of first and third party. As we grow with our suppliers and also with our marketplace sellers, we get those opportunities to serve them with ads, to serve them through fulfillment services, to monetize our data in different ways.\nThe business model change will continue, which will enable that operating income growth to help us improve returns over time. We're antsy about Christmas every year. This is my 33rd year, and I feel like it's a bit of a rerun in that it seems like we're always talking about customers being price conscious, and we always will be.\nThey're always looking for the hot toy and the right gift for Christmas, and they'll come buy food for us for Thanksgiving, and for the Christmas meal. Then New Year's will come, and we'll have clearance prices after Christmas, and we'll have a strong January because customers will react to clearance, at least the first couple of weeks when that's happening. We'll update you on the Q4 and tell you how it went. But we feel really good about our position and excited about executing this plan and appreciate your ongoing support and interest in our company.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero from your telephone keypad. Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin.\n\nStephanie Wissink\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Walmart\n\nThank you and welcome, everyone. We're excited to discuss with you the results of a strong Q2 and our upwardly revised outlook for the year. Joining me are Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, and CFO, John David Rainey.

Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, we are now ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter. We're gaining share across markets and formats, growing units sold, transaction counts are positive across markets, and growth in operating income is outpacing sales. We're really pleased with our first half performance. For the quarter, comp sales for Walmart US were ahead of where we thought they'd be at 6.4%. Sam's Club US was 5.5%, and sales for International were up 11%, led by double-digit growth at Walmex and China. Flipkart's GMV was also strong. The team is driving results in the short term and building for the future. We're a people-led, tech-powered, omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. We like who we are, and we like who we're becoming. We're positioned for growth.\nWe can serve people how they want to be served, whether that's in a store or club, picking up an order curbside, or having it delivered. We continue to grow some of our newer businesses, which shape the overall model in a positive way, helping to enable us to grow profit faster than sales. We're setting the right capital priorities, and you can expect us to continue investing in the areas we've talked about, like technology, including automation, store and club remodels, and with new stores and clubs in select markets. As it relates to technology, our approach to new tools like generative AI is to focus on making shopping easier and more convenient for our customers and members, and helping our associates enjoy more satisfying and productive work. Ultimately, the power of generative AI, or any technology, is only as good as the data that powers it.\nOur data assets are unique, and we're excited about the potential to leverage them in new and impactful ways. We're taking large language models developed by our partners and by the broader tech community and adding retail context to create models that are uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, our associates, and our supply chain. We'll unlock value for shareholders through the combination of our physical automation work with our data and increasingly intelligent software. We have a sharp focus on ROI as we drive results and set our capital priorities. The financial framework we laid out at our investment community meeting in April is evident in our results from the last two quarters. The remodel program I mentioned includes items to support our goal of becoming a regenerative company as we put things like new refrigeration equipment and EV charging stations in place.\nI was in Chile last week where I got to participate in the grand opening of a new hydrogen plant in Santiago that supports our strong business in that country. While I'm on the subject of regeneration, we recently announced a new collaboration focused on supporting US and Canadian farmers to help improve soil health and water quality. Our collective goal is to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals by 2030. Some days I still get amazed by all the good work happening across our company. As a global retailer, we see how our customers and members are affected by what's happening at a macro level and how that influences their behaviors.\nJobs, wages, and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers, but rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs, and tightening lending standards, and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure. I was in Calgary visiting stores a couple of weeks ago, and our Canadian customers are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates faster than in the US, given their shorter-term mortgages. When you put all this together, we see families that are discerning about what they're spending on. They're setting priorities and spending on the things they care most about. We saw that during the first half of the year with Chinese New Year and Easter, and more recently with 4 July 2024 and the start of back to school, where sales are ahead of plan so far.\nWe see them buying more private brand items, and they're buying more grocery staples and in-home meal options consistent with eating at home. Our customers and members are resilient. They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them. We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories. We're encouraged by how general merchandise performed during the Q1 versus our expectations. We still expect food, consumables, and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs, to grow as a percent of total in the back half, but the trends we see in general merchandise sales make us feel more optimistic about those categories in the back half of the year.\nOur stores and clubs give us a competitive advantage and power our o mnichannel model. Our curbside pickup business continues to grow as people look for ways to save time, and store-fulfilled delivery is now growing faster than pickup across all three segments. Delivery speed and accuracy are obviously important, and I like how we're leveraging our physical assets. In the US, we have more than 4,000 stores and nearly 600 Sam's Clubs making same-day deliveries, and in nearly 2,000 stores and clubs internationally. We're increasingly measuring those deliveries in hours rather than days. In China, where we deliver from all our stores, nearly 80% of digital orders are delivered in under one hour. I like how we're constantly improving delivery speed. It's important to our customers and to our strategy, and I like how we're building mutually reinforcing businesses.\nRunning great stores and scaling eCommerce are and will be our top priorities. The way we design them, along with our marketplace, fulfillment services, and advertising business, is key. We'll keep prioritizing omni-retail, but we have good opportunities in healthcare and financial services in multiple markets. The growth of PhonePe has been fantastic, and we're building other financial products like Cashi Mexico and through ONE here in the US. We continue to build our healthcare services capabilities with clinic expansion. As I look at the remainder of the year, our immediate focus is on getting product costs and retails down to fight inflation, which will help with mix, improving execution of pickup and delivery orders, expense management, and inventory management by item and category. I'll wrap up by saying a big thank you to our associates. As always, they're making a difference every day for our customers and members.\nAs we close out back to school and get ready for the holidays, their execution day to day and commitment to our customers and members is as critical as ever. Thank you for your interest in our company. Over to you, John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver another strong quarter with better-than-expected results in sales, operating income, and adjusted EPS. Sales were strong across all segments, and we gained US market share in grocery in both units and dollars while delivering gross margin rate expansion. Our focus on saving customers' time and money continues to resonate, especially in high-volume seasonal periods. We have good momentum in the business. Year- to-date, we grew sales by over 6.5%, adjusted operating income by about 12%, and adjusted EPS by roughly 8%. With our Q2 results coming in better than expected, we're increasing our full-year guidance, and we're well-positioned as we enter the back half. I'll discuss guidance shortly, but first, I'd like to review highlights of our Q2 results using our financial framework of growth, margins, and returns. Starting with growth.\nFor the Q1, constant currency sales increased 5.5%, or more than $8 billion. Walmart US comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 6.4% with growth in both store and digital transactions. Grocery and health and wellness sales continue to outperform, and we're encouraged by the modest sequential improvement in general merchandise. eCommerce sales were up 24%, driven by store-fulfilled pickup, delivery, and advertising. We like the trends we're seeing in eCommerce. Customers are increasingly counting on us for convenience, and they're visiting our app and sites more often. In Q2, weekly active digital users grew more than 20%. Similar to Q1, consumer spending remains resilient at the headline level. Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often. We see grocery staples and in-home meal options being purchased more often.\nSales of general merchandise kitchen tools like hand blenders and stand mixers have inflected higher as customers are preparing more food at home. They're also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands. Customers still want to celebrate key moments. Over the last year here in the US, we partnered with suppliers to utilize rollbacks and offer select seasonal baskets of goods at the same prices as last year, essentially removing the impact of inflation. Customer response has been strong, and sales have exceeded plan for events like Memorial Day, 4 July 2024, and our Walmart+ Week savings event. We're taking a similar inflation-fighting approach to back to school with a basket of 14 of the most popular classroom essentials for under $13. In our International segment, sales were strong, up 11% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Walmex, China, and Flipkart.\neCommerce grew 26%, and we experienced positive store traffic across markets. Similar to the US, customers are still pressured by elevated inflation with spend over-indexing towards food and consumables. We're seeing higher private brand penetration across markets as customers globally look for a combination of value and quality. In Sam's Club US comp sales, excluding fuel, increased more than 5%, with member fee income up 7%. On margins, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points as we lapped last year's elevated levels of inventory markdowns and supply chain costs. These tailwinds were partially offset by ongoing category mix pressure as grocery and health and wellness sales outperformed general merchandise. One of our strategic priorities is improving digital margins with an eye towards eCommerce profitability. I'm pleased with the progress we're making, particularly in Walmart US contribution profit, which has been driven by fulfillment efficiencies and better product margins.\nWe're leveraging our stores to fulfill more than 50% of digital orders and activating our local delivery networks to get product to customers faster at lower cost. At our investment community meeting in April, I said that we expected 200 basis points of improvement in contribution profit this year, and we're on track to achieve that goal. We're also pleased with the performance of our higher margin growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni-retail model. I'll provide highlights on each of these. First, marketplace. We're continuing to scale our marketplace in the US with new items and sellers. The number of customers buying items on our marketplace increased 14% in Q2. Sales were strong in both consumables and general merchandise categories with double-digit growth across home, apparel, and hard lines. The number of sellers utilizing our fulfillment services increased more than 50%.\nIn Mexico, we also expanded the number of sellers and items available on the marketplace, resulting in 40% GMV growth for the quarter. In Canada, we opened our first automated eCommerce fulfillment center in Alberta, which includes Walmart fulfillment services and expands two-day shipping to 97% of households. In India, Flipkart's Myntra is the country's largest eCommerce marketplace for fashion and lifestyle products, offering top brands to customers across India. Myntra now provides access to more than 6,000 brands on its marketplace. Moving to advertising, our global advertising business delivered strong growth of approximately 35%. In the US, Walmart Connect sales increased 36% in Q2, and the business has nearly doubled in size over the past two years. We're seeing strong growth in sponsored ads and increased demand for in-store activation. Advertiser count grew 60% with strong momentum in new advertisers. Sam's advertising business grew 33%.\nThe in-club sales attribution feature for search and sponsored ads has generated strong interest from advertisers. On average, advertisers are seeing a nearly 30% improvement on the returns of digital ad spend as they gain full visibility to the member journey from intent to purchase, both online and in clubs. In International, the advertising business grew nearly 40%. Lastly, membership. Sam's Club US member counts increased mid-single digits with strong Plus membership growth and renewals as Plus penetration is up 1.3 percentage points versus last year. During the quarter, we achieved record member acquisition tied to Walmart+ Week and continue to enhance the value of the Walmart+ membership. We introduced Walmart+ Assist, which provides a 50% discount off the regular membership fee for customers receiving government assistance. We also partnered with Expedia Group to launch new travel benefits for members.\nTurning back to the middle of the P&L, as expected, SG&A expenses were higher versus last year and deleveraged 33 basis points. This reflects higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance, tech investments, and increased store remodel costs in the US. Partially offsetting this, International expenses leveraged significantly on strong sales growth. As we increasingly utilize technology in our business, we're pleased with the performance metrics from our newly automated distribution and fulfillment nodes. Our automated eCommerce fulfillment centers are achieving efficiencies of 30% higher units per hour than non-automated buildings. We're also seeing increased productivity from the more than 15% of stores now being served by automated regional distribution centers. It's early in the rollout process, but we're encouraged that some of these facilities are driving operating leverage well beyond our initial expectations.\nQ2, adjusted operating income grew more than 8%, and our adjusted EPS of $1.84 was up 4%. Our plan is to grow operating income faster than sales, and our Q2 performance achieved this despite lapping the $173 million insurance settlement that benefited International's other income last year. Similar to Q1, below-the-line items were pressured by higher net interest expense, reflecting the increase in rates, and non-controlling interest due in part to stronger results from Walmex. The team continued to do a good job managing inventory, and we ended the quarter down 5%, including an 8% decline in Walmart US. We feel good about the progress we've made on in-stock levels as supply chain has normalized and the composition of our inventory mix has improved. We're maintaining discipline in how we're buying general merchandise during this uncertain macro environment to mitigate future risk if demand softens.\nROI, or return on investment, declined 100 basis points. As a reminder, we calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis, and the decline in Q2 is a result of nearly $4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year, related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted Q2 ROI by 140 basis points. As we lap these discrete charges in the coming quarters, we expect a stronger ROI inflection in the back half of the year. We're also starting to realize some benefits from productivity initiatives that were initially planned for fiscal year 2025, and we continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years. I'll now briefly discuss some additional Q2 highlights for each segment.\nFor Walmart US, our 6.4% sales comp included a high single-digit increase in grocery and a high teens increase in health and wellness. Although general merchandise sales declined low single digits versus last year, these results were 300 basis points better than Q1, aided by outperformance from early back-to-school shopping and our Walmart+ savings event. We saw a 240 basis point shift in sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness in Q2. Grocery inflation moderated more than 400 basis points from Q1 levels and more than 700 basis points year-over-year to a high single-digit increase as we lapped higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack, grocery inflation remained over 20%. We're encouraged by the growth in units sold, particularly in food categories where disinflation is more pronounced, such as fresh meats, seafood, and eggs.\nIn addition, private brand sales in grocery were up more than 9%, with penetration up nearly 40 basis points in Q2 and up more than 170 basis points on a two-year stack. Lower markdowns and supply chain costs resulted in a gross margin rate increase of 40 basis points despite ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. The negative impact to margin mix from outsized growth in branded drugs accelerated in Q2. Other income grew nearly 4%, led by continued growth in Walmart+ memberships. Overall, Walmart US operating income increased 7.6%. Our International segment delivered another impressive quarter with double-digit sales growth and strong underlying profit growth. Operating income increased 2.2% but was negatively impacted by 20 percentage points from lapping last year's insurance recovery that I mentioned earlier. Walmex had another strong quarter with sales up 10%, reflecting strength in our bodega stores, Sam's Clubs, and eCommerce.\neCommerce sales grew in the low 20s with traffic up more than 5%. Walmex is an excellent example of our omnichannel retail strength across formats and channels. Bodega Aurrerá is celebrating its 65th anniversary and has become the most valuable retail brand in Mexico. These bodega stores have consistently delivered strong performance and continue to accelerate eCommerce to better serve customers, now offering more than 60,000 SKUs from 586 stores in 299 cities. In China, sales increased 22%, led by strength from Sam's Club and eCommerce. We're executing well with increased online and offline traffic across both the Sam's and hypermarket formats. In India, Flipkart delivered strong GMV and net sales growth as the core business continues to perform well. The team continues to focus on expanding the ecosystem of products and services like advertising, travel, and healthcare, and on delivering continued contribution profit improvement.\nFlipkart's consistent progress and performance reinforces our confidence in the long-term value of this business. India is leading the largest digital transformation in the world, and Flipkart is the leading marketplace in India. We continue to be super impressed with PhonePe's strong and consistent performance. Annualized TPV, or total payment volume, has surpassed $1.15 trillion, and for the first time, we processed more than 5 billion transactions in a single month. Sam's Club delivered another strong quarter with solid unit growth and eCommerce up 18%. It's encouraging to see members embrace omnichannel with strong in-club traffic gains and increasing engagement with our digital tools in and outside the club. In Q2, utilization of Scan & Go increased 570 basis points, and curbside pickup saw double-digit growth. Similar to Walmart, sales strength at Sam's was led by grocery and healthcare categories as members focus on value and essentials.\nWhile discretionary categories were pressured overall, items with compelling price and quality and strong value to market are driving sales. Sam's Club operating income was up 22% due in part to lower LIFO charges. Turning to guidance, there continues to be a reasonable level of uncertainty in the economic backdrop for the balance of this year. While inflation is moderated and employment levels have been steady, credit markets have tightened, energy prices are higher, and some customers face additional expense from the resumption of student loan payments in October. As such, we continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook. We're raising our full-year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3. I'll highlight the key changes, but please refer to the press release for a full list of updated metrics.\nFor the full year, we now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 4% to 4.5%. We now anticipate LIFO will be a $200 million charge to operating income versus the $500 million charge that was in our prior guide. We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 7% to 7.5%. This now assumes a 30 basis point year-over-year tailwind from LIFO compared to our prior guidance, which assumed a 100 basis point headwind. We estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.36 to 6.46, including an expected 5-cent impact from LIFO. To bridge to our prior guide, we flowed through the Q2 beat, removed the Walmart US LIFO charges that were previously expected in Q3 and Q4, and modestly raised our sales expectations. Looking at Q3, we're now offering the following view.\nWe expect net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 3%. Operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 1%. This year-over-year growth is impacted by several comparison factors. We expect ongoing mix pressure impacts to gross margin to continue in Q3. We also expect a negative impact from fuel margins at Sam's Club versus last year's elevated levels. Similar to Q2, variable pay expense is expected to be higher in Q3 versus last year when we were below our planned performance. We don't typically guide currency, but it's worth noting that if rates stayed where they are currently, we'd see a $1.6 billion benefit to Q3 reported sales and reported operating income growth would be closer to 3.5%. Lastly, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.45 to 1.50.\nIn closing, we're pleased with the strong first half of the year, and we've positioned the business favorably for the back half. Our financial performance is validating our omnichannel strategy, driving organic sales growth while improving margins and returns. We're optimistic about our ability to improve our performance even more in the future. We like our position. And now I'll hand it back to [inaudible] few comments before the operator opens the line for questions.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nThank you, John David. Before we take your questions, I want to say a few words about the leadership changes we shared yesterday. Let's start by celebrating Judith. She has done a fantastic job in many roles over the 27 years she's been part of our company. She leaves her most recent role having delivered strong results and having transformed the business. It's a different portfolio, better positioned for the future, better positioned for growth on the top and bottom line. She's strengthened our culture and sets us up for a digital future at the same time. We're grateful. We're excited about Kath moving into the International leadership role. The results Kath and our team have delivered at Sam's speak for themselves. Her experience and passion to serve customers and members will take us to the next level. It'll be fun to watch her impact around the world.\nSome of you’ve met Chris Nicholas and know how capable he is. He joined us five years ago in a finance role, but with previous experience in merchandising and operations in several markets around the world. He’ll keep our member obsession going in Sam's Club US and pick right up where Kath left off. We also shared yesterday that Kieran Shanahan will join John’s team and become our Walmart US Chief Operating Officer. Kieran has 25 years with our company working in a wide variety of roles in all three segments. He’s well prepared to lead this big team and the change that’s coming through our automation investments in the supply chain. As they fill these new roles, John, Kath, Chris, and Kieran will have all four worked in all three operating segments of our business.\nThere's not only a lot of store and club expertise in this group, but there's also a great deal of digital and eCommerce experience. These are omnichannel merchants that are purpose-driven, proven leadership skills. The depth of leadership in our company is such an advantage. Batons get past, and we keep running, keep changing, and keep pushing things forward. I want to say congratulations to all of them, and now I'll turn it back over to the operator. We're happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one from your telephone keypad, and the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. So that we may address questions from as many participants as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRobbie Ohmes\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOh, hey, thanks for taking my question. Doug, you mentioned that you're seeing things in general merchandise. I think that makes you more optimistic about the back half. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing? I think John David said something about discipline buying in general merchandise. What are you seeing that's making you optimistic, and how should we think about general merchandise? And maybe if you could also weave in there, I know that you guys have continued to mention the high-income customer shopping. I think it's been more grocery-focused. Have you seen high-income customers broadening out into the rest of the store?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, Robbie, this is Doug. I'll go first, and then John or others can add if they want to. What's making me feel a little bit better is the run rate compared to the previous quarter and how back-to-school has started. Typically, when back-to-school is strong, it bodes well for what happens with Halloween, Christmas, and GM in the back half. I do think our food and consumables percentage total in Walmart US will still go up. Part of it's what's happened with inflation and disinflation in the GM categories. But relative to what I would have thought 90 days ago or when we started the year, GM is holding up better than I would have guessed. I feel like that with our store managers and the merchants, we want to have an optimistic posture on GM as we go into the back half.\nAnybody want to add anything?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nDoug, I'd like to give credit to the team for improvements they made. If you think about where we were last year with inventory headwinds of this year, I was in stores this week, and it's really clear that stores have the ability and are merchandising their store with discretion appropriately. They're on top of their markdowns. Backrooms are in much better shape. The second thing I think that's helping is the eCommerce team has done a nice job launching new products, things like registry for teachers, classrooms, parents, and lists. Those are all working and helping back-to-school. And then the last thing that I'd say is the team is doing a really nice job with seasonal events and holidays. One of the things that we hear consistently from customers right now is they're looking forward to celebrating again like they used to.\nIt's a bit of a theme that's coming through, and we certainly saw that for Memorial Day, July 4. Back-to-school started strong. So we're looking forward to the holiday. It's going to be a big holiday season. There are a lot of dynamics, as John David and Doug said, in the market, but we want to remain very flexible and prepared to help people get together and celebrate each of these holidays that are in front of us.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThere are also categories of general merchandise that, on our marketplace, saw double-digit increases, things like home, apparel, hard lines, which really gives you an indication of how our business is changing as we're selling more third-party assortment.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nIt is. And John David, I think our event, our plus event you mentioned in your remarks as well, was a good example. We had a high level of participation from marketplace sellers. We've talked about the number of items available on the sites, up almost 4x from a year ago. Our seller count has grown. The number of customers are growing. And Tom and the team have done a nice job building capabilities that will really help us in the future.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nOn the second part of your question, Robbie, with respect to high-income consumers, we continue to see share gains across all income demographics. I think encouragingly for us in the quarter, the number of categories that we saw share gain in actually expanded. But this has been pretty consistent for five or six quarters now, and it really points to the fact that our value proposition is resonating with customers. It's not just about Every Day Low Prices. It's also about convenience, and convenience matters to every household income demographic.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKate McShane\n\nU.S. Retail Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. With gross margin expanding about 50 basis points in the quarter, is there a way to quantify the buckets of contribution between the higher margin businesses like marketplace and advertising and the impact mix that's coming from the stronger grocery? And just given the more optimistic general merchandise commentary, is there any update to your mix assumptions in guidance for the second half when it comes to gross margins? Thank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThe biggest contributors to the gross margin expansion were really just the lapping of some of the markdowns that we had last year. I would point you to that as the single biggest contributor, but that's not to take away from some of the progress that we're seeing in terms of diversifying or expanding these other higher margin initiatives. Advertising is one I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Up 35% for the quarter, but equally as impressive, or perhaps more impressive, is the advertiser count was actually up 60% year-over-year in the quarter. It stands to reason. If we're gaining share and customers are shopping with us, then advertisers are going to want to spend their money where the eyeballs are.\nSo we're encouraged about this, and it really illustrates sort of this flywheel element of our business as we get stronger in marketplace and some of these other initiatives. It enables us to go out and be better in advertising and other things that tend to have a higher margin.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nRetail and Luxury Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi everybody. Judith, congrats as well. The guidance could be conservative based on the great quarter you just had. How are you thinking about what's incorporated in ticket and traffic for next quarter? And also, as we look forward to holiday, what are some highlights of how you're planning inventory, price points, assortment? Back-to-school can often correlate to holidays, so that's very encouraging that you're seeing good performance there. And just to follow up, you've done a great job with computer vision and neural networks, especially with inventory management. You called out generative AI and LLMs. What are your thoughts about how that may intersect with Walmart+ and all the data you have on being tech-enabled in terms of context and customer interaction? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nI'll take the last one first. This is Doug McMillon. Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about what's possible, and we've been working for a few years now to try and get our data in better shape so that we can really put it to work. We've still got room to improve there, but we have made progress. And when you start imagining what we can do to personalize for customers and members more effectively while still living in an EDLP world and driving the business model that way, because that's the winning strategy for us, there's a great opportunity for us to be more anticipatory and to be more relevant to them and communicate in a way that shows that we know who they are in a healthy way while protecting privacy.\nSo having that data go to work with our own large language models and using large language models from others presents a tremendous opportunity, and I think it'll unlock a lot of use cases on the customer member side. As I mentioned in the prerecorded remarks, the opportunity with associates is also terrific. The supply chain's the third area that comes to mind. So I think this will be an opportunity for us for a really long time to try and grow top line and be more efficient as a company by putting that technology to work.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nI'll take the first part of your question on guidance and maybe start on holiday before I turn to the segment CEOs. But on our assumptions on ticket and traffic, well, we saw a pretty equal balance between those in the Q2. Both were up, call it roughly 3%. It would stand to reason that as we get into the back half of the year and we lap some of the higher inflation from last year, that ticket in terms of the balance between those two, we may see a little less in ticket. But we're really encouraged by, as we noted, the strength in units that we had in the quarter. So pleased about that. And again, we're gaining share here, so I think our value proposition is resonating. With respect to the holiday, I'll just say one comment, maybe turn it to John.\nConsumers are not compromising on some of the holiday seasons. They're being choiceful in their spending, discerning, but around July 4 and some of the other holidays that we've seen, they're showing a willingness to spend. Our team is leaning into that, providing merchandise that they want to buy.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nThey are, John David. We've talked about this for a while, that flexibility in terms of what we offer is meaningful for customers and the transaction growth. We're proud of the team. We saw that in eCommerce. We mentioned marketplace, pickup, and delivery have been strong. In-store traffic and transaction count has also been strong. So having an offering that's there for the customer, however they want to shop, whenever they want to shop, is helping us. And having as many locations as we do certainly is an important part of the equation when it comes to delivering. The last thing I would say is in general merchandise and other categories where we have seen a number of rollbacks this year that are quite intentional, the results are really strong, whether it's the Justice 17-inch backpack or the Frito-Lay Multi-Pack.\nFrom general merchandise to food, we are seeing rollbacks work across the business. Customers responding. They're choiceful. They're being thoughtful about what they buy. Our merchants have done a nice job of leaning in so easily to ensure that our rollbacks are in the right places for the customer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to go to the International business in China specifically. I was hoping to get more color in terms of what you're seeing in the market. Now, for the second consecutive quarter in a row, your results seem to stand out versus some of the weaker macro data points that we're seeing out there in China.\n\nJudith McKenna\n\nCEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nHi. Yeah, thank you. So I mean, the quarter was strong for International overall. As you heard, both John David and Doug mentioned, China was one of the stronger markets that we had, along with Walmex, which had 10% growth. Both our businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe, had strong quarters as well. All of that is driven from just really being close to the customer in those markets and the combination of value and convenience that we're now able to offer. Turning to China specifically, I actually got back to China this quarter for the first time in three and a half years. What really struck me when I was there was the speed with which the consumer has moved. So the move to online and digital penetration has been extraordinary in our business. It ranges in the mid-40% that we're seeing.\nWe have two formats there. We have the Sam's Club format, and we have the hypermarket format. What's interesting is both formats have got positive traffic, and both are gaining market share. I think the reason for that is back to this combination of value, quality, and trust that we're able to provide. Sam's Club, in particular, had a really strong quarter again, and we opened a couple of new clubs. We now have 45 clubs across China, and they're really combining great items at great value. They're seeing an interesting trend in higher penetration of very high ticket items in China too. In the hypers, I got a chance to visit some of our remodeled new version hypermarkets. You've heard me talk a couple of times about the transformation in hypers that's ongoing.\nI was really impressed with the thoughtful way in which the team there had reduced assortment, brightened and freshened the stores, increased signage, helped customers navigate not only through great fresh departments, but also made the general merchandise shopping much simpler. So I think you have two formats there, both of which are leading in the segments in which they operate, and that's helping us win customers. Our associates, I will just say, they are doing a fantastic job, and it was just great to see them after such a long time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nHead of Consumer Discretionary, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys. I'm curious within food and grocery how you would characterize the current landscape from a promotional perspective relative to last year in history and how you're thinking about price investment as a tool to gain further market share just given the changes in inflation expectations. Thanks.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nCompared to a year ago, Paul, certainly inflation is at a lower rate than what it was. It's been relatively stubborn in dry grocery more than other places over the course of the year. Price gaps are something that we spend a lot of time on each and every week. We start Monday talking about trading and what's happening in the market. Price is always one of the major topics. We want to ensure that our values are right. We are pleased with where the value is today. The grocery business is gaining share. Certainly, we're going to watch the market. As I said a moment ago, we do have a number of rollbacks that are effective in food. Our rollback count in food is higher than last year.\nIt is lower in general merchandise than a year ago, but a reminder that last year we were clearing a lot of inventory that had been backlogged. So the general merchandise rollbacks, which are very effective, are more choiceful, and I think reflective of the seasons that people are in. So our job from here is to ensure that we're ready for people that are getting back to school all across the country the next couple of weeks, colleges. We have tailgating season coming up, Labor Day, and then we're right into the holiday food season.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO of Sam's Club, Walmart\n\nI'd say too, I feel like promotions is the easy solution to inflation versus doing the hard work of working with your suppliers to walk back all of the commodity and cost increases that kind of have been absorbed over the last two years. So there's a lot of work in just tracking the cost of transportation. And then as that's come down, working back with each supplier to have a look at what proportion of the cost is impacted by that and how do you roll that back. So I know in Sam's, the team have a great big board. They ring a cowbell every time we get a cost decrease, and you flow it on to the member. And I think that's how we want to think about it versus thinking about how do we go out and do promotions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nHardline, Broadline and Food Retail Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. Judith, congratulations, and to every promotion, congratulations. My question is more medium term. I wanted to ask about the inflection on EBIT dollar growth. At shareholders, we talked about how in fiscal 2025, it should or could get better than where we are today, realizing we're lapping some easy comparison last year right now. Can we hone in on what needs to take place for this EBIT dollar growth inflection, assuming healthy sales, leverage over fixed costs, marketplace ramping, is it advertising? Can you talk about sort of what's in your control and what's more sales-driven as we think about EBIT growth going forward?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure. So I mean, I'll start with maybe a bit of a victory lap here because the first half of the year has actually been pretty good in terms of the relationship of operating income and sales. We've grown the top line at, call it 6%, and operating income at almost twice that. And that's much better than what we've done historically. So we're very encouraged internally that we're executing so well right out of the gate after sharing our goals at our investor community meeting in April. As we get into next year, really what you're going to see is more of a continuation of the strategy that we laid out as we further diversify our earning streams. A lot of these areas like advertising and data ventures, these higher margin businesses are growing at a rate much, much faster than the rest of our business.\nAs you look at the math around that, our margins just want to go up. The other thing, as you're well aware of, Simeon, are the efficiencies that come from our supply chain. And so today we have roughly 15% of our stores that are served by automated regional distribution centers. And when you think about something like an eCommerce FC, that gives us efficiencies of upwards of 30% on things like units per hour. And so as we continue to roll out this automation to the rest of our network, we're going to see the benefits of that in our P&L. You're seeing it right now. And it gives us conviction and optimism as we look out over the next several years to be able to grow operating income at a rate that is faster than sales and perhaps appreciably faster than sales.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nSimeon, this is Doug. I'll just add on. I think John David said it well, that the two threads, the two questions are, how's the automation work going, and how is that playing through as it relates to productivity? And that's a multi-year implementation of these various forms of automated storage and retrieval systems that we've talked to you about. And then the second one is, how's the business model changing? And the engine for that is, what's the digital percentage total? How is eCommerce growing, and what's the pull-through to advertising, and the other components that shape that business model? And the reason I'm repeating it is because I wanted to make the point that it's not just the Walmart US business that's going through that transformation.\nAs I've been traveling in International the last few weeks, the commonality from Canada to Chile, and Judith had the team from Mexico in town this week, what Gui and the team are doing there, it's very consistent as it relates to how omnichannel retail is coming to life across our company. So I think those are the two threads to keep your eye on.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYou didn't frame the question, Simeon, in terms of return on investment, but I want to take an opportunity to talk about that. When we get to the end of this year and you look at our ROI on a trailing 12-month basis, we're going to see a fairly material uptick if you look at our guidance, what's implied there. And that's more than what we expected at the beginning of the year. We actually anticipated that some of the improvements in ROI would come next year and some of the years thereafter. We are actually pulling forward some of those benefits that we expected next year. And so we're going to see some of that this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nEquity Research Analyst of Food Retail & Distribution, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on your retirement as well, Judith. Wanted to just ask about eCommerce growth. 24%, I think, implies some pretty big market share gains, but led by pickup and delivery. And I was curious if you could also just give us a sense of how marketplace and 3P is ramping relative to your expectations and how, if at all, that's impacting the general merchandise comp. And related to that, I guess, as you think long-term about the profitability of advertising, is there a similar opportunity on the food and consumables side, or is it better to have discretionary and 3P, a greater mix of eCommerce as it relates to growing advertising profitability?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart",
    "content2": "Thanks, Kelly. Thanks for the question. John, really happy with the performance, and the team deserves credit for a lot of improvements that enabled the 24% growth. When we talk about pickup and delivery specifically, I think I would take a step back and just remind everyone what we talked about at our investor conference. And what we're ultimately trying to do with supply chain in the entire eCommerce business is densify our inventory at the first mile, make the middle miles as efficient as possible, and then shorten the last mile. And our store locations, over 4,700 locations in addition to the fulfillment centers, enable us to do that. So what's happened over the last year or so is more of our eCommerce business and deliveries have come from stores because that's where the inventory is closest to the customer and helps us with efficiency.\nSo it's important to frame that as a part of the total. The way we measure this internally is we look at the number of transactions and customers and what they bought in the store, what they picked up, and what was delivered. The second part of your question. Really pleased with the progress in marketplace. Our Plus event was a good marker for us in terms of what's possible with the marketplace. The majority of our revenue from that event was driven by marketplace sellers, and I'm thankful to the sellers who participated and helped us find customers or helped our customers find value at a time when they're looking for value. And that was across all categories, including general merchandise. In fact, much of the event was general merchandise. So I think the team has positioned the marketplace well.\nAnd in terms of the second part of your question with advertising, there are opportunities for sellers, there are opportunities for suppliers. We'll continue to learn, grow, and experiment in stores and on the site. We want to ensure that Walmart Connect, the name Walmart Connect, connects our buyers, suppliers, and sellers all to our customers in a way that's accretive to the customer experience. We want to make sure that customers are finding what they want when they want it. And if this business can help people connect together, that's great. And we saw that happen in the quarter, and the growth was higher than our eCommerce growth.\n\nJudith McKenna\n\nCEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nIf we're talking about eCommerce and marketplace in particular, it'd be remiss of me not to talk about Flipkart and the growth that we've seen there. We were there as well recently, and that business is just continuing to go from strength to strength. It's consistently performed in line with our expectations over the last few years. I'm really pleased to see the positive contribution margins continue. Their business mix is really quite healthy. Seeing strength in hard lines, particularly across mobiles and electronics as well. The scaling of their ecosystem is also helping contribute not only to the overall business, but also to their advertising revenues as well. Interesting, coming back to this theme of quality and convenience for people, they recently launched in their Cleartrip business luxury packages of holidays in India, which are going incredibly well as well.\nMyntra, which is the largest fashion online retailer in India, as John David mentioned as well, they've just launched a MyFashionGPT capability as well, which is quite incredible. I used it this morning. I put in what to wear to go to the airport, and they gave me to England to the airport. They gave me black T-shirts, black leggings, a jacket, and sunglasses, which I think was rather optimistic needing the sunglasses for England. It shows you the power of what I think GenAI can do in the future, and it's really coming to life in India. It's just a great business, and I've been proud to be able to be associated with it for the last five years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\n\nEdward Yruma\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have done a lot to enhance the accessibility of Walmart+. You've added a ton of new features. I guess you should sit back and assess the success of the program, kind of what's turned the dial the most. And then in terms of the data you're able to now collect, where have you been able to kind of pivot and change the flow of business based on some of the stuff that you're collecting from these Walmart+ customers? Thanks.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nHey, Edward. Certainly, we want to have a digital relationship with as many customers as possible, pleased with the growth overall. As we've talked about before, Plus is an important part of the offer we have. I would pull the reason back that Plus has had more success to the very core of the offer. The offer was established to unlimit the number of deliveries people get without having a charge on those deliveries from both the fulfillment centers and the stores. We launched this in 2020, certainly had issues at that point with availability, and we've had inventory imbalances. But in the last year or so, the focus continues to be in the improvements have been in the core. We measure every week something we call perfect order.\nThe stores are very focused on what we call the first-time pick rate, which is picking the order the first time they look for it. And then another thing that we do very intentionally is measure what percent of the order was delivered before there were any substitutions. So what customers are looking for is exactly what they ordered at the time that they expect to be delivered, and that's the way we hold ourselves accountable. Certainly, the other benefits are helpful. There are different features that people are using, and it is important to have a variety of benefits, but the core of the offer is the most important thing that we have to execute going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on the value proposition that Walmart offers today. So private label seems to have a lot of momentum and is likely one of the factors that's helping drive market share here. How are you managing private label differently than in the past, and how do you think that plays into the competitive gap here more from a basket-level perspective? And then ultimately, do you think that this advantage is sustainable even in an environment where maybe inflation moderates or prices decline? Love some perspective on that. Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nIt's important for us to have a wide range of assortment for a broad section of customers. We're all over the country. Situations are different for different customers. And whatever the situation is for a particular customer, then that's what we want to be there for. We've talked about this before. We don't set targets or percentages of the business that we expect private label to grow to or be a part of. It's important that we have values on brands, on branded items. It's important that we have values and quality across the portfolio in eCommerce and stores. And in the last few quarters, customers have chosen the private brands at Walmart at an accelerated pace. I think there are a lot of reasons for that. But if our quality and price weren't in the position that it needs to be, then they wouldn't repeat.\nWe'll continue to stay focused on quality and value there.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO of Sam's Club, Walmart\n\nYeah, and I think from a Member's Mark perspective, we have seen our metrics around value for money, NPS, and quality. Our Member's Mark has continued to improve. We're seeing members choose it because of the quality of the item, because of innovation into those products, and also because of the great value that they get out of the Member's Mark price-quality combination.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nWe're seeing leverage across markets with private brands too, whether it's Great Value or Member's Mark.\n\nJudith McKenna\n\nCEO of Walmart International, Walmart\n\nYeah, Member's Mark, of course, is available in our Sam's Clubs globally around the world, but also many other items as well. And I know you were in Chile recently, Doug, and they have a phenomenal International foods aisle, which is showing incredible growth, many of which are private brands which are imported from around the world, from the rest of the Walmart world.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nWhen I was in Canada, they made me Great Value tomato ketchup potato chips. I'm out on that. I'm sure Canadians love it, but that's one private brand item that I'm not a fan of.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYou made some of us eat that.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nJohn David liked them better than I did.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCorey Tarlowe\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if we could just take a step back and assess the health of the overall customer, maybe in the US and also perhaps internationally, versus Q1 and into Q2, and how you're thinking about the general health of the customer throughout the remainder of this year. Then just secondarily on shrink, what are you seeing as it relates to shrink, and what are you expecting ahead as we think about that particular dynamic?\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nFrom an enterprise point of view, just on the customer member first, and others can chime in on that. I feel like that our position is one where if things do get tougher, they're going to increasingly look for value, and we're going to be able to grow the top line. Hopefully, things do get better. I mean, there are a lot of conflicting data points, but you guys see the same data that we do. There are reasons to be optimistic in areas like employment and the wage inflation that's happened. And there are other reasons to be concerned as consumer balance sheets potentially weaken over time. But again, we like our position. We like it in terms of the breadth of product categories. We can sell whatever people want to buy.\nWe like it in terms of the way we can serve people, whether it's curbside or it's delivery or it's in a store or club. So our job is to grow our share to win through the customer value prop, which is price, assortment, experience, and trust. And whether that's in Mexico or the United States, that's the position that we put ourselves in, and we just need to execute against that. On shrink, John, you can comment too, but I just remind everybody from a total enterprise point of view, we're more than a domestic retailer. We've got 19 countries. We've got Sam's Club. We've got a variety of businesses. And so it's not necessarily the same answer as maybe some of the others that are in the news about shrink.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nAnd Doug, I'd add that, of course, shrink is an important part of margin, but there are many parts of margin that are important to be able to deliver for customers. And the first is, we want to make sure that we're pricing as low as possible so customers find the greatest value that they can possibly find. Shrink has increased a bit this year. It increased last year. It's uneven across the country. It's not in every market. Some markets are higher than others. But we do have the tailwinds that we mentioned earlier, which are cost of supply chain and markdowns from last year. So a lot of components go into this. We'll keep watching it. We don't want it to go up, obviously, because it could cause prices to rise, and we've heard that across the market.\nBut it is a part of what we're managing, and the team's doing a nice job with value, and the team's doing a nice job managing the margin total.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nShrink is comprised of more than one thing. Theft's part of it. And we do think that in some jurisdictions here in the US, there needs to be action taken to help protect people from crime, including theft. The other part of shrink is more controllable, and we stay focused on that as a priority.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Krisztina Kachnai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKrisztina Katai\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question, and I'll add my congratulations to Judith as well. I have a question about Sam's Club. I think I heard you say mid-single-digit member growth within the quarter. So can you talk about your membership gains and the momentum that you have been seeing in the business, as well as the renewal rate, and how you think about membership value for the consumer in the face of moderating food inflation? And then secondly, if I could just ask on the private label penetration that is still increasing, just how are you generally anticipating volumes to play out in the back half of the year between your private brands versus your national brands as rollbacks are increasing? Thank you.\n\nKath McLay\n\nCEO of Sam's Club, Walmart\n\nIf I start with just talking about the membership health, we've seen historic growth in our membership base over the last few years. We continue to see growth in absolute member numbers. Our tenured renewal rate held, so it didn't increase or decrease. It held from quarter to quarter. We are continuing to look at different ways to introduce people to the value of a Sam's Club membership. So you've seen us over the years try a couple of different things. On our 40th birthday, we had a great price for new members. Really, that's just an opportunity to invite people in to experience for themselves what the value of membership looks like. We want to turn them into a tenured renewal member going forward. We feel strong about the health of our membership and the growth that we've seen.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nCEO of Walmart US, Walmart\n\nWalmart on our membership, consistent growth last few quarters, but we really did have a successful Walmart+ event, really good results all across the business. As I said earlier, the core of the offer is the most important thing that we deliver, and that includes perfect order or fill rates and availability. Customers trust us to be able to deliver their food, consumables, and general merchandise items consistently and on time. On the question on private brand volume, I would also just repeat consistency over the last couple of quarters. We've talked about growth of private brands really since the beginning of 2022. Again, we don't have targets on that. We want to be there for customers regardless of what they choose, whether it's a branded item or private brand item. On private brands, we stay focused on quality and value.\nIn some cases, like if you were in a store today, you would see a rollback on Great Value mustard, and it's working really well. It's a staple that has seen really great growth because of values that we offer. Getting prices back down in dry grocery is important for the consumer, and we want to be able to help them and lead that in any way that we can.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nIf I can just say one other thing on private brand, we discussed that because I think it gives a good indication on how the consumer is being pressured right now, but that is not a driver of our margin performance. While the overall margin on private brand may be a little bit higher, the dollar profit is about the same. And if you look at the shift in composition year-over-year, we're only talking 40 basis points. So this is not a driver of our financial results. So if we see a reversion there, it's not going to have any outsized impact on our business.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thanks so much for taking our question. Doug, is it fair to think that Walmart has more visibility into its gross margin rate heading into next year than it has in recent memory, given the inflection in the profitability of the eCommerce business, the contribution from alternative profits, presumably less of a drag from GLP-1 drugs, and the prospect that general merchandise gets better? And if that is fair, do you take this as an opportunity to double down and accelerate some of the investments that clearly have been working and translating to share gains? Thank you.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nHey, Michael, thanks for the question. We didn't see COVID coming, and we didn't anticipate inflation to be as high as it has been in the United States. So if you could tell me what we're not anticipating right now, I might be able to answer your question about next year. I think your underlying premise that we kind of know what the shape is and we're not in this position that we were 12 months ago with inventory has got some truth to it. As it relates to doubling down, I think we are being aggressive. We are currently going through our long-range planning cycle. And as we look at our opportunities to invest next year and over the next five years, we look at that board and we get excited about it.\nJohn David made the point in a meeting earlier this week that isn't it cool to be a part of a company that started in 1962 that sees opportunities to drive strong returns with today's investments to help you contemporize the business for the future? And I agree with that. It's a really cool spot to be in, to have cash flow, to have this strong business, and to have opportunities in front of us that transform the business and create another level of operational excellence through productivity, for example. So I think we've got an aggressive plan. We talked at the investor conference about our capital plan, and we continue to see opportunities to invest, to grow top and bottom line. We expect ROI to go up over time. It may not happen that every quarter operating income grows faster than sales.\nBut over time, as we said at the investor conference, we expect that to be the case because of productivity and the business model shape. So I just repeat what we said there. I think we're being appropriately aggressive given the environment, and I'm excited about that.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nYeah. I would just add, Michael, just like you view a portfolio of stocks, you diversify because it reduces the risk. I think in some ways, we're doing the same thing with our business. We're not solely dependent upon just what's happening with brick-and-mortar retail. We've got other income streams that, by definition, sort of the diversification of that reduces our dependency on any one thing and also reduces the risk around that too. So we feel pretty good about our outlook.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nJust maybe one more comment on strategy. As we go through this year's cycle, and I think this was true to a large degree last year, it's pretty common. We know what the components are. It's a challenge to execute it across multiple fronts. I mean, it's full-time work to run great stores and clubs. It's also full-time work to grow an excellent eCommerce business. And there are lots of components to that. And it's got to happen around the world. But we've got the resources, and importantly, we've got the talent to do it. And so I think the shape of that board, kind of the where-to-play aspect of our strategy looks pretty consistent, and that builds confidence. We're in execution mode, and we like the plan that's right in front of us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nCEO, Walmart\n\nBefore I wrap things up, I just want to acknowledge the tragedy that happened in Hawaii and Maui. The company has stepped forward with financial support for the United Way and Red Cross, as you would expect, for providing essentials, providing supplies. We're flying merchandise there. We're bulking up on what people need. Our team on the ground has done a fantastic job. Our store manager there is Chris Pierce. Chris and his team have supported the community there, as you would expect them to, and we're really proud of them. That was a terrible tragedy. As we wrap up, I'll thank you for your focus on our business. As I mentioned just a second ago, we are really excited about what's in front of us. I think you know what the plan is. We're positioned to grow the top line.\nOver time, we can grow profit faster than sales through productivity and shaping the business model differently, which will result in higher levels of return on investment. And we're excited about delivering that, and I'm grateful to what everyone did for this quarter. And I want to thank Judith for what she's contributed to this company. It's been really significant, and we're going to miss her. Thankful she's sticking around for a little while to help with some things. And I'm excited for Kath, Chris, and Kieran. Walmart's got a deep bench, and we'll keep going. Thank you all for your time.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, we are now ready to begin.\n\nDoug McMillon\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss our Q1 results. We had a strong Q1. Sales growth was strong globally, including growth of 26% in e-commerce. Profit grew much faster than sales, and we made further progress on inventory levels. The omnichannel model we're building continues to resonate with customers and members. As expected, a higher mix of sales in the food and consumables categories negatively affected gross profit, but strong expense management and progress with our newer mutually reinforcing businesses helped us grow profit ahead of sales at 17.3%.\nThe business model we outlined at our recent investor conference is taking shape. International had a great quarter, continuing our momentum from last year. Sales grew 12.9% in constant currency, and profit grew even faster at 41%. China, Canada, and Flipkart all saw double-digit top-line growth.\nIn China, the reopening of the economy coincided with the Chinese New Year season, and that drove traffic to our clubs and stores. Sam's Club China continues its strong performance. For India, a group of us were there last week, and we left even more excited about our opportunities. Flipkart and PhonePe are doing well. Our Walmart tech team there is strong, and we have a big opportunity to increase our exports from India across quite a few merchandise categories.\nIn the US, both Walmart and Sam's Club performed well with good transaction growth, positive units in food, and strong e-commerce growth. We continue to gain market share in the grocery category, including with higher income and younger shoppers, and we saw good growth in membership income in both businesses. At Sam's Club US, member count and plus member penetration hit all-time highs in the quarter.\nOur growth is now being driven by convenience in addition to price. We see it across formats, income, and age cohorts. In terms of inventory, we're in good shape. In-stock is improving, and excess inventory keeps coming down. We see it in the numbers, and I'm seeing it on store and club visits. Globally, customers continue to seek value given the impact of inflation. We see it in the US and in other markets like Mexico, Canada, and Chile. Private brand penetration is up about 110 basis points versus last year for Walmart US and 50 basis points for Walmart. We continue to manage our price gaps and deliver value for our customers.\nIn Walmart US, general merchandise costs are now lower than a year ago, which is great, but they're still higher than two years ago on like items.\nIn the dry grocery and consumables categories like paper goods, we continue to see high single-digit to low double-digit cost inflation. We all need those prices to come down. The persistently high rates of inflation in these categories, lasting for such a long period of time, are weighing on some of the families we serve. This stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables is one of the key factors creating uncertainty for us in the back half of the year because of the cumulative impact on discretionary spending and other categories, specifically general merchandise.\nWe think we've got guidance where it should be, reflecting the appropriate amount of conservatism given the external environment. We feel very good about our performance, our multi-year momentum, and our ability to serve people however they want to shop and do it at a value. We're executing well and performing well in all three segments.\nJohn David will say more about how we're thinking about guidance in a minute. As we look ahead to Q2 and the rest of the year, we're focused on getting our merchandise costs and retails down to fight inflation for our customers and members, which will help us with mix pickup and delivery execution, whether that comes from a store or an FC, expense management, and inventory management by item and category. There are places to play offense, and there are places to be more conservative.\nWe shouldn't be treating every category the same way, and we aren't. We're playing offense where we should and controlling what we can control. Last month, we hosted our investor meeting in Florida where we visited a DC, a store, and a Sam's Club. For those of you that made that trip, thank you. We really enjoyed it and hope you did too.\nWe had three takeaways. First, we're positioned to grow because we can serve customers and members however they want to be served. Second, over time, we expect to grow profit faster than sales and improve operating margin due to productivity improvements and the mix of businesses. And third, we'll be disciplined with capital to improve ROI as we grow operating income. I hope you can see how the investments we've made in recent years are driving results.\nWe added nearly $11 billion in sales in Q1, delivered 58 basis points of expense leverage, and expanded operating margin by 34 basis points. As for returns, we want operating profit growing faster than sales, and we expect to see an inflection in ROI in the coming quarters as we begin to lap large one-time items from past quarters.\nThe investor meeting also gave us an opportunity to show off a piece of the automation we're working on in an Ambient DC. And while it's an important piece of what we're building, our overall set of capabilities go far beyond that. We're building a more connected, intelligent, and automated network. We're adding market fulfillment centers, or MFCs, which utilize automated storage and retrieval systems, and we expect to add thousands of electric vehicles to support our last-mile delivery capabilities. It's about creating a supply chain that's better, not just bigger.\nWe're excited about how our new capabilities will help our associates by making some of our more physically demanding jobs into more rewarding, higher-skilled career paths. We're hosting our annual Shareholders Week events in a couple of weeks here in Northwest Arkansas. Part of the experience will include a tour of an MFC we've just opened.\nIt'll be a good chance to see another piece of what we're building. I'll close by saying thank you. Thank you to our associates for helping us deliver another strong quarter. We're proud of them and pleased that both Walmart and Sam's Club in the US were recently certified as a Great Place to Work by the industry leader in workplace excellence. Thank you for your interest in our company. Now over to John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates, and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to start the year. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team executed, and we made progress advancing our various strategic initiatives. I'll begin by reviewing highlights for the quarter using the framework of growth, margins, and returns. Then I'll spend a couple of minutes reviewing key themes from our recent investor day before detailing our updated guidance.\nStarting with growth. For the Q1, constant currency sales increased nearly 8%, or about $11 billion, with strength across all segments. Walmart US comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 7.4%, including 27% growth in e-commerce. After a strong start, sales growth moderated as the quarter progressed.\nThe 90 basis points deceleration in comp sales growth from Q4 was driven by pricing and the effect of lapping higher inflation rates in the prior year period. We continue to gain share and grow unit volume in grocery. This was consistent with our expectations and how we built our plan. At the headline level, consumer spending has proven resilient, but below the surface, we continue to see signs that customers remain choiceful, particularly in discretionary categories. In Q1, we saw a nearly 360 basis points shift in US sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness.\nTo benchmark, the magnitude of this shift exceeds the 330 basis points of category mix shift we experienced in all of last year. In addition to the persistence of inflation in food and consumables, customers were also impacted by a reduction of SNAP benefits and lower tax refunds.\nThese impacts were partially offset by higher spending tied to an increase in the cost of living adjustment for social security benefits. In our international segment, sales were strong, up nearly 13% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in China, Walmart, and Flipkart. Many of the same impacts on consumer spending in the US affected our international markets too. In Sam's Club, US comp sales increased 7%, with member fee income up 6.3%.\nAverage spend per member increased mid-single digits. Now on margins, consolidated gross margins decreased 18 basis points with ongoing pressure from category sales mix globally. This headwind was partially offset by a reduction in supply chain and freight costs relative to last year's heightened levels. Category mix was a notable headwind across geographies and formats. Walmart US general merchandise sales declined mid-single digits, while food and consumable sales increased low double digits.\nHeadline inflation in food and consumables came down over 400 basis points from the start of Q1 to the end of the quarter, but prices remain high, and customers are being cautious with their spend in discretionary categories. While we make attractive margins in food and consumables, they have a lower margin than general merchandise. We expect category mix to remain a gross margin headwind for the balance of FY24. The higher margin initiatives that are connected to our core omni-retail business, including marketplace, advertising, and membership, continue to meaningfully outgrow the base. I'll discuss each of these.\nFirst, marketplace and fulfillment services. We're growing our marketplace with new items and sellers and an improved experience. We've increased seller counts in the US by more than 40% year over year, and the number using Walmart Fulfillment Services has more than doubled.\nWe're adding higher profile in-demand brands that our customers are searching for, but not typically distributed at Walmart. Elevating our profile as a digital shopping destination. And in India, Flipkart's commerce platform continues to scale, growing first-time e-commerce customers and expanding its reach in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Flipkart's eKart business now includes more than 35,000 Kirana partners, as well as providing fulfillment services for Flipkart sellers and other third parties. Moving to advertising, our global advertising business delivered strong growth of over 30% in Q1.\nIn the US, Walmart Connect advertising sales increased nearly 40% as we experienced strong momentum in new advertisers, particularly from marketplace sellers. And the number of 3P sellers utilizing our ad capabilities has doubled over the past 12 months.\nSam's Club ad business, called Member Access Platform, grew double digits with the number of active advertisers up more than 50% versus last year. Advertisers are responding to our recently launched in-club sales attribution feature, which provides advertisers with clear insights on the returns of digital ad spend both online and in clubs while enhancing member experience. In international, the advertising business continued to show strength, led by Flipkart ads, which was up over 50%. Lastly, membership. Sam's Club member counts have had a multi-year run of robust growth, with another record high achieved in Q1.\nMember counts have grown nearly 30% over the past three years, and we're increasingly attracting greater numbers of millennials and Gen Z. We also like the trends we're seeing from Walmart Plus members. Nearly 50% of our Walmart Plus members are coming from the online pickup and delivery channel.\nMembers spend more than non-members. They shop with us more frequently, and the membership deepens engagement, helps enable personalization, and allows us to offer more services and to provide more offers on things that are important to our customers. Turning back to the middle of the P&L, SG&A expenses leveraged 58 basis points, aided by strong sales growth across the enterprise, a continued focus on managing costs into moderating sales growth as inflation lessens, and lapping some COVID-related wage costs in the US last year.\nTaking all this together, our operating income grew more than 17%. This is relative to sales growth of nearly 8%, which resulted in operating margin expansion of 34 basis points, reinforcing the financial framework that we laid out at our investor day. As signaled when we issued FY24 guidance in February, several below-the-line items impacted our Q1 earnings results, including higher net interest expense.\nQ1 net interest expense was more than $550 million, and we issued $5 billion of debt at favorable rates. Non-controlling interest was also higher in the quarter, due in part to stronger results from Walmart. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was better than we expected as sales outpaced our plan and cost leverage exceeded plan. GAAP EPS was $0.62. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects an $0.85 impact from unrealized gains and losses on equity investments.\nThe team continued to do a good job managing inventory, and we ended the quarter down 7%, including a more than 9% decline in Walmart US. Managing costs and inventory are two of the key controllable as we navigate an uncertain macro environment. We're improving inventory efficiency and merchandise flow and addressing placement in order to better serve customers, improve store in-stock levels, while also mitigating future risks if demand softens.\nLet me take a moment to discuss our returns, or specifically return on investment, or ROI, which declined by 120 basis points this quarter. We calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis. As such, the decline in Q1 is a result of nearly $4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year, related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted the Q1 ROI by about 140 basis points. These will again be a headwind in Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q3. As we lap these charges, we expect meaningful improvement in ROI in the back half of this year. When you look beyond these unique items, our underlying operational ROI is steadily moving higher.\nAt our investor day in April, I said that we want our ROI to go up every year, and I still believe that will be the case this year. Let me briefly reference key segment highlights for Q1. For Walmart US, comp sales were strong, up 7.4%, reflecting higher store traffic trends as well as strong growth in store fulfilled pickup and delivery. From a category perspective, comp sales were driven by strong growth in food and health and wellness, partially offset by a decline in general merchandise sales. Unseasonably cooler spring weather negatively impacted sales in certain seasonal hardline categories, including lawn and garden.\nGross margins decreased 41 basis points, primarily due to ongoing pressure from category mix shifts. As mentioned previously, supply chain costs and transportation were lower as we lapped last year's elevated levels. Inflation remained high, up low double digits in food categories.\nIt's important to remember that while year-over-year inflation started to moderate as the quarter progressed, this is largely due to lapping higher levels from last year. On a two-year stacked basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets. Share gains in grocery continued, including from higher-income households, as our strong price gaps resonate with customers who are increasingly prioritizing value and convenience.\nWe're also seeing market share gains in the areas of general merchandise where we've invested to improve the customer experience, such as entertainment and automotive. In this environment, as customers manage household budgets more tightly and are biasing spending toward everyday essentials, we're reinforcing our value proposition across the merchandise offering, including seasonal event savings featuring high-quality owned brands and leaning into opening price points.\nFor the Easter holiday, we offered customers a curated Easter meal along with a traditional Easter basket for the same price as last year. Private brand penetration in grocery categories increased nearly 110 basis points in Q1, following a 160 basis point increase in Q4 and a 130 basis point increase in Q3. E-commerce sales were led by continued double-digit growth in store fulfilled pickup and delivery. Customers increasingly value convenience and speed of delivery.\nWe have an advantage here as we leverage the proximity of our stores to fulfill and deliver digital orders to customer homes. In many cases, we can get orders delivered faster to customers while building a sustainable omnichannel model. Strong flow-through and higher sales contributed to SG&A expense leverage, which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in strong operating income growth of 11.7% relative to comp sales growth of 7.4%.\nOur international segment delivered an outstanding quarter with strong growth in both sales and profit, continuing the momentum built in the back half of last year. International grew both the top and the bottom line faster than the enterprise. Sales grew nearly 13% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in China, Walmart, and Flipkart. Impressively, operating income grew more than three times faster than sales, up 41%, with each market delivering year-over-year improvement.\nThe strong profit flow-through is particularly encouraging as the team has been delivering operating efficiencies on top of strong sales growth. In China, sales increased 28% as the team executed well during the Chinese New Year season and also saw increased traffic as the Chinese economy reopens.\nResults were strong across formats and channels, with continued member growth and higher member retention at Sam's Club, improved trends in hypermarkets, and more than 50% sales growth in e-commerce. Walmart had another good quarter with sales strength in bodega stores, Sam's Clubs, and e-commerce. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to expand our physical footprint, opening more than 120 stores over the past 12 months, while also scaling our omni-channel capabilities.\nAs customers' desire for convenience increases, the team has rolled out a 60-minute delivery option to 80% of Walmart Supercenter and Express stores in Mexico. In India, Flipkart had strong top-line results and improved its contribution profit. The team continues to expand their products and services.\nAs an example, Flipkart Travel added to its portfolio of offerings by launching bus reservation services during the quarter through its ClearTrip platform, and already is capable of offering 1 million bus connections to customers. We continue to be pleased with PhonePe's great performance. During the quarter, we reached an important milestone with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, eclipsing the $1 trillion level for the first time. For Sam's Club, US comp sales were strong, up 7% in Q1.\nIn addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam's eCommerce sales were up 19%, led by strong growth in curbside. Sam's delivered another quarter of record member counts, and membership income growth was 6.3%. Plus, member penetration also hit an all-time high during the quarter. It was terrific to celebrate the 40th birthday of Sam's Club during the quarter with member promotions and events.\nWe saw incredible response from our existing and new members, including the largest quarterly membership sign-up on record. Operating income declined slightly as a result of an inflation-related LIFO charge of $48 million. Without that charge, operating income would have increased 10%. At our investment community meeting in April, I outlined our plan to grow operating income faster than sales, centered on three strategic building blocks of our financial objectives.\nFirst, we're focused on driving organic sales growth from our omni-channel business model. It's clear our omni model is resonating with customers across income demographics who are seeking out Walmart digitally, in stores, curbside, and via delivery. And we're growing mind share for our convenience, which nearly matches our mind share for price.\nAs we continue to scale digital capabilities in our markets around the world, we have an opportunity to drive significant growth in the top line over the coming years. A second component of our financial model is to diversify our earnings streams through improved product and business mix. To improve product mix, we're focused on increasing sales penetration in higher-margin categories like apparel and home through the expansion of our e-commerce marketplace assortment and an upgraded presentation and experience in our remodeled stores.\nOur e-commerce assortment has grown to include over 200 million SKUs in apparel and nearly 60 million in home categories. Our newest remodeled supercenters take a differentiated approach to showcasing general merchandise with more brand shops, digital displays, mannequins, wider aisles, and updated fixtures.\nWe're very encouraged by the early reads on customer response to these initiatives, and we plan to update 300 stores with these features this year. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we're making progress in improving our business mix as we scale a portfolio of highly attractive growth initiatives that reinforce our core retail model and will directly reshape our e-commerce and enterprise profit trajectory. This set of initiatives drives stronger returns and includes advertising, data, and membership in many markets.\nCollectively, these initiatives generate operating margins that are appreciably higher than our core business, and we expect will begin to positively influence operating profit growth relative to sales growth this year. The third building block of the model includes improving returns by scaling proven high-return investments in our supply chain that drive operating leverage and improve incremental margins.\nWe're investing capital to optimize our distribution and fulfillment nodes with automation that we expect will drive a significant improvement in unit economics in the coming years. Our capital structure and cash flow generation are an advantage, and we're allocating capital responsibly with a bias toward increasing returns. I'll reiterate what I said at our investor day. We like our strategic position. Over time, we expect revenue growth across a diversified set of drivers, improved category mix, and increasingly accretive business mix coupled with improved unit economics.\nThis is all fueled by supply chain investments with attractive payback cycles. We expect the outcome will be operating income growing faster than sales. Turning to guidance, there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of this year as macro pressures on the consumer have gradually intensified.\nAs such, we continue to maintain a prudent approach to our outlook while at the same time having a high level of confidence in what we can control. It's also not our historic practice to always update guidance exiting Q1, and we don't necessarily want to establish precedent. But we think in this unique environment, it's important to provide an ongoing framework as our views evolve. We're raising our full-year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and our expectations for Q2.\nWe now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 3.5%. Our expectations are for Walmart US and International to grow slightly faster than our prior view, and for Sam's Club growth to be consistent with our February guidance. We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 4% to 4.5%, including an expected 100 basis points impact from LIFO charges.\nWe estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.10 to $6.20, including an expected $0.14 impact from LIFO. There are also a few changes below the line. Our recent debt issuance yielded a more favorable interest rate than estimated, and as such, our net interest expense is expected to grow $600 million versus last year. NCI, or non-controlling interest, is expected to be closer to a $0.20 drag to EPS year over year, including strength in Walmart.\nOur tax expectations have moved toward the upper end of our prior range at approximately 26.5%. Looking at Q2, we're offering the following view: net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 4%. Operating income in constant currency is expected to decline approximately 2% versus last year.\nExcluding the $173 million benefit from Walmart Chile insurance proceeds last year, operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be flat to up slightly. As you compare EPS versus the prior year, we're lapping the $0.05 benefit from Chile insurance proceeds and other income and $0.05 from JD's dividend and other gains and losses, resulting in a total of $0.10 of comparable EPS headwinds. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.63 to $1.68 in Q2 this year. In closing, the year is off to a good start.\nWe're positioning our business to succeed with an expanding omni-ecosystem that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout any economic environment. If the consumer environment tightens further, we have a compelling value proposition with everyday low prices and a suite of conveniences to continue to gain wallet share.\nIf the macro environment proves, we have the opportunity to sell more general merchandise and improve our margin mix through both our first-party stores and e-commerce and third-party marketplace businesses. The transformation of our business mix toward higher margin streams of value is underway, helping to protect our profits today and to drive better profit growth in the future. I look forward to seeing many of you at our shareholders' meeting activities next month here in Northwest Arkansas. With that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question today, please press Star 1 from your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. So that we may address questions to as many participants as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst Hardlines of Broadlines and Food Retail, USB\n\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Given the prospect of disinflation and the increasingly difficult traffic comparisons and consumer environment that you're facing over the rest of the year, how much do you expect you will need to invest in price and other actions in order to maintain an overall stable comp in the US in the coming quarters? And how have you factored these investments into your updated guidance?Is it fair to think that, given your commentary around doing better than the 2% to 2.5% prior expectation for the Walmart U.S. comp, that it could be as high as 4% to 5%, just given the momentum of that business? Thank you so much.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nGood morning, Michael. It's John Furner. I want to start first by thanking our entire team for delivering a strong quarter and investing in the future at the same time. It was great to see both of those things happen. First, let me just reiterate our purpose as a company is to help people save money and live better. Certainly, in the last few quarters, we have seen new shoppers, as John David mentioned, many are higher income and younger. And those shoppers are coming to us looking for value.\nI think what's important for us as we look forward is price is really important to the Walmart shopper. We are pleased with the price gaps that we see in the market. Those are consistent with where they have been the last few quarters. Certainly, some shifting that you heard about earlier from brands to private brands. And then most important right now is the flexibility that we offer consumers all across the country. We've seen quite a few customers shift to pickup and delivery. Our transaction count has been strong.\nAnd as far as our plan the rest of the year, of course, we have built into the plan room for adjustments should the consumer change or the macro environment change. As we mentioned, some softness in general merchandise, strength in food and consumables. We'll be able to manage things well should that continue.\nWe certainly think weather and other factors have played into some of our mix shifts. So we have a plan that will enable us to deliver value across the entire year. Michael, this is Doug. I'll just add to what John said to remind everybody when we were together in Florida. We talked about this being a bit of a pivot where our investments are more focused on capital investments than income statement investments. And we'll continue to proceed to invest in the supply chain, things we talked about a few weeks ago, of course, but also would remind you about our remodel investments.\nSo I think that when I think of the word investment, I think more about those things than I do necessarily income statement investments. I think the other thing I would say is it's a great time just to be really good merchant.\nIn our stores, when I think about general merchandise, whether that's apparel or hard lines, we're focusing our store leadership and our store associates on standing tall in those areas. And because inventory is in a better spot than it was last summer, for example, they can focus more on that rather than just dealing with the flow of inventory that was coming in. So we can impact mix and do other things to drive our business beyond just considering income statement investments.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst Hardlines of Broadlines and Food Retail, USB\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs.\n\nKate McShane\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning.Thanks for taking our question. We wondered if we could ask around quarter-to-date trends for sales and if the moderation from Q1 has continued. And can you remind us when the mix lap starts to get easier with consumables?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Kate. This is John David.The Q2, or rather the Q1, the way that progressed is, as I noted in my remarks, we saw a moderation as we went through the quarter. February was stronger than March and April were a bit of a tick down. That follows some of the trends that we saw in other consumer behavior related to SNAP benefits, tax refunds, and such.\nThis quarter has started off basically how the last quarter ended. So nothing notable really to say about the shift that we've seen thus far. In terms of mix, mix is going to continue to be an impact on us this year. We began to, I think it was most pronounced in the mid-part of last year where we saw the effect of that.\nAnd certainly, as we got into the back half of the year and consumer pocketbooks continued to be stretched, we saw that shift in our business pretty pronounced from food to general merchandise. The thing that I will say that's different this year is it's not just a shift to food and consumables. We've also seen in the Q1 a shift to health and wellness more. And part of that is related to these GLP-1 drugs that are to treat diabetes. We're certainly seeing an uptick in that. For us, that comes at a lower margin.\nAnd so that has some impact on our business as well.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nI think the persistent inflation in dry grocery and consumables is the biggest issue. When you think about what we're up against and what will lap, we started to see inflation occur in the back half of 2021.\nIt accelerated in the beginning of 2022 much faster than what we expected. It got to a higher level than what we expected. Since then, you've seen general merchandise start to come back down, but dry grocery and consumables have held. And so as a customer, particularly if it's a customer living paycheck to paycheck, they now have a two-year stack that's a problem and eventually becomes a three-year stack that's a problem.\nSo working with those suppliers that are on the prepared foods and consumable categories to get costs down more as fast as we possibly can would help them drive unit volume, would help us with mix, and free up cash for customers to use for discretionary goods. And that's what we're focused on, have been focused on, and it's just taking longer in those categories than we want.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director Retail and Luxury Futurist, TD Cowen\n\nHi, thank you. The tech-enabled retail ecosystem continues to scale really impressively. What are some of the key priorities for advertising and marketplace, and how they may intersect with artificial intelligence as well as surely helping the margin mix? And a follow-up for Judith: China continues to be really impressive on sustained momentum as well as better margins. Just highlights about how that reopening has gone relative to your expectations and any thoughts on India as well. Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHey, Oliver, it's John. So first, really proud of the team for their performance in e-commerce in the Q1. The 27% is something they should all feel great about. That's a combination of a few things. We noted the growth in pickup and delivery, the significant growth in marketplace sellers.\nI think what's encouraging behind that number are the number of sellers who are using the services that we offer, like our fulfillment services, which gets more of the assortment delivered in one or two days. We see a pretty significant increase in conversion rates when a seller is using fulfillment services and can deliver within two days. That also leads to growth in the advertising business. Now, this ability that the team has developed for sellers and suppliers to reach groups of customers that are targeted is really improving. I think that's definitely driving the results there. So those business units, the way we've described them, they do help overall mix.\nAt the same time, we have some mix challenges, as John David mentioned. But within the mix challenges, the first, which is a real positive, is the performance of the supply chain.\nThe supply chain versus last year is in much better shape. The team is performing. So there is a lot of tailwind that's coming from our supply chain team and their head of our internal plan. So that's a real positive. And then, as John David mentioned, there's the mix issue that we're seeing between food, consumables, and general merchandise, and then growth of health and wellness at a lower margin.\n\nStephanie Schiller Wissink\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, Walmart\n\nHi, Oliver. Just on that first point on the kind of tech-enabled ecosystem and marketplace, we've seen some really strong progress on that internationally with a lot of leverage from US learnings that we've been able to apply, particularly from a marketplace perspective where we're building out a global marketplace capability. We've just launched Walmart fulfillment services in a number of our markets. So that's really been enabling that.\nOn the ecosystem, India is probably one of the better examples that we have, although Walmart is another great example of building out that ecosystem, putting the customer at the center of it, and using our digital capabilities to figure out how we serve them best in a simple and effective manner. You heard John David talk about the work that we're doing, for example, in travel, where we can also cross-sell in India for products as well on our marketplace at the same time as selling tickets for people, whether that be for air or for buses, which we've just launched.\nAs far as China is concerned, they undoubtedly had a very strong quarter. It was one of the important drivers of the quarter performance for international, although we saw strength across the board from most of our markets.\nIn particular, as you commented, the reopening of China for Chinese New Year made a profound effect on the quarter. Just to give you an idea of the scale of what happened there and the response of our teams, we had all of our product positioned for a Chinese New Year event based in the cities where most people were. What happened is actually everybody went home into the more rural areas, and our team had to pivot completely within a 10-day window and reallocate all of the inventory that we had around the country. It was a remarkable effort, which just demonstrated their agility and resilience.\nThe Chinese economy is still patchy. Undoubtedly, consumer sentiment, if you look externally, is better than it was. It's not all the way to bright yet to pre-COVID, but both of our businesses there are benefiting from the reopening.\nSo Sam's Club continues to do well. We have six new clubs opening this year. And then on hypers, really focusing and doubling down on how we think about fulfilled store fulfilled for e-commerce. That e-commerce penetration remains at about 40%, which is a slight softening from where it was, but that's also partly seasonal because of the Chinese New Year time. On India, as Doug commented, we were there recently. Both Flipkart and PhonePe continue to impress us and meet our expectations.\nThe build-out of the ecosystem for Flipkart, I think we've talked about, but at PhonePe, it's really impressive to see their results as well. Leveraging over the 1 trillion TPV mark, 36 million merchants online, and enabling those merchants to be able to grow their businesses as well was really impressive to see.\nAnd what we're seeing in India is a build-out of an ecosystem in its own right between our tech capabilities, between our sourcing capabilities, Flipkart and PhonePe. It's becoming a mutually reinforcing flywheel of strength for that market. And we're excited about what they're going to do in the future.\n\nOliver Chen\n\nManaging Director Retail and Luxury Futurist, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. I have a question for John David. The Q2 outlook, can you share if expectations have changed at all since you guided the full year? And relatedly, you talked about how the second half spread with EBIT for sales growth should be stronger than the first half. Can you talk about does that shape or that spread change at all? Does it widen or roughly stay the same?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure, Simeon. Good to speak with you.You might recall on our last earnings call, we gave a little bit of a head nod into Q2 performance because of some of the specific issues that occurred in Q2 last year. We said that at the time, we expected it to be roughly flat. Right now, we're seeing the guidances, and I'm speaking about operating income, down 2%. That's most impacted by, again, the insurance proceeds that we received last year. Mix will continue to be an issue in Q2. We do see some improvement in some of our supply chain costs, freight costs that we're benefiting from. But that's the anomalous quarter for us as you think about this year.\nAs we get into the back half of the year, and we see a more pronounced impact from some of the initiatives that we discussed at our investor day around these higher margin, higher growth areas, that will begin to have a more outsized impact. But relative to where we were in the last quarter, the expectation for that inflection has not changed. We still expect that to be about the same. It just so happens that, frankly, we just outperformed on the operating income line in the Q1 relative to what we thought. So really, really strong performance there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.Please proceed with your question.\n\nKelly Bania\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking our questions. John David, you mentioned the 360 basis points mix shift between food and general merchandise.\nAnd you kind of touched on it a little bit, but should we expect that Q1 is the peak of that mix pressure, and should that moderate throughout the year? Just help us understand what's in your plan. And then also on general merchandise, can you just help us understand what you're seeing in terms of units versus net pricing at this point? And also the 300 stores that you're rolling out the new general merchandise initiative to, can you share the lift that you're seeing there?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure. I'm writing down all these questions here, Kelly. So first, on mix shift, I don't think it's fair to assume that the Q1 is necessarily going to be the peak. When we gave our full-year guidance, you might recall that we talked about an additional incremental impact relative to the 330-ish basis points we had last year.\nSo I think we'll continue to see that through the year. A lot of that too depends upon consumer behavior, which is difficult to predict at best right now. Our guidance assumes a rather cautious outlook there. On units, if you just take Q1 and you break it down by segment, both Sam's and the US, if you look at it like, say, real sales, they were basically flat. The international segment, I believe, was up around 6%, 6.5% inflation-adjusted. Certainly, we're seeing the impact of higher prices and the effect of consumer behavior on purchasing as it relates to units.\nThen with respect to the stores that we're remodeling, before I answer this, I just want to caution that we're early on here. We've only done a couple of stores, but very excited about the results.\nWe've seen a quite sizable increase, a couple of percentage points in terms of uplift of sales. Now, to be clear, that would be expected. In any store where you do a remodel, you're going to see that initial uptick. I think what we need to continue to monitor is how that levels out over time. But if you've had the chance to go into one of these stores, you certainly recognize the difference that it is versus the rest of the network. And so we're quite excited about this and the early response. How many stores have been done so far?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nWell, we have a couple of dozen now that are around the country. And what we did is pilot it here in Arkansas. Then we went to the Northeast, and we put these now in a number of markets.\nAdditionally, what's encouraging beyond just the merchandising, whether it's the great brands that you see in apparel or layouts, a lot of really exciting changes. What we see is success in a number of markets. So we think this has more broad appeal than perhaps what we may have believed when we did the first one. So the program's going well, and we see several hundred of these in construction and on the way this year.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAs it relates to the GM versus food and consumables mix, you might comment on what you're seeing in e-commerce general merchandise. Then how you would answer the question for Walmart US specifically, how you view Q2 through Q4 as it relates to that mix.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah, definitely some interesting points when you dig into that, Doug. General merchandise is certainly stronger in e-commerce and strong in the marketplace.\nThe trend, as John David said, for the quarter today, which, just a couple of weeks, is very reflective of what was happening at the end of the Q1. But where we have new items, new brands, we have a lot of examples of digitally native brands that we found somewhere in the media or social media that are doing well. That actually is inclusive in food as well. And so the mix right now, as I said earlier, has some positives between supply chain. Food has definitely grown faster along with consumables. The health and wellness growth is something that we didn't really expect going into the year. That has accelerated quite a bit over the last couple of months.\nSo as we look forward, some of the things that are harder to tell right now, the general merchandise impact has been going on for the last three quarters or so, but there are impacts from other things like tax refunds, the weather, and some funds out there. So a little unclear how much of this is temporary in the month that we're in versus what we'll see the rest of the year. But I certainly expect that just the trends in food and consumables and the strength that we have in those, as well as health and wellness, will persist over the next few quarters.\nI think that, if anything, health and wellness, the impact that it's having on the mix and penetration, could get larger based on the growth rates we're seeing in these drug types that John David mentioned.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRupesh Parikh\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to go back to your US e-commerce acceleration during the quarter. What are you seeing from a category perspective? And then for the balance of the year, do you also expect to continue significant contribution to your US comp from e-commerce?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHi, Rupesh. Definitely excited about the quarter. The team has done a lot of work in the last year to improve overall customer experience. We measure something called CX scores, which looks at our assortment, the number of sellers, the quality of the product display pages. And they are really in the details of the business. And the last quarter acceleration, really across the board, in e-commerce, pickup, and delivery were very strong.\nBut we do look at this entire business as part of the total omnichannel offering. And that's really important because when we talk about pickup and delivery at stores, that does include e-commerce orders where a customer was ordering something in general merchandise. It just happened to be that the merchandise, the items were in the store. So in effect, we shortened the last mile, which helps not only speed and time, but also the cost of the transaction. Categories, though, that are strong: we've been strong in food and consumables, really encouraged by accelerations in marketplace and categories like apparel, some acceleration, certain home categories. That's great to see. And I think that'll continue as both the seller count and the item count continue to expand.\nSo we're really looking at customer chain and driving the business with search to ensure that the customer gets whatever they want when they want it from Walmart.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I'll just pile them all into one here. I guess I was wondering, obviously, you guys have brought out some brand partnerships and exclusive partnerships. How do you see that evolving? Store within a store, it seems like there's a lot of opportunity in certain categories like electronics and pet. So that's the first one. The second one is Walmart+ adding benefits. And do you see that as a driver of more high-income consumers? And three is just the grocery climate.\nYou've been taking a lot of share from some of your bigger competitors in traditional grocery. Do you think they're ever going to respond? That's it. Thanks. I jammed through you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHey, morning, Scott. First, let me take all three of these. First, brands. We really like the brand shop that we set up physically in stores that are in the remodel. I know you've seen a few, but the results are really encouraging. I think additionally in apparel, what I really liked that the team did is they brought everything together for the customer. So if you're in the men's shop, you'll see the brands at the front of the department, men's denim just behind it, shoes, accessories, all there together. So where traditionally, we've broken these things up by category, now they're more holistic. Pets is certainly exciting with some of the things that are coming.\nThen online, you will see now, and you'll see a lot more in the future, a lot of branded shops inside the digital experience, which enables brands to be able to put their entire assortment online, whether it's 1P that's online or sold in the store. The rest of the assortment there can be shopped by brand. And I think they're going really well. The first dozen or so are pretty exciting. Walmart+ continue to make progress.\nIt's an important part of the offer. It's not the only thing that we're doing, obviously, but it is an important part of the offer. We're encouraged by the growth of new members. And importantly, what we are really ensuring on these new members is that we are helping them see the entire path to get to all the benefits we offer.\nThe core offer, of course, is based in deliveries that are unlimited without cost once you buy into the membership. That's the most important thing that we get right. We measure ourselves really carefully. It's something we call the perfect order, which is exactly what you ordered on time. And then we continue to work on things like substitutions. And then the last thing on grocery, we're focused on ensuring that our stores are in stock each and every day. We feel better about the supply chain versus a year ago. That would include in-stock availability. It would also include the cost of supply chain.\nStores I've been at recently, from Virginia to New Mexico, Texas, and Tennessee, I'm seeing much better execution in grocery, in-stock, and availability, which does help the order fillers and the order pickers, which makes the Walmart+ experience much better.\nSo we'll really continue to focus on merchandising and pricing. Just the other day, I was with the team and saw this item called Bachan's barbecue sauce, which is a digitally native Japanese-flavored barbecue sauce. It's just doing really well. So also, I'm just personally encouraged by the way the merchants are looking at new ways to find new items, bring those to life, and drive sales all across the country.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nConsumer Research, Barclays\n\nPlease proceed with your question. Hey, everybody. Good morning. My question is really on advertising. I think it's a relatively small quarter for this, but the 40% growth, obviously, it's accelerating. It's very impressive. Can you elaborate on that and what you're doing to drive that? And then maybe more specifically for Sam's, the advertising opportunity there, seeing a lot of growth in sellers on MAP there. So, curious about the opportunity. Thank you.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nHey, good morning. So first, I'll talk about Walmart US with advertising. There's been considerable momentum, really, that started last year when we launched our second-place auction capability. So it's a two-sided market, but ultimately, what we're trying to do is connect our sellers, our suppliers to customers. And that can be at the one-to-one level. It can be at the cohort level. And so the team has done a lot to really increase our capacity and capability to handle those transactions really well.\nWhat's driving it, of course, over time will be a stronger, bigger marketplace. So more marketplace sellers and helping them connect to customers and then more assortment that's easier to find with search also helps the advertising business grow. And I'll turn it over to Judith to talk about international.\n\nJudith McKenna\n\nBoard Member and Former CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah.\nSo same story, really, which is as the ecosystem builds out, it continues to be better strength in our advertising businesses everywhere. So the Flipkart growth is about 50% year on year, but Walmart equally had very strong growth at about 64% year on year. So those businesses continue to grow. We continue to learn and learn new skills about how to best serve the advertisers who want to come onto our platform.\nAnd I think that's one of the areas that we're seeing a lot of good global leverage and global learning as well to really help reinforce that. And I'll just say from Sam's, we talk about it's a little bit different from Sam's, in that we don't have a marketplace, but what we are doing is stitching together.\nYou have our e-com growth, and then you need to also look at our scan-and-go growth because both of those are indicative of a digitally enabled sale. And so what we've been doing is working with our advertising community on how do you influence the sales, whether they are in-club or online or offline. And you can nudge, you can encourage, you can advertise. And now we're giving those advertisers visibility to their in-club sales and the online sales and stitching them together. They're seeing this lift on their return on advertising spend. So it's a different model to what John and Judith have, but we're happy with the tools and capabilities we're building out and how that's resonating with our advertisers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Mr. Kelly, please proceed with your question.\n\nEdward Kelly\n\nManaging Director Equity Research, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYeah. Hi, guys.\nGood morning. I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. As we think about gross margin and progression through the year, could you maybe give us a little bit more color on how some of the pieces progress? We think about things like freight, markdowns, how that might influence the P&L on the back half. And then related to shrink, you haven't spoken about shrink. We have heard it from others. It seems like it's a big industry issue. Just kind of curious as to how tha\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nt's impacting you. Thank you. Yeah, I'll take it. Good morning. So first, supply chain. In the Q1, we definitely felt the tailwind from supply chain versus prior periods, including the execution all across the business.\nIt becomes more of an issue as we lap Q2 last year, Q2 last year, and late Q1 last year would have been the peak of inventories. We worked through a backlog of something like 100,000 containers that had been delayed at port. So lapping those costs gets bigger as you look forward to the next quarter or so. And then as you get into the back half of the year, things tend to normalize a bit. As far as markdowns, last year, we had markdown pressure throughout the entire year as we unloaded that freight and moved it from the ports to the distribution centers to the stores, and through the entire chain.\nSo the markdown comparisons will moderate slightly as we move forward. But every year, including this year, we always leave room for seasonal markdowns.\nAnd at the end of each season, we want to ensure that we are clean on inventory so that we don't carry any liabilities forward. And what happens when that happens is it makes it harder to set the next season, which backs things up. So we'll stay really focused on taking markdowns on time. In fact, in some categories like apparel, we're pulling some markdowns forward within the quarter to take advantage of the traffic that we'll see over the Memorial Day holiday. So this is something that we pay a lot of attention to. Last part of your question, can you repeat again? Shrink? Shrink. Sorry. There were several in there.\nOn shrink, it is a factor mix. As I said a few moments ago, it's affected by supply chain. It's affected by food, consumable, general merchandise mix, and then health and wellness.\nBelow that level, there is, of course, shrink. As we've said in the past, it's been challenging for us. It's been challenging really for all of retail. We're going to actively manage this issue. We always do. We always have. We're going to continue to take the steps that are reasonable and required to make sure we're protecting our customers, protecting our associates, and protecting our assets and inventory. We know a lot of communities have been affected by this, but it's also important to note that retail can't solve this issue all on its own. It'll take communities stepping up and enforcing the law to be able to bring this issue back under control.\nOur next question is from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHi. Thanks very much. I had one clarification and then one question.\nJohn David, I think in your remarks, you made a comment that alternative investments will protect profits. And that comment is a little different from the analyst day where I believe you said it would be additive and not subsidizing, I guess, for Walmart, for lack of a better word. So I wanted to clarify that. But then the bigger question I had is, could you maybe get a little color on what the spend pattern is with a higher-income demographic? And maybe you could quantify what you think our share is today versus what our share is with them today versus prior to the pandemic?\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nCertainly, Karen. To clarify my comments and the prepared remarks, all of these, first of all, work together. It's hard to just look at core retail and then separate out advertising, membership, and fulfillment services.\nThey are mutually reinforcing, which is what makes them so attractive to us. And it's those very new businesses that we think will make our profits inflect in terms of the growth rate relative to sales going forward. So the protect profits, please don't read too much into that. We clearly are excited about this part of our business, and this is the opportunity to have our profits go faster than sales. On the high-income cohort, I'll start there. Maybe John or others might want to jump in. But that was probably most pronounced.\nAnd by that, I mean the shift that we saw. It was most pronounced in the Q2 last year. When we got to the third and the Q4, there was a little more balance between the various income cohorts in terms of share gain.\nThat's what we saw in the most recent quarter as well. But I think the big story here is that it's around how our value proposition for convenience is resonating. We've always been known for price, but I think the steps we've taken in the last three to five years to expand our e-commerce capabilities, to expand online pickup and delivery, you see that resonate with customers. It doesn't matter what your monthly income is. Everybody values convenience the same. So that's the big takeaway here. I think it's an important point as you think about the future of Walmart.\nAs we have these new shoppers coming to us, as we have higher-income shoppers coming to shop for not only grocery, but general merchandise, we want to retain those. We want to retain them with better experiences, better product offerings.\nWe're seeing that in the actions that we're taking today.\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nWe spend a lot of time, of course, working on ensuring that we have flexible options for any customer. In the case of the group that you asked about, we definitely see in the data that there is a higher usage of e-commerce and pickup and delivery. Then when you click into the things they're buying, you do see some differences. So we do see within pickup and delivery, higher purchase rates of categories like prime beef versus regular Cattlemen's grade beef. So you see trade-ups within it. We see it in apparel. We're definitely seeing some growth in apparel and marketplace. That is definitely being driven by some of our newer higher-income customers.\nI'm really excited about the growth of not only transactions, but the number of digital users that we have on year-on-year, which is accelerating.\n\nStephanie Schiller Wissink\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, Walmart\n\nYeah, and I'd just say I think there's a couple of behavioral trends that we're keeping an eye on. So I do think our lower price point units, like say in patio, sold quicker. And what we're seeing is people being very choiceful about where they spend their money, but they're also shopping a lot later. So in the past, when we set patio, it sold really quickly. And now we're seeing people wait a little bit later into the season. We're seeing that with Mother's Day sales. So those demand profiles are looking a lot like they used to in 2018, 2019 versus pandemic spend. So people are buying a little later.\nWe also saw kind of cooler weather, which kind of changed the shape of how people are buying. But what we are seeing is that where you get this really fabulous quality-value equation right, sales are up. So we were looking at beef brisket the other day. Our beef brisket AUR is down 17%. Our tonnage is up 29%. Our roses are amazing value. Rose sales are up 60%. So where you get this great kind of value-quality combination together, we're seeing members engage and spend. And also, I've been looking at kind of convenience and traffic drivers. Hot-baked pizzas in our cafes are up 29%. So there are areas where you see if you get that quality equation, you can drive traffic into the club. And we're just watching cautiously as how they spend on those bigger-ticket items and when those sales will come.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, thanks. I wanted to follow up on inflation because it seemed to be a theme on your prepared comments. I guess, what is the outlook when you talk to the merchants for inflation, both in grocery and across the store? And what can Walmart do to sort of help alleviate that? And then is the industry being rational in terms of pricing and promotion?\n\nJohn Furner\n\nPresident and CEO, Walmart\n\nYeah. As you look forward, it's important to compare what we've been up against the last couple of years. And if you go all the way back into late 2021, that's when we started to see prices starting to rise. And then in 2022, February, March, and April, it was quite acute, obviously, and rose at a rate that we weren't expecting going into the year.\nWith the peak of inflation in the end year in July and August of last year, we saw high double digits in categories like food and consumables. As you get into the period that we're in now, we're still seeing around high single digits to double digits in parts of dry grocery and other places. But when you add that up over the three years, it gets to be a really high number, which is clearly driving part of the shift. The way we think about value, first, we're always comparing ourselves to the prices that are out on the market. We feel good about our price positioning. The second, we've been able to look at key holidays like Thanksgiving last year, Easter that we just went through.\nWe've been able to keep a number of items on either a Rollback program or base prices where customers can buy key important holiday meals at the same price that they bought them for the year before. As you look forward, it's not easy to predict. Clearly, we're not happy with the inflation that we see in categories like dry grocery, and those persist. As you get into the later part of the Q2 and Q3, the end-year number may look lower because we'll be comparing against such high numbers last year.\nBut it's important to keep in mind that the two-year stack at that point, we still think will be in the mid-20s. So consumers are under a lot of stress. Therefore, we see the shift to private brand that John David mentioned in his earlier remarks. So more shift this year than the year before.\nThe year before, there was more of a shift than 2021. That trend continues.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nWe can be good mix managers within food, but across the box as well for the US and around the world. General merchandise prices, as they're coming down, present an opportunity leading down, number one. Number two, finding items and categories that have above-average margins and shaving the margin off there to mix sales up. As customers want to buy discretionary items, we are in a position to be able to show them value through the rest of this year that they might not find elsewhere. We can be aggressive there. Private brand share is another thing. You're seeing that number come up. We have more influence over what's happening with private brands than we do with branded product.\nWe do need some of these branded suppliers that are in dry grocery and consumables to get top-line focused more than they have been for a while. It's a generalization. Not everybody's in the same place, but we're looking for those that want to be aggressive. So if we can make a difference on dry grocery and consumables, lead with general merchandise, and then deal with what's happening in the fresh food categories, which are less consistent, more volatile, that some are up, some are down relative to dry grocery and consumables. That's the way we pull off a basket that generates the best value for our customers.\n\nGreg Melich\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will be from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys.\nLast year, 2022, you gave some numbers around SKU count, big increases in SKU count on marketplace throughout the year. I'm curious if you can give us an update on your total SKU count currently and how you expect that to change in 2023 and beyond. And if you can give any color, what percent of your marketplace customers can you also count as advertising and fulfillment services customers? And what targets are there? Thanks.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nSure. Good growth in the marketplace in the US, and there may be other comments from other markets. But a lot of growth last year. SKU count, as you mentioned, lately, I think it was Q4 and Q1, both in the 400 million range. We expect that to grow probably not at the rate that it grew last year. We made a lot of progress in both SKU count and seller count.\nThere is continued acceleration with the number who are using fulfillment services and advertising. What's important about both of those services is, let me start with fulfillment. It helps with the customer time to promise, and it helps customers know when they're going to receive their item. Customers want to get their delivery when they ordered it.\nThey don't want it early. They don't want it late. They want it the day of. And when sellers move their assortment, their inventory into our fulfillment channels, then it's more certain for a customer that it's going to be next-day delivery or two-day delivery. And that just helps with conversion rates. So if you're a marketplace seller and you want to know how to drive business at Walmart, it's to list on the marketplace, put inventory in fulfillment services.\nAnd then Walmart Connect is just a great way for the seller to be able to find audiences, targeted audiences who are looking for products in categories like the ones that are offered. So it's really the three of those things that all come together to make the customer experience much greater, and the data supports everything I just described. From an international perspective on marketplaces, we continue to see SKU growth across Mexico and Canada, but both of those marketplaces are quite nascent in their development and provide a lot of opportunity for the future. Walmart added 50% of SKUs in Q1 versus the same time in the previous year. Of course, our most mature marketplace is in India, which has hundreds of millions of products on that. It continues to find new ways to serve customers.\n\nJudith McKenna\n\nBoard Member and Former CEO, Walmart\n\nBut when they recently launched Flipkart Fulfillment Services, that connectivity between the advertising, the providing the services to help sellers wherever they are in India be able to get items to customers, and our business is working really well. Again, we've only recently launched that, and we're already seeing really good traction right across the country.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nCFO, Walmart\n\nI think I'll go ahead and wrap up here. We ran a little over. I hope that's okay. Appreciate your questions. I'm grateful to work with such a strong team, the people that have been on this call, but all those that are working in our stores, clubs, and throughout the company. I think you can see in our results that we've got a very strong and capable team and one that can adapt to environments.\nThere have been a lot of pivots over the last few years in particular, and they've done a terrific job of navigating all of that. We feel strong about our position to grow the top line. We're positioned to serve customers and members how they want to be served. I think the e-com growth this quarter being up 26% is an example of that. But if they want to come to stores and clubs, we're there. If they want to do a pickup order, we're there. If they want to have it delivered, we can do that. We are positioned to grow profit faster than sales through productivity and through the mix of businesses, carrying in an additive way.\nThen on ROI, we'll be disciplined with capital, but we are excited about our opportunities to invest and really grateful that you all came down to Florida, so many of you, and saw what we're doing there. We just wrap up by inviting you to come in a couple of weeks. We'll show you an MFC. We'll go to a store. We'll go to a club. We'll answer more of your questions. We feel like we're in a position to outperform and to continue to outperform because of the work that's been done to date and our ability to manage the business and pivot as we need to looking forward. Thanks for your attention today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Welcome to Walmart's Fiscal Year 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Steph, you may now begin.\n\nStephanie Schiller Wissink\n\nThank you, and welcome to our Q4 Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today from Walmart's home office in Bentonville are CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. We'll follow a similar format to prior calls, where Doug and John David will share their thoughts on the quarter, year and year ahead. Following, we'll open the call to your questions. For the Q&A portion, we've asked our segment CEOs to join, including John Furner from Walmart U.S., Judith McKenna from Walmart International and Kath McLay from Sam's Club.\nToday's call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.\nWe are now ready to begin. Doug, over to you.\n\nC. Douglas McMillon\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Walmart Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're excited about our momentum. The team delivered a strong finish to the year. And as our results in the last 2 quarters show, we acted quickly and aggressively to address the inventory and cost challenges we faced last year. We built momentum in the third quarter, and that continues. We're well positioned to start this fiscal year.\nFor fiscal '23, we added $38 billion in sales globally, and we crossed $600 billion in revenue for the first time in our company's history. Globally, e-commerce now represents more than $80 billion in sales and over 13% of our total sales.\nWalmart U.S. grew sales by more than $27 billion. International had another strong year with sales and profit growth of about 9%, excluding divestitures, restructuring and currency. And Sam's Club U.S. grew sales by more than $10 billion as we delivered double-digit comp growth for the third consecutive year with membership count at a record high and strong growth in membership income. All 3 segments have momentum. We're grateful to John, Judith, Kath and their teams for how they're leading these businesses and showing results.\nThe holidays were strong for us. From Thanksgiving to Christmas to Diwali to Singles Day, our teams were ready. We had aggressive plans and we delivered. Around the world, the teams leaned into our food and consumables strength, taking share in places like the U.S. and Canada and delivered a good experience for customers and members in general merchandise. They drove sales and landed the seasons in a very good inventory position when it was all said and done.\nWe ended the quarter with inventory about flat to last year, which is better than we anticipated and even better when you consider how inflation lifts that number. And they did it while improving in-stock levels. I'm impressed with how they brought it all together, and want to highlight our store, club and supply chain associates who handled a lot of volume to make this happen.\nAs we navigated the short term, we also advanced our strategic priorities. Big picture, our strategy is simple. It's to bring our purpose to life for those we have the privilege to serve. We're a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer that's dedicated to helping people save money and live a better life. That's who we are.\nWhy do we exist? It's to help people save money and live better. How do we do it? By being people-led with clear values, a unique culture and tech-powered.\nWe're a people business focused on customers, members and associates. We're constantly adjusting to put the right combination of wages, benefits and education in place so that our people can build lifelong careers and achieve their full potential. You can start your career assembling bicycles and end up leading all of our U.S. stores. You can start as a cashier and become a truck driver. You can start unloading trucks in a DC and grow to oversee an automated system moving freight through that DC. We provide opportunity even as we continue to innovate through technology and prepare our business and workforce for the future.\nOne of the things I have always appreciated about this company is that it's naturally hedged. If customers want more of something and less of something else, we shift our inventory. If the economy is strong, our customers have more money, and that's great. If things are tougher, they come to us for value.\nWith today's inflation, we're continuing to see that happen. We're gaining share across income cohorts, including at the higher end, which made up nearly half of the gains we saw in the U.S. again this quarter. And we're also capturing a greater share of wallet at Sam's Club in the U.S. with both mid- and higher-income shoppers. Our goal is, for the experience they're having in our stores and clubs, combined with our current capabilities for pickup, delivery and membership, to result in them choosing us even as inflation eventually subsides.\nAs we plan this new fiscal year, we've anticipated stubborn inflation in dry grocery and consumables in particular, which will have some mix impact. We'll stay focused on general merchandise and earn sales in those categories to offset that impact as much as possible.\nWhen we think about our business today compared to what it was during prior economic downturns, we now have a more compelling offer, a true omnichannel experience that makes us optimistic that more higher-income families will continue shopping with us across categories because we have pickup, delivery and membership.\nAnd we're improving in categories like apparel and home. Our recently remodeled U.S. stores have a focus in those areas, and the early response from customers is promising. We're also improving our e-commerce assortment and presentation in those categories.\nWe've always been known for great prices. And because of the work we've done around pickup and delivery from stores, clubs and expanded assortment through FCs, we're increasingly known for the convenience we offer. In fact, our U.S. customer feedback showed strength in price and convenience. Our reputation for price remains strong, and our score for convenience has risen to nearly the same level. Our Walmart+ members recognize our strength for convenience even more than the average customer.\nAs it relates to our customer or member value proposition, we continue to have a strength with respect to value, while we're expanding choice by growing our assortment on Walmart.com, and we're improving as it relates to experience. Being an at-scale omnichannel retailer creates unique opportunities to innovate in the area of experience. That includes products like Scan And Go at Sam's Club and a newer in-house conversational AI platform enabling a voice and chat capability being used by more than 50 million customers and an average of 1 million associates across the U.S., Mexico, Canada and Chile.\nWe're driving a lot of change inside our company. We know where to tap the brakes on cost and inventory, but our focus is more on the gas pedal with respect to our strategic improvements related to assortment growth and our customer and member experience. We'll keep shaping the business model by scaling our newer mutually reinforcing businesses in areas like marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising. It's exciting to see our global advertising business grow to $2.7 billion for the year we just completed. That's nearly 30% growth.\nOver the last 3 years, while our frontline focus was on navigating the pandemic and inflation, we still launched and started scaling new complementary businesses using the technology and expertise we developed over time. You can see this in some of our recent announcements. The partnership we announced with Salesforce to help scale local fulfillment and delivery solutions for customers on their e-commerce platform is a good example; or our new Walmart business e-commerce site is another, where we're helping small and medium-sized businesses and nonprofits save money and spend less on purchasing the items they need every day.\nOur fast-growing businesses in India, Flipkart and PhonePe, announced a full separation, which will allow both companies to focus on their own growth paths independently and help unlock value for shareholders. Flipkart has continued to strengthen its market leadership position in e-commerce and is entering this year with good momentum. PhonePe also announced the closing in January of the initial tranche of a fund raise that values the business at $12 billion pre-money. This is more than double the previous valuation just 2 years ago.\nAnd our Sam's Club U.S. team announced expansion plans that will have us opening more than 30 new clubs across the country over the next several years in addition to a multiyear plan to invest in and modernize our supply chain, especially in the U.S.\nI'll wrap up my comments today by saying thank you to our associates. I'm grateful for how they continue to step up for our customers and members, and I'm impressed by their creativity and resilience. We've worked through a lot of the operational stress in our business from last year, and we made progress on strategic initiatives as we did it, and we're doing it in a way that's uniquely Walmart.\nJohn David, over to you.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Walmart Inc.\n\nThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter to wrap up the year. We're pleased with how we finished the year. Our team demonstrated our agility and responsiveness to overcome the operational challenges, from supply chain disruptions, excess inventory and the shift in our merchandise mix.\nFor the full year, enterprise sales on a constant currency basis grew more than 7%, and we surpassed $600 billion in annual sales for the first time. Adjusted EPS declined 2.6% for the year.\nOur performance in Q4 was better than our expectations due to sales upside and good expense leverage.\nConstant currency sales grew 8% with strength across all segments, including strong performance throughout the holiday season.\nWalmart U.S. comps increased 8.3%, including 17% growth in e-commerce, with a combination of pricing due in part to inflation and share gains. Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 12.6% excluding fuel and tobacco. And constant currency sales in Walmart International increased 5.5%, led by Walmex.\nAs I discuss our profitability, it's important to note the reorganization and restructuring charges within the International segment affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q4 results will focus on the business excluding adjusted items.\nGross margins were down 83 basis points, largely resulting from additional markdowns taken to address carryover inventory balances, mix headwinds and underlying inflation in our cost structure. With strong sales growth in the quarter, we levered SG&A expenses by 89 basis points.\nTaking all this together, adjusted operating income grew nearly 7%. Adjusted EPS of $1.71 was better than we expected going into the quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.32. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.16 benefit from unrealized gains on equity investments partially offset by a $0.55 charge related to business reorganization and restructuring in International.\nInventory at quarter end was relatively flat to last year. This includes a nearly 3% decrease from Walmart U.S. I'm pleased with how our teams responded to the challenge early in the year to aggressively rebalance inventory for the current environment, and it sets us up in a really good position going into the year.\nLet me briefly reference key highlights for Q4 by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales were strong throughout the quarter, and December was the largest sales month in Walmart U.S. history. This was led by strength in food sales, which increased high teens, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in general merchandise sales with softness in toys, electronics, home and apparel.\nThe effects of product mix shifts have negatively impacted our margins. Over the last year, grocery and health and wellness sales, which have a lower margin than general merchandise, have increased by 330 basis points as a portion of our mix. We continue to see strong share gains in grocery with nearly half coming from higher-income households, and private brand penetration increased over 160 basis points as customers prioritized value. Inflation remained high, up mid-teens in food categories, which was similar to Q3 levels. E-commerce sales were led by continued strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in Q4.\nOver the last 2 years, store-fulfilled delivery sales have nearly tripled, and we're now doing over $1 billion a month, which gives you an indication of why we're so excited about the progress here. Advertising sales were also strong this quarter, up 41%. Higher sales and lower COVID costs contributed to SG&A expense leverage, which offset gross profit pressure, resulting in operating income growth of 3.8%.\nIn International, strong sales trends continued with growth of 5.5% on a constant currency basis led by double-digit growth in Walmex and China. Currency negatively affected reported sales results by about $900 million or an approximate 340 basis point headwind to growth. Q4 sales benefited from successful festive events across our markets. Year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by the timing shift of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event to Q3 this year versus Q4 last year.\nLooking at the second half of the year in total, International sales grew more than 9% in constant currency. E-commerce sales were strong with penetration at 21%, with China leading the way at 48% penetration for the quarter. Walmex had another great quarter with sales strength in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 14% growth in e-commerce. Segment adjusted operating income grew faster than sales, up nearly 17% in constant currency, helped by effective cost management across markets.\nIn India, Flipkart continued its strong momentum through Diwali and other seasonal events. We are particularly pleased to see Flipkart's positive contribution margin expanding. PhonePe's recent valuation that Doug talked about was supported by annualized TPV reaching more than $950 billion, about 50% higher than just 1 year ago, while also exceeding more than 4 billion monthly transactions.\nTurning to Sam's Club. Our strong momentum continued, with comps up 12.6% in Q4 and up 23.4% on a 2-year stack. The segment delivered another quarter of record member counts and membership income growth was above 7%. In addition to solid increases in both transaction and ticket, Sam's e-commerce sales were up 21% year-over-year with contributions from both curbside and ship to home.\nOperating income was pressured in the quarter by elevated markdowns lapping higher co-branded credit card income last year and an inflation-related LIFO charge of $14 million. With the strong trends at Sam's over the past several years, we're excited to expand our physical footprint through a multiyear investment in new clubs and supply chain optimization.\nTurning to guidance. As we sit here today, we find ourselves in a similar position to each of the last 3 years, where there is a great deal of uncertainty looking out over the balance of the year. While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high and there is considerable pressure on the consumer. Attempting to predict with precision these swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer behavior is challenging.\nAs such, our guidance reflects a cautious outlook on the macro environment, but at the same time, our excitement about our recent results, momentum in all segments and progress on our strategy both for this year and the years that follow. We are positioned well and convicted about our plan.\nIn FY '24, we expect operating income growth to outpace sales growth. Given the persistence of high prices and the potential for further macro pressures, we are taking a cautious outlook for the year. We are guiding enterprise sales growth of 2.5% to 3% in constant currency and operating income growth of approximately 3%. This guidance assumes product mix pressures persist, but that our business mix continues to improve.\nEven with an estimated 100 basis point impact from LIFO charges, we still expect to grow operating income more than sales. We also expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, International sales growth in constant currency of approximately 6% and Sam's Club comp sales growth of approximately 5% excluding fuel. Based on FX rates at the end of our fiscal year, we estimate a potential year-over-year enterprise sales tailwind of about $1.2 billion from currency.\nOur purpose starts by helping people save money and live better, and it's more important than ever in this environment as consumers manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We're reinforcing our value proposition across our merchandise offering, including featuring high-quality owned brands and leaning into opening price points. We're accelerating share gains in our food categories and seeing signs of improved attach rates in consumables and high-frequency purchase areas of general merchandise.\nOur multiyear sales and operating income targets are just that, multiyear. In some years, our performance will be higher; and in some years, lower. We are confident, however, that we're building a business that allows us to grow our top and bottom line throughout an economic cycle.\nOver the past 5 years, sales have grown approximately 6% on average, excluding divestitures. This year will likely be lower, but we look forward to getting back to a sales growth trend more in line with what we've delivered over the last few years.\nOver that same period, operating income has grown at about half the rate of sales growth on an adjusted basis, excluding divestitures. This is the result of important investments we made in associate wages, pricing, technology and supply chain, which together strengthened our core business and position us well for the future.\nImportantly, while we navigate some of the short-term challenges, we're continuing to invest for the future, invest in ways that strengthen our retail advantages by expanding our capabilities in marketplace, ad platform, data ventures and fulfillment as a service. We're providing more convenience for customers, including pickup and delivery, Scan And Go and Walmart+. We're working in partnership with our suppliers and sellers to use data, scaled fulfillment capabilities and our rapidly growing ad platform to elevate inventory accuracy and in-stocks, lower the cost to serve and drive improved conversion. All of this improves the trajectory of our ROI and our margin profile.\nWe will continue to invest in our associates through increased pay and benefits to reinforce the ladder of opportunities at Walmart. But we're managing our costs in a way that allows us to achieve our operating income goals with these investments. In other words, we're staying true to our commitment of everyday low cost, enabling everyday low prices.\nWe expect FY '24 CapEx to be flat to up slightly in total dollars compared to last year as we continue the multiyear investment in technology and innovation to optimize our supply chain in stores. Many of these tech enhancements are reaching the stage where we can rapidly deploy them across our network, and we have clear line of sight toward better efficiencies and ROI on these investments in the medium term.\nI want to call out a few other assumptions for our guidance for the year. Gross margin rate is expected to increase this year, though not back to FY '22 levels yet. We expect gross margin to benefit from the lapping of higher supply chain costs and markdowns from this past year as well as growth from our newer initiatives, many of which have a higher profit margin.\nPartially offsetting this, we expect product mix and inflation-related LIFO charges to be gross margin headwinds. Based on current assumptions for inflation, LIFO charges for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $500 million this year with the headwind equally proportioned across quarters. This is an improvement from the $1 billion LIFO estimate we provided on the Q3 call due to moderating inflation in key merchandise categories and reduced inventory levels. It's important to note that inflation, inventory levels and additional factors will influence the aggregate amount. We'll commit to providing updates as we go through the year.\nWith sales growth expected at a lower rate versus the prior year and our commitment to continuing to invest in our people and technology, we expect SG&A to delever slightly in FY '24. There are also several below-the-line items that will pressure EPS for FY '24.\nFirst, interest expense is estimated to be about $750 million higher than last year. This translates to an approximate $0.20 year-over-year EPS headwind with Q1's impact less than the remaining quarters.\nSecond, we do not expect a repeat of the benefit we realized from certain discrete tax items last year, and as such, expect our tax rate to be more normalized in FY '24 at 25.5% to 26.5%, resulting in an approximate $0.10 EPS headwind.\nAnd lastly, in our noncontrolling interest line, we expect an approximate $0.12 EPS headwind related to acquiring full ownership of Massmart and Alert Innovation as well as the impacts to minority interest of strong expected performance at Walmex.\nIn total, these below-the-line factors account for approximately $0.42 of year-over-year EPS headwind. The impact from these below-the-line items offsets the gains we're making in our core business, resulting in EPS being slightly down for the year. We expect full year EPS of between $5.90 and $6.05, including a $0.14 headwind from LIFO.\nFor the first quarter, we expect to see a higher rate of sales growth of 4.5% to 5%, largely due to inflation. We expect operating income to increase 3.5% to 4%, including the negative impact of a LIFO charge of approximately 235 basis points. EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.25 to $1.30, including an approximate $0.03 headwind from LIFO.\nWhile we're not providing quarterly guidance beyond Q1, I want to offer the following perspective. We currently expect sales growth to be strongest in the first half then moderating in the second half, reflecting our macro assumptions and a more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Because we will lap the benefit we received last year from insurance proceeds in 2Q, we expect operating income to be flat in 2Q relative to last year. We expect operating income growth to begin to outpace sales growth to a greater degree in the second half of the year versus the first half.\nIn closing, I want to echo Doug's Sentiment on our business. Over the last year, our team responded to some of the external challenges with the speed and nimbleness rarely seen in a company of our size, and we exited the year in a much, much better place.\nAs I reflect on where we are today, I'm more excited about our future than at any point in my time here. The opportunity in front of us is incredible. Our customer, member value proposition has never been stronger. Perhaps that's more obvious during times like this, when the consumer is pressured.\nWe have become an omnichannel retailer. Who else has the stores and clubs so close to so many customers and members, combined with first- and third-party e-commerce and the combination of grocery and general merchandise and in multiple attractive countries? We're in the right markets with a breadth of assortment and ways of shopping like no one else with impactful and emerging digital and technological capabilities.\nOur plan leverages our strengths to serve our customers and members in more ways. We meet them where they are, to continue to help them save money and time, to help them live better.\nBut what you're going to see in the years to come is that we will keep changing, and the changes will improve the composition of our P&L. We will have related, diversified, higher-margin earning streams that are scaling rapidly. You will begin to see the significant benefits from the investments that we're making in things like our supply chain automation and our expanded e-commerce capabilities. We're at an inflection point to begin to accelerate margin expansion, reinforcing that the algorithm is in place. The macro pressures this year may obscure some of that progress, but won't take away from the long-term promise of many of these initiatives. We look forward to sharing more at our Investor Day in April.\nThank you. Let me turn it over to the operator for questions.",

Welcome to Walmart's Fiscal Year 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the conference over to [Steph Wissink], Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Steph, you may begin.\n\nStephanie Schiller Wissink\n\nThank you. Welcome to Walmart's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; John David Rainey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club.\nIn a few moments, Doug and John David will provide you an update on the business and discuss third quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session.\nBefore I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.\n\nC. Douglas McMillon\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Walmart Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our results for the third quarter. Let me highlight what you'll hear from us this morning.\nFirst, it was a good quarter. We delivered strong results on the top line across our segments, and our value proposition is resonating with customers and members around the world. We see this in our grocery business in stores and online in key markets like the U.S. and Mexico. Customers that came to us less frequently in the past are now shopping with us more often, including higher-income customers.\nSecond, we're being thoughtful and balanced about inventory levels by category and expenses as we work through the fourth quarter and position ourselves for next year. There are places where we'll remain aggressive and others where we're being more conservative.\nThird, while we prioritize retail fundamentals, we're also connecting and scaling newer, naturally related capabilities to our larger business so they become mutually reinforcing. Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising are examples. As it relates to the third quarter, it began with top-line momentum from the back-to-school season in the U.S. and Mexico, and that continued through festivals in India, China and through early Deals for Days events in the U.S. Walmex had a great quarter and so did Sam's Club in the U.S. as we continued our string of double-digit comp club sales growth. Kath and the team at Sam's have run double-digit comps for almost 3 years. We like the way those numbers compound.\nAs a total company, we're seeing strength in stores, clubs and e-commerce. Transactions are positive, and our penetration of e-commerce sales continues to climb. So far this year, 13% of our total sales as a company now start in a digital fashion, and that's led by Walmart International, which is already at 20%.\nWith the cost of everyday items still stubbornly high in too many categories, more customers and members are choosing us for the value and assortment we're known for and they're responding to the changes we've made to save them time. With this in mind, we're focusing on earning repeat business from customers who are now shopping with us more frequently than before.\nFor example, a strong presentation throughout fresh and apparel are priorities, along with executing pickup and delivery to create a delightful experience that saves them time. And in the case of Walmart U.S., it also means selling more Walmart+ memberships. As more people look to us for value, we want them to see that the experience of shopping with us is also compelling due to the new capabilities we develop.\nOur app experiences around the world are a place where we introduce these newer capabilities. As our app becomes more a part of daily life for our customers and members, they find that they can do so much with it, like easily build a shopping cart, schedule a time to pick up an order or have it delivered when it's convenient for them, skip the line with scan & go or find an item in their local store. As you would expect, we're helping families stretch their dollars as we head into the holidays. The Walmart U.S. team has set the retail prices for a typical Thanksgiving meal the same as last year. We're removing inflation on a basket of traditional Thanksgiving food items, including whole turkeys for under $1 per pound.\nThe members' dollar's going further at Sam's Club, too, with racks of lamb and lobster tails priced more than 40% lower than last year. We're also making the everyday shopping trip better by lowering the price of the cafe hot dog combo by nearly 10% to $1.38.\nAround the world, our teams have this type of mindset. In Mexico, we've widened the price gaps in our popular Bodega format by 100 basis points this year. It's incredible value at a time when customers need it most. We're finding creative ways to relieve pressure for families across our merchandise categories and countries. I'm proud of how our associates continue to step up. We're grateful for how they've navigated our inventory challenges this year and continued to prioritize the customer and member experience while doing so. During my store club and DC visits, they inspire me by the way they work together, the way they serve others and how they're embracing change and contributing ideas to improve our business.\nLooking ahead, we updated our outlook for the year on results from Q3, yet we remained balanced in our approach to the rest of Q4 and next year. Inflation is being especially stubborn in some categories like dry grocery. Living with high prices through this year has a cumulative impact on our customers, especially for those that are most budget-conscious, and so we're focused on bringing our costs and prices down as quickly as possible by item and category. Regardless of income levels, families are more price-conscious now. So it's as important as ever that we earn their trust with value.\nIn just a minute, John David will share more about the guidance we gave this morning. We're working to position ourselves to succeed regardless of demand levels through value and the experience we offer and the way we're positioning inventory and expenses. We're into the details, business by business. This is not a time to paint with a broad brush. We're focused on the things we can control. We delivered good expense leverage during the quarter across our segments. Strong sales growth helps, but we're also doing a good job of managing costs, and we're doing it in a sustainable way. We can keep costs in line and continue to invest in our people and technology, including supply chain automation, and continue to deliver value for customers, members and shareholders.\nWe've made good progress to improve our inventory position. Globally, inventory is up 13% for the quarter, including 12.4% for Walmart U.S. and 2.5% for International. Inflation drives the majority of the increase rather than units. In-stock on replenishable items and active management of seasonal item quantities and sell-throughs are the priorities. We expect this progress to continue through the fourth quarter and that will end the year in even better shape.\nOur merchants have taken an item-by-item, category-by-category approach to match inventory with demand. We've worked through a unique period in history as we chased inventory in 2020 and 2021 and were too heavy in some general merchandise categories this year. Given where inflation remains and that economic uncertainty seems higher than normal, the quantity choice our merchants make is even more crucial than in a more normal time back when there was such a thing as a more normal time.\nWe can be more aggressive on shorter lead time items like food and consumables, but we're especially sensitive to quantity decisions on longer-lead time items that are imported. We're thankful to have so many experienced and talented merchants. They've accomplished a lot these past few quarters. Just like John, Kath, Judith and the rest of the team have done, they've demonstrated good judgment and a lot of hustle.\nOur flywheel continues to take shape. We're scaling our newer businesses and connecting them to our larger, established retail businesses, primarily by how we design digital interactions. One example is how our growth in e-commerce, especially the Marketplace, fuels our ad business. More items and sellers drive GMV and improved customer satisfaction. And it also drives success in advertising, they're mutually reinforcing.\nIf we double-click on advertising with Walmart Connect in the U.S., we see it's benefiting from growth in e-commerce and from improvements made within the business itself, and we've seen strong growth in return on ad spend over last year. In turn, this helped drive the highest ad spend all year for sponsored search in Q3. These improvements underscore Connect's strengths and position the business for continued growth.\nWe also continue to see strong growth with Flipkart Ads in India. Like much of what we're doing, advertising is working for us globally because we have something unique to offer media buyers, and these businesses create momentum for each other.\nAs with advertising, growing our Marketplace business also unlocks fulfillment services opportunities through both fulfillment centers and last-mile delivery. We're scaling these businesses in the U.S., and we're starting to ramp up in Mexico and Canada. The team in Mexico increased the number of sellers on our Marketplace by 20% during the quarter. In the U.S., the Marketplace on Walmart.com now offers about 370 million SKUs. That's an increase of more than 50% from Q2.\nMany of these sellers want to leverage our fulfillment network. They also want to use our advertising capabilities to drive demand, and we're making that easier for them. We recently shared that all new Marketplace sellers in the U.S. will be automatically onboarded onto our self-service ad platform. We believe this seamless integration will help both businesses scale even faster.\nWhat you see in our results is that we can run compelling stores and clubs, scale a first- and third-party e-commerce business and connect them together in an omnichannel fashion that saves customers and members money and time. Our strategy unlocks growth opportunities for us in a thread that runs from digital retail to fulfillment and advertising and opens up even more opportunities with health and wellness and financial services. This quarter demonstrates, again, that we can navigate short-term challenges and build for the long term simultaneously.\nIt's been my experience over all these years that Walmart is a well-positioned business and is inherently hedged. When times are good, we have room to grow. When things are more difficult, we sell things people want and need at a value and in ways they want to shop. And with new levers for growth across our flywheel, we're becoming even stronger and more resilient.\nI'll close today by saying thank you for your interest in our company. We like the momentum we are creating in our business, and we recognize the need for a balanced approach in the near term given continued strains on our customers and members. Our team is focused and alert. Happy holidays, everybody.\nHere's John David.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Walmart Inc.\n\nThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver a strong quarter. I will focus my comments on the themes Doug mentioned. First, our sales momentum and share gains. Second, operational actions we're taking to improve inventory and supply chain. Third, progress we're making to further connect our alternative value streams to our core business. And lastly, our guidance for the balance of the year.\nOur Q3 results exceeded our expectations due to sales upside with operating expense leverage across all 3 business segments. While we're encouraged by our position and our confidence in our business remains high, the macro backdrop remains challenging as persistent inflation is impacting the consumer and our business.\nAs I discuss our results, it's important to note the charges related to the opioid legal settlement framework affect year-over-year comparisons. So my comments regarding Q3 results will focus on the business, excluding adjusted items.\nTotal constant currency revenue grew 9.8% as our omni model and strong value proposition continue to resonate with customers during this period of broad inflationary pressures.\nEach of our segments delivered strong sales results. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated sequentially to 8.2% growth with increases in average ticket size as well as transactions. Constant currency sales in Walmart International were strong, up 13.3% led by Flipkart and Walmex, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with growth of 10.3%, excluding fuel and tobacco.\nOur purpose of saving people money has never been more important as inflation remains consistently high. High fuel prices and mid-teens food inflation have forced consumers to manage household budgets more tightly, making frequent trade-offs and biasing spending toward everyday essentials. We continue to manage pricing in a way that preserves our price gaps while gaining market share profitably.\nWalmart is well positioned to serve customers and gain greater trip frequency during tougher economic periods, and we have even more tools to do so in this cycle. For example, we've continued to gain grocery market share from households across income demographics, with nearly 3/4 of the share gain coming from those exceeding $100,000 in annual income. This quarter, our private brand penetration in food categories increased about 130 basis points, reflecting customers' increased focus on quality products at value prices.\nWe observed incremental trade down in categories, including proteins, baking goods, baby and dog food. We're working hard to keep prices low and help ease the burden to make customers' lives better. This includes working with vendors to reduce product cost and minimize inflation impacts on final goods' pricing.\nConsolidated gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points. More than half of the decline was due to markdowns and sales mix in the U.S. The remaining headwind reflects a $113 million LIFO charge at Sam's Club due to inflation and the timing of sales events in International, including Flipkart's Big Billion Days.\nNotably, the rate of decline in gross margin improved from 2Q as inventory remediation efforts are progressing. We've been very targeted in reducing certain categories of inventory in our system and our actions included canceling orders and increasing the level of markdowns. The team has done a really good job addressing our inventory situation, as reflected by Q3 inventory being up only 13% versus last year, including 12.4% growth in Walmart U.S. In aggregate, this level represents a more than 10 percentage point improvement versus the end of Q2.\nNotably, about 70% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation. We feel good about our ability to sell through the majority of this in Q4 and expect continued year-over-year improvement even when including the effects of inflation.\nWe saw stronger expense leverage this quarter as selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 75 basis points due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID cost. We're focused on what we can control and continue to work down inventory levels and manage general and administrative expenses tightly.\nTaking all this together, adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis increased 4.6%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.66 but adjusted EPS was $1.50. The difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS reflects a $1.11 impact from unrealized losses on equity investments, primarily JD.com and a $1.05 charge related to the opioid litigation settlement framework. We're pleased that our adjusted EPS outperformed the guidance we provided in August due primarily to better operating expense leverage on higher sales across the business.\nOperating cash flow for the year-to-date period decreased $600 million to $15.7 billion primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. We're committed to continuing to provide strong cash returns to shareholders while still appropriately investing in our business for the long term. And our Board has just approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization that we expect to utilize over the next several years.\nLet me briefly reference key highlights by segment. For Walmart U.S., comp sales momentum accelerated in Q3 with a 2-year stack of 17.4%, up 570 basis points from Q2. Monthly sales gains were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. Food sales continued to lead with mid-teens growth. We're particularly encouraged to see year-over-year growth in food units sold after experiencing a slight decline last quarter. We also continue to make good progress on improving in-stock levels in our grocery business despite the heavy volumes we're experiencing.\nInflation remained high, up mid-teens percentage in food categories reflecting an 80 basis point step-up compared to levels at the end of Q2. We've seen incremental levels of inflation month-over-month be less significant, but it's not clear if this represents a sustainable trend. However, we believe our strong price positioning is contributing to share gains as we attract value-seeking customers across the household income spectrum.\nGeneral merchandise sales declined low single digits with softness in electronics, home and apparel. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to 16% growth, even as store transactions continued to grow. We experienced strength in pickup and delivery from stores, Marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising.\nGross profit rate decreased 77 basis points due primarily to higher markdowns and product mix headwinds, but the team delivered strong SG&A expense leverage of 60 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs. As a result, we delivered better-than-expected operating income growth of nearly 5%.\nWalmart International delivered strong sales results, with sales up 13.3% in constant currency despite continued macro headwinds. E-commerce sales on a constant currency basis were exceptionally strong, up 46% in the quarter. The earlier timing of Flipkart's Big Billion Days event was also a benefit to sales results.\nCurrency negatively affected reported sales results by about $1.5 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, led by a great quarter from Walmex, with comp sales growth of 11.7%, reflecting strong performance in Bodega stores, Sam's Clubs and 17% growth in e-commerce.\nIn China, comp sales were up 5.6%, reflecting strong e-commerce growth as well as strength at Sam's Club. E-commerce sales grew 63% and penetration reached 41% of sales.\nCanada comp sales increased more than 5%. And in October, we launched Walmart fulfillment services in Canada, where sellers of all sizes on the digital Marketplace can now contract with us to take care of their inventory storage and logistics needs. The new offering will provide faster shipping of customer orders within a 2-day window to 95% of Canadians.\nIn India, Flipkart had a great quarter with strong customer response to our Big Billion Days event, which moved forward into Q3 this year from Q4 last year. We had over 1 billion visits to our site during the 8-day event and, importantly, saw more than 60% of those customers coming from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.\nPhonePe also continues to perform well with annualized total payment volume, or TPV, now over $920 billion and reaching a record level of monthly transactions to about $3.6 billion. This was the first time PhonePe had a quarter with more than 10 billion transactions.\nInternational segment operating income was better than expected and increased 3.2% in constant currency, led by Walmex and China.\nIn Sam's Club U.S., we had another strong quarter with comp sales up more than 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and an increase of more than 25% on a 2-year stack. Both comp transactions and average ticket increased about 5%. And e-commerce sales grew 20% with strength in curbside orders and ship to home. Membership income was up 8% with another record high quarter in overall member counts, at an all-time high, plus member penetration.\nSam's leveraged expenses 68 basis points due primarily to higher sales. This helped offset a decline in gross profit rate due primarily to a 53 basis point or $113 million inflation-related LIFO charge.\nFor the quarter, Sam's operating income increased more than 18% with fuel and nearly 8% excluding fuel and including the impact of the LIFO charge.\nCombining these results with my comments about International, you can see Sam's Club is performing well around the world, and we're pleased with the leverage we see across markets with Member's Mark as an example.\nAs we navigate changes to our external environment, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives that were enabled by our omnichannel retail capabilities. Globally, as we're building a larger e-commerce business, we're scaling our Marketplace which unlocks and strengthens our fulfillment and advertising businesses and expands the number of families that choose to be members.\nAcross our segments, e-commerce is enabling deeper engagement with customers and members that helps drive strategic growth in our alternative value streams. New sellers in our U.S. Marketplace are contributing to our advertising growth and we added more than 8,000 sellers in Q3.\nThird-party build-out helps diversify and strengthen our product assortment, which now includes more than 370 million SKUs.\nStrong digital advertising growth continued this quarter, increasing over 30% on a global basis, led by 40% growth in Walmart Connect in the U.S. and Flipkart Ads in India.\nAs we focus on membership, our ability to leverage our data improves, so we continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering, Walmart Luminate, and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow. We gained some of these new Walmart+ members after expanding our last mile delivery capabilities through a fourfold increase since January and the number of pickup points serviced by the Spark Driver platform.\nWe're making good progress in fulfillment and automation. The Spark Driver platform now serves customers in all 50 states for more than 10,000 pickup points with the ability to reach 84% of all U.S. households. This coverage includes a growing revenue stream from businesses utilizing Walmart GoLocal. Our delivery-as-a-service offering, has already made over 1 million deliveries since launching last year.\nBuilding Walmart fulfillment services in the U.S., Mexico and now also in Canada has been an important asset in growing our seller base as they seek an integrated omni sales and fulfillment solution. For example, almost 30% of orders on Walmex' marketplace are now being fulfilled using Walmart fulfillment services which was launched a year ago.\nIn September, we opened a next-gen fulfillment center in Illinois. This 1.1 million square foot facility features robotics, machine learning and automated storage, resulting in increased productivity and a better service for our customers at faster delivery times.\nAnd last week, we acquired Alert Innovation as we expand our market fulfillment center build-out. MFCs are positioned inside or attached to Walmart supercenters and use robotics and AI to fill online orders more quickly. We're putting the building blocks in place to deliver powerful, mutually reinforcing ecosystem that not only benefits customers and partners, but also shareholders, with more durable and diversified earnings streams.\nTurning to guidance. In this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we are well equipped to continue gaining market share in an environment where consumers need to stretch their dollars further. We will continue to advocate for customers and work with our supplier partners to maintain strong price gaps and deliver lower relative pricing versus competitors. We're also navigating real inflation on our own cost structure and continue to seek ways to reduce cost and improve leverage potential.\nWith these considerations in mind, we're maintaining a balanced approach to our guidance, incorporating a cautious view on the consumer together with our confidence in our ability to execute. We're updating fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the Q3 upside and leaving our sales and profit assumptions for Q4 unchanged. Despite a good start to Q4, our guidance assumes that the consumer could slow spending, especially in general merchandise categories, given persistent inflationary pressures in food and consumables. Our guidance provides flexibility to compete in a promotional environment, accounts for pricing action to reduce remaining excess inventory and anticipates ongoing mix pressure.\nFor Q4, we expect net sales growth of about 3%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S., with food and consumables growth continuing to outpace general merchandise. We expect year-over-year operating income within a range of a 1% increase to a 1% decrease. And adjusted EPS is expected to decrease 3% to 5%, including higher year-over-year tax and interest expenses.\nFor the full year, incorporating the Q3 upside, we now expect net sales growth of about 5.5%, including comp sales growth of 5.5% for Walmart U.S. On an adjusted basis, we expect operating income to decline 6.5% to 7.5% and EPS to decline 6% to 7%. Excluding the effect of divestitures and on an adjusted basis, this would translate into net sales growth of 6.5% and a decline in operating income of 5.5% to 6.5% and a decline in EPS of 5% to 6%.\nLooking beyond Q4, we know some of the unanticipated costs experienced this year shouldn't repeat next year. That said, we're planning our business with the assumption that inflation remains somewhat elevated. In addition, we've had significant currency headwinds this year. Based on year-to-date results and current FX rates, we estimate a year-over-year sales headwind for this fiscal year of $4.1 billion from currency and a potential sales headwind of about $3 billion next year.\nAlso, as we've had $236 million in LIFO charges this year at Sam's Club, we're likely to experience LIFO charges in Walmart U.S. as well next year. Based on current assumptions, these LIFO charges next year for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club could approximate roughly $1 billion of gross profit headwind. It's important to note that inflation, inventory levels and additional factors that are challenging to predict will influence the aggregate amount. We're committed to providing you ongoing updates to the assumptions as we report our quarterly results.\nAnd with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",

Welcome to the Walmart Fiscal Year 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Dan, you may begin.\n\nDaniel Thomas Binder\n\nSVP of IR, Walmart Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; John David Rainey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club.\nIn a few moments, Doug and John David will provide you an update on the business and discuss second quarter results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session.\nBefore I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.\n\nC. Douglas McMillon\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Walmart Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. A few weeks ago, we updated you on our expectations for how we would perform in Q2 and for the year.\nThe second quarter finished stronger than we had anticipated, and John David will touch on that in a moment and provide more detail for the back half of the year. Our sales were well ahead of plan, with inflation lifting our average transaction size, but we know that the amount and persistence of inflation is negatively affecting many families.\nFrom the U.S. to Mexico to Canada to Chile, they're prioritizing how they spend their money. We're pleased to see more families from a variety of income levels choose us as they look for value. Our purpose is to save people money and help them live better, and that's especially important right now.\nAfter the first quarter, we shared how the environment had changed. The cost of food and fuel, a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables and excess inventory in general merchandise categories, were among the most challenging items for us at the time. As we move through Q2, food inflation continued to tick up, and we continue to see a heavier mix of sales in food and consumables in many of our markets, and that put pressure on margins overall.\nFood comps in the U.S. were up mid-teens for the quarter, with units in food slightly negative and about flat exiting the quarter even with double-digit inflation. Another weight on margins has been the number of markdowns we've taken. Starting back in March, we knew we needed to act quickly and aggressively in some categories, and we have. We've made good progress to reduce inventory levels where we focused and taken markdowns. The aggressive approach we took to move through apparel, in particular, put financial pressure on us, but it helped relieve pressure on our stores and through our supply chain.\nWe're making good progress to reduce costs. We've reduced the number of shipping containers in our system, for example, by more than half from the Q1 level and are now much closer to our historical averages. We're also managing pricing to reflect our fully landed costs. The merchants are adjusting by category to reflect where we expect demand to be.\nWe had our U.S. store manager meeting last week. And amongst other topics, we shared examples of items where we're holding prices down or rolling them back. Those tend to be opening price point, private brand, food and consumables items. We want to help families put meals on the table with great value in our other private brands to relieve the pressure they're feeling. The quality, value and convenience we offer makes Walmart a smart choice, and we're seeing more middle- and higher-income shoppers choose us.\nAs I've been in U.S. stores recently, I'm pleased how we've executed back-to-school. As we finish it off in some markets, we've transitioned back-to-college in the appropriate stores with items like mini refrigerators, floor-length mirrors and futons. In July, I got to visit our associates in India. After visits to Flipkart, Myntra and PhonePe, a Flipkart fulfillment center and a kirana to see how they're using PhonePe, I left even more excited about what's happening in these businesses and what's to come.\nHaving visited several of our international markets this year, I'm pleased by how connected we are now and how so much of what we're building is common across markets as we scale Marketplace businesses and fulfillment, advertising and financial services and take steps to make a bigger difference in health care.\nAs I look ahead, I expect a strong finish to the back-to-school season, and we'll quickly transition to the holidays. Our fall and holiday products look great. There's a lot of newness, and we've got a strong position in opening price points across categories. From Halloween to Christmas to Flipkart's Big Billion Days, we'll be ready. We'll have a cleaner inventory position and we'll have a strong seasonal presence. We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make, and we're adjusting to that reality so we can help them more.\nRegardless of the inflation level and as we work through the places we have too much inventory, we continue to make progress on our strategy. We're becoming more digital, even more relevant as an omnichannel retailer; and the related businesses, like fulfillment and advertising, continue to grow. We're building a different business, and we're making progress.\nLet's move on to our operating segments. I'll start with Walmart U.S. The strong comps we see in food and consumables are leading to market share gains. Pickup and delivery are strong. Growth is improving on Walmart.com, including the Marketplace, and more people are choosing to be a Walmart+ member or step up to InHome.\nWalmart+ is an important component of our plan, and we announced the addition of a streaming benefit. Walmart+ members will receive a Paramount+ subscription at no additional cost as part of their Walmart+ membership in September. The premium streaming service offers a broad content offering with original series, movies, family shows and live sports. We're excited about the coming launch, and we know our members will be, too.\nBeyond membership, the team is also working on getting items to customers faster, while lowering the cost of delivery through a significant increase in the number of orders fulfilled by stores. We've increased this volume by nearly 40% from a year ago. Speed matters, whether it's how quickly we get items to customers or how quickly we scale new businesses. Our white-label delivery platform service, Walmart GoLocal, will celebrate its 1-year anniversary later this month. Powered by our Spark Driver platform, I'm excited about the growth I've seen so far and the expectations looking ahead. We passed 1 million deliveries so far with GoLocal. We expect to have about 5,000 pickup locations by year-end and client satisfaction scores are strong. We continue to sign up larger scale customers, and we're making strides on the bigger unlock, which are small- and medium-sized businesses.\nOur technology and expertise will help so many of these businesses grow while contributing to our operating margins over time. Advertising is also performing well. In Walmart U.S., the Walmart Connect team continues to deliver more value to the suppliers and sellers who advertise with us.\nImprovements to search and our large first-party shopper data have led to performance improvements for our advertisers, both year-over-year and sequentially. We've seen the number of active advertisers investing with us increased 121% over last year. Even more encouraging, these improvements have supported the overall site experience for our customers by helping them find the right products or discover new ones that are most relevant to them. As you've heard us say before, advertising is a global priority for us. We continue to see strong growth in markets outside the U.S., like India and Mexico.\nTurning to Sam's Club in the U.S. Comp sales were strong again for Q2, up 10%, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth. Similar to Walmart, gross profit was pressured for the quarter on higher-than-normal markdown activity to clear through excess inventory. We'll continue to make progress as we move through Q3, and we'll be in good shape as we enter the holiday season. We like what we see in terms of membership. Total accounts are up about 9% over last year, and the penetration of Plus members continues to climb.\nMoving on to Walmart International, where we performed well again in Q2, with sales up nearly 10%, including double-digit comps in the 3 largest markets of Mexico, Canada and China. We're also accelerating our digital businesses, including strong eCommerce growth over the last 2 years. Mexico is up 31%; Canada, 32%; and China, 152%.\nWe see this growth even as customers choose to do more in-person shopping. It really shows the power of operating across multiple channels. Like the U.S., we see the effects of inflation come through in how people are shopping. In Mexico, we saw all formats perform well, and Bodega was especially strong with comps above the overall Walmex average. We widened our price gaps for Bodega by 140 basis points in Q2, and we're seeing more customers shopping this format.\nWhile inflation remains high, most of our markets are growing comps ahead of inflation. I'm proud that we're helping families access the things they need at more affordable prices. I'll close today by thanking our associates for all they do every day to support our customers and members. I'd also like to welcome John David for his first earnings call with us.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to him.\n\nJohn David Rainey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Walmart Inc.\n\nThanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong sales quarter. We're moving a lot of volume through our business, and I'm proud of how our associate team has responded in serving customers as we manage through this unique period.\nWe delivered strong top line growth with total constant currency revenue up more than 9% in the second quarter. Sales were strong across all segments, particularly in food and consumables. Customers are increasingly choosing Walmart to help them save money as they deal with broad inflationary pressures.\nAs we navigate the current environment, we know that we're not immune to large macroeconomic shifts. We're facing similar cost pressures that others are seeing related to excess inventory, fuel prices and supply chain. But our business model is structurally sound and our market position is strong. As the year has progressed, we've seen more pronounced consumer shifts and trade-down activity.\nAs an example, instead of deli meats at higher price points, customers are increasing purchases of hot dogs as well as canned tuna or chicken. Private brand penetration has also inflected higher. And in food category, specifically the private brand growth rate doubled compared to Q1 levels. We'll continue to manage pricing for customers in a way that preserves our price gaps and allows us to earn market share profitably.\nWe've been very focused on managing controllable costs and consequently achieved expense leverage across all 3 segments in Q2, even though we haven't fully lapped the wage investments implemented last year. During the quarter, we also made progress reducing inventory, managing prices to reflect certain supply chain costs and inflation and reducing storage costs associated with the backlog of shipping containers.\nWe're encouraged by the initial steps taken by some suppliers to help us reduce product acquisition costs. We've taken similar steps to manage our support and overhead cost, too, and we're achieving significant savings in procurement of goods not for resale. In our stores and fulfillment and distribution centers, we've seen labor productivity metrics improve. We're finding efficiencies and reducing expenses while still focusing on operational excellence.\nI want to spend a moment discussing inventory. As a backdrop, the shifts that we've seen in consumer behavior through the pandemic, shifting from in-store to online, along with big swings in the purchase of goods versus services and then the reversion back to pre-pandemic norms, have been sharp and difficult to predict. These trends have been exacerbated by inflationary pressure on the consumer that many of us have not experienced in our lifetime, the effect of which has recently changed consumption patterns in certain categories for us, notably general merchandise.\nThe result of all of this put pressure on our inventory levels that peaked in the last quarter. Importantly, the team has a deep understanding of our inventory levels and content and have made a lot of progress during the last quarter. In-stock levels have improved about 250 basis points since Q1 in our grocery business alone, despite the heavy sales volumes we're experiencing.\nWe also made progress selling through excess inventory, especially in hardline categories. At the end of Q2, Walmart U.S. inventory growth was 26% versus last year, reflecting over 750 basis points of improvement from Q1 levels. Notably, about 40% of the year-over-year increase relates to inflation.\nGeneral merchandise inventory growth rates are down more than 15 percentage points from Q1, but still with more work to do. We've cleared most summer seasonal inventory, but we are still focused on reducing exposure to other areas such as electronics, home and sporting goods.\nWe've also canceled billions of dollars in orders to help align inventory levels with expected demand. We estimate that only about 15% of our total inventory growth in Q2 is still above optimal levels, and our actions in Q3 will allow us to make significant progress toward rationalizing absolute levels and mix, which will enable our stores to be well positioned ahead of the holiday season.\nDespite the short-term challenges we're facing this year, we continue to advance our flywheel strategy and diversify our income streams. For example, the global advertising business grew nearly 30% in Q2, led by Walmart Connect and Flipkart, as new advertisers turn to Walmart to deepen relationships with customers.\nWe now have over 240 million items in our U.S. eCommerce assortment, and our Marketplace seller count has increased about 60% year-over-year. We continue to sign on more customers to our data ventures offering and the number of Walmart+ memberships continues to grow.\nWe're also excited about the build-out of automation and technology throughout our business and how it will continue to help drive greater efficiency. Through my first couple of months here, I've been able to get out and visit our stores and see our distribution and fulfillment centers and witness the supply chain automation and technology that we're putting in our stores and centers. One example is the VizPick technology that we've rolled out to our associates across U.S. stores. This tool uses augmented reality to speed the inventory management process, enabling associates to get needed product from the backroom to the sales floor more efficiently. This not only saves associate time, but also helps avoid missing sales through side counter out-of-stocks. It's a win-win.\nIn summary, our business is resilient. And with the omni capabilities we've built, we're better positioned now than we were in prior periods of economic softness. Now let's get to some additional Q2 financial details.\nAs mentioned previously, each of our segments delivered strong sales growth. Walmart U.S. comp sales accelerated to 6.5% growth, reflecting strong grocery sales at a higher average ticket size. International constant currency sales were up 9.9% with strength in Mexico, Canada and China, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered comps of 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco. Consolidated gross margin rate decreased 132 basis points, reflecting increased markdowns and unfavorable mix shifts in our U.S. businesses. Sam's Club gross profit was also negatively affected by a LIFO charge due to higher inflation. On the expense side, selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 45 basis points, helped by higher sales, partially offset by the U.S. wage investments implemented last year.\nOperating income decreased 6.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.77. Two discrete items positively affected our results. Operating income benefited from a favorable insurance settlement of $173 million during the quarter. Adjusted EPS also benefited from this as well as a $182 million special dividend from one of our equity investments. Operating cash flow was $9.2 billion, reflecting lower operating income, higher inventory amounts due in part to inflation and the timing of certain payments.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase. Through Q2, we are ahead of pace on our original share repurchase plan for this year and now expect to repurchase $10 billion to $11 billion in shares for fiscal year 2023.\nNow let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales momentum continued, with growth excluding fuel of 11.7% on a 2-year stack. Food sales were especially strong with mid-teens growth while general merchandise sales were soft, particularly in electronics, apparel and home.\nTransactions increased 1%, while average ticket increased 5.5%. We were pleased to see eCommerce sales growth improve sequentially, up 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 18% on a 2-year stack. SG&A expenses leveraged 21 basis points, reflecting higher sales and lower COVID costs, partially offset by the wage investments.\nThe team did a nice job pivoting the expense structure, so the scheduling challenges from Q1 did not repeat. Gross margin pressure led to a decline in operating income of about 7%. International had another really good quarter. Sales were strong, up 9.9% in constant currency.\nCurrency headwinds negatively affected reported sales results by about $1 billion. Each of our major markets delivered positive comp sales, with Mexico and China leading the way. eCommerce sales on a constant currency basis grew 15% on top of strong gains last year. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 11%, with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew 18%. The team is doing a good job reinforcing our price message and positioning, as customers manage through this inflationary period.\nIn China, comp sales were up more than 14%, with strong growth in eCommerce sales, which increased 77% in the quarter and more than 150% on a 2-year stack. eCommerce penetration continues to climb in both our Sam's Clubs and hypermarket stores, as customers increasingly choose omni solutions to meet their shopping needs.\nCanada comp sales increased more than 10%, even as higher levels of inflation are starting to pressure consumer spending in discretionary and general merchandise categories. Flipkart continues to meet our expectations, and the team is gearing up for Big Billion Days. I traveled to India last month and was impressed by how the Flipkart and PhonePe teams are innovating for the customer and driving growth.\nPhonePe continued to see strong growth with annualized TPV of over $830 billion, reaching a record level of monthly transactions of about 3.1 billion. International operating income in constant currency increased more than 28%, partially attributable to the previously mentioned insurance recovery for prior operational disruptions in Chile.\nSam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of more than 20% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 9.8%. eCommerce sales grew 25%, with strong contributions from both curbside and ship-to-home orders. Membership income was up nearly 9%, with another record high quarter in overall member counts and continued growth in Plus member penetration.\nSam's added more new members in Q2 than any other quarter in recent years, benefiting from membership campaigns. Sam's leveraged expenses 131 basis points, including fuel and 72 basis points excluding fuel, due primarily to higher sales and lower COVID costs. But gross margins were down as elevated markdowns, supply chain and fulfillment cost and a 70 basis point inflation-related LIFO charge pressured profitability. As a result, operating income declined about 35%.\nNow let's turn to guidance. With the updated financial guidance we released last month, we outlined the pressures that led us to take a more conservative outlook for the current year profitability. Let me take a minute to provide you with more detail. When we provided guidance 3 months ago, we didn't expect food and fuel inflation to accelerate to the levels that we experienced in Q2. In fact, Walmart U.S. food inflation was up double digits year-over-year, and we saw a nearly 400 basis points step-up as the quarter progressed compared to levels at the end of Q1. The rising cost for essential items and customers' reprioritization of spending led to significant mix shifts in our business.\nGrocery sales mix increased nearly 300 basis points, whereas general merchandise sales mix decreased more than 350 basis points. This resulted in additional general merchandise markdowns in our U.S. business, particularly in apparel at a time when inventory clearance was already higher than expected in the industry. Higher fuel prices also pressured our supply chain expense. We finished the quarter on a strong note, however, and ahead of our updated Q2 guidance provided last month, and the Q3 back-to-school season is off to a solid start. Contributing factors to the better performance included strong sales at the end of the month, with good flow-through to the bottom line and lower-than-expected supply chain cost.\nWe're taking additional pricing actions in Q3 to improve inventory levels in the back half of the year, and we built in more conservative category mix assumptions within our guidance. Our sales and profit view reflects trends we've seen year-to-date as well as the uncertainty around inflation and consumer spending in the coming quarters.\nWe've updated our fiscal year '23 guidance to reflect the better Q2 results versus the guidance we provided in July. We continue to believe the sales and profit guidance we provided at the time for the back half of the year appropriately reflects elevated uncertainty in this environment and is our best view of expected performance.\nFor Q3, we expect net sales growth of about 5%, including comp sales growth of about 3% for Walmart U.S. We're expecting operating income to decline 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS to decline 9% to 11%. For fiscal year '23, we expect net sales growth of about 4.5%, including comp sales growth of about 4% for Walmart U.S. We expect adjusted operating income and EPS to decline 9% to 11%. Excluding the effect of divestitures, this would translate into net sales growth of 5.5% and a decline in adjusted operating income and EPS of 8% to 10%.\nBefore I close, I'd like to share my perspective as someone that is new to Walmart in meeting many of you for the first time. I'm excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Certainly, retail broadly is being pressured right now, but that shouldn't detract from the incredible opportunity that we have in front of us. It starts with our mission of helping people save money so they can live better. We do that every day at a scale that is unmatched by helping people be able to buy the things that they want and they need.\nThis mission permeates our culture in everything that we do. I've joined an exceptional leadership team. Their history of operational excellence, their strategy, the drive to win is simply something that I wanted to be a part of. And you combine that with the resources we have and the investments we're making in things like supply chain automation, improving our eCommerce capabilities and diversifying our portfolio with higher-margin products and services like data and advertising that will result in more durable earnings streams as they scale.\nWe have the potential to not only be relevant in the next chapter of retail but help define it. And when we execute on these things, we have the ability to appreciably increase our shareholder value over time. I believe that some of the best days of Walmart are in front of us.\nI look forward to working with you, and now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you.",

Welcome to Walmart's Fiscal Year 2023 First Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the conference over to Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Dan, you may begin.\n\nDaniel Thomas Binder\n\nSVP of IR, Walmart Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Kath McLay, President and CEO of Sam's Club. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss first quarter results, that will be followed by our question-and-answer session.\nBefore I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.\n\nC. Douglas McMillon\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Walmart Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us to hear about our results. We had a good quarter from a top line point of view. Sale for the period were ahead of what we expected across all segments, and we're pleased with the momentum we see so far in Q2. The bottom line was below our expectations due primarily to 3 areas that negatively affected operating income in our U.S. businesses, both in Walmart and Sam's Club. Each of these items represents about 1/3 of our overall profit miss.\nThe first item is wage expense. As the Omicron variant case count declined rapidly in the first half of the quarter, more of our associates that were out on COVID leave came back to work faster than we expected. We hired more associates at the end of last year to cover for those on leave, so we ended up with weeks of overstaffing. That issue was resolved during the quarter, primarily through attrition.\nThe second item relates to our general merchandise inventory level, primarily in Walmart U.S. GM was a lower percentage of total sales in Q1, resulting in an unfavorable gross margin mix. We also had higher costs for containers and storage, and we've taken and are taking steps to contain those cost pressures to the first half of this year.\nThe third item is related to fuel costs in our supply chain. So those are the 3 items. And now I'll share more detail on each to help provide clarity.\nAs for wages and staffing in the U.S., we had nearly all associates on COVID leave return in February. We expected the Omicron to be steep on the backside, but given that we needed more associates to cover in January, it just took some time over March and April to get wage costs in line with sales. We're now staffed in a way that supports our top line performance. As it relates to Walmart U.S. general merchandise sales, we knew that we were up against stimulus dollars from last year, but the rate of inflation in food pulled more dollars away from GM than we expected as customers needed to pay for the inflation in food. We like the fact that our inventory is up because so much of it is needed to be in stock on our side counters, but a 32% increase is higher than we want. We'll work through most or all of the excess inventory over the next couple of quarters.\nWe started being aggressive with rollbacks in apparel, for example, during Q1. Even with reduced prices, the apparel margin can still be helpful to our overall mix. As we managed the quarter, we generally passed on cost increases from suppliers at the category cost of goods level, but fuel costs accelerated during the quarter faster than we were able to pass them through creating a timing issue. Fuel ran over $160 million higher for the quarter in the U.S. than we forecasted. We made progress matching pricing to the increased costs as the quarter progressed. And while we expect some gross margin pressure in Q2, we expect an improvement over Q1. We're not happy with the profit performance for the quarter, and we've taken action, especially in the latter part of the quarter on cost negotiations, staffing levels and pricing while also managing our price gaps.\nWhile we've experienced high levels of inflation in our international markets over the years, U.S. inflation being this high and moving so quickly, both in food and general merchandise is unusual. We'll control what we can control, reduce our inventory level and keep prices as low as we can, especially on opening price point food items while improving our profit performance. Inflation is playing a role in the top and bottom line and the pace of change created a timing issue for us in Q1. We're adjusting to the mix change and operational costs.\nImportantly, we expect the solid top line performance to continue, and we're taking up sales guidance for the year. Customers and members are coming to us for value. I'd like to highlight our international team and their performance. We had strong top line performance and managed the quarter very well across the markets. Our biggest international pressure point is related to the COVID lockdowns in China, which created operational and financial pressure. Our teams did a great job of pivoting to serve customers and members through delivery. They stepped up as stores and clubs closed and demand for delivery spiked. Overall, the International segment had another good quarter.\nWe're making progress executing our strategy. The flywheel we're building is better for customers and members and the more diversified approach to profitability is making the company stronger. We're excited about our newer businesses and our plans to automate much of the supply chain. We're committed to our 4% top line growth and greater than 4% profit growth algorithm. Our strategy and mid- to long-term financial plans support that despite the turbulence we're managing through today.\nGlobally, we continue to build new mutually reinforcing businesses as we grow in areas like marketplace, that leads to growth in fulfillment services and advertising income. Our B2C relationships lead to complementary B2B relationships, which strengthen our P&L. The number of marketplace sellers we have continues to grow, and growth in Walmart Connect and Flipkart ads was strong for the quarter. Walmart GoLocal continues to add new partners for our delivery platform, and we've now reached more than 1,600 delivery points in the U.S. We recently increased the Walmart Plus benefit for fuel to up to $0.10 and expanded the number of participating fuel locations to more than 14,000 including Exxon and mobile stations.\nOur health and wellness work continues. In the U.S., we announced an expansion of Walmart Health into Florida with the opening of [40] locations and 1 more on the way. In India, the launch of Flipkart Health Plus, following our acquisition of online pharmacy platform, SastaSundar.com is enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. The team recently launched the Flipkart Health Plus app which is available on low bandwidth, so it's usable for more people in more cities.\nAnd in Canada, we're growing our number of primary care clinics to 87 and in partnership with TELUS Health, we'll launch digital pharmacy services. We're also making progress with financial services. In India, PhonePe recently processed more than 100 million transactions in a single day, with annualized total payment value of about $770 billion. It's one of the fastest-growing businesses in this space.\nI also like what we're doing in Mexico with our digital wallet, Cashi. In the U.S., through our JV with River Capital, we completed the acquisitions of 2 FinTech businesses, 1 finance in (inaudible) and combined those businesses under the one brand. Around the world, we can help our customers and members transact seamlessly, digitally and help them strengthen their lives financially.\nNow I'll briefly comment on each segment before adds additional detail. In Walmart U.S., our sales performance was ahead of plan, and we continued to gain share in grocery. Inflation is lifting the average ticket, and our transaction count in stores went up slightly versus last year. Overall basket size is up, as you would expect, but units per basket are down a bit. Price leadership is especially important right now and one-stop shopping becomes more than just convenience, people are paying over $4 a gallon for fuel. Overall, eCommerce growth increased about 1% for the quarter. We're making progress on the eCommerce experience as in-stock improves, and the team continues to improve on the app and site experience, delivery accuracy and speed.\nOur eCommerce operations were affected early in the quarter as we lost one of our largest fulfillment centers to a fire, which created some cost inefficiencies for us. The buildings were destroyed, but thankfully and most importantly, no one was hurt. The loss did put strain on our system, however. The team quickly reacted to utilize our stores and spread volume to our other FCs to fulfill eCommerce orders. I'm proud of the team for moving so quickly to keep orders flowing to our customers.\nMoving to Sam's Club U.S., we continue to drive strong comp sales on a 1- and 2-year basis with strength across most categories. Transactions were up in Q1, overall membership count continued to grow, Plus member penetration reached another all-time high, and we saw good growth in eCommerce. Profitability was negatively affected by the areas I mentioned earlier.\nWalmart International continues to build on the momentum from last year with strong comp sales across markets and strong growth in eCommerce. I've visited our teams and stores in Mexico and Canada since the first of the year. the progress they're making on building out our flywheel capabilities is impressive. From financial services and health care that I mentioned earlier to marketplace expansion and advertising, the teams are moving quickly. Also like the example from Mexico, where we have a MXN 200 per month unlimited Internet option that's helping customers access the benefits of the digital economy that would otherwise cost them 3x that price.\nIn summary, around the world, we're still living in environments with COVID present and navigating the economic and other impacts to deliver for customers and members. As always, our associates are doing a great job, and we're grateful to them. We continue to change and strengthen our company and position it for a strong future.\nThank you for your interest in our company. We hope to see you at our annual associate and shareholder celebration in a couple of weeks. As I turn it over to Brett, I want to pause and say a big thank you to him. Brett made significant contributions to our company in all parts of our business for many years. He has represented our associates, our investors and our company so well. His knowledge, astute judgment and character have made him a pleasure to work with. Thank you, partner.\nWith that, I give you Mr. Biggs.\n\nM. Brett Biggs\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Walmart Inc.\n\nThanks, Doug. In the first quarter, we faced some new challenges as well as some that were more pervasive than anticipated. Of course, we've been in a very fluid environment for more than 2 years, and I'm proud of the way the company has performed during that time. Q1 sales were strong across all segments and the strength has continued in the start of Q2, reinforcing Walmart wins with customers in even the most unique environments. The first quarter was one of the most challenging periods yet related to supply chain disruptions, increased costs and persistently high inflation. .\nThere are some things that were unique to the first quarter, like some labor scheduling inefficiency as U.S. associates returned more quickly than expected from COVID-19 leave and some things that will likely be more persistent than anticipated when we gave guidance to start the year. As Doug mentioned, during the quarter, particularly in the middle of the quarter, we weren't able to fully address or pass along some of the cost increases that impacted profit more than expected. We're now managing those costs and passing them along more effectively.\nThe costs related to inventory and fuel prices in the U.S. will strike some into Q2, but the scheduling related costs have been mitigated. Most of the increased inventory and related costs were related to buying over the past several quarters with a keen focus on in-stock and now we're in a short period of rightsizing it. The current sales strength and warmer weather in the U.S. give us confidence in our ability to work through this fairly quickly and strategically.\nOur market position is strong, and our business model was built to weather times like this when customers are making more real-time choices. We're there for them, and we'll continue to provide great value while managing the business in a way that's also good for shareholders. We'll continue to reduce costs where we can and manage pricing in a way that preserves competitive price gaps while managing the bottom line and passing on costs where they appear to be less temporary in nature.\nOur expectations for the top and bottom line growth algorithm remains structurally unchanged. As we navigate the current environment, we continue to make great progress building our flywheel and executing our long-term strategy. For example, the global advertising business grew over 30% in Q1. I'm excited about what is ahead and what it means for customers as we more actively engaged with them in different areas of their lives and deepen those relationships.\nNow let's get into some additional Q1 details. As a reminder, my comments today will exclude the effect of last year's international divestitures. We delivered strong top line results in the first quarter with total constant currency revenue up more than 6%, reflecting healthy growth in each segment. Walmart U.S. gained grocery market share and at higher average ticket despite lapping last year's significant benefits from U.S. stimulus. International was led by Mexico and Canada, while Sam's Club U.S. delivered the ninth executive quarter of double-digit comp growth, excluding fuel and tobacco.\nFirst quarter gross margin rate decreased 89 basis points versus last year due in part to pressure at Sam's Club from supply chain costs, fuel mix, inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate was down 38 basis points with more than 3/4 of the decline related to higher-than-expected supply chain, fuel and eCommerce fulfillment costs. While we did see some supply chain improvement early in the quarter, the war in Ukraine and ongoing COVID impacts in various parts of the world, including China led to increased challenges.\nWhile sales were ahead of plan in Q1, the category mix in the U.S. was heavier in food and consumables and spending shifted somewhat away from more discretionary items, including categories impacted by unseasonably cool weather such as apparel, patio furniture and landscaping supplies. We remain very bullish on our food and consumables business. Consumers are feeling inflation pressures as evidenced by an increase in grocery private brand penetration. The category mix shift, along with increased inventory, some of which was delayed in arriving led to higher-than-normal margins for general merchandise. In Q1, unexpected markdowns pressured Walmart U.S. gross profit by about $100 million. We expect the inventory position to improve as we go through Q2.\nSG&A expenses deleveraged 39 basis points, primarily due to increased U.S. wage costs, partially offset by lower total COVID costs versus last year. We expected higher labor costs at Walmart U.S. due to the hourly associate wage increase announced last year. As mentioned, Q1 profit declined more than expected with operating income down 20% and adjusted EPS down 20% to $1.30. Operating cash flow was also lower than expected at negative $3.8 billion. This is due to several factors, including: higher inventory amounts with about half of the increase due to inflation, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables due to inventory delays. Given our confidence in selling through the inventory, I feel confident about operating cash flow getting back on track as we go through the year.\nNow let's discuss segment results. Walmart U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 3% and were up 9% on 2-year stack, reflecting strong food sales, which were up low double digits. As mentioned previously, general merchandise sales were softer but still increased high single digits on a 2-year stack. Transactions were flat versus last year, while average ticket increased 3%. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year as customers continue returning to stores.\nWe're making strong progress in many of our newer higher-margin initiatives. The Walmart Connect advertising business continues to scale as we expand self-serve capabilities and offerings. Our new data monetization business, Walmart Luminate, continues to accelerate with over 75% growth quarter-over-quarter as more supplier partners collaborate with merchandisers to utilize new customer insights in our platform.\nWe also continue to expand our Walmart GoLocal delivery as a service business with new partnerships announced during Q1. In addition, we held grand openings of 4 new Walmart health centers in Florida and will open another 1 next month as we continue to expand access to affordable quality care.\nOne, our strategic fintech partnership with Ribbit Capital, closed on the ONE Finance and even transactions, which sets the foundation for growth. Collectively, these initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next several years. Gross margin pressure and expense deleverage led to a decline in operating income of about 18%. Inventory increased about 33% due to inflation and aggressive inventory buys over the past few quarters.\nInternational sales were strong, up 8% in constant currency, with Mexico and Canada leading the way. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 22% on top of strong gains last year with growth up 86% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales in Mexico increased 9%, with strong growth in stores as well as eCommerce sales, which grew nearly 20% in Q1 and 185% on a 2-year stack. In Canada, comp sales were 7.7%, while in China, growth was slower than it's expected, but comps still increased more than 4%, led by eCommerce growth of nearly 90%.\nFlipkart had another good sales quarter with solid trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also used with the strong growth of PhonePe with annualized TPV of over $750 billion as the team continues to launch new customer offers such as the recent expansion of insurance offerings to include health, auto and ATV coverage. International operating income at constant currency declined nearly 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit in China, reflecting increased markdowns and higher eCommerce penetration during the quarter as well as investments in eCommerce across the portfolio.\nSam's Club had another strong sales quarter with comp sales up 10.6%, excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of about 21% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 10% and ticket was slightly positive. eCommerce sales grew 22%. Membership income was up 10.5% with another record in member counts. Operating income was down 20% as the gross margin pressure I mentioned previously was partially offset by higher membership income, fuel profit and expense leverage.\nNow let's turn to guidance, which will be discussed ex divestitures. While we don't typically update guidance at the end of Q1, we felt it was appropriate given the current environment and the profit miss in Q1. We're behind for the year, but we're also just one quarter into the year with time and options in front of us. The team's focus is still on the original profit guidance. Based on our continuing strong top line, we feel good about our ability to deliver full year sales growth in excess of our original guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales growth, excluding divestitures, to be 4.5% to 5%. We expect Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of about 3.5% for the year versus the original guidance of slightly above 3%. However, as a result of the higher-than-anticipated costs we saw in Q1 and the expectation of some of that to continue, growing operating income on our original guidance and more than sales growth is challenging. We now expect operating income and EPS to be relatively flat year-on-year. As is our usual practice, we'll update you on our progress as we finish Q2. For Q2, we expect net sales growth of over 5%, including comp sales growth of 4% to 5% for Walmart U.S. As our confidence builds in our ability to manage cost increases more efficiently, operating income and EPS are expected to be flat to slightly up.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with the top line momentum we're seeing across the business. While Q1 profit was lower than expected, during this dynamic and challenging environment, I'm proud of how our teams continue to be laser-focused on serving customers and taking care of shareholders.\nNow we'd be happy to open up the call for your questions.",

Welcome to Walmart's Fiscal Year '22 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Dan Binder, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Dan, you may now begin.\n\nDaniel Thomas Binder\n\nSVP of IR, Walmart Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined by members of our executive team, including Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you an update on the business and discuss fourth quarter and full year results. That will be followed by our question-and-answer session.\nBefore I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements as well as our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.\n\nC. Douglas McMillon\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Walmart Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us to hear about our fourth quarter results. Let's jump right in. Our team delivered net sales growth of 7.6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.3% excluding divestitures. We continued to gain market share in food and consumables in the U.S., and comp transactions were positive. Consumer demand during the quarter was strong, and the team overcame a number of challenges in the U.S. and around the world to deliver these strong results.\nGoing into the quarter, we were confident that we had the people, the products and the prices to deliver and we did. Our inventory position improved, and we delivered high sell-throughs in seasonal categories across markets. Food, consumables and apparel were also strong globally. We comped low single digits in general merchandise in the U.S. against strong results last year. And Sam's Club saw broad-based strength across categories in the U.S. and in China. Our merchants are doing a nice job of navigating the pressure from cost of goods inflation with our customers and shareholders in mind.\nI like how we're mixing out the business. Consolidated gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the quarter, including more than 50 basis points in Walmart U.S. We're working closely with our suppliers to manage inflation, finding a few places where we can roll back prices, and we're paying close attention to how we manage our opening price point items. Q4 and the full year are proof points that we can keep our price gaps in the range where we want them, grow market share and deliver against our top and bottom line growth algorithm.\nOur associates did an amazing job of serving customers and members during this busy season even as we faced Omicron and supply chain challenges. This quarter's COVID leave peak was larger than anything we had experienced in 2020 or previously in 2021. We hired more associates than our plan called for to help fill that gap, which negatively impacted expenses but it was clearly needed. I'm grateful to our associates and store and club management teams for how they set priorities on behalf of our customers and members during the quarter.\nAs I visit stores and clubs, it's inspiring to see how our team is navigating such a fluid environment. They're delivering tremendous growth while making significant progress against our longer-term strategy. During the fiscal year just ended, excluding divestitures, we grew net sales by 9%, grew operating profit by 18%, invested $13 billion in CapEx to grow our business, returned $16 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends, grew our advertising business globally to $2.1 billion and took important steps to build our U.S. financial services capabilities with agreements to make 2 key acquisitions.\nSometimes it feels like 2020 and 2021 were just 1 long year. If you look at growth since the beginning of fiscal '21 through the end of fiscal '22, excluding divestitures, our company is about 17% larger in terms of revenue, 31% larger in terms of operating income. And globally, our percentage of digital sales grew from 6% to 13%. As the company grows, we're fueled by the new business model and flywheel we outlined last year. Our strategy is coming to life.\nEnsuring that we deliver our strategy is where I invest the majority of my time. It starts with the customer and earning primary destination. The big-basket stock-up trip is important. It's foundational to our relationship with families. We earn that shopping occasion by running great stores and clubs and offering seamless pickup and delivery experiences, including for our Walmart+ and InHome members in the U.S. Our membership offering, Walmart+, continues to be an important piece of what we're building.\nWe're adding capacity for pickup and delivery. We increased capacity by nearly 20% last year, and we expect to increase capacity by another 35% this year. For Walmart InHome, we recently announced an expansion of this membership service to make it available to about 30 million homes in the U.S., up from 6 million. To enable the expansion, we're creating roles for more than 3,000 associate delivery drivers. The majority of these roles will be filled by existing experienced associates. We'll be building out a fleet of all electric delivery vans to support our delivery services and our goal of a 0 emissions logistics fleet by 2040.\nOur flywheel is designed to serve families more broadly, deepening our relationship with them and creating a healthy mix of merchandise and services for our business. Recently, we shared some news about our fintech start-up in the U.S. that will operate under the ONE brand going forward. The combined talent of our JV leadership team and out of the pending acquisitions of ONE Finance and Even is impressive, and our plans are aggressive. We can help our customers and Walmart+ members save money, have an experience with less friction and help strengthen the financial position for millions of families.\nAs with our advertising business, our financial services capabilities cross borders. Our PhonePe business in India is growing incredibly fast, and we have strong capabilities in Mexico, which is such an important market for us.\nAs we look to improve the customer experience and strengthen the mix of our business, expanding our Marketplace is important. We added more than 20,000 new sellers to the platform in the U.S. last year and expect to add nearly 40,000 more this year. We're now up to nearly 170 million SKUs, and we're adding more every day. We opened up our U.S. Marketplace to sellers from India and created a dedicated team there to help sellers onboard and grow.\nMany sellers are looking to diversify their business, and they're pushing us to add capabilities, including the expansion of our fulfillment services. We grew our U.S. GMV delivered by our fulfillment services by 500% last year. We expect the robust growth will continue this year as we add more capacity. For Q4, our fulfillment services represented 44% of total Marketplace orders in India and 22% in Mexico.\nGrowing our Marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow and enhances our profit margins. Our plan for this year includes strengthening the experience for sellers and adding fulfillment capacity so customers have access to more items faster. It's clear to me that we have years of profitable Marketplace and fulfillment services growth ahead of us.\nStaying on the theme of fulfillment and scaling new businesses, we recently launched Walmart GoLocal, a last-mile delivery solution using our Spark Driver platform to help businesses of all sizes to reach more customers. GoLocal is making deliveries for The Home Depot and other large retailers, but I'm most excited about serving small local retailers. We have nearly 1,000 GoLocal service pickup points, and we expect to end this year closer to 5,000. This is good for customers, our clients and for us as we lower the cost per order by increasing the combined order size and the route density.\nAs we bring more customers, sellers and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those relationships. A great example is our advertising business. Globally, it's been growing at a high rate with high margins and is now a $2.1 billion business in only a few years, and we expect this strong growth to continue.\nAnd as our eCommerce business, including Marketplace, continues to grow, so will our advertising business. We're taking the learnings from the U.S. and India and growing in places like Mexico, Canada and Chile. Importantly, we're beginning to build tech platforms that can be leveraged in multiple countries. Our strong team of technologists and our digital transformation enable global synergies.\nWe see traction in our core business as well as in our newer businesses. There's real power in the ability to make these pieces mutually reinforcing, to design them such that one portion of a customer relationship leads them to another because it's easy and intuitive. Connecting B2B opportunities like advertising enables us to grow earnings and make key investments at the same time. Because of how the flywheel is coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth algorithm we discussed last year of about 4% top line growth and operating income growth rates higher than sales.\nWe've highlighted the increased costs we had in Q4 from COVID, supply chain and wages. And some of these costs are likely to continue through part of this year, but I feel confident in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to deliver the growth we expect. The Walmart we're building is becoming more impactful for our customers and members, more digital, more automated and more diversified on the top and bottom lines.\nNow let's move on to our performance by operating segment. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. The team had a great holiday season. They drove comp sales of 5.6%. You know about our strength in food and consumables, but despite the supply chain challenges, the seasonal hardlines execution for holiday looked good in stores. We're continuing to navigate cost pressures and in-stock challenges, but overall, I'm really proud of the team for delivering the holiday season. And I believe we'll work our way to an improved in-stock level through the course of the year.\nBuilding a seamless omnichannel experience for customers and prioritizing convenience for them is critical. Our stores have become hybrid. They're both stores and fulfillment centers. Last year, we increased the number of orders coming from our stores by 170% versus the previous year, and that's on top of more than 500% from the year before. Having inventory so close to so many customers is a competitive advantage. In some cases, we're getting items to customers in hours rather than days.\nIn Sam's Club U.S., the momentum continues. Sales and membership were strong. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comps were 10.8% for the quarter and nearly 26% on a 2-year stack. Membership income grew 9.1%, driven by membership count, which reached another record high during the quarter. The team leveraged operating expenses and grew operating income 24% excluding fuel. They had another fantastic quarter and year. Sam's continues to drive digital innovation and add capabilities. Our Bold & Blue club remodels and our strengthened pickup and delivery services will drive growth.\nAt Walmart International, we had another strong year with good progress in all aspects of the flywheel Overall, sales were strong again in Q4 with growth of 9.8% in constant currency excluding divestitures. China, Mexico and Flipkart led the way. Our 21% eCommerce penetration is a new record and up nearly 400 basis points from last year.\nWe get to serve a spectrum of holidays and festivals during the holiday quarter, from Diwali and Big Billion Days in India through to preparation for Chinese New Year. During Big Billion Days, 40% of sellers were first-time sellers on the Marketplace, and more than 100,000 kiranas participated by making last-mile deliveries. This is strong inclusive growth.\nWhile our omnichannel model gives the gift of time, access and affordability remain important. We're expanding our ecosystem, and we've made investments in areas such as health care, marketplace, telecommunications and our online food business. A few great examples include the launch of Flipkart Health+ that aims to increase access to affordable care in India and the acquisition of Foodmaestro in Canada to build more personalized shopping experiences for customers. And BAIT, our value-based Internet and telephone service that enables customers in Mexico to enjoy digital connectivity, surpassed 2 million members.\nIt's great to see all 3 of our operating segments doing so well. I'm grateful to our strong and capable leadership team and to all of our associates. We've had an incredible couple of years during these challenging times. We have momentum in the business. We have aggressive plans, and we're executing on the strategy. It still feels like we're just getting started.\nI'll now turn it over to Brett.\n\nM. Brett Biggs\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Walmart Inc.\n\nThanks, Doug. We wrapped up another great year with a strong fourth quarter and good momentum as we start the new year. Over the last couple of years, each quarter has presented unique challenges but I'm proud of how we've navigated each one of those. The fourth quarter was no different as we faced the rise of Omicron with its impact on the supply chain and our associates. This resulted in some significant unexpected expenses, but despite that, we delivered the top and bottom line results we expected.\nWe continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to fulfill the vision we outlined last February. U.S. flywheel is accelerating and is evident through initiatives like our pending fintech JV acquisitions, the launch of a new data business and acceleration of last-mile delivery. Sam's growth in membership income has been strong throughout the year as we expand omni options, including Club Pickup. These and other key initiatives represent large revenue and profit opportunities over the next few years.\nFor the full year, we had record sales of $568 billion with increased traffic to stores and clubs while eCommerce penetration approached 13%. Walmart U.S. grew sales by more than $23 billion and saw strong market share gains in food and consumables. Over the past 2 years, our U.S. segments have grown sales by $67 billion or 17% and operating income by 25%.\nNow let's discuss Q4 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestiture significantly affect year-over-year comparisons so my comments today will exclude the effect of divestitures. Total constant-currency revenue grew 7.9% to over $153 billion and reached another important milestone with quarterly net sales exceeding $150 billion.\nConsolidated gross margin rate increased 5 basis points with Walmart U.S. gross margin rate increasing by a healthy 54 basis points, reflecting primarily price management resulting from cost increases and mix along with benefits from a growing advertising business, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Supply chain costs were over $400 million higher than expected, but we expect some of those costs to abate over time. International gross margin rates were lower due primarily to format mix.\nSG&A expenses deleveraged 19 basis points as increased U.S. wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower COVID costs versus last year. Although COVID costs were lower than last year, we had significantly higher associate leave costs in the U.S. than anticipated. In the first 3 quarters combined, COVID leave costs were about $600 million but increased over $450 million just in Q4, presenting an unexpected headwind of over $300 million. Despite these expense challenges, adjusted operating income increased more than 6% and EPS increased more than 9%.\nWe're in a great financial position, enabling us to allocate capital towards both growth and shareholder returns. Free cash flow was $11.1 billion for the year, down versus last year due primarily to inventory build throughout the year, higher CapEx and cost increases. We increased share repurchases significantly this year with buybacks of just under $10 billion, a pace we plan to continue or increase in the coming year given our view of the long-term value of the company. In addition, we announced the 49th consecutive annual dividend increase this morning. ROI increased 90 basis points to just under 15%, the best level in 5 years due primarily to growth in operating income.\nNow let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had its first ever $100 billion-plus sales quarter with sales of $105 billion. Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a 2-year stack. We continue to grow grocery market share as food comps increased high single digits while health and wellness, apparel, seasonal and automotive categories were also strong. Transactions were up more than 3% despite COVID pressures.\neCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains last year, resulting in a 70% 2-year stack. We continue to see elevated levels of cost inflation and have taken prudent steps to manage pricing while having slightly wider price gaps than pre pandemic. We have a good balance of growing market share while managing price with both customers and shareholders in mind.\nWe continue to make strong progress in some of our newer higher-margin initiatives. Walmart Connect advertising experienced robust sales growth this year with a strong pipeline of new advertisers and large growth opportunities ahead. In fact, the number of active advertisers using Walmart Connect grew more than 130% year-over-year. And about half of the ad sales came from automated channels in Q4, more than double last year. We expect Walmart Connect to continue to scale over the next few years with plans to become a top 10 ad business in the midterm.\nGrowing eCommerce Marketplace at WFS have been a priority over the past couple of years as we've invested to expand fulfillment capacity, introduce new services for sellers and double the number of items available for customers. In fact, we expect to have over 200 million items in our eCommerce assortment by the end of the year. The expansion of WFS has also been a key unlock in bringing more sellers to Walmart's Marketplace.\nCustomers increasingly want home delivery, and we had a sixfold increase in delivery in the fourth quarter versus pre-pandemic levels. We continue expanding capabilities, including announcing the acceleration of InHome delivery to 30 million households by year-end. We also announced our new fintech business, ONE, in January with the pending acquisitions of fintech platforms One Finance and Even.\nSG&A expenses deleveraged 95 basis points as increased wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower total COVID-related expenses year-over-year. Still, as I mentioned earlier, COVID leave costs were much higher than expected. Operating income grew slightly, aided by strong margins as well as solid growth in membership and other income. Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix and higher-than-normal in-transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock.\nInternational sales were strong, up nearly 10%, led by China, Mexico and Flipkart as seasonal events, omni growth and good inventory position contributed to results. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 21% on top of strong gains last year with growth of more than 75% on a 2-year stack. China comps increased nearly 20% in constant currency with continued strength from Sam's Clubs as well as more than 90% growth in eCommerce sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 8% and grew faster than the market according to ANTAD.\nFlipkart had another good sales quarter, aided by strong holiday events and favorable trends in monthly active customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe with TPV of more than 130% versus last year, with a current run rate of $650 billion. In Canada, comp sales were up 4.6%, led by in-store shopping, and comps increased more than 13% on a 2-year stack. International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs, partly offset by gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam's China and eCommerce. For the full year, International adjusted operating income grew 12.7%, and we feel confident about our international business as we head into the new year.\nSam's Club had another impressive quarter with comps up 10.8% excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of nearly 26% on a 2-year stack. Transactions increased 7% and ticket was up 3.2%. eCommerce sales grew 21%, and we expanded the rollout of delivery capabilities of digital orders to nearly all clubs during the quarter. Sam's is leveraging Walmart's GoLocal last-mile delivery service to provide more convenience to members. Membership income was up more than 9% with another record in member counts and strong Plus penetration. Operating income was up 41% as higher fuel and membership income as well as strong expense leverage were partially offset by gross margin pressure from inflation and supply chain costs.\nNow let's turn to guidance. We feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and believe we can deliver full year growth in FY '23 that aligns with the growth algorithm we discussed last year. As you saw in Q4, we're still challenged with increased costs related to COVID and supply chain disruptions. Our guidance assumes that we will see some relief from that as the year progresses and that the U.S. consumer remains in a generally favorable economic position throughout the year.\nThe comparisons against last year are unique primarily due to the timing of international divestitures and U.S. stimulus in FY '22. As a reminder, the divestitures of our businesses in the U.K. and Japan were completed near the end of the first quarter last year, contributing about $5 billion in sales and about $0.07 of EPS in Q1 FY '22. Our guidance will be ex divestitures.\nWe expect total company sales to increase about 4% with Walmart U.S. comp sales slightly above 3% for the year. Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart U.S. in the first quarter followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year. We expect FY '23 total company operating income to increase at a rate slightly higher than sales growth and EPS to grow 5% to 6% versus FY '22 adjusted EPS due in part to our aggressive share repurchase program.\nThe quarterly profit growth cadence is expected to be quite variable due to last year's U.S. stimulus as well as lapping wage investments initiated in February and September 2021. As you would expect, the variability of the quarters looks less extreme when viewed on a 2-year stack. We expect Q1 operating income and EPS to be down low double digits to low teens as we cycle the stimulus effects from last year that resulted in nearly 30% operating income growth as well as increased wages this year.\nOn a 2-year stack, Q1 operating income would still be up a mid-teens percentage. Q2 and Q3 operating income and EPS are expected to increase at low to mid-single-digit rates as year-over-year comparisons ease due in part to the moderation of stimulus benefits last year. We expect higher growth rates in the back half of the year as we fully cycle wage investments, resulting in fourth quarter operating income and EPS increasing by a high-teens percentage. Q4 operating income will also benefit from some timing versus FY '22, particularly in international as well as cycling elevated COVID leave costs in FY '22.\nOur effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26% due primarily to earnings mix. For the year, we expect gross margin rates to increase due to pricing, mix and new business initiatives, although there will be variability quarter-to-quarter as is usually the case. For the first time in a while, we expect some expense deleveraging as we continue to see elevated supply chain, wage and tech costs. We'll continue the multiyear journey of accelerated capital investment focused on increasing fulfillment capacity, automation and technology to enhance productivity.\nFY '22 CapEx was about $13.1 billion, lower than anticipated due to timing of projects impacted by supply chain challenges. Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year's CapEx being at the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales.\nIn closing, I'm really pleased with our FY '22 results and very confident as I look to this year and to the future. The company is in an enviable position to serve customers and members and also to achieve our financial goals, benefiting shareholders.\nNow we'd be happy to take your questions.",

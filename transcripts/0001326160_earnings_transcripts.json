My name is Sammy, and I'll be coordinating your call today. During the presentation, you can register a question by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two on your telephone keypad to remove yourself from a question queue. I would now like to hand over to our host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead, Abby.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Sammy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q3 2025 Earnings Review And Business Update. Leading our call today is Harry Sideris, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Harry.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong results for the Q3 with adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 compared to $1.62 last year, driven by continued growth in our electric utilities. We are well-positioned for a solid finish to the year and are narrowing our full-year guidance range to $6.25 to $6.35. I'm proud of how our teammates are executing our strategy, delivering value for our customers, communities, and shareholders every day while preparing our system to serve the growing energy needs of tomorrow. We approach 2026 with momentum as our company converts large-load economic development prospects into tangible projects with signed electric service agreements, and we are already turning dirt on projects to meet this load growth. We're carrying out an ambitious generation build that will add more than 13GW of capacity to our system in the next five years.\nWith a maturing pipeline and concrete investment plans in place, we're reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2029 and have confidence we will earn in the top half of the range beginning in 2028. Moving to slide five, as load growth materializes and we invest in modernizing our system, we expect our new five-year capital plan to be between $95 and $105 billion, increasing the largest investment plan in the industry. The step-up is primarily related to investments in new generation that will drive earnings-based growth of more than 8.5% through 2030. We will provide additional details on the updated capital and financing plan on our Q4 call in February. As the investment needs of our utilities accelerate, I want to underscore that customer value and affordability remain front and center.\nOur job is to address the needs of all customers, from large industrial customers that are competing against a global market to residential customers that are managing their household budgets. This focus starts with cost management, which is a core competency for Duke Energy. We continue to leverage AI and pursue a technology-enabled, industry-leading cost structure as we invest in our system. Other tools we are utilizing to keep rates as low as possible include the combination of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress utilities, which, if approved, would save retail customers more than $1 billion through 2038, storm cost securitization, which is expected to save customers in the Carolinas up to 18% on their bills compared to traditional recovery mechanisms, energy tax credits, which collectively result in hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings.\nAnd we're protecting existing customers through tariff structures and contract provisions for new large-load projects. These are just a few of the many solutions we employ to ensure our 10 million customers receive the service they count on at a fair price. We recognize that our work to provide affordable energy for customers is never done, but we are proud that average rate changes have paced below the rate of inflation over the last decade and that our rates are well below the national average. Turning to slide six, the majority of our capital plan increase relates to our record generation build, which is hitting a new gear. Last month, we filed our updated Carolinas Resource Plan in North Carolina, which expands upon the previous filing approved by regulators in 2024 and presents an updated path to continue to meet the needs of our customers reliably and affordably.\nThe plan maintains an all-of-the-above strategy and supports the work already underway to meet near-term growth. Importantly, the updated IRP results in annual customer bill impacts of approximately 2% over the coming decade, below the rate of inflation and significantly lower than the previously approved plan. The roadmap we laid out isn't just a long-term view. We're actively executing on generation build today. We're on track to add more than 8.5 gigawatts of new dispatchable generation across our service territories over the next five years. This includes over one gigawatt of upgrades to maximize the value of our existing fleet and 7.5 gigawatts of new natural gas. In the Carolinas, we have secured all major permit approvals, gas supply, long lead equipment, and workforce contracts for our Person County Combined Cycle units, and construction has commenced at the site.\nWe also recently filed CPCNs for the Anderson County Combined Cycle and Smith Combustion Turbine projects. We expect approvals on both these sites in mid-2026. In Indiana, we appreciate the Commission's recent approval of our CPCN for the Cayuga Combined Cycle gas units, a critical project to meet the state's growing power needs. The order approved two settlements reached in the case, as well as semi-annual securitization recovery through a rider. This recovery mechanism will support the balance sheet through the construction cycle and reduce overall costs to the customers. All of the work underway today will enable us to continue to serve our customers reliably and affordably into the future. Beyond supplying power, these grid and generation investments deliver significant value to our communities. In September, we partnered with EY to estimate the economic impact of our investment plan.\nThe 10-year capital plan we laid out in February will equate to over $370 billion in economic output, including approximately $130 billion in labor income, and will contribute more than $200 billion to the GDP for the communities we serve. The investment will also support nearly 170,000 jobs annually. We are privileged to be a critical economic driver of the communities we serve, and we look forward to growing together in the decades to come. In closing, the fundamentals of our business are the strongest they've ever been. We're powering tremendous growth across the Southeast and Midwest with solid plans based on concrete projects that provide a durable runway of investment well into the future. We're meeting our financial and strategic objectives while continuing our focus on operational excellence, and I am confident the tailwinds we see will continue to strengthen.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. As shown on slide seven, we continue to build on the momentum from the first half of the year with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 in Q3. This represents over 11% growth versus adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 last year, putting us firmly on track to deliver the targeted growth in 2025. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.24, driven by higher retail sales volumes and the implementation of new rates across many of our jurisdictions. Weather was above normal in the quarter, but not as favorable as the prior year, and interest expense increased as we execute our growing investment plans. Gas utilities and infrastructure results were largely flat to last year, consistent with the seasonality of the LDC business. And finally, the other segment was down $0.04, primarily due to higher interest expense.\nAs we think about the remainder of the year, recall that we have a demonstrated track record of managing agility in both directions. In the Q4 of last year, we implemented extensive one-time cost savings and agility measures in response to the historic 2024 storm season. In contrast, our strong year-to-date results in 2025, including favorable weather, provide an opportunity to reinvest in the system. With these Q4 considerations and year-to-date performance in mind, we are highly confident in achieving our narrowed EPS guidance range of $6.25 to $6.35. Looking ahead to 2026 growth drivers on slide eight, we expect the constructive regulatory outcomes that are driving 2025 results to continue next year. We are progressing through our multi-year rate plans in North Carolina and Florida and will implement phase two of the Indiana rate case in March. Midwest and Florida grid riders will continue to provide steady growth.\nWe also expect new rates in South Carolina to be effective in the Q1 of 2026. We were pleased to reach constructive settlements last week with the ORS and other interveners in our DEP rate case. The settlements, which are subject to commission approval, are based on a 9.99% ROE and 53% equity ratio and resolve all open items in the case. Our DEC South Carolina rate case continues to progress as well, and we expect final orders in both cases by year-end. I'd also like to highlight that in North Carolina, we provided 30-day notice of our plans to file rate cases for both DEC and DEP later this month. We expect new rates to be effective in early 2027, and we'll provide additional details once the filings are made.\nAs we move through the remainder of the decade, our long-term earnings growth is underpinned by our attractive jurisdictions, which are benefiting from population migration and growing economies. These tailwinds provide an extensive runway of capital development deployment opportunities, which drive steady and increasing rate-based growth. With solid business environments and efficient recovery mechanisms in place, we are well-positioned to deliver 5% to 7% earnings growth through 2029, with confidence to earn in the top half of the range beginning in 2028. Turning to slide nine, one of our strategic priorities is to solidify our late-stage economic development pipeline and convert prospects into firm projects. We've been working closely with state and local partners to deliver on that commitment. Internally, we've developed new teams dedicated to speed and execution and implemented creative solutions that accelerate the time to power.\nThese efforts are yielding tangible results, with approximately 3GW of signed electric service agreements with data centers this year alone. This includes ESAs signed this quarter with Digital Realty and Edged, who are making multi-billion-dollar investments in North Carolina to support AI infrastructure. We're not just signing data centers. Our economic development activities have yielded over $11 billion of capital commitments from other commercial and industrial customers in 2025. These projects are expected to bring an additional 25,000 jobs to our service territories and support our load growth projections. In a rapidly changing external environment where affordability is paramount, I want to emphasize that our electric service agreements contain terms that protect our existing customer base and ensure new large-load projects pay their fair share. Terms include minimum take provisions, termination charges, and refundable capital advances.\nAs a testament to our work delivering on this wave of economic development, in September, we were recognized with EEI's Outstanding Customer Engagement Award. This award is given directly by corporate customers and highlights our ability to collaborate among broad stakeholder groups on complex projects. We are just getting started. Active site evaluations are progressing across all of our service territories, and many more projects are moving to advanced stage. As our economic development pipeline has matured over the past year, we are more confident than ever in our ability to capture the once-in-a-generation load growth opportunity in front of us. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 10, I first want to recognize the work of our regulators and other stakeholders to address cost recovery from last year's historic storm season in record time.\nWith their support, we were able to successfully issue North Carolina storm securitization bonds approximately one year after Hurricane Helene, and we expect to issue South Carolina bonds before year-end. Securitization is one of the many tools available to help mitigate rate increases for customers, with the North Carolina bonds projected to save customers up to 18% compared to traditional recovery methods. In Florida, $1.1 billion of storm costs will be fully recovered by February 2026. As a result, bills are expected to decrease by approximately $40 a month beginning in March. Across all three jurisdictions, the timely recovery process helps maintain credit quality and reinforces our expectation of achieving 14% or higher FFO to debt by year-end.\nAs discussed on the Q2 call, we are targeting 15% FFO to debt over the long term, which provides 200 basis points of cushion above our Moody's downgrade threshold and 300 basis points above our S&P downgrade threshold. Our balance sheet will continue to improve as we receive proceeds from the Tennessee and Florida transactions, which we expect to close in early 2026. As Harry discussed earlier, we expect our new five-year capital plan to be between $95 and $105 billion. Consistent with previous guidance, we'll target 30% to 50% equity funding for this incremental growth capital. Transaction proceeds will satisfy equity needs in 2026, and remaining common equity issuances to support growth represent a very modest percentage of our market cap and will help maintain credit quality during this period of unprecedented capital deployment.\nWe will provide more detail on our capital and financing plan on our Q4 call in February. Moving to slide 11, we are well-positioned to deliver earnings within our narrowed guidance range in 2025, as well as 5% to 7% growth through 2029. As load growth and capital accelerate, we have confidence we will earn in the top half of the range beginning in 2028. Our extensive runway of capital investments, coupled with efficient recovery mechanisms, position us to achieve our growth targets, which combined with our attractive dividend yield provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. To ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure your device is unmuted locally. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is open, Julien. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey. Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it. Nicely done today. Appreciate the extra details versus your traditional cadence.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Julien.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Julien. Thank you.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, absolutely. So maybe just to kick off here, considering those details that you guys gave us here, can you speak a little bit to the incremental capital that you guys are looking at? I know it's still a range, but how, when you think about layering that in, is that sort of ratable across the period? Or when you think about layering in that last year, 2030, does that final year represent a further acceleration even relative to 2028 and 2029? You know what I mean? In theory, the move up from $87 billion by $10 billion could be ratable across the forecast period, or it could be heavily weighted to that final year in 2030.\nYou haven't quite given us the full details here, but I'm curious as to, as you think about the cadence of this data center ramp playing itself out, is it really truly weighted towards that last year? Can you speak to that a little bit?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, I'll take that, Julien, and good morning. The way I would think about it, as we're signing up these large-load customers, we have more visibility into the infrastructure build we need to make to serve them. And this update in the capital plan has that. Plus, as we get deeper into the energy modernization strategy, we're investing more. So we knew 2030 was going to be higher than 2025 rolling off. But I would think of it as we're adding capital in every year of the plan, and it's to build to that ramp of these large customers as we get more firm contracts signed and more visibility into the infrastructure needs of those customers.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nI would add, Julien.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYou got it.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nIt's a very dynamic environment out there. You saw us raise from $0.83 to $0.87 earlier this year with the Brookfield deal in Florida. Then you're seeing our capital expand here because of what we're seeing in data center growth and economic development, as well as our modernization that Brian mentioned. So we'll continue to evaluate and update as we move.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nI know it is truly unusual for you guys to update twice in a given year outside of your typical cadence of Q4. So I hear you on that one. Can you speak a little bit more to what that incremental potential is by this roughly $10 billion? What's comprised within that? Is that principally just transmission and generation for new data centers, or are there other pieces in there?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nNo, Julien, it's more than that, but it does encompass that. So as we sign more energy service agreements, that's a trigger to invest more transmission and potentially generation in this five-year plan. But we're also evaluating LDC investments that could support the new generation at our Piedmont Natural Gas Company. And all those investments, along with the bullpen of T&D investments that we've got that we haven't pulled onto the field quite yet, we're evaluating all those factors as well as customer affordability as we finalize our capital plan. That's why we didn't come out with a single-point estimate this time, because we're still running our models and evaluating rate cases over time and how that might show up.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJulien, we'll have more details in February like we normally do on financing that plan, as well as what the details are of that.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. But needless to say, you've been pretty committed to the balance sheet. You think the FFO to debt, regardless of where this lands, you're going to stick with this updated level pro forma for what you did with the FFO this year?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAbsolutely. We are committed to 15% FFO over time, and we're on target to be over 14% this year as committed.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYep. Excellent. All righty. Well, thank you guys very much. I'll leave it there.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nAppreciate it, Julien.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking the time.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Thanks for taking the time.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nHey, Carly.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for the time. I guess maybe just on the Carolinas IRP, you have included an option for nuclear there, including an AP1000 starting in potentially 2037. I guess just with some of the announcements that we've seen across the broader nuclear space recently, just curious how you might envision Duke playing a role in this build-out, particularly as an operator.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Great question, Carly. As you know, we operate 11 low-cost, safe, reliable nuclear reactors today. So nuclear is a big part of our business. It makes sure that our customers get reliable and affordable power every day. We earn over $500 million of tax credits a year that go back to our customers from those nuclear plants. So we feel nuclear is a very important part of the future. With that said, there's a lot of things that we have to determine and figure out before we move forward. We're encouraged to see the government and some of the partnerships with Westinghouse that were recently announced leaning into this and addressing supply chain concerns, which is one of the items that we have on our list.\nWe still need to figure out what we're going to do with cost overrun protection and how we're going to protect our investors and our customers from overruns on those projects, as well as how we're going to protect the balance sheet if we move forward with nuclear. So we're working to resolve those, working with government officials as well as some of the tech customers. So we'll continue to work that. If you remember last year, our IRP had only SMRs in it. We were asked by the North Carolina Commission to explore light water reactors as well. So we filed a report this past March to show what it would take or what would be an AP1000 type project. So we've added that into our plans in our model, and we'll continue to evaluate both of those SMRs as well as light water reactors.\nBut again, nothing going forward until we have those other items resolved.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nVery clear. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then maybe just another on Carolinas resource planning. As you laid out the updated plan, the share of gas stayed pretty consistent with the prior plan. I guess would you expect that to move higher to the extent that there's expanded natural gas pipeline capacity into the Southeast? And would something like the MVP Boost project potentially be a needle mover there?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. There's a lot of gas in that plan, as well as a lot of batteries and solar. So we continue all of the above strategy and how we serve our load going forward. We've done a lot of work to secure gas through the early part of 2030, and we continue to work on beyond that. We do expect, as economic development growth continues, we will need more gas and more pipelines, and are working with the companies to provide that. So we'll continue to update the process and the progress on that. We feel like dispatchable power is critical to serve these new loads, and gas is the source that we're focused on right now.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the color.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, Shar. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. It's actually Alex on for Shar. Thanks for taking our questions.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Alex.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning, Alex.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nMorning. So just wanted to touch on the earnings outlook. So you've indicated you expect to be at the high end of the 5% to 7% starting in 2028. Just sort of want to get a sense, is there any potential for that growth to begin ramping sooner? And if you can just remind us what drives the delta between the 5% to 7% EPS growth and that 8 and a half rate base growth you have out there. Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThat's great, Alex. And it's the right question as we have these incremental investments, capital plans expanding, and customers are getting signed up. I would first say that every year the plan's within the 5% to 7%. But 2028 is an inflection point where we're investing more capital in Florida. We're completing the multi-year rate plan. The transaction with Brookfield will be completed. And we talked about expanding capital in Florida in that period. And we're also seeing many of the large-load customers we're signing up today are coming online. We have more visibility in their construction projects. Their projects will be completed in the second half of 2027. So the ramp will begin, but it really hits an inflection point in 2028, and it continues to grow into the early 2030s.\nSo that gives us high confidence that we're going to be in the top half of the growth range in 2028. I want to underscore, the growth is strong. I would think of it as a CAGR in the top half in 2028 off of 2025 base of 630, not just an annual growth.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Okay. Super helpful there.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAnd I would add, we feel it's durable too beyond that. We'll continue. We see the prospects continuing. So we feel like this is a long-term play for us.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Got it. Thank you. And just on the funding, so you still have a good amount of equity out there. You've done good deals in Tennessee and Florida, which have been accretive. So just any other opportunities around asset recycling, or should we assume equity and equity-like instruments going forward? Thank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYes, Alex. Our focus is on digesting those two big deals that we announced earlier this year. And then we'll continue to fund, like we've mentioned before, 30% to 50% of our plan with equity depending on the projects. We'll update the details of that in February, as we always do. But we're committed to protecting the balance sheet, meeting that 15% FFO that we committed to, and being above 14% this year.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDiana Niles\n\nAssociate, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Diana Niles, on for Jeremy.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Diane.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nDiana Niles\n\nAssociate, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. If I may expand on Alex's first question, I was wondering to what extent does that high end of 5% to 7% reflect incremental capital? And does any of that incremental capital factor into the confidence that you expressed today to hit the high end of the range starting in 2028?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Diane, this is Brian. I'll take that. As I think about the top half of the growth range and beginning in 2028, I would say it fits within any of the $95 to $105 billion capital range that we provided. It's not depending upon us being at the high end, or it would be lower on the low end. It's contemplated in all those scenarios.\n\nDiana Niles\n\nAssociate, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thank you. All right. That'll do it for now.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you. Thanks, Diane.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Our next question comes from David Paz from Wolfe Research. Your line is open, David. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Paz\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just on your large load commentary, could you remind me what does the advanced pipeline or, sorry, the pipeline look like for large load? And how much of that would you say is in advanced discussions that could be added to the 3GW of ESAs you signed this year?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Good morning, David. Good to hear from you. We have a very large and diverse pipeline of projects. I would say ours is just as big, if not bigger than, anybody else's out there. But really, our focus has been on the projects that are from the credible hyperscalers as well as third-party developers that we feel like have the ability to get these projects through fruition. So we're working with them to get through the queue, to get through the funnel, as we call it, to be able to have these signed ESAs. So we've signed in the last six months 3GW of ESAs, as we mentioned in our presentation. And we continue to work with many others on that. So really focused on nailing down those energy service agreements because that's what we feel is the right focus for us.\nWe're working through a large pipeline, but really focused on developing those prospects into those final projects.\n\nDavid Paz\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. So you don't want to characterize how much are in near-term advanced discussions that could be signed over the next year or so?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nIt's a very dynamic environment, David. We continue to work on it every day. We have a dedicated team, like Brian mentioned earlier, that is focused on this 24/7 of how we get this into our system and into these signed agreements as fast as possible.\n\nDavid Paz\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay. No, I appreciate that. Sorry to kind of go back to the EPS growth commentary. I just want to make sure I understood what you added, I think, at the end of the durability of this growth starting in 2028. So the upper half of your five to seven beginning in 2028, and that's durable into the 2030s at that same level off of a 2027, I guess. Is that the way to think about it?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. That's a good assumption. As these economic development projects come into play and we continue to invest in our system, we see that being a durable approach.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Your line is open, Nicholas. Please go ahead.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Got on late, so sorry if I'm repeating a question. I really just had one. It was just the 30% to 50% of equity funding to fund the capital upside. What would kind of put you in the lower end of that range? And what should we be watching there from the balance sheet side that could enable you to do less equity? Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Nick. It's a great question. We've provided this range in previous quarters, and it informed how we funded the capital plan in the current five-year plan. What would determine the lower end would be investments with a higher velocity of recovery. So there's less equity need as you tack into those investments over time versus more investments that have a bit of slower recovery. Maybe it takes a while to get it into the rider mechanism or the like. You might need some balance sheet support. But the last capital update, we were at 40% of the incremental growth capital funded with common equity or equity support. I would think of it as the faster recovery capital would be in the low end and the slower recovery capital being in the more like 50%.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nAll right. That's all for me. Thank you.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, man.\n\nOperator\n\nWe currently have no further questions. I'd like to hand back to Harry for some closing remarks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Just to wrap up, I want to leave y'all with three items. Number one, we see a lot of momentum into the end of this year and into 2026 and beyond. Two, our business is in the strongest position it has ever been. And finally, I am confident we are going to earn in the top half of our five to seven range beginning in 2028. But more importantly, our plan is durable well into the future. So again, thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your investment in Duke Energy. Hope everybody has a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. We thank everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

During the presentation, you can register a question by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two on your telephone keypad to remove yourself from the question queue. I'll now hand over to our host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead, Abby.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relation, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Sammy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q2 2025 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Harry Sideris, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Harry.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you today for our second quarter earnings call. We have a lot of exciting news to share this morning, starting with Brookfield Infrastructure's $6 billion minority investment in our Florida business. This transaction enables a material strengthening of our credit profile as we enter this period of significant growth, as well as the ability to grow our Florida utility at its full potential. We are now targeting FFO to debt of 15%, a 100 basis points increase versus our previous target. We are also increasing our Florida capital plan by $4 billion, funded by a portion of the sale proceeds.\nBrookfield is a highly regarded infrastructure investment, and we are pleased to have them as a long-term partner in Duke Energy Florida.\nIn further support of our capital funding needs, we announced the sale of our Tennessee LDC business to Spire last week. The premium valuation of $2.5 billion, or 1.8x rate base, reflects the high end of LDC asset sale precedents. We have been privileged to serve the Tennessee community for more than 40 years, and I know that under Spire's leadership, our teammates and assets will continue to operate with excellence and provide best-in-class service. Combined, these strategic transactions allow us to efficiently finance the record growth ahead of us and give us greater confidence in delivering our EPS objectives.\nShifting to the 2Q results on slide five, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.25, building on our strong start to the year. These results were driven by top-line growth across electric utilities.\nWe move into the back half of the year with positive momentum and are reaffirming our 2025 guidance range of $6.17 to 6.42 and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7 through 2029. Moving to slide six, we continue to deliver on our strategic priorities, including advancing large-scale economic development projects and securing industry-leading regulatory and legislative outcomes. Starting with economic development, we operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions in the country. Our states continue to thrive and grow, and the affordable, reliable power we provide plays a key role in bringing business into our regions.\nWe've been partnering with our states to attract jobs and investments for decades, and that momentum continues to build. In fact, North Carolina was just named the top state for business by CNBC for the third time in four years, and most of our states ranked in the top 10.\nOur size and scale, together with an unwavering commitment to our customers and demonstrated willingness to partner to do business, allow us to move with speed and agility to seize the opportunity ahead. To highlight a recent project win, Amazon Web Services announced in June that it plans to invest more than $10 billion to build a new data center campus in North Carolina. I am proud to say that our team played an integral role in making this happen. AWS described North Carolina as being the perfect home for this investment and highlighted our efforts in putting the site on their radar. Our team continues to build on their track record of success,\nmoving at pace with our customers to deliver what they need when they need it. To continue to bring in these significant wins in a competitive environment, we are working closely with our stakeholders.\nDuring the quarter, we advocated for state and federal policies that enable us to meet the moment for our customers, while at the same time supporting our credit profile, improving our regulatory constructs, and maintaining customer affordability. These outcomes show clear alignment between our company and policymakers on shared goals of delivering reliable and affordable energy to meet growing demand. On the federal side, the preservation of nuclear production tax credits in the final budget reconciliation bill was a significant win for our customers. Only well-run, cost-efficient reactors are eligible to receive the credit.\nOur 11GW nuclear fleet is the largest regulated fleet in the nation and earned $500 million of PTCs last year for the benefit of our customers. We appreciate the engagement from Congress, the administration, and stakeholders around our shared objective of supporting nuclear energy and lowering customer bills.\nIn North Carolina, the Power Bill Reduction Act became law last week. As we ramp up generation investments to meet accelerating load growth, this legislation allows for annual recovery of financing costs for new baseload generation, supporting our credit profile and minimizing costs to customers. In South Carolina, the Energy Security Act was signed into law in May. The legislation supports all-or-above strategy, recognizing the value of our dual-state system and, importantly, allows electric utilities to implement a rate stabilization mechanism similar to our gas utilities. This efficient mechanism allows for annual rate true-ups that reduce volatility for customers and support the\ncredit quality of the utility. And finally, the Ohio legislation approved House Bill 15 in May as well. As outlined, the law replaces the electric security plan with a multi-year, forward-looking rate-making process, reducing regulatory lag.\nBeyond legislative accomplishments, we continue to build our track record of regulatory execution. We recently filed rate cases in South Carolina for both Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas. We expect hearings to take place in Q4, with new rates in effect early next year if approved. Later this month, we plan to file applications with the North Carolina, and South Carolina Commissions and FERC to combine our DEC and DEP utilities. We expect the combination to generate significant customer savings over $1 billion through 2038 as we simplify processes and add operational flexibility to our system.\nWe are targeting 27 January for the effective date. And finally, we continue to advance regulatory approval processes for new generation investments and plan to file our next Carolinas Resource Plan in North Carolina by 1 October.\nFocusing on our generation plans, as you can see on slide seven, we are actively advancing all solutions to quickly meet the increasing demand coming to our service territories, including maximizing our current fleet while we build new capacity. We're on track to add over 8GW of dispatchable power across our system through 2031. This includes uprate projects to efficiently increase the capacity of existing natural gas, nuclear, and hydro units. In aggregate, they represent over 1GW of cost-effective incremental capacity. Turning to new generation, we finalized the EPC agreement for our first combined cycle under development in the Carolinas, and construction is underway.\nWe also announced the site location for the third combined cycle in Anderson, South Carolina. In Indiana, we reached two settlements in our Cayuga CPCN proceeding.\nThe agreements with Reliable Energy and the Industrial Group provide key support for our request, including the request to recover financing costs as they are incurred. Hearings begin later this month, and we expect an order by November. These milestones demonstrate our progress in advancing these critical infrastructure investments. With turbines secured under our framework agreement with GE Vernova and gas supply contracted, we are confident in meeting the in-service timelines we have laid out for these new units. In closing, our strength in the first half of the year was driven by solid execution by our 26,000 teammates.\nThis performance, coupled with our unwavering focus on operational excellence, demonstrates our ability to meet the unprecedented growth we see over the next decade and deliver value for shareholders and customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide eight, we finished first half of 2025 with another strong quarter, with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.25. This is up from adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 in 2024. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.10 compared to last year, driven by top-line growth from the implementation of new rates across Carolinas, Florida, and Indiana. Partially offsetting these items were higher planned O&M and interest expense. Gas utilities and infrastructure results were flat to last year, consistent with the seasonality of the LDC business.\nAnd finally, the other segment was down $0.02, primarily due to higher planned interest expense. Overall, we are very pleased with the results we've achieved so far this year, which continue to reflect the strength of the regulatory outcomes and the operational performance we have consistently delivered.\nWe are on track to achieve our targeted EPS and credit objectives for 2025. Turning to slide nine, population migration in the Southeast and Midwest continues to drive sustained customer growth, led by more than 2% in the Carolinas. As expected, rolling 12-month volumes moderated in the quarter, driven by a very strong second quarter of 2024, particularly in the residential class. First-half results reflect a shift in mix across retail classes compared to our original assumptions. We are closely monitoring these trends, but continue progressing toward our 1.5% to 2 volume growth expectations for the year. As we look ahead, we continue to expect load growth to accelerate in the latter years of the plan as large load projects come online and begin to ramp.\nOur economic development pipeline remains robust, and we continue to take a risk-adjusted approach as we evaluate which projects to include in our forecast. As a reminder, our pipeline includes a diverse mix of customers, including advanced manufacturing projects across multiple sectors, as well as data centers. I've talked about how we're streamlining our processes to accelerate economic development projects through the pipeline, and these efforts are yielding tangible results. The $10 billion AWS data center investment in North Carolina is an incredible economic development win for Richmond County and the entire state of North Carolina.\nThe data center will support both cloud computing and AI infrastructure and is expected to create at least 500 new high-skilled jobs. This announcement is a major public milestone for the project, and it highlights our team's continued focus on speed, creativity, and execution as we help move the project through the development process.\nThe site selected for this project was part of our Site Readiness Program, which helps our state, regional, and local economic development partners make potential industrial land more attractive. By identifying sites that already have robust transmission infrastructure and capacity, we can proactively accelerate the timeline of getting power delivery to a site. That strategic groundwork has paid off, and I'm proud of the work the team continues to do to consistently meet our customers' needs. Turning to slide 10, proceeds from the minority investment in Duke Energy Florida, and the sale of our Tennessee LDC business strongly position us for the transformational generation modernization\ninvestments ahead. A portion of the proceeds will be used as efficient funding to de-risk our equity plan. The remaining proceeds will displace long-term debt, materially strengthening the balance sheet.\nEnabled by these transactions, we announced today that we are raising our long-term FFO-to-debt target to 15%. This new target will provide 200 basis points of cushion above our Moody's downgrade threshold and 300 basis points above our S&P downgrade threshold. We are also delivering on all credit support initiatives and are firmly on track to achieve 14% FFO-to-debt this year. Focusing on the equity plan, the deal valuations represent significant premiums to our common stock. We'll use about half of the proceeds, or $3.5 billion, to displace common equity, including funding the incremental capital we're investing in Florida. We expect to issue the remaining $4.5 billion of\ncommon equity through the DRIP and ATM programs in the 2027 to 2029 timeframe. Moving to slide 11, we remain confident in delivering our 2025 earnings guidance range of $6.17 to 6.42 and 5% to 7 earnings growth through 2029.\nProceeds from the accretive transactions solidify our credit profile and provide further confidence in our potential to earn in the top half of the range as load growth accelerates in the back end of the plan. Along with supportive legislation in place and our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, we are well-positioned to achieve our growth targets, which, combined with our attractive dividend yield, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. In preparing to ask your question, please ensure your device is unmuted locally. Our first question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is open, Julian. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time and nicely done here.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Julian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Julian.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAbsolutely. Maybe just to kick it off here a little bit. I mean, obviously, a series of constructive data points here, whether it's the Carolinas legislation, the transaction in Tennessee, or now this in Florida. How do you think about this positioning yourself within the EPS CAGR, right? I only see net accretive actions before us. Are there any offsets, otherwise said?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThe way I've looked at this, Julian, is this really just gives us even more confidence in our 5 to 7 range that we've mentioned many times before, and also gives us confidence in earning in the top half of that range in the 28 and 29 at the back end of the plan. The $4 billion investment in Florida is going to come in that timeframe. So I'd look at all these transactions and this movement as really solidifying us in that range and in the top half of that range towards the back end of the plan.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nNice. Excellent. Then if I can ask a little bit more of a detailed question here. Around the latest Carolinas legislation, can you elaborate just a little bit further about how that shifts your plan? And just with respect to that, any shift in expectations on earned returns or spending? Just to elaborate, obviously, this is a novel development.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. The passage of that bill really enhances the attractiveness for growth in the state. It had bipartisan support, and we definitely support a growing state. And like I mentioned, North Carolina is number one for business, ranked by CNBC. So a lot of good things going on in North Carolina with AWS and other things. So our plan is still intact with the bill. It gives us some credit help with CWIP being able to recover annually. But I would look at it as our plan is still along the same lines of all of the above that we've filed and the multiple IRPs that we've done. We'll be filing another one here this fall. And just really looking at all resources that can support the growth that we're seeing in North Carolina. And this bill just helps us manage that, but also manage the customer affordability portion.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. I'll pass it on. But nicely done again, guys. Congrats.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nick Campanella in Barclays. Your line is open, Nick. Please go ahead.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for all the info today.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Nick.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSo, I just wanted to ask. Hey, good morning. Morning. I just wanted to ask, this is the second time, I guess, you've done a non-controlling interest stake in the business. You just did Tennessee. Just how are you kind of thinking about any additional opportunities across the portfolio to just knock out that remaining $4.5 billion? Or are you kind of done here for now? Thanks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThe reason we did these deals is they're just very efficient use of equity. We feel comfortable in what we've done so far. We also feel comfortable with the equity plans that we've laid out to cover our growth. So I would look at it as, for now, that we're going to stick and get these transactions done and implementing our plan and continuing our growth trajectory that we have.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. That's very clear. And then, excuse me, you're outlining an increased FFO-to-debt to 15% long-term. What's the feedback from the agencies been? And then can you just clarify what year you expect to get to that 15% range? Is it 2027? Or maybe you can provide more clarity there. Thanks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Nicholas, I'll kick that off, and then Brian can add some color. The rating agencies have always been supportive of our metrics at where they were. This is just going to enhance that. We just recently had a meeting in April with them, and they were supportive of our plans, our regulatory outcomes that we have in the states that we serve around storm securitization and storm recovery. Those tools that we have really help them feel comfortable with where we are today at 14%. And they're only going to be more comfortable at a higher level, obviously. Brian, do you want to add anything to that?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. I would add, Nick, I mean, we have several strategies in play to improve FFO-to-debt. Even before these transactions were announced, right, the legislation that Harry just spoke to in North Carolina with CWIP recovery, the South Carolina Energy Security Act has more efficient credit-positive aspects of the regulation. And Ohio, the multi-year rate plan structure. It's going to take some time to get those wheels turning. But once they do, there's a more efficient cash recovery. And these transactions kind of give a booster shot to that FFO. So I would say we're tracking really strongly to the '14 this year without any of those things in place, just strong cash flow and execution of the business as expected. And within the five-year plan, we'll clearly be in the '15.\nWe'll refresh the financial plan in February, Nick, with more details as we absorb timing and use of proceeds in a more granular way.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open, Steve. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the last question. Should we assume you need to kind of complete the Florida sell-down steps to get to the 15%?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nSteve, I would say as it progresses, maybe not all the tranches, but we need to progress through the deal to be right at the '15.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Okay. And then just in thinking about, I think I can't remember the exact number, but in the past, I think you've given a rough number as capital goes up, a rough ratio of how much would be funded with equity. Does that change when we kind of look to a refresh later this year based on these new metrics, or is it roughly the same?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nNo. We've always targeted between 30% and 50 depending on what recovery mechanism we have. We'll continue to look at that as we refresh our plans.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nI would add this balance sheet strengthening.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThis balance sheet strengthening obviously gives us more flexibility of timing of the equity component of that capital investment and the like. But the 30% to 50 is a good planning range.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMakes sense. Then lastly, just maybe it might be helpful to get a little more color on your views on kind of resource preferences as we head into the next update there. I guess specifically, any updates on your thinking on new nuclear?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Steve, I'll take that one. We've always had the all-of-the-above strategy. So we look at a wide range of resources, including nuclear. Like we've said many times, we operate the largest regulated fleet of nuclear plants in the country. We think nuclear has a place to play and a lot of promise in the future. But before we go down that path, we're going to have to have some things figured out. We're going to have to have the first-of-a-kind risk design, supply chain, workforce resolve for SMRs and even bigger reactors, how we're going to handle that. We're also going to have to have overrun protection from the federal government or others to be able to protect our customers and our investors from any overruns on these projects.\nAnd then lastly, we're going to have to have a means to make sure that we're protecting the balance sheet as we're building these facilities. So until we get those items resolved, we're still looking at solar, gas, and uprating, and getting everything that we can out of our current assets.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Makes sense. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, team.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nHey, Jeremy.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHey, Jeremy.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey. So maybe following up a little bit here, appreciating where we are in the Carolinas IRP process. But could you share any high-level thoughts coming into the filing here beyond nuclear? Just wondering if there's any other points you'd like to highlight.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. We'll be filing that in October. Again, we're looking at all of the above. With the new bill, it takes the 70% of carbon and moves that out. But we've always been focused on reliability and affordability as being kind of the regulators for what we put in our plan. So you'll see a lot of the same that you've seen in the previous IRPs around gas, batteries, uprates that I mentioned earlier, as well as continued solar as we move forward. We are looking at nuclear when that makes sense, like I mentioned just a minute ago. But a lot of things will have to be determined before we go forward with that.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful there. Thanks. I was just wondering, as far as current load trends are progressing through the quarter, I was wondering if you could provide us just maybe a little bit more detail on what you see on the ground ahead of you that gives you confidence in the full-year guide at this point.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Jeremy, I'll take that. This is Brian. We knew we had a tough comp in Q2 of 2024, which was a strong quarter. Largely, residential growth in Q2 of 2024 was over 2%. And total retail growth at Duke was 1.9%. So we had a big comp. We expected kind of to be behind Q2 of 2024. But what we're seeing with some of our larger customers is a very cautious stance, right? The swirl of uncertainties that range from tariffs, as tax policy has been being worked real-time in the quarter and the like, those customers are not overproducing, if you will. They're just being very cautious when they have firm orders. They're running to those firm orders. So we're in close contact with these customers as we always are.\nAnd we expect, as some of these uncertainties get settled, I mean, there's a lot of progress on the tariff front that's happened in recent weeks. As that gets more firmed up, these customers will have more confidence in their supply chain and what the cost might be on their side. So that gives us. We're tracking in line with the 1.5% to 2 growth this year. And we do think this is more of a transit item.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful context. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Just a heads-up. Mizuno sells sporting equipment. Mizuno. But congrats on the transaction. Just curious on the selection process. Why is the Florida subsidiary not Ohio or Carolina or South Carolina? What made the company lean towards the 20% sale in Florida?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Good morning, Anthony. Good to hear from you. We don't need any sporting goods right now. But we look at our entire portfolio, and we look at where we can get the best value and an efficient use of raising funds. Florida fit that bill. It's a premium asset. And obviously, by our valuation, we got a premium price for it. It was a natural fit. It's a great jurisdiction to do business in. I think people realize that. We had a lot of interest in that.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. That's all I had. Congrats again.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Anthony.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just on the Amazon announcement that you mentioned in North Carolina, can you just provide any color on how we should think about the timing of those investments and the impact it could have on your CapEx expectations? Is that something that we should expect to be included in the capital plan update on the Q4 call?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Good morning, Carly. Yeah. The Amazon deal is a big deal for us. It does have ramping like all these data centers do. So it will start coming in in the 2027, 2028 timeframe, and it'll ramp in through the beginning of the next decade. We anticipate that they will also look at ways to add to it. Typically, when they build a data center campus, they have plans for longer term as well. So we anticipate some additional items coming in towards the middle part of the 2030s as well from them. But you'll see a ramp, and that'll be built into our plans as we do our updates.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one quick one on the Brookfield transaction. I think you had mentioned that there's an option for them to fund the total investment sooner. Is that something that's just up to their discretion, or are there any sort of considerations or gating factors there to keep in mind?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. It is up to their discretion. They do have to do it quarterly, and they have to notify us if they're going to do that. But what we've laid out in our plans is laying out the dates as we've announced with the tranches.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on all the updates, and appreciate all the information. Maybe just zooming out.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nSo what was the impetus for these sales? Was it wanting to improve the balance sheet? Were you looking to unlock more CapEx or something else? Just wondering what drove the decisions, especially as they were back-to-back like this?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. I would say, Andy, we always look for the most efficient ways to fund our growth. We have so much growth ahead of us. We're adding the $4 billion, so it allows us in Florida to maximize that opportunity and grow that utility at its potential. That led us to those fundings, as well as what we're focused on with the generation build and the data centers that are coming to our states. It really gives us an efficient way to fund that growth and really supports our balance sheet into the future and allows us to earn that 5% to 7 and at that top half in the back half of the plan.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nI would build on that, Andrew, that in our capital allocation process, we were making choices. And that's holding back some of these businesses to grow at their full potential. And we have full faith that Spire is going to take the Tennessee business and grow it to the level it can grow. We were having to rotate capital from Tennessee into other areas because of the generation modernization effort, as well as Florida. So I'd say this unlocks the portfolio we will own going forward. And it was a very attractive capital recycling opportunity on both fronts.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. That makes a lot of sense. Then forgive me if I missed it, but the four billion upside to CapEx, is that entirely going to Florida? And if so, can you give us any details on the timing and what types of investments that's going to be going into?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. That is all in Florida. I would think about it at the end of our multi-year rate plan. Starting with our next multi-year rate plan, which will be 2028 and 2029, is when those investments would go in. There'll be grid investments, generation investments, ways to serve our customers better, and handle the growth that Florida is experiencing as well.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nIs sort of all of the above more of everything kind of story?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThat's a good way to think about it.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYep.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Great. And one last one, if I may. I see the slides still say targeting 60% to 70 dividend payout ratio with a stronger balance sheet and pointing to a little bit faster earnings growth. Any thoughts on the pace of dividend growth? Any philosophical tweak to the thinking there?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nAndrew, we like the growth. The last couple of years, our board has approved a 2% growth in the dividend. We feel like that's appropriate given the capital allocation and investment cycle we're tacking into. So we will continue to drive down the payout ratio as that level of dividend growth remains through the planning period.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nVery clear. Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe currently have no further questions. So at this time, I'd like to hand back to Harry Sideris for some closing remarks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, all. I just wanted to wrap up today's call by saying we're entering the second half of the year with a strong momentum, a very clear strategy, and a team that continues to deliver. We have materially improved our credit profile, and our financial results reflect the strength of our business and the outcomes we have achieved. We're very confident in our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers while delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Wanted to thank you again for joining us today and for your investment in Duke Energy. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. We thank everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

My name is Sammy, and I'll be coordinating your call today. During the presentation, you can register a question by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two on your telephone keypad. I'd now like to hand over to your host, Abby Motsinger, VP Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead, Abby.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Sammy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q1, 2025 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Harry Sideris, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Harry.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the quarter, let me start by saying how excited I am to be with you today on my first call as CEO. Since we announced our leadership succession in January, I've had the opportunity to spend time with many stakeholders, including our customers, investors, regulators, and Duke Energy teammates. These conversations centered around the same theme: the critical role Duke Energy plays in powering the lives of our communities and serving the incredible power demand facing the nation.\nWe are projecting load growth at levels I've never seen in my 30-year career, which will drive more than a decade of record infrastructure build. We are ready to meet the moment with a renewed focus on speed and agility, and supported by the same spirit of innovation that has been at the heart of this company for over a century.\nAs I assume the CEO role during this pivotal point for our company and industry, Duke Energy's mission remains unchanged: delivering long-term value for shareholders and superior service to our customers and communities by building a smarter energy future. Moving to the quarterly results, today we announced Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, which marks a strong start to the year. These results are $0.32 above last year, driven by top-line growth across our electric and gas utilities.\nThe constructive regulatory outcomes we've delivered over the last several years provide line of sight to earnings growth with minimized rate case exposure in 2025 and 2026. We remain confident in our outlook and are reaffirming our 2025 guidance range of $6.17 to 6.42, and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2029.\nMoving to slide five, meeting our customers' growing and evolving energy demands requires not only new generation, but where possible, maintaining and enhancing our existing generation. In March, we received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the operating license for our Oconee Nuclear Station for an additional 20 years, with three generating units that produce more than 2,600MW. Oconee is our first nuclear station to reach this milestone and will now power the Carolinas into the 2050s.\nAs the operator of the largest regulated fleet in the nation, nuclear is foundational to our strategy, and we intend to seek similar extensions for each of our remaining reactors to extend their respective licensing periods. In addition to extending the life of our nuclear fleet, we continue to pursue uprate projects to efficiently increase the capacity of existing natural gas, nuclear, and hydro units.\nIndividually, these are small, ranging less than 10MW up to 75MW per unit, but in aggregate, they represent over 1GW of cost-effective incremental capacity to support our growing regions. Turning to new generation, we've taken several important steps this year to advance our all-of-the-above strategy to meet growing demand and replace aging infrastructure. In the Carolinas, we commenced early site activities for our first combined cycle unit in Person County, and we filed a CPCN for a second combined cycle at the site.\nIn Indiana, we filed CPCNs for two combined cycles in February. In Florida, we're making investments in solar and battery storage projects approved in our multi-year rate plan. In January, we joined a public-private DOE grant application led by TVA to explore new nuclear technologies.\nThe coalition has the potential to accelerate SMR technology development and increase our access to industry learnings and best practices. And finally, we recently announced a strategic partnership with GE Vernova to secure up to 19 natural gas turbines. This agreement provides for timely delivery of critical infrastructure to meet our enterprise-wide resource plans and serve the growing needs of our customers into the 2030s.\nMoving to slide six, we continue to work closely with regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders to advance regulatory and legislative priorities across our jurisdictions. In the Carolinas, we've had ongoing discussions with stakeholders in both states around merging our DEC and DEP utilities. We are on track to file a merger application later this year with North Carolina and South Carolina commissions, as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nThe proposed merger would create significant customer savings, simplify operations and regulatory processes, and add operational flexibility to our system. We expect the application process to take about a year and are targeting January 2027 for the effective date of the merger. We also continue to advance storm securitization in North and South Carolina, and we're on track to issue securitization bonds in both states by the end of this year. Turning to Florida, in March, we began recovering 2024 hurricane costs over 12 months.\nThe timely recovery of storm costs was a key objective into the year, and this constructive outcome supports our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Finally, our Kentucky electric rate case is progressing with hearings scheduled for later this month, and we expect to implement new rates later this year.\nI am incredibly proud of our strong performance in the Q1, which is a result of continued operational excellence and the constructive outcomes the team has delivered. The fundamentals of the company are stronger than ever and provide visibility of growth for years to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide seven, we delivered a strong Q1 with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, a 22% increase over the Q1 of 2024. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.33 compared to last year. Growth was driven by higher sales volumes, improved weather, and the implementation of new rates.\nPartially offsetting these items were higher interest expense and depreciation. Moving to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.08 compared to last year, driven by new rates at Piedmont, North Carolina. And finally, the other segment was down $0.08, primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, we are very pleased with the Q1 results, which were in line with our expectations and reflect the strength of the regulatory outcomes and operational performance we have consistently delivered.\nTurning to slide eight, weather-normalized volumes increased 1.8% versus last year, in line with our full-year projection of 1.5% to 2%. Residential volumes were up over 3% in the quarter, reflecting both customer growth and higher usage. We continue to see robust customer growth through Q1, concentrated in the Southeast and Indiana. As we look ahead, we continue to expect load growth to accelerate beginning in 2027 as economic development projects come online.\nOur economic development pipeline continues to grow and includes advanced manufacturing projects across multiple sectors, as well as data centers. We're streamlining processes across the organization to accelerate projects through the pipeline, which is yielding results. In April, we signed new letter agreements for nearly 1 gigawatt of data center projects, and advanced manufacturing projects continue to ramp.\nThe pipeline remains robust, and we continue to take a risk-adjusted approach as we evaluate which projects to include in our forecast. Turning to slide nine, as we've demonstrated over many years, our commitment to our current credit ratings and a strong balance sheet will remain a top priority as we execute our growth objectives. We are delivering on all credit-supportive initiatives and are firmly on track to achieve 14% FFO to debt this year, and we expect to improve above 14% over the five-year plan.\nThis provides over 100 basis points of cushion above our Moody's downgrade threshold and over 200 basis points above our S&P downgrade threshold. As we disclosed in February, we expect to issue one billion of common equity this year via our DRIP and ATM programs.\nIn the Q1, we took advantage of a strong market, pricing just over $530 million, more than half of our annual target. We've also completed close to 40% of our planned long-term debt issuances for 2025 and are on track to receive storm securitization proceeds by the end of the year in the Carolinas. Before I close, let me take a moment to talk about progress on our capital plan.\nWe're continuing to advance our grid improvement plans, and as Harry highlighted, we're investing in our existing fleet and hitting a new gear in building generation. We invested more than $3 billion of capital in the quarter and were on track for $15 billion for the full year. As we think about our capital plan going forward, we're evaluating the impact of tariffs.\nIt's important to remember that tariffs primarily affect capital, and the majority of our capital spend is American labor, which is not subject to tariffs. We currently estimate the impact of tariffs to be about 1% to 3% of our five-year capital plan, and we are confident in our ability to further minimize the impact, leveraging our size and scale to work with suppliers across our diverse supply chain.\nMoving to slide 10, we remain confident in delivering our 2025 earnings guidance range of $617 to 642, and 5% to 7% earnings growth through 2029, with the potential to earn the top half of the range as load growth accelerates in the back end of the plan.\nOur track record of constructive regulatory outcomes provides a solid foundation and minimizes near-term regulatory exposure in our financial plan. We are well-positioned to achieve our growth targets, which, combined with our attractive dividend yield, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. To ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. For reference, to ask your question, please ensure your device is unmuted locally. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nMorning, morning. Just, I guess, first, it's obviously been reaffirmed, but you're seeing, obviously, a fairly strong step up in 2027. You're signing more letters of agreements. 2027 isn't that far off. I guess, at what point could we start seeing some guideposts around incremental CapEx opportunities above your base plan, like some of your peers have been doing? So a range of maybe possible upside CapEx opportunities that can go into plan as more deals are signed. I guess, are you considering this type of placeholder disclosure, and could EEI be the podium for that? Thanks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Thanks for that, Shah. I'll start off and turn it over to Brian for any feedback he has on it as well. So we just updated our plan in February, as you know, $83 billion for the next five years, half of that going into the grid, half of it for a generation build. We got several updates coming up with our IRP, and the Carolinas being updated. We continue to work our pipeline.\nIt's stable and growing, and as that continues and our updates for our IRP, I can never say that word, we will continue to look at our plans, but we do have a wealth of investment opportunities and growth opportunities, and we'll continue to look at that and update you as that comes along. And Brian, do you have anything to add?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, I would add. We're updating our resource plans, and we just actually filed our 10-year site plan in Florida, which calls for more resources than our previous plan. And, Shar, we've kind of gotten on this annual cycle of updating capital in February. If there is a catalyst, we will definitely update the investment community, but until then, I would kind of look to February as our major capital update cycle, but we take all these things into consideration when we update.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Got it. And then just maybe a question for Brian. Just on credit metrics, I mean, obviously, the key thing is the visibility is improving. You guys are monetizing the tax credits. You're getting storm cost recoveries. I guess, when can we start seeing some more specificity around actual target ranges within the plan versus the 100 basis points, 200 basis points guidance you guys have out there for some time? Is there a point when you can start to disclose around actual ranges you guys decide to lay in, you can land at during the trajectory? Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nNo, I appreciate the question, Shar, and it's something that we've been discussing a lot internally as we've continued to improve the credit profile of Duke and growing the operating cash flow and clearing some of these items that are in front of us, like storm recovery and storm securitization. So I think we're going to continue to evaluate it, but we'll see this within maybe our next cycle in February. We'll give a more defined targeted range on where we would be on the credit.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. That was actually my question. I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Julien.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. Hey, pleasure. Hey, guys, just to follow up a little bit on what Shah was just picking at here, I mean, 1GW of signed deals in April alone, quite a statement there. Just how are you thinking about the statement with respect to the cadence that you had contemplated? I mean, obviously, as you say, you've seen this accelerated load growth, but is it actually accelerating actively versus what you guys had contemplated initially?\nMaybe I'm not asking specifically about the CapEx, but just in terms of the cadence of adding a single gigawatt in a single month of data center deals specifically, I mean, are you seeing more than what you'd even talked about back in February? Or maybe another way to ask that is, where are you within that range of the 3% to 4% that you laid out just a handful of months ago as you see these data points coming in?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Julian. Our pipeline continues to be robust and continues to grow, and we've really focused on accelerating getting projects through what we call our funnel to get them from the pipeline through these letter agreement stages to shore them up. So this 1GW that we just signed is working through our process. It's been contemplated in our plans, and we'll continue to work that large pipeline that we have to move more of these through our funnel to look at how we go to in the future.\nSo we feel very comfortable and confident that we have a great pipeline, and we continue to find ways to work through that faster for our customers.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Understood. All right. And then, if I can pivot slightly differently, I mean, big announcement the other day with your friends at GEV here. How do you think about the 19 turbine commitments? I mean, just against what you guys have in the plan, how do you think about that juxtaposing versus what's formally in the plan versus what's possible here? Again, I know that it's not a formal commitment on your side per se, but I'm just curious how that fits and what that might suggest about future activities and future generation needs and the timeline.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, we were very pleased with the partnership with GE. We talked about meeting the moment at Duke and serving the tremendous load growth that we have ahead of us. Innovative agreements and framework agreements like this give us the flexibility as we're moving projects through that funnel that we're able to have the supply chain shored up in terms of turbines and other agreements that we have so that we could quickly serve these customers as they want to come on. This is important to shore up and give us the flexibility as we move these projects into fruition that we're able to deliver them to the customer quickly because that's what they want. These agreements are great.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Excellent. And 2025 seems like you're trending well already. I mean, too early to talk about, shall we say, moving within the range, but how do you think about putting more latitude against shoring up where you are against the longer-term outlook, just even 2026 here and de-risking some of the future years?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Julien, I think we look at our five-year plan and our 5% to 7% growth and feel very good about that growth outlook. A good start to 2025 obviously helps every year in front of it. We think that 2026 planning has been underway for many months now as we think about the years ahead, and we're well-positioned to deliver on that growth range as we look at the plan.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat, guys. All right. Thank you so much.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning, team. Thank you for giving me time. Congrats, Harry, once again. Just you guys have discussed.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning, Harry. You guys have discussed the DEP/DEC merger in the past. Maybe just a little bit more color. What are the financial implications of that merger? Want to know if it'll improve cost savings? I know there's going to be some operations streamlining, but just any color you can share there would be appreciated.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYes, Durgesh. We're excited about the opportunity to merge our DEC and DEP utilities, something we've contemplated since the merger back in 2012. Stakeholders are very supportive of this. It does generate a lot of savings over time for our customers, over $1 billion. So that'll help with the affordability to our rates for our customers going forward.\nIt really focuses on operational savings, fuel savings from running a combined system, managing our reserve margins as a whole instead of separately, allowing us to put plants in the best location and optimize that. It's less regulatory proceedings, which our regulators like as well as us. So it continues to provide a lot of benefits for our customers.\nSo we continue to work with our stakeholders on finalizing the details. Like I mentioned earlier, we plan to file later this summer with the North Carolina and South Carolina Commissions as well as FERC and look to be running as one utility in January of 2027.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Okay. Sounds like a ton of room for making improvements on the customer build front. Great. Just one quick follow-up on the data center, 1GW signings. Can you just say how many customers is that? Just trying to get a flavor for are these one or two large customers or just the megawatts per customer, if you will? Thank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. The 1GW we talk about is actually two customers.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nOkay. Good.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning, Carly.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nStart IRA. Good morning, Harry. Thanks for taking the time. Maybe just to start, IRA has been pretty topical throughout earnings season here as we look at some of the potential legislation coming through reconciliations. Can you just provide your latest views on the outlook both for transferability and the future of the tax credits that support a lot of these renewables projects? And can you just remind us in terms of what is actually baked into the financial plan from a transferability perspective?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, I'll take that one, Carly. We appreciate what Congress has ahead of them and how many priorities they'll be weighing as they work through the budget reconciliation process. We tend to look at this from the customer's perspective, and really our overarching objective is to maintain affordability for our customers, and that's what we've framed our advocacy around. The savings our customers receive from these energy credits fall right in line to what the president wants to do, which is delivering on his promise to reduce power bills across the country.\nAs you know, each one of these dollars that we earn in energy tax credits goes back to our customers. The nuclear tax credits are most important to us. Our well-run, low-cost nuclear plants earn over $500 billion of tax credits that go directly to reducing our customers' bills.\nNuclear has broad support in Washington, and we were pleased to see last week 26 representatives sign a letter stressing the importance of these nuclear tax credits and transferability to the president's objective of affordable and reliable energy. So we continue to work with folks in Washington to advocate to help our customers lower their bills through these credits, and we will continue to do that as they work through the process.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Appreciate that. And then maybe just as we think about the macro, is there anything that you're seeing or hearing from, in particular, your industrial customer base in terms of activity levels potentially being impacted by a higher degree of economic and policy uncertainty at this point?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nNow, it's obviously the topic everyone's talking about, Carly, and we're in close communication with our large customers as we always are. We've not seen any changes to their production schedules or expectations for 2025, but I would say there's somewhat of a cautionary stance, right, because everybody's waiting for the finalization of where the tariff policies might land, and their inputs, reliance on the global supply chain, all factor into that equation.\nSo I would say that today it's no change, no knee-jerk reactions from our customers, but kind of a cautionary stance, and that makes sense given where we are. So we think our 1.5% to 2% load growth for 2025 is intact fully, and the first quarter was evidence that we're right in line with that.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nWe also see the potential, Carly, for some of our customers to increase production because the tariffs actually help their business. Think about steel producers and those types of folks. So we're in contact with some of those customers as well.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's great. Very clear. Thanks so much for the time.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe currently have no further questions, so I'd like to hand back to Harry Sideris for some closing remarks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAll right. Thank you, everyone, and thank you for your investment in Duke Energy. Our team is standing by if you have any further questions during the day, and I hope everybody has a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

My name is Elliot. I'll be your coordinator today. If you would like to register a question during today's events, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. I would now like to hand over to Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q4 2024 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair and CEO, along with Harry Sideris, President, and Brian Savoy, CFO.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAbby, thank you and good morning everyone. Today we announced 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $5.90, finishing within our guidance range. 2024 was a year of great accomplishment and in many ways was defined by our response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We were moved by our community's outpouring of support and appreciation for our work during these historic storms. We also announced updated guidance today including a 2025 earnings per share range of $6.17 to $6.42 with a midpoint of $6.30.\nAn $83 billion capital plan, which drives 7.7% earnings-based growth. This capital represents infrastructure spending driven by growing jurisdictions and underpinned by robust regulatory processes such as integrated resource plans and approved grid investment spending. And finally, the continuation of our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate through 2029 with the potential to earn higher in the range as the years progress. Duke Energy enters the back part of this decade in a position of strength, and we're excited about the future. We're committed to delivering strong earnings growth and cash flows for our investors and superior service to our customers and communities. Before we get further into 2025 guidance, let me acknowledge our key achievements in 2024. Turning to slide 5, we continued our track record of regulatory execution with the approval of $45 billion of rate-based investments.\nThe regulatory work of the last two years minimizes rate case exposure in 2025 and 2026. We also advanced generation and transmission through our integrated resource plans and CPCN approvals. We continue to add solar in Florida with 1,500MW now in service. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the Piedmont Natural Gas JD Power. For the third consecutive year, the team earned the J.D. Power number one customer satisfaction ranking for natural gas service in the Southeast. Let me also just take a moment and acknowledge last month's announcement. Effective 1 April, Harry will become CEO and President of Duke Energy, and Ted Craver will assume the role of independent Chair of the Board. Therefore, today will be my last earnings call prior to retirement. It's been an honor to lead this company, and I appreciate everyone who's been on the journey with me.\nTo our employees, thank you for your commitment to our company and customers. To our shareholders, thank you for your investment in Duke Energy. The capital you provide powers our success and makes the work we do possible. To the analysts who cover our company, you play a valuable role in the investment community, and I've appreciated your thoughtful research. To Harry, thank you for being an incredible leader and advisor to me. As many of you know, Harry is a 29-year veteran of the company with experience in nearly every facet of our business. Harry raised his hand for every challenging assignment and has led this company to great success thanks to his commitment to our investors, our employees, and our customers.\nWith Harry as CEO and a strong, experienced leadership team around him, Duke Energy is well positioned to execute the next phase of our business strategy. I'm confident in all that the company will achieve. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Lynn, for your kind words and for your mentorship over many years. Through your leadership, Duke Energy has become an industry-leading, fully regulated utility that is ideally positioned for the growth ahead. I'm deeply honored by the confidence the Board has placed in me and the outpouring of support I've received from employees, industry leaders, and public officials, as well as from many of you in the investment community. It is hard to imagine a more compelling time to lead Duke Energy. We are passionate about our mission to power the lives of our customers and the vitality of our communities. I look forward to the opportunities ahead with optimism around our strategy, our operating culture, and our team. Turning to slide 6. I assume this new role at a pivotal point for our company and industry.\nWe share the new administration's commitment to ensuring the availability of reliable and affordable energy to meet our customers, our country's aspirations for technology, leadership, and economic growth. These priorities align with our business strategy, and we look forward to working with President Trump, both parties in Congress, and our states to build, operate, and protect the critical infrastructure needed to deliver on these goals. To that end, we are executing our all of the above generation strategy to meet growing demand and replace aging infrastructure. Our diverse mix of new resources includes dispatchable natural gas, which is essential to maintaining reliability and affordability for customers and complements our substantial investments in renewables.\nIn the Carolinas, we have started construction on over 2 GW of natural gas generation that was approved last year, and we are filing CPCNs for our next round of gas plants in the Carolinas and Indiana this quarter. We've secured turbines and gas supply for each of these sites, expediting our ability to connect megawatts to support economic development. Growth with our generation investments are accelerating. Important grid investments will continue to be a significant portion of our five-year capital plan, ensuring the reliability and resiliency of our system. With 320,000 line miles, we operate the largest transmission and distribution system in the nation. Working with stakeholders across our jurisdictions, we have tailored state-specific multi-year investment plans that strengthen the grid and ensure our ability to connect new large load customers.\nThe path forward is clear as we navigate this decade of record infrastructure build, and we remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders while meeting our customers' energy demands now and into the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks Harry and good morning everyone. As Lynn mentioned, our full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.90 was within our 2024 guidance range. For the year we saw top line growth from rate cases and riders across our jurisdictions, which was partially offset by the impacts of a historic hurricane season. For additional details on 2024 results, please refer to supporting materials in today's news release. Moving to Slide 8, we set our 2025 EPS guidance range at $6.17 to 6.42.\nThe $6.30 midpoint represents around 7% growth over 2024. This trend is a continuation of the 6% annual growth we've delivered since 2022. Within the electric segment, constructive rate case outcomes over the past two years will continue to drive results. In January we implemented our new multi-year rate plan in Florida and entered year two of our multi-year rate plan in North Carolina.\nWe'll see benefits from the DEC South Carolina rate case and our recently approved Indiana rate case, as well as growth from grid riders in the Midwest and Florida. In addition to rate activity, our plan assumes normal weather and retail sales growth of 1.5% to 2% in 2025. Growth in our gas segment will be driven by the Piedmont North Carolina rate case and annual rate mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee, as well as customer additions and integrity management investments. Finally, we expect results at the other segment to be driven by higher interest expense and modest share dilution to fund our growing capital plan.\nTurning to slide 9, beginning in 2027, we see an acceleration in volumes with annual load growth increasing to 3% to 4% at the enterprise. Our confidence in this forecast is underpinned by significant economic development projects coming online, particularly in the Carolinas, which we see growing at 4% to 5% over the same period.\nOur economic development pipeline reflects advanced manufacturing projects across multiple sectors as well as data centers. As a reminder, we take a risk adjusted approach as we evaluate which projects to include in our forecast. We incorporate just a portion of our total pipeline, focusing on those with letter agreements or in very late stage development. We then utilize discrete project level analysis to ensure confidence in when the projects will begin commercial operation and require energy supply.\nIn the near term. We're planning for annual load growth between 1.5% to 2% at the enterprise. Our forecast is supported by strong residential customer growth, improving industrial activity, and the expansion of new and existing businesses across our service territories.\nMoving to Slide 10, our five-year capital plan is now $83 billion, a 12% increase versus our prior plan. The majority of the increase is driven by generation investments reflected in our IRPs. These investments ramp up over the five-year period as load accelerates and we replace aging infrastructure. In addition, grid investments represent around 45% of our capital plan as we continue to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system.\nWith our updated capital plan, we now expect roughly 7.7% annual earnings base growth through 2029, a 50 basis point increase from our prior plan. Supporting this growth are efficient recovery mechanisms which are critical to maintaining a healthy balance sheet, mitigating regulatory lag, and smoothing customer rate impacts. The need for infrastructure to support our growing regions is not limited to this five-year plan. We have a long runway of investment opportunities that extend well into the next decade.\nTurning to slide 11, as we have demonstrated over many years, our commitment to our current credit ratings and a strong balance sheet will continue to be a top priority. We are targeting 14% FFO to debt by the end of 2025 and expect to improve above 14% over the five-year plan. Our long-term target provides over 100 basis points of cushion above our Moody's downgrade threshold and over 200 basis points above our S&P downgrade threshold.\nTo support these credit objectives and fund accretive growth, we increased equity funding to $6.5 billion over the next five years. This increase in equity funds, approximately 40% of our capital plan increase. We will continue to use our at the market and dividend reinvestment programs to efficiently fund our equity needs. As Harry mentioned, we've delivered many constructive regulatory outcomes over the past two years. These results enable timely recovery of investments and drive considerable improvement in our operating cash flow. In addition, we continue to see a strong market for energy tax credits. In 2024, we efficiently monetized over $500 million of credits that will benefit customers over time.\nBefore we open it up for questions, let me close with slide 12, with a strong track record of regulatory execution. We begin 2025 with confidence in our plan, and our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand its importance to our shareholders, and this year marks the 99th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. As we look ahead, our robust capital plan, strong customer growth, and constructive jurisdictions position us to deliver 5% to 7% growth through 2029, with the potential to earn higher in the range as load growth accelerates in the back end of the plan. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press STAR followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press STAR followed by two. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure your device is unmuted locally.\nFirst question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey guys, good morning. Can you hear me?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nYes, good morning.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Morning. So obviously you guys have pretty good visibility now. The CapEx is updated, financing is updated. You don't have a lot of regulatory uncertainty just on the EPS CAGR. You know, Brian, you mentioned this and Lynn mentioned it's just higher in the range. Comments in the prepared. Are we just basically guiding toward the top end of that range and with the credit metric targets you have out there, the over 100 basis points above Moody's, 200 basis points above S&P. Brian, can you just put a bit of a finer point on a specific target range versus the quote unquote over language you guys have out there. Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, I'll start with the EPS guide. Thanks for the questions. You know, as we look at our plan and see the load growth accelerating in 2027 through 2029, clearly the opportunity is there to earn in the top half of the range. And you're exactly right, that's what we're alluding to. It's based on the economic development pipeline we have that continues to grow by the day and the ability to serve this growing load. So we clearly see the 5% to 7% over the five years in the top half in the back end of the plan.\nOn the credit, we're very pleased. We finished 2024 at 13.9% FFO to debt in spite of the storms that we saw. We were expecting some pressure from the storms. We saw it, but we overcame it because the operating cash flow in our business is accelerating. That's based on regulatory outcomes that we've experienced over the past couple of years. As we look out in time, we've guided to above 14%, which gives us over 100 basis points, like you mentioned, above Moody's downgrade threshold and over 200 in S&P. We feel like that's the right target for now. Above 14. We will come up with specific guidance as the plan progresses.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. That's what I was trying to get at, Brian. So there will be a point in time when we can be a little bit more specific on the range that you target over the long term. That's what I was trying to really get to.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThat's correct.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, great. And then just on the load growth, obviously everyone is focused on the incremental load growth opportunities from hyperscalers, et cetera. The DeepSeek and Stargate stuff has been out there for a few weeks now. Just any change in tone, Lynn and Harry, from your customers, in your conversations as we're thinking about spending needs, speed to market, et cetera? Or is it kind of full speed, no pun intended, by the way.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, I'll take that one, Shar. Yeah, we feel very confident in our plan that we shared with you. And we have a wealth of opportunities in our discussions with the hyperscalers. They anticipated efficiency gains, so DeepSeek was not a surprise to them. They're full speed ahead. They're looking at the fact that these efficiencies may actually increase the demand for AI.\nSo we have not seen any pullback in anything they're planning on. In fact, we've seen a lot more discussions with accelerating some of their work. And speed, as you mentioned, is very important to them. And it's something that we pride ourselves on in working innovatively on solutions with them to find ways to bring them on quicker, which is what they want.\nWe'll continue to work with them, but we're not seeing any pullback. In fact, an acceleration in what they're discussing with us.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nMake sure the only thing I can.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, a little bit late. Sorry. You know, Harry might talk about what we see in the near term pipeline. There's a lot of the data centers that are really focused on cloud computing.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, that's a good point, Lynn. The near-term data centers that we're having under construction are really associated with cloud computing and expansion. And then as we move later into the plan, that's where some of the generative AI data centers are coming in and that's when we see the larger load growth.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Thanks, guys, so much. And Harry and Lynn, a big congrats on both your phase 2s. And Lynn, I know we're going to miss you a lot. It's been over 20 years of earnings calls, but it's going to be fun watching you take over board. So thank you much.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nMake sure.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now move on to Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning everyone. I'll echo Shar's comments. Congrats to Lynn. I counted the earnings calls. It's over 80, so.\nYeah, congrats all around.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nBut hey, just in the equity that you outlined for this new plan, you know, if you were to do kind of junior sub or hybrid or any type of like equity content, like instrument, does that change the equity needs or do you just kind of remain, do you expect this to kind of remain constant through the plan?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Nick, I would just frame the equity a little bit. You know, the equity funding in the context of a company our size is around 1%, 1.5% of the market cap, what we need on an annual basis, and you know, you would expect us to look for the most cost-effective shareholder-friendly solutions to fund that equity. As we look through the plan, and we're planning on using the ATM and the DRIP, but hybrids have continued to be attractive in the market. And you would expect us to look at this, and we will.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Yeah, definitely. Appreciate in context of the market cap, it's smaller.\nAnother question, just legislation in South Carolina has been a discussion point for many investors. Just curious, I assume none of that's kind of in your plan at this point. If you can maybe detail how it would impact the plan? Are you underearning in South Carolina? Could legislation in any way change your ability to execute differently on the resource plans you've put out there? Thank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Nick, this is Harry. I'll take that one. You know, we're always pleased to take part in energy policy discussions in our states, and South Carolina is no different. This is something that has been going on since last year and is making progress. It's really more tone setting around support for the dual state system that we operate, regulatory timelines, as well as the all of the above strategy and support for that. So we don't anticipate changes to our plans from the legislation, but it will make the tone in South Carolina stronger for us, and we support that and continue to work with our policymakers on that front.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nAll right, well, thanks a lot. See you soon.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now turn to David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. And Lynn, best wishes with your upcoming retirement and congratulations, Harry.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nLet me see. You know, hey, Brian, just to put you on the spot, we're going to see like is the top end possible in 2027 specifically or how are you thinking about it? Just within the specifics of the five year plan here.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nYou know, David, we're not going to get that specific on the day, but we do see load growth stepping up in 2027, and that's in our slides. And that's when a lot of these economic development projects that are under construction now will start taking energy and we'll start serving them. So, you know, that's the year where we do see this kind of ratcheting up of growth on the top line and it does present the opportunity.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Okay, great. Now that's helpful. Appreciate your not getting overly precise here with it, but. And then could you speak to just how much of a pipeline of data center activity that you're kind of seeing and working on in the background? It sounds like a lot of the growth is even beyond data centers that you're seeing crystallized in the state, which is great to see. And just curious, just the quantum of data center activity that's back there in the pipeline.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, David, we have a wealth of opportunity and not just data centers, but total economic development. We have advanced manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, so very diverse pipeline. Our near-term pipeline and advanced-stage pipeline is over 7GW. Our broader pipeline is at least double that and continues to grow. As Brian mentioned, we take a risk-based approach in what we put in our load forecast because we know these loads can move around and the timing of them. So we're really putting in the load forecast items that are either turning dirt or have letter agreements or near letter agreements. We continue to work with the ones in the pipeline to bring them forward and get them in the load forecast. We feel very strongly about our positioning for economic development and future growth, not just in data centers, but in other economic development projects.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep, excellent. Now that's helpful. I appreciate the color. And I was just, you know, is it possible that there could be even more, you know, upside, I guess, based on the pace of the development that you're seeing in your service territory? I know you've put obviously a lot of thought into this updated load growth. Of course, probability weighted it here. In terms of the pace of or the rate of change that you're seeing, is there potential for further upside over time?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nDavid, we're definitely confident in the plan that we shared with you, and we continue to work to bring as much additional load that we can, and we focus on making sure that we can serve that load reliably and affordably. Like I mentioned earlier, the speed is important. So how can we speed this up? And we continue to have those discussions with the hyperscalers, as well as the advanced manufacturing, and other economic development folks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nDavid, I would say as we look at the pipeline over the last year, it has continued to increase. And if we look out to 2029, for example, 50% of the pipeline is now data centers. So I do think the hard work of the team in bringing customers to our service territory will not stop. And we'll keep you updated along the way on how that translates into growth.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. Very helpful. Thanks so much for the color.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now return to Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Can you guys hear me alright?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nLauren.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, excellent. Awesome. Hey, good morning. Congratulations to both of you guys. Nicely done. And Lynn, all the best. It's been a pleasure over the years. Indeed, as they said. Absolutely. Look, maybe just shifting the conversation focus slightly, can we talk a little bit about cost savings, just the ability to drive more efficiencies out of the organization? It seems like a potential meaningful year ahead here. As you think about the opportunity. Again, maybe a question more for Harry, if anyone.\nHow do you think about the scale of what you could deliver here, especially against the backdrop of what seems like a reinflationary cycle from a variety of different factors and how that makes you guys relatively competitive? I appreciate your rates remain competitive against a number of different peers and metrics, but how do you think about that contributing to the backdrop of economic development in that 3% to 4% as well?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nHey Julian, it's Brian. I'm going to start and Harry's going to come back and add some additional color. But you know, we've been a cost leader in the industry and over the past many years leveraging technology, including AI process improvement and our scale to drive our cost to where they are. And you're recognizing that and thank you for that. I will say as our asset base grows to serve a larger customer base, O and M is going to increase.\nWe will continue our cost, our continuous improvements efforts to keep those increases much smaller than the additional customers we're serving or the revenue that comes with them. But over the time, as we increase our assets, you do see some slight increase in O and M and I suspect the whole industry is going to see it. We don't believe our position as a cost leader is going to change, and we're going to manage this very tightly. The long-term planning assumption we have is that it's around the 1% CAGR on O&M growth, and that's again much less than the assets and customers we're adding.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nAnd I would add, Julian, we have a strong continuous improvement culture. It's really in our DNA to find better ways to do things each and every day. And then our size and scale helps us negotiate better deals with our supply chain partners as well. A lot of improvement that we made using technology on our planning to make sure that we have long-term plans and locked up resources and materials to implement our growth strategy.\nSo that helps us manage our costs, and we're taking a programmatic approach to some of the generation build that we're doing. That's really saving us a lot of money and really allowing us to have definitive ways to implement this in an efficient and dependable manner. So we'll continue to do that. Brian mentioned technology and we talk about AI a lot of times on the load side, but that's another opportunity for us to continue to leverage those tools to make us more efficient in the future.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. All right, excellent. And then yeah, I thought we were going to talk a little bit more about the consolidation within the utilities here. If I could maybe press you guys a little bit further on there. But related, if I can, I'd also love to hear a little bit about customer deposits and how you think about that impacting rate base, starting point, and cumulative rate base. Certainly we've seen that with some of your peers of late. As load is ramping, is that a factor here that we should be thinking about? Especially as you think about the relative increase in rate base versus the CapEx.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJulie, let me jump in. You may be talking about some of the creative tariff structures for the large load, and I would think of that as being a little bit of noise for us given the scale of the company. So the rate-based numbers that we're sharing with you have a high degree of confidence in the amount of capital that's actually going to be deployed in our rate structure. And I think the team has done an extraordinary job developing creative tariff structures to attract large load in a way that protects our residential customers, our low-income customers, but also makes our state attractive for economic development.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. Yeah, I was thinking the 7.7 CAGR versus the 72 that you guys had previously. I would have thought maybe the translation of the, you know, between the 84 and 73 would have been a little bit higher, is what I was getting at earlier. If there was any offsets with it between the CapEx, the rate-based translation.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nI think we can go through more specifics with you offline.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nDon't take it offline.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Julian, I would say to you 12% rate base growth is incredibly strong and is a great underpinning of what we see. All that capital has been put through our regulatory processes. We have integrated resource plans in place, et cetera. And I would say to you that if I were to call the operators around the table, they'd like even more capital because the opportunities that we see to invest in our business are just really strong. So we'll keep going and delivering the returns that go with it.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. All right, guys, thank you very much. Best of luck again.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\nElliot, are you still there?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, sorry for the technical difficulties. We'll now turn to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nLynn. Best of luck going forward. Harry, congratulations.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nI was just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more, I guess, on what you're seeing, economic activity clearly in the Carolinas. A lot of good things happening there, but we've heard other peer utilities talk about, you know, improvements in the Midwest as well, and just wondering if you could touch on what you see in some of those areas. In your footprint.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Jeremy, I'll take that. In Indiana, we're seeing strong growth as well. The main focus that we've seen in our territory is around advanced manufacturing and facilities, manufacturing facilities expanding. We do have some data centers coming into the pipeline there, but not to the level that others are seeing in Indiana or that we're seeing in the Carolinas, but we continue to have discussions with them and have plans to bring as much economic development into Indiana as we can. It's a very constructive state. They do a great job of attracting industries and have a very business friendly environment and we work side by side with them to advance that.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. We're just wondering with the change in administration in DC if that impacts, I guess, your thought process at all. Granted you're making very long-term decisions and four-year terms aren't ways to really run the ship. Just curious if there's anything out of DC you know, particularly as it relates to, I guess, nuclear at this point. Seems like there's some maybe improving momentum. With regards to nuclear initiatives across the country.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJeremy, thanks for that question. I would say that as we think about the strategy of Duke Energy, it is a strategy that has been built to really serve customers for decades. As we look at this particular administration, we have shared aspirations with the federal administration, but frankly with our states as well to ensure that we keep delivering reliable power at low cost, and that we deploy generation and embrace this growth and economic development that our states are seeing in a way that demonstrates good speed to meet what the market requires, but also does it in a way that continues to underpin economic growth going forward. So that framework and that strategy that we're pursuing we think is a strong underpinning both at the federal level and the state level.\nIf I were to talk about nuclear in particular, we've been; we're a strong nuclear operator. We are pursuing how nuclear can be a part of our all of the above strategies. We get into the 2030s and beyond. You likely saw that we joined a consortium with TVA and others around a DOE grant. We think continuing to learn more on these technologies are important so that when we're ready to deploy, we have a high degree of confidence that there is a supply chain and engineering design constructors ready to go so that we can produce and operate these new technologies in a way that makes sense for customers. So we are deeply engaged at the state level and the federal level and see a lot of opportunity to support growth across the US.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning. Congrats, Lynn. Congrats, Harry. Unfortunately, my question is for Brian, so you guys get a little break here. Brian.\nIt may be the same question. I guess one is, and I don't want to belabor. I'm not looking to hold you down. I know you addressed a little bit with Shar on slide 11. You talk about FFO to debt to improve above 14% over the five-year plan. What's a reasonable cushion to assume that you would improve by? And the second question is more so, as you've talked about in the back end of the plan, you expect to be towards the high end of the 5% to 7% earnings growth. How do you think about the income statement? You know, maybe we raise the earnings growth rate or we work on improving the balance sheet maybe to the upside, you know, the upgrade trigger and it may be the same question. So I'll leave it there.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Anthony. You know, as we think about our FFO to debt and the size and scale of Duke Energy. I firmly believe 100 basis points of cushion from the Moody's downgrade threshold gives us flexibility to execute our plans with confidence and to deal with uncertainties that come our way. We've proven that over the past several years the rating agencies have been tremendously positive towards us. The regulatory outcomes that we've been able to work with our regulators on have provided that operating cash flow that the rating agencies are looking for and that consistency of top line revenues that support credit profile of ours.\nI would start with that. So, you know, the 14% is a solid number for Duke Energy given the size, scale, and diversity we have, and the rating agencies have been very supportive of us every step of the way. As we look through time, operating cash flow does accelerate, we're making more investments, those investments are turning into top-line revenues, and we see the 14% improving again.\nI'm going to provide more details as the plan progresses, but we feel very good about where we sit and how we see the five years playing out in front of us. You know, on the earnings question, I would just say that load growth in 2027, 2028, 2029 is a step change for us. It moves up from the 1½% to 2% we're seeing in 2025 and 2026 to 3% to 4% across the enterprise. That's a substantial step up, and it gives us clearly the opportunity to earn in the top half.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey team, good morning. Thank you for giving me time and echo. You know, the congratulations for Lynn and Lynn and Harry, all the best to you both.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, just certainly Brian, sorry, I'll apologize in advance because this is an annoying question, but when I think about the 2025 guidance and I compare it to the 2024 original guidance midpoint, it's a 5% EPS growth and obviously the 2025 guidance was lowered because of hurricane and one time stuff. So I'm just wondering, are you being conservative as it relates to 2026 or there are other headwinds like interest rates that is causing you to be at the low end versus the original 2025. Any color you could share there.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nDurgesh. I would start with.\nThe 630 is firmly within our 5% to 7%. As we've looked at our plan, we feel like it's the right level for us. But you see one item I'd point to in our in our electric walk up on the earnings. We have O and M increasing, and that is due to two things. One, we had.\nResources focused on the storms in the second half of the year. Right. So we didn't do some grid projects or some generation outages that we had planned. Those are going to be caught up in 2025. So we have some shifts in O&M from that. And we also set aside some O&M resources for additional storm costs because we've seen a more frequent set of storms impact our regions. And if you wanted to point to one thing, I would say that's a timing shift that's showing up in 25 that you might not have had in your model. But other than that, we feel like the 6.30 is right in line with where we need to be, and we have a high degree of confidence in achieving it.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. A little bit of O and M catch up and timing. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then finally, just shifting gears, looking at the ROE charts that you publish annually. Thank you for doing that. The Ohio, Kentucky, still considerably below your other subsidiary ROE averages. Just wondering what steps, and you have a footnote there, timing of rate cases on that. So what steps could you take to kind of get it to 9+%? Just any thoughts there? Thank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, thank you for that question, Durgesh. Yeah, we continually look and work in ways with rate cases and other mechanisms on our riders to improve that. We will continue to focus on that, working with our commissioners in the future.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Okay, thank you.\nGo ahead, Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThe only thing I would add is there can be some variability in ROE from year to year, as we think about whether it's an outage or we think about other activities that may be going on. I would ask you to evaluate those returns over a longer term period, and our objective is to earn at our allowed rate of return by aggressively pursuing rate cases and cost reductions in a way that position the utilities for success.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nSure.\nOkay. Yep. Yep. Absolutely. Thank you. Thanks again for the time.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our Q&A. I will now hand back to Lynn Good for any final remarks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nWell, thank you all. Appreciate the sentiments of congratulations for Harry and for me. But most of all, I appreciate your investment in Duke Energy. We feel like we've presented a strong long-term case for growth, for cash flows, and delivering returns for all of you and look forward to continuing that conversation. So thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

My name is Felicia, and I'll be your operator today. Following today's presentation, there will be a Q&A session. You may register for questions by pressing star, followed by one, on your telephone keypad. I will now hand you over to your host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations at Duke Energy. Please go ahead, Abby.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Felicia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair and CEO, along with Harry Sideris, President, and Brian Savoy, CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAbby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the work of our team responding to Hurricane Debby. The storm made landfall in Florida yesterday morning and caused outages for about 330,000 customers. We had crews in position over the weekend, and our teams are working around the clock to restore power. As of this morning, we've restored 90% of our impacted customers. Based on its current track, we expect the storm to impact the eastern and central parts of the Carolinas later this week.\nAlong with tropical storm-force winds, the system is bringing heavy rains. We're staging crews and implementing flood mitigation plans to be able to safely and quickly respond to expected customer outages. Now, let me turn to our Q2 results and the significant progress we're making across the company.\nOur simplified, fully regulated portfolio of Southeast and Midwestern utilities, combined with our strong track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, positions us well to deliver long-term value for shareholders. We have clear growth visibility driven by our $73 billion capital plan, which is focused on grid and generation investments to support the growing communities we serve. In a moment, Harry will provide an update on recent regulatory activity and operational highlights from across the business. And later in the call, Brian will walk through detailed financial results and our long-term sales outlook. But let me begin with the results for the quarter. Turning to slide five, today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.18, building on our strong start to the year.\nThese results are $0.27 above last year, driven by growth across our electric utilities and improved weather.\nWe continue to deliver consistent outcomes, carrying positive momentum into the back half of the year. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $585 to 610. We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028, based off a $598 midpoint for 2024. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Harry.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Lynn. Starting on slide six, we have a long history of working with stakeholders to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes that benefit our customers and deliver returns for our shareholders. Since the start of 2023, we've continued to build on this track record with approximately $75 billion of rate-based investments approved or settled across seven rate cases. I'm proud of the teams across the company that contributed to these impressive results. The outcomes support essential, critical infrastructure investments, acknowledge the rising cost of capital through higher ROEs, and allow us to meet our customers' demands for affordable, reliable, and increasingly clean energy now and into the future. Just last month, we received a final order in our DEC South Carolina rate case, and rates were updated 1 August.\nThe order supports our efforts to increase system diversity and reliability and enhance the customer experience.\nWe also filed a comprehensive settlement in our Florida rate case in July. The Florida settlement reflects a three-year, multi-year rate plan with rates effective in January. It focuses on continued grid modernization to serve population growth and harden the system, as well as investments in renewables. Hearings are scheduled to begin later this month, and an order is expected by the end of the year. Importantly, the outcomes in South Carolina and Florida demonstrate our commitment to affordability and continued focus on finding creative solutions to maintain low rates, including utilizing tax benefits to moderate increases. With solutions like these, we expect customer rates to remain below the national average. Turning to slide seven, we continue to collaborate with stakeholders across our jurisdictions.\nIn the Carolinas, the IRP process is advancing in both states.\nOur plans call for a diverse and increasingly clean energy mix that serves our growing customer base while preserving reliability and affordability. In mid-July, we were pleased to reach a constructive settlement in North Carolina with the public staff, Walmart, and CCBA. Importantly, the settlement adopts our near-term action plan, including renewables and natural gas investments, as well as early development activities for long lead-time resources. Hearings concluded in North Carolina yesterday, and South Carolina hearings will start in mid-September. We expect orders in both states by year-end. CPCN hearings will begin today in North Carolina on our request to construct more than 2GW of natural gas generation.\nThese advanced class units will be located at existing coal plants slated for retirement, ensuring continued reliability and complementing our significant investments in renewables.\nWe expect CPCN orders from the NCUC by the year-end, and pending approvals, construction is planned to start in 2026, with all units operational by 2028. Moving to Florida, we placed three new solar facilities in service through June. This keeps us on track to have 1,500MW of solar on the Florida system by the end of the year. Looking ahead, we plan to build 12 solar plants between 2025 and 2027, adding another 900MW of clean energy to the Florida grid. We also have two additional rate case hearings this quarter. In Indiana, hearings begin later this month, and in North Carolina, our Piedmont Natural Gas hearing begins in mid-September.\nBoth cases are based on investments we've made to serve our customers and to strengthen our system over the last several years.\nBefore I turn it over to Brian, I wanted to commend all our teammates for their unwavering focus on operational excellence, ensuring reliable and affordable energy to our customers every day. As Lynn mentioned, many of our teammates are actively working to restore power to our Florida customers impacted by Hurricane Debby. Restoration efforts are well underway, and we are committed to restoring power to all customers as quickly and safely as possible. In addition to responding to storms, this summer we experienced extreme heat across our jurisdictions. In fact, the Carolinas reached two new record summer peaks in a matter of weeks. Our team showed incredible preparation and collaboration across the company.\nI'm pleased to share that the grid and fleet performed well, and our employees met the needs of our customers and communities during these critical times. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide eight, we had a strong Q2 with reported and adjusted EPS of $1.13 and $1.18, respectively. This is up from adjusted EPS of $0.91 in Q2 last year. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.34. Growth was driven by rate increases in riders, higher sales volumes, and warmer-than-normal weather across our service territories, which is a complete reversal of the extremely mild weather in Q2 2023. Partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense and depreciation.\nMoving to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were down $0.02 compared to last year, as favorable rider revenue was offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. Finally, the other segment was down $0.05, primarily due to higher interest expense.\nTurning to slide nine, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our earnings profile for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, last year had an atypical earnings shape, with record mild weather in the first half of the year, which was mitigated with agility measures in the second half. With that in mind, the strong performance we've demonstrated so far this year is aligned with our planning assumptions. I'm incredibly proud for the team for delivering an impressive first half, and we are on track to achieve full-year results within our guidance range. Turning to slide 10, we were pleased to see weather normal volumes increase 1.9% versus last year, in line with our full-year projection. Customer growth remains robust, led by the Carolinas and Florida, which grew 2.4% through the first half of the year.\nWe're also encouraged to see improving residential usage across our jurisdictions.\nCommercial and industrial volumes were up over 1% versus last year, driven by strength in the commercial sector. Commercial sales volumes have exceeded our projections through the first half, offsetting a slower rebound in industrial sales. As economic development projects continue to come online throughout the second half of the year, we expect C&I load growth to accelerate. We operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions for both economic development and customer migration, which provide conviction in our 2% load growth forecast in 2024 and 1.5% to 2% load growth CAGR over the five-year planning horizon. Turning to slide 11, we are forecasting unprecedented growth in power demand from advanced manufacturing projects across multiple sectors, as well as data centers. As we evaluate which economic development opportunities to include in our forecast, it's important to remember that we take a risk-adjusted approach.\nWe utilize discrete project-level analysis to evaluate and probability-weight potential opportunities, resulting in a subset of projects being included in our current projections. We have a robust pipeline of projects that continue to progress and will be reflected in our plans when the projects mature. This pipeline provides a runway for growth well into the future. We are committed to serving this new load in a way that prioritizes reliability and affordability for all our customers. To that end, we recently executed MOUs with Google, Microsoft, Nucor, and Amazon to explore tailored solutions to meet large-scale energy needs and develop rate structures to lower the long-term cost of investing in clean energy technologies. These voluntary programs, which are subject to commission approval, would be open to any large customer and would include protections for non-participating customers.\nWe look forward to continued collaboration with all stakeholders as we work to meet the accelerating demand in our service territories. Turning to slide 12, we recognize the importance of a strong balance sheet as we advance our strategic priorities and fund investments that will be foundational to our growth. We are on track to achieve 14% FFO to debt by the end of this year, which represents 100 basis points of cushion to our Moody's downgrade threshold. Our constructive regulatory outcomes, combined with the collection of remaining deferred fuel balances, monetization of tax credits, and programmatic equity issuances, provide a clear line of sight to achieving our target. As disclosed in February, we expect to issue 500 million of common equity annually over the five-year plan via our DRIP and ATM programs. We've completed over half of our 500 million target, having priced $285 million year-to-date.\nWe've also completed approximately 80% of our planned long-term debt issuances for 2024. As we've demonstrated over many years, our commitment to our current credit ratings and a strong balance sheet is unwavering and will continue to be a top priority as we execute our growth objectives. Moving to slide 13, we remain confident in delivering our 2024 earnings guidance range of $585 to 610 and growth of 5% to 7% through 2028. We operate in constructive, growing jurisdictions, and the fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever. We are well-positioned to achieve our growth targets, which, combined with our attractive dividend yield, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. The first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nConstantine Lednev\n\nVP of Equity Research, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHi, good morning, team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Constantine.\n\nConstantine Lednev\n\nVP of Equity Research, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYou highlighted the economic development and growth, and kind of the geography is obviously favorable for data center activities, but you're still running on that 1.5% to 2% load growth projection. At what point do you feel you can reassess these assumptions, and what could that mean for the capital plan? Can you see some out-of-cycle updates kind of going towards the tail end of the year?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Constantine. It's a great question and one that we continue to be encouraged about. So if we dial the clock back, a year ago, we were projecting a 0.5% load growth CAGR over our planning horizon, and then economic development opportunities began to surface and continue to show up. We moved to 1.5% to 2%. On a base of sales of over 200,000GWh a year at Duke Energy, that 1.5% to 2% CAGR is quite impressive, and we're very pleased to see that kind of growth. I would say that with the economic development pipeline we're looking at today, we're trending to the high end of that 1.5% to 2%.\nAs we look at our plans, we're forecasting to update the full financial plan with the load growth and the capital supported, along with the earnings per share outcome from those elements in February, which is our normal cadence. We will definitely keep you updated along the way as the economic development pipeline progresses, but I will say that we continue to be encouraged, and every time we look at our load update, it deepens as far as the load growth outlook. Most of that growth is later in the decade, so it kind of coincides with, as we roll the plan to 2029, it will make more sense to show that load growth over time.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nConstantine, this is Lynn. The only thing I would just emphasize that Brian touched upon is we have continued to see economic development growth. I know the chart that we've shared with you is consistent with Q1, but we are continuing to see growth in that economic development pipeline. And so our thought is that we will provide a comprehensive update, both on load and capital, in February, but continue to give you a sense of economic development progress over the balance of the year. So the bottom line is we have a wealth of growth opportunities and feel like we're really well-positioned to take advantage of them.\n\nConstantine Lednev\n\nVP of Equity Research, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYep, sounds great. Totally understood. Maybe separately, can we get an update on nuclear PTCs from just a timing and monetization perspective, given some of the importance that they play towards the credit metric targets and any other pieces we should be mindful of?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Constantine. I'll take that as well. This is Brian. On the nuclear PTCs, we were hoping to see guidance by mid-year, and that obviously has not transpired. The treasury continues to actively issue guidance on elements of the IRA. We see that week in and week out. We still expect the formal guidance for the nuclear PTCs by the end of this year.\nBut I will say that we operate 11 very low-cost nuclear plants that have delivered extremely well over the first half of the year. These plants have earned about $250 million of nuclear PTCs through June. That's recorded in our financial statements. Our plans are to test the market on monetizing these PTCs in Q3.\nSo you can expect us to report on that later in the year, but we don't feel like the delay in the guidance from our early expectations will have any impact on our credit in 2024.\n\nConstantine Lednev\n\nVP of Equity Research, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. That's very helpful. I will come back in queue. Appreciate the question.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays, please. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, Nick.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, morning, morning. So hey, good to see the settlement in Florida. I was just wondering on DEI with evidentiary hearings at the end of this month, do you think you can settle that case ahead of those hearings, and how should we think about that potential? Thanks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThanks for that question, Nick. This is Harry. We're always open to settlement discussions. That hearing is later this month. As we get closer to that hearing, we'll continue to look for opportunities to have those discussions. But we also feel very strong about the case that we've put together: strong customer benefits, the investments for the growth in Indiana, and the economic development in Indiana.\nSo we feel comfortable either path on a constructive outcome.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nSo we'll keep you informed, Nick, as we get closer to the hearing. But as Harry indicated, a strong case and anxious to move through this process in Indiana.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThat's great. We'll be watching it. And then I guess just when I think about your roll forward, which I know is not till the fourth quarter, just kind of wondering how you're kind of tracking within this kind of 5% to 7% EPS glide path. When I try to kind of conceptualize some of your sensitivities that you laid out on slide 22, interest rates are down. You did mention some pressure higher on the 1% to 2% load growth assumption, and the stock's also up, which helps the accretion of your equity program. Just where are you tracking in the 5% to 7%, and then what headwinds should we be kind of considering versus what I outlined right there?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Nick. This is Brian again. So as we look through our five-year plan, we definitely see more tailwinds than headwinds, right? This accelerating load growth that's pointed more towards the back end of the plan clearly provides a tailwind. Consistent investment in critical infrastructure across our jurisdictions that are supported and approved by multi-year rate plans or grid riders for multiple years to come provide that transparent growth. And a stabilizing interest rate environment, frankly.\nThose three things give us a high degree of confidence in the 5% to 7%, at a minimum extending that, but also presents the opportunity to earn at the top end of that range later in the period. I will say that the things to watch would be an economic downturn, right? That affects any utility. It would affect our communities that we serve, and it would affect our customer demand.\nSo that's something that we definitely keep our finger on the pulse with our customers, understanding where they are and what pressures they're seeing. But that probably would, Lynn, I don't know if you would add anything to that.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYou know, Nick, I would say we are comfortably positioned within the 5% to 7% and feel like it's strongly positioned when you look at this economic development for a sustained period. We've given you 5% to 7% through 2028. As Brian indicated, we see a lot of growth in that 2027, 2028 period with the economic development pipeline. So that gives us the opportunity to earn at the higher end of the range if those projects mature at the pace we expect and if we continue to add them, which has certainly been our experience here in 2024. So we'll continue to update you every step of the way and are anxious to provide an update in February that will not only capture this economic development we've seen in 2024, but also give us a chance to update capital.\nWe've produced a lot of cash flow. That balance sheet is strengthening in 2024 as well. So we're very optimistic about the future.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for all those thoughts. Appreciate the time.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Nick.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Julien. Your line is open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you guys for the time.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHey, Julien. Welcome back.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Hey, maybe just following up on this focus on industrial growth. I mean, you guys outlined these MOUs here. Can you comment to the extent to which that is incremental versus reflected in that projection on load growth in 2027, 2028? I imagine it's pretty substantively excluded.\nAnd then how do you think about the remaining timeline on reaching this MOU finality, if you will? And how do you think about the risk sharing within that, right? I mean, I know you mentioned Nucor here. Presumably, there's some sort of ability to leverage an SMR directly with some of these counterparties. How do you think about what that structure would look like for you guys? Just to clarify that ahead of time on your risk tolerance relative to ensuring that there's appropriate risk sharing.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJulien, thanks. Let me take a shot. I'm sure Harry and Brian will have something to add to it. So as we think about this economic development pipeline, over the period that we've shared with you through 2028, data centers represent about 25% of that pipeline. But as we get out to 2030 and beyond, that 25% grows. And so we already see a lot of growth in the economic development pipeline for data centers moving into 2030 and beyond.\nSo I would think about this MOU as not only further catalyzing how we might serve customers that are in the pipeline, but our hope also is that those customers will have an interest in expanding in our service territories as we find a way to continue to meet their needs on sustainability, but also bringing resources on. So the discussions are early.\nI think there's a clear understanding that we are trying to do a couple of things here. We're trying to meet the load. We're trying to meet their sustainability goals. We're trying to do so in a way that protects retail customers. We're trying to meet their timelines. And I would say the discussion is very constructive.\nAnd the notion of risk sharing is something that we're very clear on and have lots of experience in talking with customers about. And so I think that element of the discussion is going well as well. So we'll keep you informed as we start to mature some of these agreements into something that's more definitive. There will be disclosure, and we'll continue to update you on the economic development pipeline as we go. So I'll pause there and see if Harry or Brian has anything they'd like to add.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nNo, I would just add, Julien, the MOU has really amped up the constructiveness of our discussions with these customers and a lot of excitement on their end for these ACE tariffs, the clean energy piece of it. So I think this is going to pay dividends as we work with them closer into the future.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. And the idea here being selecting either some kind of SMR offtake or some kind of clean energy offtake that would specifically not impact other customers? Just when you think about what the MOU comprises.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. So Julien, when you talk about nuclear, there are a number of structures that we're talking about. They have an interest, obviously, in carbon-free generation, and nuclear represents an around-the-clock option. But we all recognize we're in the early stages of development. So is there a structure? Is there premium pricing?\nIs there some method of equity investment? Is there some structure that would encourage the development at perhaps a more rapid pace or sooner because of the partnership? So all of that is being explored as we talk with them, and we're anxious to continue to develop it. I think the other thing I would note, which Julien, of course, you're aware of, this generation plan is moving through the Carolinas. A lot of discussion already on carbon-free generation like the SMRs.\nWe would also expect that every element of the agreements that we would reach with the tech companies or Nucor would also go through a commission process to make sure that they're comfortable with the structure. But they have been very, very positive on the fact that we're exploring these discussions because it's a win-win for economic development, for bringing clean energy to the states, and also for doing so in a way that reflects protection of retail customers.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nWonderful. I'll leave it there. Best of luck, guys.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Jeremy. Your line is open.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning. Just wanted to dive back in, I guess, on the load trends as you laid out in the prepared remarks and how commercial and industrial are tracking versus expectations here today, and just what you're seeing on the ground as far as trends over the back half of the year there.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Jeremy. So we guided to 2% load growth in 2024, and we're tracking on top of that. The residential growth has been robust. We've added more customers in the first half than in any first half we've looked at in any kind of recent years. About 80,000 retail customers added to our system in the first half of the year, which just put in residential kind of right in line with our 1.5% to 2% growth for 2024. Commercial has been higher than our expectations.\nWe came into the year thinking a modest growth in commercial, but we've seen much more in the commercial sector. This is a combination of data center usage, healthcare, universities, and just a broad mix of commercial companies that have higher demands and largely supporting this higher population that are in our regions.\nThe industrial sector has not rebounded as fast as we anticipated. We continue to be in dialogue with our industrial customers, and they're just taking a cautionary stance. The fear of recessions out there, you don't want to get overextended. The labor market has been tight, so there's been a challenge to get all the shifts staffed appropriately.\nSome of our customers are taking the opportunity just to pull back a little bit. They're still signaling a rebound later in 2024 or maybe early 2025, but we feel like the mix might be a little different, but the growth in 2024 is on top or better than our expectations.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJeremy, the only thing I would add to that is this industrial rebound kind of pushing into later 2024, 2025 has also been influenced by interest rates. It's what we're hearing from customers. And it's primarily what I would call our legacy industries of textile, and paper that are feeling the pressure. And we continue to track with all of that industrial volume we're expecting from economic development. That is exactly on track. So it's a little bit of an old industry, new industry story that we're seeing in the Carolinas in particular and a little bit in Indiana.\nBut overall, we're tracking to the growth for the year and, as we've said many times, feel bullish on the economic development pipeline.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful there. Thank you for that. And then just wanted to go to November here. We have elections coming up. North Carolina has a gubernatorial race.\nAnd just wondering, any thoughts you could share with regards to if different outcomes could impact the IRP or just there's a lot of stakeholder agreement here, and so you wouldn't expect too much change?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nNow, you know, Jeremy, no matter what happens in November, our objective is the same, which is to keep serving our customers well with reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy. We don't expect that election to have an impact on the rulings we would receive in the Carolinas, or in Indiana, or in the Piedmont case. And you should know, and just reaffirming that we believe a bipartisan approach working on both sides of the aisle for energy policy has served our companies well, every utility well over time, and that'll continue to be our posture as we move into this election. So Harry, would you add anything on IRP progress?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. You know, we wrapped up the Carolinas IRP yesterday. In July, we entered into a very constructive settlement with public staff and some other intervening parties. And I think that helped speed the process up. It was very efficient. I got to spend some time there last week, and the commission was very engaged in providing this energy transition affordably and reliably to our customers, which aligns to what we're doing.\nSo we feel like our plan that we set forth meets the needs of our customers in North Carolina, and we'll work to see an order later this year on that.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, team.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nMorning, Anthony.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, just a couple of questions. I guess you laid it out nice on slide six. Harry went over it on the regulatory execution. I'm just curious, very impressive there. Just curious, has there been a change in the company's regulatory strategy over maybe the last five years given how strong the outcomes have been in the last two years? Or just it's a great track record, and I'll leave it there.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYou know, Anthony, thank you for appreciating that. You know, when I think about regulatory outcomes, it is an absolutely everyday assignment at Duke Energy because it includes operational excellence that we serve our customers well, reliably, and affordably. It also includes work in the legislature to make sure that energy policy is clear and that we have an expectation of how to go in the future. It's stakeholder engagement. That includes customers, that includes policymakers, that includes community leaders, etc. So I think you saw us undergo a bit of an organizational change a few years ago where we put CEOs of the Carolinas and CEOs of Midwest and Florida, Alex and Julie, in place to really continue to fine-tune our approach around stakeholder engagement and clarity around roles and responsibilities in the regulatory area.\nIt's been a long-standing history at Duke Energy, but appreciating this complex and often polarized environment, we think that additional focus has been helpful to us. We take the responsibility of serving customers well every day very seriously. That's the first job at Duke Energy. We have the deepest respect for the oversight of our commissions and policymakers, and work hard every day to serve our customers well and to please those that have that awesome responsibility to keep energy policy moving in our states.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Then on load growth, I mean, obviously, you guys talk about it, and I appreciate the language, Brian. You said of moving it, giving the Duke footprint to 1.5% to 2%. Given the load growth, the long-lived asset, and planning cycle that's required, does the company believe you'll start seeing more frequent IRP filings, that whether you're on a two or three-year cycle, that that may have to condense given the changes that the system is seeing right now?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nYou know, it's a good question, Anthony. We have a pretty frequent cadence already on IRPs, which in the Carolinas, it's every other year. Florida, it's every year in a 10-year site plan. And then in the Midwest, there's various time horizons that are pretty frequent as well. But I think that what we did in Carolinas this year, we had an August filing. We updated it in January because we saw increasing load growth, and we felt the commissions need to see this in real time.\nSo maybe not a full IRP filing each and every year, but we could see more frequent updates as we learn more about the load growth over time to plan the appropriate resources because you do need plenty of lead time to gear up these generation plans and execute them.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThe only thing I would add to.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nOkay.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Anthony.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nI guess we might.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah.\nThe only other thing I would add on that notion of updating the IRPs is we work very closely with the states on economic development. So it's a partnership between Duke Energy and the economic development engines of each state. And so there's a lot of understanding on the part of the state of what's coming. And that gives us an opportunity to have on-the-ground discussions about what's needed with transmission and generation. And then the IRPs, like the regulatory filings that follow that. So we intend to continue to stay really closely linked with our states as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe just to quickly follow up on the.\nHi.\nHi. Thanks so much. Just wanted to quickly follow up on a couple of the previous comments on the Carolinas IRP. Appreciate all the color on the North Carolina process. I guess just as you look towards the South Carolina piece with hearings starting next month, is there any potential for settlement there as well?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYou know, Carly, I appreciate that question. I think it's a little early to tell. We're still in the middle of a procedural schedule in South Carolina where rebuttal testimony is due. In a week or so, there's a surrebuttal process that goes on in South Carolina, and then hearings occur in mid-September. As Harry indicated, we believe the plan that we've put forward in both states meets the requirements of the objectives that both states have set out. As we've said many times, our objective is to give both states the opportunity to put their fingerprints on this plan in a way that serves their needs and continues to deliver the benefits of scale that Duke Energy has offered to customers over a long period of time.\nSo we'll keep you informed as we get deeper into the procedural process, but South Carolina is lagging a bit.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Okay. Appreciate that. And then the follow-up was just on the nuclear side. I know you guys made some comments on nuclear before, but could you just refresh us sort of on your latest thoughts on the technology and the timing for new nuclear to potentially have a place in the resource planning process?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nCarly, the SMR is included. Harry, do you want to talk a little bit about how we've approached it with the IRP?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, absolutely. In North Carolina, we've included that in our near-term action plans for these long lead item projects like SMRs. We have it slated in our IRP to come online 600MW in 2035 at our Belews Creek station. So we're waiting for approval from the commission to move forward with those actions to continue the development as we work through technology selection as well as other construction needs. But we have a site selected, and we're working through that process. And this IRP filing has all that in there. And the public staff, and the settlement has agreed to those items.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nCarly, I would just add, I think you appreciate that Duke has a long-standing nuclear history here in the Carolinas, 11 units. We also have customers in both states that are interested in a sustainable future. We have states who appreciate the economic development that nuclear investment has represented for the communities. So we will work through this in a thoughtful way, but do believe that continued expansion of nuclear here in the Carolinas could make sense as we get into the 2030s and beyond. And frankly, we're hearing some conversation in Indiana as well on whether nuclear at some point could fit into that program. That, I would say, is probably lagging a little bit on timing, but I think there's a recognition that nuclear could be a part of the future and will manage it in a very disciplined way.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for the comments.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions, so I'll turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing remarks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nWell, thank you. Thanks, everyone, for your questions today, for your investment in Duke Energy. We're available, investor relations and members of the team, for questions if there's any follow-up that we can provide. And really appreciate the engagement today and appreciate, as I said, your investment in Duke Energy. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you all for attending. You may now disconnect your line."

My name is Lydia, and I'll be your operator today. If you'd like to ask a question during the Q&A, you can do so by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I'll now hand you over to Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Lydia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q1 2024 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair and CEO, along with Harry Sideris, President, and Brian Savoy, CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAbby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, delivering a strong start to the year. These results are $0.24 above last year, driven by growth from rate activity across our jurisdictions, strengthening retail volumes, and improved weather. We remain confident in our outlook and are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $5.85 to 6.10 and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028. We have a clear path forward as a fully regulated utility operating in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing areas of the country. Our strategy will drive continued growth underpinned by our five-year, $73 billion capital plan, efficient recovery mechanisms, and track record of constructive regulatory outcomes. Moving to slide five, our jurisdictions are experiencing unprecedented growth from population migration and economic development.\nWe're committed to meeting these increasing customer demands through an all-of-the-above strategy that preserves affordability and reliability as we decarbonize. In doing so, 2024 marks an important stage in our fleet transition as we move from the planning phase to project execution. In Florida, we're on track to have 1,500MW of utility-owned solar in service by year-end. And in our recently filed 10-year site plan, we expect to more than triple the amount of solar on our system by 2033. In the Carolinas, we're completing annual solar procurements that will add approximately 1,500MW to the grid each year, beginning in 2027. These investments are part of our goal to have 30,000MW of regulated renewables on our system by 2035. In the Carolinas, we filed certificates of public convenience and necessity in March to build more than twogigawatts of new advanced-class natural gas generation.\nThe filings with the NCUC include two simple-cycle combustion turbines and one combined-cycle plant, consistent with the Carolinas Resource Plan. Pending regulatory approvals, construction is planned to start in 2026, with all units operational by the end of 2028. Each of these new facilities will be sited at existing coal plants and will provide needed dispatchable generation when those units retire. We recognize there's a lot of attention on natural gas and its role in achieving net zero. We believe natural gas must be a part of not just Duke's, but our nation's energy transition strategy. In the face of unprecedented demand from AI data centers, chips manufacturers, and other economic development, natural gas remains an essential tool to provide reliable and affordable energy for customers and complements our substantial investments in renewables and energy storage.\nAs you know, EPA recently released rules that place limits on certain baseload generation sources. While the fate of this rule will soon be in the hands of the courts, we will continue to advocate for solutions to reliably and affordably serve the growing energy needs of our customers and communities. As we step into this period of significant infrastructure build for the company, we recently appointed Harry Sideris, President of Duke Energy. As president, Harry has responsibility for all of our electric and gas utilities, including all aspects of operations and regulatory activities. Harry is a 28-year company veteran and has an exceptional track record of accomplishment and leadership across many functions. He began his career in generation, led environmental health and safety, served as the president of our Florida utility, and most recently led transmission, distribution, and customer operations, including economic development.\nHarry is a trusted member of the executive leadership team, and in his new role, he remains committed to delivering value to our customers and our investors. I'm pleased to introduce him for the first time on an earnings call in his new role as President. With that, Harry, I'll turn it over to you to go through the jurisdictional highlights.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Lynn, for the introduction. I'm excited for the new role and look forward to leading our utilities and operations through this important time in our energy transition. Turning to slide six, meeting our customer's expectations requires collaboration with regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders, and we continue to make great progress across our jurisdictions. Starting with South Carolina, hearings begin 20 May in our Duke Energy Carolinas rate case. Since our last rate case in 2018, our rate base has increased by almost $2 billion, driven by investments to improve reliability and resiliency, and meet the growing energy needs of our customers. We expect new rates to be implemented 1 August. Shifting to Florida, in April, we filed our next three-year multi-year rate plan that will begin in 2025.\nThe plan includes grid investments to enhance reliability, decrease outages, and shorten restoration times, building on Duke Energy Florida's best reliability year in over a decade in 2023. The filing also covers investments to add new solar and battery, as well as improve the efficiency of our current generation assets. Even with the requested base rate increases, we expect overall customer bills to decrease in 2025 as fuel underrecovery, storm restoration costs, and legacy purchased-power contracts expire at the end of the year. In Indiana, we filed our first rate case in four years in April. Since our last case, we've invested more than $1.6 billion to support the state's growing population and increase the resiliency and security of the grid. The case includes a four-test year and two rate step-ups starting in the Q1 of 2025, smoothing the impact to customers.\nFinally, Piedmont Natural Gas also filed a rate case in North Carolina in April. The request covers significant infrastructure investments to comply with federal safety regulations, enhance the customer experience, and provide safe, reliable natural gas service. As part of the filing, Piedmont is also requesting concurrent rate reductions for pass-through natural gas costs, which will help mitigate the impacts to the customer bill. We plan to implement interim rates 1 November, with the final order expected in January. We've made great progress in the Q1, advancing rate cases and fleet transition projects across our footprint. As we embark on this period of significant infrastructure build, we have confidence that our investment plan will deliver sustainable value to shareholders and 5% to 7% earnings growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide seven, our Q1 reported and adjusted earnings per share were $1.44. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 and 1.20 last year. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.29 compared to last year. Growth was driven by rate increases, higher volumes, and improved weather. Partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense and depreciation on a growing asset base. As a reminder, residential decoupling was in effect for both of our North Carolina utilities this quarter, which moderated the impact of a mild winter in the Carolinas. Moving to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were flat compared to last year. And finally, the other segment was down $0.5, primarily due to higher interest expense. With a strong start to the year, we're on track to deliver on our 2024 EPS guidance range.\nTurning to slide eight, we were pleased to see solid growth in weather normal volumes this quarter versus last year. Customer growth remains robust in our jurisdictions, led by the Carolinas and Florida, which both grew 2.4%. We're also encouraged to see improving residential usage across our jurisdictions. Commercial and industrial volumes were up over 1% versus last year, driven by strength in the commercial sector. We're closely monitoring economic trends and remain in regular conversations with our largest customers. Notably, these customers continue to convey expectations for growing power needs in the second half of the year. Combined with new economic development projects coming online, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the year. Turning to slide nine, the impact of economic development activity in our jurisdictions cannot be overstated. We are gearing up to serve up to 18,000 gigawatt-hours of additional load from these projects in 2028.\nThis is up 2,000 gigawatt-hours from the projection we just shared in February, demonstrating the strength of our economic development pipeline. As a reminder, we take a risk-adjusted approach to our forecast and generally only include the most mature and committed projects. We've included a few photos that showcase the impressive size and scale of the construction activity underway. Pictured at the top of the slide is the substation that will serve Wolfspeed's $5 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The new factory will bring about 1,800 jobs to the state. We've recently energized the initial transformer bank in the substation, and Wolfspeed expects the facility to begin production by early next year. This project and others across many sectors, including batteries, data centers, EVs, and pharmaceuticals, to name a few, are making tangible progress and will provide meaningful load growth in our service territories.\nWe operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions for both economic development and customer migration, which underpins our confidence in our 2% volume growth forecast in 2024 and 1.5% to 2% growth rate over the five-year planning horizon. Turning to slide ten, we recognize the importance of a strong balance sheet as we execute one of the sector's largest capital programs. We are on track to achieve 14% FFO to debt by the end of this year, which represents 100 basis points of cushion to our Moody's downgrade threshold. The biggest driver of our FFO improvement is the implementation of the North Carolina rate cases, which add nearly $700 million of annual revenues. Combined with the collection of remaining deferred fuel balances, monetization of tax credits, and programmatic equity issuances, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our target.\nAs disclosed in February, we expect to issue $500 million of common equity annually over the five-year plan via our DRIP and ATM programs. We're off to a great start, having priced just over $100 million year-to-date. We also completed approximately 65% of our planned long-term debt issuances for 2024 in Q1, which helps to de-risk our plan. We've raised $4.6 billion in long-term debt with an average interest rate of 5.19% and an average tenor of 13 years. We've been strategic in our approach, reducing floating rate exposure amid a rising rate environment and further diversifying our investor base with a euro offering in April. As we have demonstrated this quarter and over many years, we are committed to our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet as we execute our growth objectives.\nMoving to slide 11, we remain confident in delivering our 2024 earnings guidance range of $585 to 610 and growth of 5% to 7% through 2028. We operate in constructive, growing jurisdictions, and the fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever. We are well-positioned to achieve our growth targets for the year, which combined with our attractive dividend yields, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, it's star followed by two. Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning, Shar.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Shar.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nMorning. Morning. Obviously, you guys reaffirm that 1.5% to 2% long-term growth assumptions, but also kind of concurrently kind of increase the economic development activities. I mean, obviously, we've seen several of your peers raise long-term growth assumptions, kind of lever to that C&I customer backdrop, including large data centers coming into their states. I guess, Lynn, what's the trigger point and timing on when you will maybe re-guide around load growth, which to us seems conservative, especially in the Carolinas? And could the opportunities kind of be accretive to your EPS growth guide like we heard from one of your southeastern peers? Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nShar, I'll take that. We continue to be encouraged by the pace of economic development opportunities. I mean, every time we do a new load forecast, we see more opportunities, and that's demonstrated by what we showed this morning. We typically update our full financial plan in February, right? We feel like updating load without updating the CapEx to support the load might be a bit disconnected and not show the full picture. But we do see clearly more tailwinds than headwinds as we look at growth over time. All of this sign is a good, all of this points to a good sign of long-term EPS growth. I would point to, on the EPS side of things, load growth, the capital opportunities for the energy transition. All this gives us a high degree of confidence in our 5% to 7%.\nAs we look throughout the plan, probably later in the plan, pushes us in the higher end of the range. It gives us the opportunity if all this transpires. We are taking a very calculated position on our load growth, and we want to be smart about updating the plan prematurely before we put the capital to support the new load.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nShar, one thing I might add is just to give you a metric on this. 1,000 gigawatt-hours represents 0.1% increase in our load growth. So we are trending to the higher end of that 1.5% to 2%. And we'll continue to update you during 2024 if we see more opportunities materialize. And as Brian said, we'll do a comprehensive update in February. I think the other thing I would note, given the size of our company, I believe the move from about 0.5% load growth to 1.5% to 2% is quite strong, and we're proud of that, and we'll keep going. But I think that metric of 1,000 gigawatt-hours being about 0.1% should help you get a sense of how we're moving.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Okay. So as we head into February's update, appreciate that. And then maybe just one more question for Brian. Brian, obviously, you guys have kind of a perpetual preferred, which has a dividend reset coming, I think, in September. What's the plan, I guess, to refinance it? What's better than your numbers? Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nNow, it's a good question, Shar. And it's clearly in our financing plan to address that perpetual preferred. And we're going to look at all the options available in preserving the balance sheet support that that product presents, as well as what the market's paying for. We saw some deals yesterday that are encouraging. We'll look at those and other tools as we move toward September. But repricing the preferred at the current rates doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So we're looking at ways to take that out and use other tools.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. Fantastic, guys. And Harry, congrats on your first of many earnings calls. Big congrats. Thanks, guys.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning, David.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nIf you could elaborate. Morning. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the new EPA rules and how that could affect some of your IRPs, just longer-term resource plans that are in flight right now.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nDavid, thanks. I'll take that. To your point, we're looking very carefully at the rule, but also looking very carefully at how we meet the growth in our service territory, continue to decarbonize, and maintain an eye on affordability and reliability. We have CPCNs in front of North Carolina right now, and those processes will continue over the course of 2024. They're very public. We think that'll be a great opportunity to really present the case for how we can meet this load within all of the above strategy. We are also in the process of doing an IRP in Indiana, and we'll reflect the implications of the new rule in that IRP. So I would indicate that we're continuing to study what this might mean.\nWe're a week into it, looking at everything from gas to co-firing to conversions, all with an eye on reliability and affordability, and recognizing that meeting this load, addressing an aging coal fleet is a part of the formula that we'll consider. I think litigation is something that's also being looked at across the industry because there are a number of questions within the rule, and we're evaluating that as well.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thanks for that color. And then just following up on the topic of load growth and kind of what CapEx could come from that, could you maybe elaborate on your thinking there as you do find more economic development opportunities and potential upside to the load growth forecast? What does that mean for your capital plan in terms of could there be further generation? But also maybe on the T&D side, if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about what T&D expansions and upgrades might come out of what we're seeing in longer-term load growth increases.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nNo, David, this is Brian. I'll take that. It's a really good question, and one we evaluate every single day here at Duke Energy as we find a way to serve our customers in a reliable and affordable way. We know we're going to need more resources because we're seeing more demand on the system. Like your point, it's not just generation. It's T&D investments, too. The teams across Duke Energy evaluate how we're going to put the loads in the best places. As well as when we talk about economic development opportunities, we present customers with the places that have generation capacity and T&D capacity to support them or the modest upgrades that we need. As we look out in time, we see an expanding CapEx profile. We've guided $73 billion for five years, but over the 10-year plan, $170 to 180 billion.\nThat contemplates higher resource needs to serve this increasing load. We're going to do so that drives growth for our investors as well as preserves a strong balance sheet. I think, like I said to Shar's question, we want to bring all this together in our next financial update as we roll the plan to 2029 that will have a fulsome view of both capital, load demand, as well as how we're going to finance all that.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nDavid, the one thing I would add, we have been really successful over the last many years in developing modern regulatory mechanisms for grid investment. And those grid investments are running in every jurisdiction to really prepare for this generation transition, and that will continue. So you look at our next five years, largely grid investments. And so we'll keep that going at a pace that makes sense. And to just emphasize Brian's point, we have such a wealth of opportunity here in both generation and grid investment that we see some sustained growth out of our jurisdictions in a very constructive way, delivering returns to shareholders over a long period of time. So we're excited about what this growth potential represents.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Very helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Evercore\n\nHey. Good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. I just had to clarify.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Evercore\n\nHey. Good morning. I just had two clarification questions. First, can you remind in North Carolina how, if any, there are sort of intertwinings between the CPCN process and your IRPs? And then second, the CPCN ads, will that be incremental to your current CapEx plan, or is that already incorporated into the current CapEx plan? Thank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nSo Harry, you want to talk about the CPCN and IRP process in the Carolinas? Durgesh, I'll take the second question. Those CPCN investments are in the capital plan.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. So Durgesh, good morning. We're in the process of our CIRP proceedings. We expect a hearing in July in North Carolina and in South Carolina in September. We expect an order later this year in December and November for each of those states. And we propose three different pathways: Path 1, Path 2, and Path 3, with the preferred path being Path 3. This is showing a 2-gigawatt increase from our supplemental filing in January from our previous filing. We're still focused on making sure that we have an affordable and reliable plan for the customers in North Carolina while meeting our needs for our carbon reductions. The plans still show that we're going to be out of coal by 2035. And it's adding additional resources, particularly solar, batteries, and new gas as well.\nWe've been through some of the hearings, and the proceedings will continue this summer, but we feel very comfortable in what we're putting forth to the commissions and look forward to defending our case and talking through it with stakeholders.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nDurgesh, on the CPCNs, we would expect the IRP hearings to occur and the CPCN hearings to follow. So the timeline that Harry just outlined would have all of this in front of the commission in the second half of this year. And so we'll keep you informed every step of the way.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Evercore\n\nAwesome. Thank you for that. Just quickly, Lynn, just though, are the IRPs incremental to the CPCN filings, the gigawatts that you're proposing? I'm thinking the answer is yes.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nDurgesh, well, the way this works is the IRP is a multi-year view of generation, and it includes renewables and batteries, energy efficiency, demand response, and the entire collection of resources necessary to meet load. The CPCN is a process to achieve approval of unique and discrete assets. So these gas plants that are included in the IRP go through a separate proceeding so that we can share cost estimates and the timeline for when we would build those assets. So you should think about the filings as complementary.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. That's where I was getting at with this. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey. Good morning, team. And Brian, no comments on the Canes game one, but just, I guess, quickly, I guess.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nNot fair, Anthony.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nIt's only one game, though. I'm well aware of that as a Rangers fan. Just I guess.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nI think you just speak for yourself for the rest of the series.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nI know. This is going to be brutal. I know. Just, I guess, if I could talk about earlier of maybe the load growth is more back-end loaded. You guys will update it on the Q4 call. I guess if I could think of that and maybe how that maybe translates into earnings growth, is the balance sheet where you'd like it to be? Your target is 14 at the end of 2024. You believe you'll be there. I know the company's very focused on the balance sheet, but as we think maybe earnings potential stronger in the back end of the plan, will that be an opportunity to give yourself more cushion, or you're happy with where you're targeting at the end of 2024?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nIt's a good question, Anthony. As we've mentioned in the Q4 call, 14% FFO for 2024, 14-plus as we look out in time. We're not going to stay put at 14. We're going to continue to improve it over time. Guiding through that, we've got the benefit of the North Carolina rate cases this year. Next year, we'll have the benefit of all the other jurisdictions: Florida, Indiana, Piedmont, and South Carolina. All these rate actions are underway, that will continue to support top-line growth, which also then supports the credit. As we look out in the plan, I think the potential to earn at the higher end of the range also gives us opportunity to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. I think we're going to take a balanced approach that provides growth for investors as well as protects a strong balance sheet over time.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. That's all I had. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nHey.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nMaybe just as you think about your capital plans, both from an investment in the grid perspective and also on new generation, have you been seeing anything, any constraints from a supply chain perspective, whether it's in procuring kind of generation kits or transmission equipment that we should be keeping in mind?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nCarly, thanks for that question. As we've worked the capital plan and all the supply chain challenges since COVID, it's kind of been issue by issue. I would say a couple of years ago, solar panels was a hot area, and we entered into framework agreements over a long period of time to secure our solar panel needs. We also had transformers last year that was a really hot spot. It's still a tight market, but we've been able to work through these with the size and scale of Duke Energy and really partnering with OEMs on how we're going to work with them multiple years in a row. As we look to build generation at scale, we're looking at areas like EPC contractors, turbine manufacturers, and other components to support the generation build. We're going to take a similar approach.\nBut I think what we've learned is that we must partner with one or two suppliers over multiple years to give them certainty on the revenue side, give us certainty on the components and labor on our side. So it's been a successful model and is one we want to replicate as we advance the transition.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nAnd I would add, Carly, it is getting better, but we've been able to put some processes in place using our scale to be able to pre-plan and pre-order to really make sure that we have what we need when we need it to keep our investment plans going. And as we look forward, we're going to continue to do that and partner, like Brian mentioned, with our vendors to be able to stay ahead of the curve. But things are getting better, and we're staying ahead of the curve there.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the balance sheet question. Can you just update us on where you currently stand? And then just relative to the walk that you sort of laid out last quarter, are any of the buckets that bridge the gap of getting to that 14% FFO to debt level changing at all relative to what we saw last quarter?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nCarly, we really update the FFO once a year, but we are making progress with the rate cases for North Carolina being the largest single driver of improving FFO year-over-year. Deferred fuel recovery is also on track. Those rates were updated. The last one happened in December for DEP North Carolina. So all the deferred fuel is on track to be fully recovered by the end of this year. We're issuing the equity, the ATM, and DRIP. We did $100 million in Q1, and we'll continue that throughout the year to get to $500 million by the end of the year. And lastly, in the second half of the year, we expect to monetize tax credits from the IRA. And that's the last component. So we're tracking exactly where we want it to be at the end of Q1, and it's looking clearly in sight.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's great. Thanks so much for that color.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Jeremy.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nPresident, Duke Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nI just wanted to follow up with the proposed gas additions as you laid out there. Just wondering how you see, I guess, incremental gas flowing into your territories given the difficulties we've seen in building new pipelines in different parts of the country. So just wondering how you think about this at that point.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJeremy, thank you. Making sure that we have adequate supply for any new source of generation is a part of the assignment. And so we have been at work over the course of 2023 in putting in place agreements that we believe will not only continue to strongly support the existing gas in our area, but also allow us to expand. And this is something that is closely monitored by the North Carolina Commission, and will be by Indiana as well, as we continue diversification there. But we feel like we've got a credible plan in place, and it'll be executed over the number of years, fully recognizing that it takes a lot of work with stakeholders to not only build the generation, but working with our partners who are putting pipeline infrastructure in place to make sure that those stakeholder concerns and needs are being met.\nWe're confident we've got a plan in place we can execute.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. Maybe just diving into load growth expectations, just wondering if we could go a little bit further. I think in the quarter, commercial was up 3.5%, industrials were down 2.5%. If you could touch base on that as well as, I guess, what specific things you see materializing over the balance of the year to accelerate the growth as you talk about a back half of 2024 increase.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nCFO, Duke Energy\n\nJeremy, it's a good item to talk through. On the commercial growth, we saw strength across our regions in the commercial sector. Data center growth was a key driver in that in the quarter, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. On the industrial side of things, we have some plants that are retooling for new products. So they're offline in the Q1, and they signal to us that, \"Look, this is a temporary thing, and we're going to be changing our lines.\" By Q2, mid-Q2, late Q2, we're coming back on in full. We're talking to these customers on a frequent basis to ensure we're there to meet their needs when they need it, and they're tracking on our plan.\nWe kind of expected this trend to continue because we saw this lag in industrial last year, and we thought by mid-2024, we'd see the tide turn. And then lastly, the economic development projects that are coming online in 2024, those were slated for the second half as well, and those are tracking as planned. So we are on track for our 2% growth in 2024, and we'll keep you apprised as we learn more.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thank you for that.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the Q&A session. I'll hand the call back over to Lynn Good for any closing remarks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nLydia, thank you. Thanks to all of you. Thanks for your interest in Duke Energy. As always, we're available for follow-on questions and appreciate your investment. Thanks for joining today.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line."

My name is [ Lydia ], and I'll be your operator today.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI'll now hand you over to Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Lydia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO; along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Duke Energy Corp.\n\nHappy. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $5.56, finishing the year within our guidance range and demonstrating once again our ability to exercise agility in managing our business and meeting our commitments. We also announced 2024 guidance of $5.85 to $6. 10 with the midpoint of $5.98. This represents 6% growth from our original 2023 guidance, and we extended our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate through 2028, off the midpoint of our 2024 range. We entered the year with significant momentum. 2024 marks a fundamental repositioning of our investment proposition. With the commercial renewable sale, we've transformed our business to become a fully regulated utility for the first time in decades.\nAlong with improved regulatory constructs, we're poised to deliver on our simplified 100% regulated growth plan. Our Southeast and Midwest utilities operate in some of the fastest-growing and most attractive jurisdictions across the U.S.. We expect growth in our service territories to accelerate as we move further into the energy transition, driving substantial investment. We are now projecting $73 billion in CapEx over the next 5 years, an $8 billion increase versus our previous plan. Turning to Slide 5, 2023, marked another year of outstanding accomplishments across our business, building on our compelling growth story as we move into '24. As I mentioned, we completed our portfolio repositioning and delivered multiple constructive regulatory outcomes while maintaining our commitment to safety and customers. We executed 5 rate cases, and I'm proud of the constructive results the team has delivered.\nWe received orders approving $45 billion in historic and future rate base investments that will provide growth to customers for years to come. There was also a recognition of the rising cost of capital with improving ROEs and equity ratios. And in North Carolina, we implemented forward-looking multiyear rate plans for the first time ever. The performance-based regulations authorized by HB 951 provides certainty, predictability and value to customers and the company. This milestone was accomplished through years of work with policymakers, legislators and other stakeholders. Shifting to operations. Our teams performed well throughout the year, serving our customers in extreme weather conditions and restoring power following historic storms in Indiana and Florida.\nProviding safe, reliable power in all seasons and circumstances remains our mission. In fact, in 2023, Duke Energy Florida had its best reliability performance in more than a decade, largely due to our significant storm protection plan investments. These investments also aided restoration efforts in Hurricane Adalia, saving outage minutes and speeding return to service. In the Carolinas, our nuclear fleet continues to generate safe, reliable carbon-free power, achieving a capacity factor of 96%, the 25th year in a row above 90%. And underpinning all of this in a hallmark of our commitment to operational excellence, 2023 marked our best safety performance in company history as measured by a total incident case rate of 0.31.\nSafety is a core value at Duke Energy, and I'm proud of our employees' commitment to event-free operations. Finally, the Piedmont team continues to excel in customer service. For the second year in a row, J.D. Power ranked Piedmont #1 in residential customer satisfaction for natural gas services in the Southeast. And our Carolinas electric utilities continue to achieve strong results as well, remaining in the top quartile. Moving to Slide 6. We start the year entering the next phase of our energy transition, a period of execution and record infrastructure build to meet the evolving energy needs of our customers and communities. We're working with stakeholders to develop resource plans to support the phenomenal growth in our communities. In the Carolinas, demand is already outpacing the forecast used in our August resource plan filings and we filed supplemental portfolios in January.\nWe're committed to meeting this growth with a diverse and increasingly clean energy mix that includes renewables, natural gas, next-generation nuclear and storage resources, as well as energy efficiency and demand response tools. We're also taking steps to build new generation in North Carolina we'll file CPCNs for over 2 gigawatts of new natural gas generation in '24. We'll continue to advance annual solar procurements targeting 1 gigawatt per year. And in Indiana, we'll file CPCNs for new generation resources around midyear. These new facilities will add to our diverse mix of resources and are critical to meeting growing customer demand as we reliably exit coal by 2035. From a regulatory perspective, we've announced 2 rate cases in 2024, starting with DEC South Carolina in early January.\nSince the last case in 2018, we've invested more than $1.5 billion to improve reliability and resiliency and meet the growing energy needs of our more than 650,000 customers. And in Florida, we notified the commission of our intent to file a rate case in April. Similar to our current multiyear rate plan, which runs through 2024, this filing will cover 3 years of investments beginning in 2025. Our plan will add over 1,000 megawatts of new solar and include over $3 billion of grid investments to serve population growth, increased reliability and reduced storm-related outages. Finally, since our last rate cases at Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont, North Carolina, we've continued to make investments to strengthen our system, and we're evaluating the timing of our next filings in these jurisdictions.\nIn closing, I'll move to Slide 7, which depicts the transition of Duke Energy over the last many years to the premier regulated utility than it is today. The strategic and financial clarity provided by optimizing our portfolio over the last decade has simplified Duke Energy to a powerful, core regulated business operating in vibrant jurisdictions, growing through population migration and strong commercial and industrial economic development. Our growth potential is the highest it's been in decades and is reflected in our $73 billion capital plan. This plan is driven by grid investments to transform the largest T&D system in the U.S. and IRP-related generation investments to support our growing jurisdictions and fleet transition, an efficient recovery mechanisms allow us to translate these investments into customer and investor value.\nIn closing, we have positioned Duke for long-term value creation, and our path forward is clear. as we navigate the coming decade of record infrastructure build. This pivotal point in our history drives a differentiated low-risk total return proposition going forward, and I'm confident we will deliver. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian D. Savoy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. 2023 marked a year of solid growth for our utilities. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.56, which represents about 6% growth over 2022. For the year, we saw top line growth from constructive rate case outcomes multiyear rate plans and rider growth across our jurisdictions. Additionally, we delivered on our cost and agility efforts, which offset record mild weather, lower volumes and higher interest expense. 2023 was a year full of significant headwinds, and I'm proud of the team for executing on our agility plans, including strong Fourth Quarter results to deliver on our financial commitments. Turning to Slide 9. We are introducing our 2024 guidance range of $5.85 to $6.10. The midpoint of $5.98 represents more than 7% growth over 2023.\nWithin electric, we expect normal weather and retail volume growth of roughly 2%. We also entered the year with updated rates for our North Carolina utilities, including the benefit of the historic base case as well as year 1 of the multiyear rate plans. Additionally, we have updated rates at Duke Energy, Kentucky and expect updated rates for DEC South Carolina in August. We'll see growth from year 3 of the Florida multiyear rate plan currently effect and we will continue to see growth from grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers are higher interest expense as well as depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base. Our gas segment continues to deliver strong growth with investments across all jurisdictions related to integrity management and to serve a growing customer base.\nFinally, we expect the other segment to be impacted by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. We ended 2023 with an ETR of 10%. Although we continue to pursue a robust set of tax optimization strategies, we expect our 2024 ETR will increase to between 12% and 14%. Turning to retail electric volumes on Slide 10. In 2023, we saw strong residential customer growth in all jurisdictions, highlighted by the Carolinas and Florida at 2.1% and 2%, respectively. In fact, over the course of 2023, we added 195,000 new customers, the largest customer increase in company history and a continuation of the trend we've seen over the past few years. As a reminder, residential decoupling in North Carolina began in DEP in October and in DEC in January. This will reduce volatility and align growth with positive customer migration trends.\nWe have also seen significant growth in economic development opportunities in our service territories as reflected in the recent supplemental Carolina's resource plan filings. As we evaluate which projects to include in our financial plan, we recognize that site selection processes are often very competitive. We generally only include the most mature and committed projects, focusing on those with letter agreements or in very late-stage development. This gives us upside potential should additional projects progress. Economic development opportunities in our service territories are diversified across many industries. Semiconductors, EVs, batteries, pharmaceuticals and data centers to name a few, which will provide growth from the projects themselves as well as incremental growth from residential and supplier demand.\nThese economic development and customer migration trends give us confidence in our 1.5% to 2% load growth expectation over the forecast period. Turning to Slide 11. In Duke's proven track record of cost management will support our ability to execute an energy transition that is rooted in discipline and a commitment to safety for our employees and reliability and affordability for our customers. As I mentioned before, we delivered on our significant O&M and agility targets for 2023 in response to macroeconomic headwinds and unfavorable weather. In 2024, we expect O&M to be largely flat to 2023, offsetting inflationary pressures with sustainable efficiencies, and we will continue to target a flat cost structure over the 5-year plan.\nDuke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost efficiency, driven by our culture of continuous improvement. We consistently rank in the top quartile across a variety of O&M measures, and our ability to manage our cost structure creates significant value for our customers and shareholders. Turning to Slide 12. We I'd like to provide an overview of our 5-year $73 billion capital plan, which has increased $8 billion over our previous plan. About half of the incremental capital is a result of rolling the plan forward a year to include 2028. The update reflects an early estimate of the supplemental Carolinas resource plan filed in January as well as improved spend in the North Carolina multiyear rate plans. Over time, our capital plan has steadily increased as we move further into the clean energy transition, supporting a 7.2% earnings base CAGR through 2028.\nGrid investments represent 50% of our 5-year capital plan and will improve the reliability and resiliency of our system. Significant generation spend ramps up in the latter part of the plan as we add more renewables and storage assets. extend the life of our carbon-free nuclear fleet and make prudent investments in cleaner natural gas to better serve our growing customer base. Looking ahead, about 90% of the electric investments in our capital plan are eligible for efficient recovery mechanisms, which is critical to maintaining a strong balance sheet, mitigating regulatory lag and smoothing customer rate impacts. Moving to Slide 13. Our ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet, and we remain committed to our current credit ratings.\nWith that in mind, we are introducing modest equity to fund the increase in capital plan we announced today. We expect to raise $500 million annually over the 5-year plan starting in 2024, using at the market and dividend reinvestment programs. Turning to FFO to debt. We have provided a walk up, showing the path to achieve our 14% target by the end of '24. Compared to 2023, we expect improvements from normal weather rate case activity, the collection of remaining deferred fuel balances, the monetization of nuclear PTCs and equity issuances under the DRIP and ATM programs. These credit supportive drivers give us confidence in achieving 14% FFO to debt in 2024 and a minimum of 14% over the long term.\nLet me talk a bit more about the nuclear PTC. An important element of the inflation Reduction Act that will provide substantial savings to our customers over time. As an operator of 11 low-cost nuclear units in the Carolinas, we expect to qualify for several hundred million dollars per year of nuclear PTCs beginning in '24. We intend to monetize the credits in the transferability markets established by the IRA. In North Carolina, we worked with the public staff on a settlement regarding the treatment of nuclear PTCs that was approved in our DEC rate case order last year. We will flow back the benefits to customers over a 4-year amortization period. This treatment allows customers to benefit from bill reductions over time and is supportive of the utility's credit metrics.\nMoving to Slide 14. I our robust capital plan, strong customer growth and constructive jurisdictions provide a compelling growth story. And our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand its importance to our shareholders, and 2024 marks the 98th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing our dividend, balancing the payout ratio with the need to fund our capital plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate a steady decline in the payout ratio, and we are adjusting our target payout ratio to 60% to 70% from 65% to 75%. This updated range provides additional financial flexibility minimizes external equity needs over time and is more consistent with the company investing in our current pace. As always, dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors.\nIn closing, 2023 was a year of execution, and we have tremendous momentum as we head into 2024. The fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% growth through 2028. With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

Thank you for attending the Duke Energy Q3 Earnings Review and Business Update. My name is Matt, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call for an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. I will now turn the call over to our host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Abby, please go ahead.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q3 2023 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President, and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAbby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong results for Q3, adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 compared to $1.78 for last year. During the quarter, we also made great progress on regulatory outcomes and simplification of the business. This momentum is underpinned by our strong fundamentals. We have a track record of operational excellence and serve growing jurisdictions with a long runway of investment opportunities. This positions us well for the future and gives us confidence in reaffirming our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. For 2023, we continue to work our cost structure to offset mild weather and weaker industrial volumes. Brian will talk more about load and cost agility efforts, but I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work across the organization to mitigate pressures in 2023.\nAcross the company, agility measures, savings opportunities, and efficiency improvements are well underway, while never compromising on our commitment to safety and customers. We expect to finish the year within our guidance range, trending to the lower half of the range. Moving to slide five, let me spend a moment on the meaningful progress we've made in North Carolina. In August, the North Carolina Utilities Commission approved our Duke Energy Progress rate case application and related settlements. This order is the culmination of years of work with stakeholders and represents a significant milestone, the first implementation of performance-based regulations, including multi-year rate plans authorized by HB 951. The order approved a retail rate base of $12.2 billion, a $1.6 billion increase from our last case, along with roughly $3.5 billion in future capital investments in the multi-year rate plan.\nImportantly, the order also recognized the rising cost of capital, increasing the allowed ROE to 9.8% and the equity component of the capital structure to 53%. This outcome positions us well to continue delivering value to customers while supporting the cash flows of the company. New rates and residential decoupling were implemented on 1 October. Turning to the Duke Energy Carolinas' rate case, in late August, we reached a partial settlement with the public staff on many aspects of the case. The settlement provides clarity on retail rate base of approximately $19.5 billion, a $2.6 billion increase from our last case, and includes nearly $4.6 billion of capital investments in the multi-year rate plan. A second settlement with the public staff further narrowed the open items in the case and also addressed nuclear PTCs, which Brian will provide more detail on in a moment.\nWe expect the NCUC to issue its decision by the end of the year and expect permanent rates to be in effect by January 2024. We're pleased with the constructive outcome at DEP and look forward to finalizing the DEC rate case in the coming weeks. North Carolina is our largest jurisdiction, so constructive outcomes are critical to supporting a strong balance sheet and de-risking our five-year plan. Turning to slide six, I'd like to highlight our updated Carolinas resource plan, which is driving material growth and capital investment opportunities as we lead the nation's largest energy transition. In mid-August, we filed our updated resource plan with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The single unified resource plan for the Carolinas is designed to meet the needs of this growing region, spurred by rapid population growth and significant economic development activity.\nThe plan maintains an all-of-the-above strategy with a diverse deployment of additional resources, including renewables, battery storage, and natural gas, as well as energy efficiency and demand-side management. It also provides the opportunity to evaluate emerging technologies, pursue an early site permit for advanced nuclear, and early development activities for expanded pumped storage hydro at Bad Creek. The filing included details about our annual solar procurement, which targets over a 1GW of new solar each year beginning in 2027. It also outlines plans to build additional natural gas generation to maintain reliability and affordability as coal plants are retired. Since the resource plan filing, we filed pre-CPCNs with the NCUC for a combined cycle plant on 1 September and combustion turbines on 1 November. We will make our full CPCN filings in Q1 2024.\nSimilar to previous filings, the Carolinas' resource plan is based on significant stakeholder engagement and outlines multiple portfolios, each of which preserves affordability and reliability while transitioning to cleaner energy resources. Next steps will include hearings in both states in the spring of 2024. We expect an order in South Carolina in mid-2024 and an order in North Carolina by the end of 2024. Turning to slide seven, with the closing of the commercial renewables sale last month, our portfolio repositioning is complete. We are now a fully regulated company operating in some of the fastest-growing and most attractive jurisdictions across the US. I just mentioned some of our progress in North Carolina, and our other utilities continue to deliver as well. At Piedmont, we recently received South Carolina Commission approval of our settlement in our RSA proceeding.\nWe also received approval of our settlement in our ARM proceeding in Tennessee. These annual rate updates allow for efficient recovery of investments as we continue to modernize our natural gas system. In our DEC, South Carolina, we've made significant investments since our last rate case in 2019 and are evaluating the timing of our next rate case application. These investments have strengthened the grid against storms, reduced outage times, and maintained the high level of reliable service our customers expect. In Florida, we're seeing some of the fastest customer growth in the state and have efficient recovery mechanisms for our grid and solar investments. Our response to Hurricane Idalia in September yet again demonstrated the value of our grid-hardening investments. The storm caused over 200,000 outages, and we restored power to 95% of customers within 36 hours.\nFurther, our investment in self-healing grid technologies saved more than 7 million outage minutes for customers. Shifting to the Midwest, in October, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved the new rates in our electric rate case, which utilized a forecasted test year. The Commission approved a 9.75% ROE, a 50 basis points increase from the previous case, as well as increasing the equity component of the capital structure to 52%. Across our footprint, we've built considerable momentum over the last year, and our long-term organic growth strategy has never been more clear. This past year has made our company stronger and more agile as we've responded to macroeconomic headwinds. I'm confident we're well positioned to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next five years. And with that, let me turn the call to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on quarterly results. As shown on slide eight, our Q3 reported earnings per share were $1.59, and our adjusted earnings per share were $1.94. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 and $1.78 last year. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation in today's materials for additional details. Within the operating segments, electric utilities and infrastructure results were down $0.01 per share compared to last year. We experienced earnings growth from rate cases and riders, favorable weather, and lower O&M from our cost mitigation initiatives, which I will discuss further in a moment. These positive items were offset by lower weather normalized volumes, higher storm costs, and higher interest expense. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.01 due to riders and customer growth.\nWithin the other segment, we were up $0.16 over the prior year, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, which reflects the ongoing tax efficiency efforts in the company. We expect our full year 2023 effective tax rate to be at the low end of our 11% to 13% guidance range. As Lynn mentioned, we are tightening our full year 2023 guidance range to $5.55 to $5.65. We entered the year with one of the mildest winters on record, and although weather improved in the Q3, we remain $0.20 below normal. We also continue to see weakness in volumes estimated at approximately $0.20 year to date, some of which may be attributable to weather, but also to a softening of industrial load, and return to work for residential customers.\nTo mitigate the impact, we have increased our 2023 agility target to $0.30, which includes tactical O&M savings, a lower effective tax rate, and other levers. As we look to the Q4, we expect a strong finish to the year, targeting $1.50 to 1.60 per share. Our original plan was back-end loaded due to growth from rate cases and riders. We will also see the benefit of our ongoing cost management efforts. We are closely monitoring volume trends and have included Q4 drivers in the appendix. Turning to slide nine, let me discuss more specifics on volume trends. Volumes are down 1.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Many of our industrial customers are acknowledging a near-term pullback, managing inventory levels and costs in a disciplined way due to uncertainty in the broader economy.\nMost are describing the pullback as temporary, and there is optimism about a turnaround in mid to late 2024 and into 2025. We continue to see strong customer growth from population migration and robust economic development, giving us confidence in growth over the long term. Based on recent success in economic development efforts in key sectors such as battery, EVs, semiconductors, and data centers, we see meaningful load growth over the next several years, as outlined on slide nine. For example, in 2024, we expect economic development projects coming online will add between 1,000GW and 2,000GW hours. As we look further out, we have line of sight to 7,000GW to 9,000GW hours by the end of 2027, giving us confidence in our half to 1% growth rate. Turning to slide ten, let me spend a few minutes on 2024.\nConsistent with historical practice, we will provide 2024 earnings guidance and our detailed capital and financing plans in our February update. Today, we have provided growth drivers for 2024. We've executed an active regulatory calendar this year that has yielded constructive outcomes as we head into next year. The multi-year rate plan and DEP will be in effect for a full year, and we expect permanent rates under the DEC multi-year rate plan to be effective in January. In Florida, we will see the impact of the third year of our multi-year rate plan and growth from storm protection plan investments. In the Midwest, we'll see the impact of our Kentucky rate case and grid riders in Indiana and Ohio. In the gas segment, we will see robust growth from rate cases, integrity management investments, and customer additions.\nFrom a load perspective, we project a pickup in 2024 from return to normal weather. Additionally, while we continue to closely monitor customer usage trends, we expect higher weather normalized volumes driven by economic development activity and residential customer growth. Recall, residential decoupling will be in place in 2024 in North Carolina, so both DEC and DEP revenue growth will be based on customer increases, which have been robust. We expect interest rates to be higher for longer, resulting in increased financing costs in 2024. For O&M, we have aggressive efforts underway to sustain all cost savings identified in 2022 for 2023, as well as about half of the agility efforts we identified during the course of 2023 to mitigate weather and volumes.\nAs we continue to pursue a technology-enabled, best-in-class cost structure, we expect our culture of continuous improvement to drive 2024 O&M to be lower than 2023 and significantly below our spending level in 2022. Moving to slide 11, let me highlight some of the credit-supportive actions we've taken to maintain balance sheet strength. We continue to collect deferred fuel balances and have filed for recovery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs, with about 90% approved and in rates. We're on pace to recover $1.7 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2023 and expect our deferred fuel balance to be back in line with our historical average by the end of 2024. As Lynn mentioned, we completed the sale of our commercial renewables business in October. With that, about $1.5 billion of commercial renewables debt will come off the balance sheet, further supporting our credit metrics.\nIn August, as part of our ongoing DEC North Carolina rate case, we reached a settlement with public staff on the treatment of nuclear PTCs related to the Inflation Reduction Act. The settlement provides for the flowback of annual PTCs to customers over a four-year amortization period. If approved by the Commission, this settlement would provide savings for customers and be supported to our credit metrics. We intend to utilize the transferability provisions of the IRA and have engaged an external advisor to run a formal auction-style process, providing access to a broad range of qualified buyers. With these positive developments, we are targeting FFO to debt between 13% and 14% in 2023 and 14% in 2024 through 2027. Finally, as I mentioned, we will provide an update in February on our financing plan, along with a comprehensive refresh and roll forward of our five-year capital plan.\nWe expect our capital plan to increase as we move further into the energy transition. We will take a balanced approach to funding the incremental capital, supporting our growth rate and balance sheet strength. As part of this balanced approach, we will evaluate modest funding through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and active market program. The growth potential in our business is at a level we haven't seen in decades. For customers, we will achieve the right balance of affordability, reliability, and increasing clean energy. For investors, we will achieve growth while maintaining balance sheet strength. Moving to slide 12, we're executing on our priorities and are excited about the path ahead as a fully regulated company. We operate in constructive, growing jurisdictions, which, combined with our $65 billion five-year capital plan, strong operations, and cost efficiency capabilities, give us confidence in our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027.\nOur attractive dividend yield, coupled with long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on the telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by two. Again, to ask a question, press star one. As a reminder, if you're using a speakerphone, please remember to pick up your handset before asking your question. We will pause here briefly as questions are registered. The first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy,Power,and Utilities, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Shar.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nMorning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy,Power,and Utilities, Guggenheim\n\nGood morning, morning. Lynn, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'll be obviously updating the capital plan in February, as you always do, and directionally you're talking some upside bias with CapEx. But maybe you can help at least frame the potential magnitude. So is it kind of supportive of the 5% to 7% or potentially better? And where do you see the increases coming from? So sort of the various buckets and which states, as we think about CapEx upside. Thanks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nSure. And Shar, the capital is really underpinned by the integrated resource plans that we have filed. And so if you look at the Carolinas alone, the filing that we made in August compared to where we were in 2022, we see load growth, and we also see the need to raise the reserve margin as a result of all of the growth going on in this region and the winter peaking nature. And so if you look across all of the types of megawatts, from solar to battery, natural gas, etc., you see an increase there, and that will become reflected more fully in our capital plan, of course, working through that process with the Commission in 2024. But we see a need for additional megawatts in the Carolinas, really driven in large measure by population growth, economic development, and reserve margin.\nWe're also moving deeper into generation transition in Indiana. So as we have filed integrated resource plans and we've accelerated our thinking around the timing of coal retirements, we see natural gas coming into the picture in Indiana, as well as renewables. And so CPCNs will be filed in the next several months, really setting the cadence for Indiana. And then I think on our regular schedule in Florida, we will be updating the multi-year rate plan effective 1 January 2025. And so expectations for capital spending there will be updated. And then the gas business continues to see not only extraordinary growth for a number of customers, but integrity management continues as capital. So we are in an extraordinary period of growth in all of our jurisdictions. It's transparent.\nIt's filed with our commissions in the form of integrated resource plans on the electric side and clear on the gas side as well. So we're anxious to provide that update to you in February and have a chance to talk further about it at that point.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy,Power,and Utilities, Guggenheim\n\nGot it. And then obviously, you highlighted that the current base plan assumes no equity through 2027, which is consistent, but you're obviously leaving it open for potential equity to fund spending above the current base plan. As we think about sort of your balance sheet capacity, should we be assuming that every dollar of incremental CapEx is funded with a balanced cap structure, so 50/50 debt equity, or is that too simplistic and we should be also factoring other sources of equity funding above straight equity? So just, I guess, help us bridge \"balanced approach\" with \"balance sheet strength.\" Thanks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nShar, I would think about balanced approach kind of in the 30% to 50% range. When I think about equity, we've talked about shareholder-friendly equity. You have seen us accomplish that with our transaction in Indiana. I don't know how much potential exists for that given present cost of capital, but we would, of course, explore that. And then evaluating the role of dividend reinvestment and at-the-market programs as well. I would also say that the other couple of things that we're watching: we have yet to finalize the DEC case, so we'll have more visibility on that in December. And then waiting for Treasury guidance on these nuclear PTCs and the transferability market. Those are also very consequential from a cash flow standpoint.\nSo I feel like we have just a number of levers available to us, and we will exercise them in a way that maintains our growth rate, but also underpins the strength of the balance sheet.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy,Power,and Utilities, Guggenheim\n\nGot it. Perfect. Thank you, guys. We'll see you in about a week. Appreciate it.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks for your question. Next question is from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Really appreciate all.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director of Energy,Power,and Utilities, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, Lynn, pleasure. Just coming back in the same direction as Shar here, just in terms of balance sheet, obviously, it's been a source of continued conversation, as illustrated by the first couple of questions here. How do you think about maybe shoring up the balance sheet incrementally in addition to funding these incremental upsides here? I just want to make sure that we're clear about how you think about that piece of it. Obviously, coming into a position of strength here with the rate case resolution that you already or resolutions that you alluded to by Q4 here. But how do you think about kind of getting to that next step where perhaps conversation is a little less focused therein? But thank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, Julian, thanks for that. As we lay out what we laid out today, I think you're watching us strengthen the balance sheet. $1.7 billion of deferred fuel to be collected in 2023. Another $1.7 billion of deferred fuel to be collected in 2024. The multi-year rate plans, which have not only given us an opportunity to reset rate base from historic spending, but also prepare and put into effect rates for future, I think those will be credit positive. The transferability that I mentioned on the IRA will be credit positive. So as we bring to you a financing plan and think about the future and the continued growth that we see from capital investment, we will be targeting a minimum of 14% as we go forward and feel like we have the tools to accomplish that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning, Lynn and Brian.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nJust hi. So you mentioned a couple of times the monitoring, the sales trends, and I know you gave a little bit of color on the return to work. And could you just talk a little bit more, in more depth, on what's going on with sales in your territories and some of the recent weakness?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nSure. And Steve, I'll give it a start, and then I know Brian will have something to add to it. So we've seen some weakness in 2023, and I think you saw us early in the year trying to figure out, do we have volume weakness or is it weather? Because we had such extraordinarily weak weather in the Q1 and Q2. But the weakness has continued into the Q3. I would mention textiles. I would mention paper as two industries that have been impacted. And then outside of those industries, we're hearing from our customers, supply chain, labor, and interest rates being an impact to them that they're adjusting to. Many of them have inventory they're working through, so they've dialed back production. And production, of course, hits us in terms of lower volumes.\nBut I would say there's optimism in that same industrial group about a rebound later in 2024 and into 2025. And what I would further say is we have evaluated this. Residential, of course, return to work, but we think we're probably where that return to work trend is situated, meaning no more impact from return to work. I think we've pretty well worked ourselves through that transition. And then for our largest jurisdiction, we go to a decoupled environment in 2024, and customer growth continues to be very strong. And it's customer growth that will drive revenue. And then on the industrial side, the rebound is positive on existing customers, but this economic development has been extraordinary. And we've given you a sense of what that can look like. It starts to layer in as early as 2024.\nAnd so that gives us some confidence around our longer-term growth rate that we've got customers sort of working through the macro trends here in the short term. But over the long term, we continue to see this economic development being incredibly strong. And I'm sure you saw yesterday in the journal, the Toyota battery plant is expanding further, also sitting here in the North Carolina territory. So that's what I would share. And Brian, what would you add?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, I would add, Steve, North Carolina residential has contributed a significant amount to the weakness this year, over half. So going to decoupling is something we need to really emphasize. It's going to mitigate risk and volatility going forward. And our Florida jurisdiction has seen strong growth in the residential space. It's been a hot year in Florida, but we've also had strong population migration, strongest in the state of Florida. So we see positive shoots coming out, and we do see this industrial load in the Carolinas turning as we talk to customers kind of mid to late next year.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. That's helpful. One other separate question, just on when you're doing your plan and your growth rate, from the standpoint of interest rates, are you generally just kind of using whatever the forward curve is of rates for financings or refinancings and the like?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nSteve, we are generally. We look at curves from.\nYeah.\nYes, absolutely. Absolutely. And as you know, that's a dynamic area. So we look at a range, a range of outcomes. We did that in 2023. We'll do it again in 2024. And as we talked about all of this work we're doing on cost structure, our objective is to offset the impact of interest rates in 2024.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thank you. See you soon.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nLead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nHey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Nick.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nLead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nGood morning.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nSure.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nLead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nGood `morning. Hey, I just wanted to ask, there's been some pretty significant changes in the Carolinas in terms of just rate structure with these MYRPs. And I know that you're a little lower in the range for fiscal 2023, but could you just help frame EPS volatility 2023 versus 2024? And the residential decoupling just stands out to us. If you could just frame how that informs your confidence to hit the 5% to 7% implied EPS growth for 2024 specifically. Thanks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. So Nick, I would confirm that it does underpin our confidence in 5% to 7% growth. This modernized construct in the Carolinas is consequential. It's kind of a first in the history of the utility that we will have multi-year rate plans, the ability to set price as we go forward, of course, delivering value to customers every step of the way, but also more closely matching the expenditure of capital with return. And I would add to that our confidence in the capital underpinning that 5% to 7% growth. Very transparent integrated resource plans that outline what is going to be necessary to serve this growing state. So the Carolinas are very well positioned for the future. And as Brian mentioned a moment ago, continue to see extraordinary growth in Florida. And we have strong capital in Florida and grid and solar.\nWe'll be updating our multi-year rate plan. Our investment in the Midwest continues well along both generation and grid in Ohio, for example. I feel like we've got all of the elements to underpin our confidence in the growth. The jurisdictions are constructive jurisdictions that find the right balance between benefits to customers and investors, and we're confident in the future.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nLead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. And what about just on O&M? I know in slides, you kind of talked about 50% sustainable after 2023, but just looking back to prior calls, I think we've kind of talked about 75%. So maybe that's just different buckets, and I'm mischaracterizing it. But could you help reconcile that view? And then how to just think about 2024? Thank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYes. And Nick, I really appreciate that question because we have two different 300 millions that I think, as I look at some of the commentary, has been confusing to you all. So let me step through it for you. You may recall that we entered 2023 with a cost initiative identified at driving out $300 million of costs, primarily in the corporate center. And we said to you at that time, we thought 75% of that $300 million would be sustainable. We have executed on that throughout 2023 and have gained confidence that the 75% is going to 100%, that we'll be able to sustain all of it into 2024. And then further, we have developed mitigation plans based on weak weather and volume in 2023, which has included not only O&M, but other levers, including tax ideas. Those total $300 million as well.\nWe think 50% of those are sustainable into 2024. We also highlighted on our drivers schedule that we will continue to look for cost savings ideas, part of the continuous improvement structure. That's what we're talking about on slide 10. We believe we have various elements in place to continue to drive O&M lower. We think 2024 will be lower than 2023. That's just part of our conviction to continue to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nLead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nMany thanks. We'll see you soon. Thank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Nick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. All my.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nQuestions have been answered. I just had a good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Brian. All my questions have been answered. Just a quick clarification, Lynn. I think in response to the first question, you mentioned 30% to 50%. I believe you were referring to the equity content of any incremental CapEx. Could you just clarify if my understanding is correct there?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThat's correct, Durgesh. It was in response to what does balanced mean. So that's the range I would think about. Of course, we'll bring a concrete financing plan and capital plan in February that will lay this out more clearly. But as we think about all of the tools and levers and cash flow opportunities that we have across all of our business, that is the range I would consider for incremental equity matched with incremental capital for growth.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Thanks so much for clarifying that. I appreciate it.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Miller\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. You've got John Miller on for Carly. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJohn Miller\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nMaybe just to start with the North Carolina resource plan, just curious if there's any areas where you expect, if any, to get some pushback. Obviously, a healthy chunk of renewables in there with the wind and solar, but also a share of natural gas as well. So curious if you're expecting the focus on reliability with that to outweigh any ESG concerns with the natural gas.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJohn, I appreciate that question. I'd start by saying these integrated resource plans are informed by a very robust stakeholder process. As you imagine pulling stakeholders together, there are different points of view across the spectrum from renewables to batteries to natural gas to nuclear, some pro, some con. But we believe what we've put forward is a very balanced, all of the above strategy that provides the right balance between reliability, affordability, and increasingly clean, which is our commitment to the state. We think all of those elements will be closely reviewed and evaluated as part of the process in front of the commission. We believe we'll work through this in a very constructive way, consistent with the way we've moved forward in the previous plans. We'll keep you posted every step of the way.\n\nJohn Miller\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just one follow-up to the O&M discussion. I know a decent bit of the business agility savings will come in 2024, but as we are now in the year at November, just curious if you have any indications of where you're trending towards that target of 50% being sustainable.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nWe're going to make 50% sustainable.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThat's right. Yeah. We're there, John. We have line of sight to the Q4 efforts because a lot of it was tied to the fall outage season as well as just a culmination of work that takes a couple of months to implement. And we've evaluated the ability to keep those going on for 2024 and beyond, and we've confirmed that.\n\nJohn Miller\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Got it. Great. Thank you so much.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time, so I'll pass the call back to Lynn Good for any closing remarks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nWell, thank you all. Appreciate your engagement today, investors and Duke. And we're looking forward to seeing all of you at EEI. So we'll continue the conversation then. And of course, IR and Brian and I are always available. So thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line."

My name is Grant, I'll be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand you over to your host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Grant, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO; along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may be different from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Duke Energy Corp.\n\nAbby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 for the quarter. For the second quarter in a row, mild weather impacted results. For perspective, in the Carolinas, January and February were the mildest in the last 30 years, and May and June were in the top 5. Through June, we're facing a weather headwind of nearly $0.30.\nAgility measures have been put in place, which add to the $300 million O&M reduction that was targeted and in place coming into 2023. Our cost initiatives are grounded in our culture of safety and serving our customers with excellence, while maintaining our assets for the future. Brian will provide more on cost management in a moment.\nWe've had an early look at July, and as you would expect, July weather is positive consistent with the trend across the U.S., and August and September are in front of us. With our largest quarter ahead, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2023, and we'll have more to say on projected results for the year on the third quarter call. As we look ahead, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% growth rate.\nTurning to Slide 5, you'll see highlights of the strategic portfolio repositioning we've executed over the last decade. With the announcement of the Commercial Renewables sale, which we expect to close by the end of the year, we're a fully regulated company operating in constructive and growing jurisdictions with the wealth of clean energy investments driving growth for years to come.\nThe regulatory constructs in our states have also meaningfully improved over this time, including landmark bipartisan energy legislation passed in North Carolina in 2021. Modern constructs, like those in HB951, allow us to invest for the benefit of our customers while preserving returns for our investors. We are pleased that today, 90% of our electric utility investments are eligible for modern recovery mechanisms that mitigate regulatory lag.\nOur growth story is an organic one with over $145 billion of clean energy grid and LDC investments over the next decade. With the portfolio repositioning complete, our sole focus is on our regulated businesses and the work we have underway to pursue the largest energy transition in our industry.\nLet me now turn to Slide 6 to provide an update on our progress in each jurisdiction. In North Carolina, we continue to work towards resolution of the Duke Energy Progress rate case. We implemented interim rates June 1, subject to refund, with rates for typical residential customers increasing about 5%. We expect the commission to issue an order later this month with the final DEP rates going into effect October 1. We're also preparing for the Duke Energy Carolinas hearing, which is scheduled to begin August 28.\nOur energy transition in the Carolinas remains the top strategic priority, and we're working diligently on updated resource plans to be filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the North Carolina Utilities Commission, respectively, in mid-August. Similar to previous filings, the plans are based on significant stakeholder engagement, and we'll outline multiple portfolios, each of which preserve affordability and reliability, while transitioning to cleaner energy resources.\nIRA benefits will be incorporated into the analysis for the first time, as well as increasing load from numerous economic development announcements and continued strong population migration into the Carolinas. Our modeling will also reflect higher reserve margins as a result of our continuous evaluation of resource adequacy. Later this year, we will begin the CPCN process in North Carolina for replacement gas generation.\nAt the same time, solar procurement will continue on an annual basis. In fact, our 2022 solar procurement was recently finalized, with nearly 1,000 megawatts to be placed in service by 2027. And our 2023 solar RFP targeting 1,400 megawatts was recently approved by the NCUC, with bids to be received later this year.\nFollowing the resource plan filings, each commission will hear from interested parties through a transparent regulatory process as they consider our proposals. We expect an order from the South Carolina Commission in mid-'24 and an order from the North Carolina Commission by the end of '24.\nTurning to Florida. We're executing on our investment plan to benefit customers. We've added 300 megawatts of new solar this year and now operate 1,200 megawatts in the state, with plans to continue adding about 300 megawatts per year over the next decade. We're hardening the grid through our store protection plan and already seeing benefits from improved reliability. With robust customer growth and timely recovery of investments, our Florida utility continues to deliver strong returns.\nIn Kentucky, we partnered with Amazon to install a 2-megawatt solar plant on top of their fulfillment center in Northern Kentucky, the largest rooftop solar site in the state. This partnership supports the carbon reduction goals of both Duke Energy and Amazon, and is just one example of how we're working with our customers to meet their energy needs.\nTurning to Indiana. I'd like to take a moment to thank the nearly 2,000 crew members that worked tirelessly over the July 4 holiday following multiple storms. The widespread storm systems extended across our entire service territory and led to a multi-day effort to restore over 370,000 outages. And in fact, today, in the Carolinas, our crews are also working to restore outages that resulted from the strong storms in the Eastern Seaboard and are doing so safely, timely and in close communication with our customers and stakeholders.\nAs with all operations, the safety of our employees, environment and communities remain front and center, and I'm proud to say that for the eighth consecutive year, we've led the industry in safety as measured by total incident case rate. On the federal side, we're taking advantage of multiple incentives and other opportunities to benefit our customers. We're incorporating IRA tax benefits into resource plans and rate adjustments across our jurisdictions to lower costs for customers. And federal funding from the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act creates opportunity to advance new resources and for economic development.\nWe have put forward multiple proposals through the IIJA, including for methane reduction, carbon capture, long-duration storage, hydrogen and grid modernization, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities as funding is announced. We continue to advocate for federal and state support that recognizes the importance of a responsible energy transition. And in fact, later today, we will file comments on EPA's proposed 111 rule.\nWhile we support EPA's commitment to a cleaner energy future, we believe an orderly transition requires a diverse mix of energy resources and must align with the pace of technology development. We will continue to actively work with policymakers, industry peers, state partners and others in support of a reliable, affordable energy transition.\nIn closing, we've navigated the first half of the year with agility, taking swift action in the face of record mild weather while maintaining our focus on our strategic priorities. With our portfolio repositioning complete, we offer an attractive, fully regulated organic growth proposition. We have a clear strategy ahead of us as we invest to satisfy increasing demand for clean, affordable and reliable energy across our growing regions. Our long-term fundamentals remain as strong as ever, and we're well positioned to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next 5 years.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian D. Savoy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with quarterly results and highlight key variances to the prior year.\nAs shown on Slide 7, we reported a second quarter loss of $0.32 per share and adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share. This compares to reported and adjusted EPS of $1.14 and $1.09 last year. GAAP reported results included an impairment of approximately $1 billion related to the Commercial Renewables sale, which is reflected in discontinued operations. Announcing the sale agreements represents a key milestone, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made to date on this important strategic move.\nWithin the operating segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was down $0.14 compared to last year, driven by $0.16 of unfavorable weather. Absent the weather, we saw growth from rate cases and riders and lower O&M, partially offset by lower volumes and higher interest expense. Moving to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. Results were up $0.01 due to higher margins and customer growth. And within the other segment, we were $0.05 lower primarily due to higher interest expense, partially offset by higher market returns on certain benefit plans.\nTurning to Slide 8. Cost management has become part of the Duke Energy DNA and continues to produce sustainable savings. We're leveraging digital innovation, data analytics and process improvements to increase efficiency, making targeted capital investments to reduce maintenance costs and reshaping our operations to streamline work and lower costs. We've established a proven track record. And in 2022, we're an industry leader across key O&M cost efficiency measures.\nComing into 2023, we implemented a $300 million cost mitigation initiative to address interest rate and inflation headwinds. These reductions, which were incorporated into our base plan, are focused on corporate and support areas and remain on track. And as we said, 75% of these savings are structural and will be sustainable into future years.\nAs Lynn mentioned, we've seen record mild weather in the first half of the year. We've taken action to offset these pressures, including launching significant business agility in the first quarter. We're looking to tactical O&M reductions and other levers, including deferring noncritical work, reducing spend on outside services and limiting nonessential travel and overtime. We expect about $0.20 of mitigation from these measures weighted toward the fourth quarter.\nWe will be thoughtful about these actions, keeping our unwavering commitment to safety, reliability and customer service at the forefront of our approach. Looking ahead, residential decoupling in North Carolina will be fully implemented in 2024. But until then, we will continue to flex the agility muscle that we have done so successfully in the past.\nTurning to Slide 9. I'll touch on electric volumes and economic trends. Volumes are down 0.6% on a rolling 12-month basis. In the residential class, customer growth remained robust at 1.8%, but was offset by lower usage per customer. We believe this is partially driven by energy efficiency and a growing trend of returning to the office. In addition, we continue to see most of the weakness when monsoon when weather was extreme. In these situations, it can be challenging to precisely estimate the weather component of total volume variances.\nThe long-term residential growth trajectory remains strong. In fact, residential volumes have averaged just under 1% growth per year for the past 5 years and are 4% above prepandemic levels. In the commercial class, second quarter volumes are trending above our full year estimate, supported by continued growth in data centers.\nIn the industrial class, planned investment in our territories continues to be robust. Many of our large customers are expanding. And we partnered with our states to attract over 29,000 new jobs and $23 billion in capital investment in 2022. These investments represent several key sectors such as battery, EVs and semiconductors. And we expect they will provide around 2,000 megawatts of demand as operations ramp up.\nThe strength of our service territories was also reflected in CNBC's annual list of America's Top States for Business, where 5 of the states we serve ranked in the top 15 and North Carolina ranked #1 for the second year in a row.\nIn the near term, we've seen a slight pullback in some of our manufacturing customers due to softening demand in certain sectors of the economy. We're monitoring the impact of macroeconomic trends, but the underlying fundamentals, residential customer growth and commercial and industrial investment continue to support long-term growth of roughly 0.5% per year.\nMoving to Slide 10. Let me highlight some of the credit supportive actions we've taken to maintain balance sheet strength. We continue to collect deferred fuel balances and have filed for recovery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs. In April, we began recovery of $1.2 billion in Florida over 21 months with a debt return.\nWe also reached settlement with the public staff in our DEC North Carolina fuel proceeding, and expect to receive an order in the coming weeks. Per the agreement, we would recover approximately $1 billion of deferred fuel by the end of 2024. Across our jurisdictions, we're on pace to recover 1.7 of deferred fuel costs in 2023 and expect our deferred field balance to be back in line with our historical average by the end of 2024.\nAs Lynn mentioned, we expect to complete the sale of our Commercial Renewables business by the end of the year, and we used proceeds for debt avoidance at the holding company. In addition, about $1.5 billion of Commercial Renewables debt will come off the balance sheet when the transactions close, further supporting metrics. These actions are credit positive, and we expect to see continued balance sheet improvement into 2024 as we recover the remaining deferred fuel costs and see the full year impact of both North Carolina rate cases.\nMoving to Slide 11. This year marks the 97th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 17th consecutive annual increase. Looking forward, we're executing on our strategic priorities and are excited about the path ahead as a fully regulated company. We operate in constructive, growing jurisdictions, which, combined with our $65 billion 5-year capital plan, give us confidence in our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders.\nWith that, we'll open the line for your questions."

The Duke Energy Q1 2023. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Hello everyone, and welcome to the Duke Energy Q1 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Nadia, and I'll be coordinating the call today. If you would like to ask a question at the end of the presentation, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I will now hand over to your host, Abby Motsinger, VP of Investor Relations, to begin. Abby, please go ahead.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Duke Energy\n\nThank you, Nadia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Q1 2023 Rarnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President, and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let me turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nAbby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 for Q1. These results reflect a $0.22 headwind from weather, with January and February ranking among the warmest winter months on record across our service territories. In fact, DEP had its warmest January and February in the last 32 years. In response, we've already taken action, activating agility measures across the enterprise, which Brian will walk through with you in just a moment. With three quarters remaining, including our strongest quarter still ahead, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance range of $5.55 to 5.75, with a midpoint of $5.65. We're also on track to deliver our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7 through 2027, up the midpoint of the 2023 range.\nBefore I turn to our regular utilities, I'd like to provide an update on the sale of our commercial renewables business. As you know, we have separate sales processes underway for the utility scale business and the distributed energy business. We are in the late stage of the process for both transactions and will look to update you in the near future. We continue to anticipate proceeds in the second half of the year. Moving to slide five, we're making meaningful progress in our strategic initiatives in each of our jurisdictions. In North Carolina, we recently reached a partial settlement with public staff and CIGFUR, who represents DEP's industrial customers, in the Duke Energy Progress rate case.\nWith agreement on approximately $3.5 billion of forward-looking capital investments in the multi-year rate plan, the settlement represents a significant milestone on our journey to modernize recovery mechanisms in North Carolina. It positions us well to continue delivering value to customers while supporting the cash flows of the company. The settlement also provides clarity on retail rate base of approximately $12.2 billion for the historic base case and depreciation rates that largely align with DEP's proposal. Further, we reached agreement on performance incentive metrics and residential decoupling. We were pleased to be able to work with public staff and CIGFUR to narrow the open items in the case. These settlements are subject to approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Evidentiary hearings began 4 May and are expected to conclude later this month.\nInterim rates will be implemented in June, subject to refund, and we expect permanent rates to be effective 1 October. The Duke Energy Carolinas rate case is about three months behind the DEP case, and hearings scheduled to begin on 21 August. Moving to South Carolina, the Commission approved a comprehensive settlement in our Duke Energy Progress rate case in February. Revised rates went into effect in April. We also recently received Commission approval to securitize approximately $170 million of past storm costs at Duke Energy Progress. In Florida, the Commission approved our fuel, capacity, and storm cost request in March. Rates were updated in April and reflect recovery of deferred fuel costs over 21 months with a debt return. We'll recover storm costs associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as well as replenish the storm reserve over 12 months.\nWe also continue to expand our renewables fleet in a steady and responsible manner, adding four solar projects in March and April totaling 300MW. With these additions, we now operate 1,200MW of solar in Florida, with plans to continue adding approximately 300MW a year going forward. In Indiana, we've had an active legislative session. The legislature passed several energy bills, including House Bill 1421, which was signed into law and allows QIP and rate base for natural gas generation. These bills support our ability to execute our energy transition in Indiana while maintaining reliable and affordable power for customers. We're in the process of finalizing CPCNs, which we expect to begin filing with the Indiana Commission later this quarter. In Ohio, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the PUCO staff and multiple other parties in our natural gas rate case.\nThe settlement, which is subject to Commission approval, includes agreement on expanded revenue caps for the capital expenditure program rider. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on 23 May. And in Kentucky, the Commission is conducting an evidentiary hearing today on the electric rate case filed in December. If approved, new rates are anticipated to go into effect in July. We're making great progress on our strategy across our entire service territory, meeting our commitments and advancing investments in a balanced way to better serve our customers. Our strong track record is reflected in our impact reports, Duke Energy's 17th Annual disclosure on sustainability topics. This comprehensive report was published in April and includes our goals and progress on a broad range of topics, including the energy transition.\nIt also outlines our corporate citizenship and the value we're creating for employees, customers, and communities, from economic development to environmental justice, and to reskilling and redeploying workers. Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me take a moment to talk about our grid investment plan, which is $36 billion and accounts for over half of our five-year capital plan. The grid is a critical part of our energy transition, and with more than 320,000 line miles, we operate the largest transmission and distribution system in the nation. The foundation of our grid plan is focused on improving reliability and resiliency, preparing the grid for renewables, and enabling electrification. Our reliability and resiliency investments are centered on strengthening the grid against storms and security threats and improving the ability to rapidly restore power when there is an outage.\nWe're making targeted investments across a variety of programs, including self-optimizing grid technologies, targeted undergrounding, physical and cybersecurity upgrades, and upgrading lines and substations. Our investments are already making a difference, as evidenced by our response to Hurricane Ian last fall, where we restored power in less than half the time of our Hurricane Irma restoration efforts in 2017. As highlighted on the slide, we've made great progress in establishing constructive recovery mechanisms across our jurisdictions. These mechanisms will also assist in recovering grid investments in a timely manner, mitigating lag, and supporting balance sheet strength while delivering benefits to our customers. From grid improvements to installing renewables to advancing policy, we're taking collective action to transform and ready the system for the future. We have a clear path forward and are confident our investment plan will deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7 earnings growth.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with quarterly results and highlight key variances to the prior year. As shown on slide seven, our Q1 reported earnings per share were $1.01 and adjusted earnings per share were $1.20. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 and $1.29 last year. Adjusted results exclude the impact of commercial renewables, which has reflected in discontinued operations. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was down $0.14 compared to last year. As Lynn mentioned, these results reflect extremely mild weather in January and February, which drove a $0.22 headwind compared to normal. This is the most significant weather impact we've seen in recent memory. In addition to weather, lower volumes and higher interest expense were partially offset by lower O&M and growth from rate cases and riders.\nRate case impacts in the quarter were primarily driven by our Florida utility. Consistent with our current settlement terms, in January, we had an annual step-up under the multi-year rate plan, as well as the impact of a 25 basis points ROE increase as a result of rising interest rates. Moving to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were $0.04 higher year-over-year, primarily due to growth from riders and customer additions. Before discussing retail volumes, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our 2023 cost mitigation efforts and full-year expectations. We're currently executing the $300 million in O&M reductions that we shared previously, which were incorporated into our base plan to address interest rate and inflation headwinds. As we've said, 75% of these savings are structural and will be sustainable into future years.\nIn response to mild weather in Q1, we've already activated agility measures, leveraging our scope and scale to identify further savings opportunities. As we've done in the past, we're looking to tactical O&M efforts and other levers. These include deferring non-critical work, reducing spend on outside services, and limiting non-essential travel and overtime, among others. We will be thoughtful about these efforts, keeping our unwavering commitment to reliability and customer service at the forefront of our approach. Looking ahead, residential decoupling in North Carolina will be fully implemented by 2024, but until then, we will continue to flex the agility muscle that we have done so successfully in the past. Turning to volumes on slide eight, as expected on a rolling 12-month basis, load growth has moderated closer to pre-COVID trends.\nWhen comparing to 2022, it's important to note that we had a very robust Q1 last year, which saw nearly 6% growth. In addition, nearly all of the Q1 weakness this year was seen in January and February when weather was extreme. In these situations, it can be challenging to precisely estimate the weather component of total volume variances. In March and April, when weather was closer to normal, volume trends were more consistent with expectations, giving us confidence that the full-year 2023 load growth will be in the neighborhood of 0.5%. Continued strong customer growth in the residential class also supports confidence in our outlook. The population migration we've seen into our service territory remains as strong as ever. In the industrial class, we're seeing some weakness in the textile sector, as well as an isolated plant closure by an electronics manufacturer in the Carolinas.\nLingering supply chain impacts also continue to be a factor impacting usage. With that said, fundamental growth remains strong. Many of our larger industrial customers are expanding, and economic development in our service territories continues to be robust. For example, our recently released Impact Report highlighted our final economic development results for 2022. Over the year, we partnered with our states to attract over 29,000 new jobs and $23 billion in capital investments to our service territories. These new customers, which represent several key sectors such as battery, EVs, and semiconductors, will provide meaningful load growth as operations ramp up. We're proud of these accomplishments, which support the communities we serve and give us further confidence in the long-term economic outlook for our service territories. Moving on to financial activities on slide nine, we had a productive first quarter, completing around 60% of our planned 2023 issuances.\nWe've also been opportunistic, taking advantage of market dynamics, which made convertible notes an attractive option. In April, we issued 1.7 billion of these notes to reduce our commercial paper balance and lower interest expense. Importantly, we made good progress on fuel proceedings during the quarter as well. In Florida, we received approval for a full recovery of the 2022 deferred fuel balance, with rates updated 1 April. We also filed in February for recovery of approximately 1 billion of deferred fuel in DEC, North Carolina. We expect to receive an order in August and for rates to be implemented in September. Filings over the summer will round out the Carolinas, addressing the remaining uncollected costs. In addition, we continue to expect proceeds from the sale of commercial renewables in the second half of this year, which will be used for debt avoidance at the holding company.\nCombined, we expect these two items, fuel collections and the completed sale, will positively impact FFO to debt by 50 to 75 basis points by year-end. I know the balance sheet is top of mind for investors, and credit is at the forefront of our planning as well. In fact, our efforts and commitment to the balance sheet were recently recognized by Moody's. In April, following our annual meeting, Moody's reaffirmed our current credit ratings and stable outlook at the holding company. This is further evidence that we have the right plan in place and are taking appropriate steps to maintain our strong balance sheet as we advance our energy transition and execute our capital plan. Moving to slide 12, we remain confident in delivering our 2023 earnings guidance range of $5.55 to 5.75 and growth of 5% to 7 through 2027.\nWe operate in constructive, growing jurisdictions, and the fundamentals of our business are strong. Our progress on key initiatives in the first quarter positions us well to deliver on our commitments as we execute the priorities that are important to our customers, communities, and shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad.

Just to confirm, the short-term cost-cut measures Brian touched on, those are incremental to the $300 million figure that's out there. Are any of them potentially structural in nature? And I guess the key question is, I guess, where do you guys stand within the 23 EPS guidance range under that normal weather assumption for the rest of the year? Are you still kind of comfortable within the range at this juncture?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThe answer to that is yes, Shar. And let me talk about the various cost initiatives that are underway. The $300 million that we identified for last year, I would call largely structural. When we talk about 75% of this being achievable, it's because we're making fundamental changes in the way we're completing work, staffing work, prioritizing work, etc. When we talk about the actions we're taking in response to weak weather, I would call those more tactical. This is deferral. This is reducing non-critical work, third-party spend, expenses, those types of things that we have done so many times, as you know.\nThe combination of all of these activities, as well as the fact we enter any given year expecting a range of outcomes and establishing contingencies in our planning in case something doesn't work out exactly as planned, we are confident in reaffirming the range of $5.55 to 5.75. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses, but our commitment in reaffirming at this point.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then just, Lynn, commercial, obviously, the commercial sale being in late stage is new language, and you obviously took another $175 million charge. This is obviously the second charge to date. Could we maybe just elaborate why the expectations on the sale have come off more? I mean, what's driving the second revision? Is it capital markets? Is it buyer interest? Just some sense there. And I guess, I guess when can we see something announced? Is it Q3? Is it closer to year-end? Thanks.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, sure. Appreciate the question. And we are continuing strong progress. We're in the late stages and expect to be able to provide more information shortly on where we are. Given the fact that we have placed the business into discontinued operations, we continue to evaluate whether we have the right recognition of net book value on the financial statements and did take an additional impairment charge representing further progression of the process. I would say to you, though, that the estimated value that we see in this process remains within our planning assumptions. So there's nothing here that I would point to as a surprise for us as we've moved through the process. As we have continued the negotiations, the marketing's complete.\nWe're in discussions with select bidders, and we have made a decision to separate the process involving, for example, two projects that we are a minority owner of, and concluded that the natural owner is the majority owner based on discussions and negotiations that progressed. So you should look at all of this as demonstration that we're nearing the end of the process, and we'll be anxious to announce and give you further feedback as soon as that's appropriate.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. I appreciate the extra color. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Infrastructure and Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Julian, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Researh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Look.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Julian.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Researh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nBrian, actually. Hey, good morning, Lynn. Brian, I wanted to go back to some of your comments, and you specifically said credit is at the forefront of many people's minds. In the last question, it was brought up about expectations evolving on the renewable sale here. Just want to be crystal clear about this. I mean, especially following the affirmation, barring any changes in CapEx here, which you obviously do in a fairly annual cadence, can you just elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the balance sheet? It seems like you got a target here to get back to 14%. You talked about the 50 to 75 basis points, but very specifically here, your comfort level with the plan and the need to address any further equity or equity-like considerations to expedite getting to that long-term target.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nNow, thanks, Julian. It's the right question, and it is top of mind for us and for investors. Speaking about what was the pressure we felt in 2022, it was really focused on deferred fuel. All right? We undercollected nearly $4 billion of deferred fuel. We also had storm restoration costs of around half a billion. So the balance sheet wore $4.5 billion of costs that we didn't plan for as we moved into 2022. We're starting to recover that deferred fuel at DEP and at Duke Energy Florida. Duke Energy Carolinas will happen later this year, and we put a chart in the slides to show that balance come off over the next two years. As we recover those deferred fuel balances along with the proceeds of commercial renewables, we feel like the balance sheet is where it needs to be.\nThe target of 14% FFO to debt is the right target with the right cushion to deal with contingencies that come year-in and year-out, and positions us for no equity through 2027.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Researh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Thank you for hitting that clearly, and good progress on the fuel. And then separately, Lynn, if you can comment here, I mean, obviously, a lot of different utility assets moving around, potentially changing hands here. Would love to hear your thoughts more specifically therein as you think about the options. You've got obviously a full plate in some respects on a lot of novel angles, especially in the Carolinas here, but can you elaborate at least your latest thinking around perhaps evaluating further assets here?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nJulien, I would say our primary focus at Duke is executing what we think is one of the strongest organic growth plans around. As you look at the clean energy transition going on in the Carolinas, Indiana is beginning transition of generation as well with CPCNs coming yet this year. Florida is continuing to deliver strength with not only solar development but also grid investment from the storm protection plan. So we feel like we've got just a robust capital plan moving forward and strong jurisdictions. So our primary focus is on organic growth. As you note, though, assets do become available from time to time.\nWe will look at them if they make sense for us, but we'll do so in a disciplined way that maintains a focus on our balance sheet, maintains our focus on growth, maintains a focus on constructive jurisdictions that recognize the right balance between utility health and customer value. And I'll just leave it there.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Researh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. And then if I could clarify earlier, just super quickly, with respect to Indiana, obviously, you've got this IRP out there. Just curious, A, if that could change your CapEx entry year and B, if you have any further thoughts about what that could look like here.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nIt's a really good question, Julian, because we have continued to update the IRP in Indiana. Our core retirement profile remains largely the same, but we are seeing increase in renewables as a result of the IRA, and we're also seeing the impact of MISO's new planning assumptions and how we ought to be addressing that over time. So we are on the verge of CPCN filings that will include both intermittent and non-intermittent resources. We will update the IRP again in 2024 and continue to evaluate whether we're moving at the right pace around the energy transition. I would say as we get into the back part of the decade, there probably is more potential in Indiana around that transition, but we'd like to work through this process to get it started in a way that makes sense for customers in the state. So more to come on Indiana.\nReally pleased with the progress we're making.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Researh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys. Talk soon.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Steve Fleishman of Wolf Research. Steve, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks. Hi, Lynn.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, Steve.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nJust on the North Carolina Settlement Agreement, is there any other parties in the case? Are they opposed to it, or are they just not taking a position? Where's kind of the other parties, if at all?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah. Steve, I would say we're really pleased with Public Staff and the industrials. Two important parties in the case in Indiana. The attorney general will be there as well as some of the consumer groups, environmental groups, etc. But we feel like the settlement is very strong with Public Staff and the industrials. We also have a settlement on the performance incentive mechanisms, allocation on transmission. There are a host of things included. So we believe it's a demonstration of strong progress. We're on the stand starting, I guess, 4 May. That's last week. And feel like we have a very strong case. So I can't speak to the other parties on what they may think about what we've put together, but I believe the strength of the settlement, Public Staff, and CIGFUR is noteworthy.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Good. And then, just in terms of thinking about a lot of the issue, North Carolina over the years was just dealing with lag, and the multi-year plans kind of help, hopefully, deal with lag. Obviously, ROE cap structures still need to be finalized, but is it fair to say the parts that you agreed upon here are kind of the pieces that would address kind of regulatory lag in North Carolina in this settlement?\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nI feel like it's a really key step in that direction, Steve, because for the first time, we have approval of forward capital in a way that gives us some confidence. And the construct of the legislation is such that we have an opportunity to adjust price as that capital is spent in a way that, as you know, is really new in the Carolinas and will reduce regulatory lag. So I think starting back with the legislation, we've been making progress toward modernization, and now with the settlement, have approval of that capital or have a settlement around that capital, of course, commissioned to approve in a way that we feel like we're making strong progress.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Our next question goes to David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEVP of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nHi, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEVP of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning. Let's see. I wanted to check in just on the Florida 10-year site plan. I just wanted to confirm whether there could be upside to the CapEx outlook now that you've gotten that filed.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nYeah, David, I would say we're continuing it with our progress of about 300MW a year. And as we get deeper into the plan, I think we'll consider whether we're moving quickly enough. The multi-year rate plan for Florida runs through 2024. The team is signaling me here. So effective 2025, we'll kind of reset that expectation in Florida, and we'll continue to look at whether we're delivering the right amount of capital and customer value as we go, always focused on not only continuing to develop renewables at a pace, but also delivering value to customers along the way.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nOkay. Got it. Thanks. Then also just wanted to follow up on the Carolinas' settlement. I was just wondering what your current thoughts are about potentially achieving a settlement at the Duke Energy Carolinas rate case now that you've been successful in getting the partial settlement at Progress.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nDavid, I think our posture is always to look for ways to achieve settlement. If you think about the calendar or the procedural calendar of any rate case, typically parties file their positions, and then you have an opportunity to sit down and discuss. We will, of course, pursue that in the DEC case as we did in this one. We'll keep you updated as the summer progresses.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEVP of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks very much.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question goes to Bill Appicelli of UBS. Bill, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North America Power and Utiities Research, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. Just was wondering if we could get some additional color around the sales, good morning. Some additional color around the sales trends. I know you commented that when you have the extreme weather, it can distort the weather normalization trends, but maybe just some more color around why you feel better about the trend you saw in March and April.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nBrian, you want to definitely take that.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nEVP and CFO, Duke Energy\n\nThanks for the question. And I want to remind you that Q1 of 2022 was a robust quarter. We had 6% year-over-year growth that quarter, strength in all sectors as we were coming out of the COVID rebound. That was the peak point. And so we're comparing to a high watermark, and volume trends normalized to our expectations over the course of 2022. And when we looked at this year with extreme weather in January and February, as I mentioned, it's really hard to pinpoint what the true weather normalized volumes are in those situations. And when we analyzed March and April results, weather was close to normal in both those months, and the volume trends were on track with our expectations for the year. So we do feel like this is bracketed into January and February as far as the weakness.\nWe feel confident that our 0.5% load growth in 2023 and the long-term outlook around 0.5% is right for us because of the customer growth we're seeing at 1.7%, as well as the industrial expansions and economic development activity in our regions.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nExecutive Director and Head of North America Power and Utiities Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you. Just one other quick follow-up. On the corporate and other, there was a $0.08 pickup year-over-year. I know you cited some investment gains. Can you just provide some color around that?\nYes. Bill, we have investments in benefit trusts and other types of investments like that, our captive insurer. Market returns go up and down. We obviously had a strong . S&P was up around 8%, and that was reflected in the market returns in that section.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEVP of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Lynn Good, Chair, President, and CEO, for any closing comments.\n\nLynn Good\n\nChair, President and CEO, Duke Energy\n\nWell, thank you. Thanks to all of you who joined today and for your interest and investment in Duke. We're available for follow-on questions after this call and look forward to talking soon. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

Thank you for attending today's Duke Energy Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may proceed.\n\nAbby Motsinger\n\nThank you, Joel, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nAbby. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $5.27, closing out a successful 2022. We achieved results solidly within our updated guidance range while making significant progress on our strategic goals, responding to external pressures and delivering constructive outcomes across our jurisdictions. As a result, today, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75 with a midpoint of $5.65. We're also reaffirming our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027 off the midpoint of our 2023 range. This reflects the strength of our regulated businesses, our disciplined approach to cost management and a robust $65 billion capital plan that supports our thriving jurisdictions.\nBefore I turn to our regulated utilities, let me provide a brief update on the sale of our Commercial Renewables business. The sales process continues to progress. But as with the sale of any large-scale business, the timing tends to evolve. We remain on track to exit both the utility scale and the distributed energy businesses and now anticipate proceeds in the second half of the year. We will continue to keep you updated along the way.\nTurning to Slide 5. We've reached a significant milestone in our clean energy transition. On December 30, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued an order adopting an initial carbon plan. This constructive order is the culmination of years of work with policymakers and stakeholders to chart a responsible path for the energy transition. The order recognizes the value of an all-of-the-above approach to achieving carbon reduction targets in a manner that balances affordability and reliability for customers.\nThe near-term action plan provides approval of 3,100 megawatts of solar and 1,600 megawatts of storage as well as transmission upgrades to support the integration of these renewable resources. The commission also approved limited development activities associated with longer lead time investments, including small modular nuclear reactors, pumped hydro and transmission related to offshore wind. And as part of an orderly transition out of coal by 2035, the commission supported planning for approximately 2,000 megawatts of new natural gas generation to maintain reliability. Through its order, the commission reinforced the importance of maintaining a diverse generation mix while conducting an orderly clean energy transition and was clear that ensuring replacement generation is available and online prior to the retirement of existing coal units is a shared priority.\nThe carbon plant provides a constructive road map that delivers on our strategic priorities and supports the needs of our customers and communities today and into the future. It supports our capital plan and provides the clarity we need to advance critical near-term investments. We look forward to continuing our progress through our updated carbon plant filing in North Carolina later this year.\nMoving to Slide 6. We're making meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives in each of our jurisdictions. In North Carolina, we filed our first performance-based rate application for our Duke Energy Carolinas utility on January 19, which followed a similar filing for our DEP utility last fall. The request includes a multiyear rate plan to fund system improvements to meet the growing needs of our customer base, including $4.7 billion of capital projects that are expected to go into service over the 3-year period. These investments are primarily T&D-related projects that support the security and reliability of the grid as well as approximately $300 million of solar and storage investments consistent with the carbon plan order.\nOur request is mitigated by a reduction in operating costs since our last rate case, evidence of our continued ability to manage costs to keep customer rate increases down. Evidentiary hearings are expected to begin in the third quarter and consistent with past practice, we intend to implement temporary rates in September, subject to refund. If approved, we expect year 1 revised rates to be effective by early 2024.\nIn South Carolina, we were very pleased to reach a comprehensive settlement in January with all parties in our Duke Energy Progress rate case. The settlement, which is subject to commission review and approval includes a 9.6% ROE, the continuation of deferrals for grid and coal ash spend and supports accelerated retirement dates for certain coal units. In fact, the settlement is on the commission's agenda for this afternoon. And if approved, new rates are expected to be implemented in April. We also plan to file an updated IRP in South Carolina later this year, which will take into account the carbon plan and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nTurning to Florida. On January 23, we filed a petition to adjust customer rates for deferred 2022 fuel costs, less the impact of lower forecasted fuel prices in 2023. We are also flowing back IRA tax savings to our Florida customers as of January 1.\nIn Indiana, we're updating our IRP to reflect results of the 2022 RFP process, regional transmission operator requirements and the Inflation Reduction Act. We expect to begin filing for certificates of need for new power generation in the second quarter.\nIn Ohio, the commission approved in full our electric rate case settlement in December, which supports the recovery of grid investments to improve reliability and service for our customers.\nIn December, we also filed an electric rate case in Kentucky. The request reflects more than $300 million in investments we've made to strengthen the generation and delivery systems as well as updated retirement dates for our Kentucky fleet. As we advance our regulatory strategy, affordability remains top of mind. Brian will go into more detail on steps we're taking across our jurisdictions to lower costs for customers.\nFinally, I want to highlight a well-deserved recognition for our Piedmont Natural Gas team. In December, J.D. Power ranked Piedmont #1 in residential customer satisfaction for natural gas service in the Southeast. This is the first time Piedmont has received the #1 ranking and is a testament to the commitment to our customers.\nIn summary, 2022 was an extraordinary year for Duke Energy as we made strong progress executing our strategy, responding to difficult external pressures and advancing our clean energy transformation. Our path forward remains clear. As we continue to navigate our energy transition, we will do so responsibly, preserving affordability and reliability for our customers and remaining good students -- stewards of communities. I'm confident that our strategy will continue to deliver consistent and lasting benefits to our customers, communities and investors.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian D. Savoy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. 2022 marked a year of solid growth for our utilities. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.27, above the midpoint of our updated guidance range. These adjusted results exclude our Commercial Renewables business, which was moved to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter. The classification of these assets as held for sale triggered a valuation adjustment of $1.3 billion, which is reflected in discontinued operations and GAAP reported results. This adjustment relates to the combined utility scale and distributed generation businesses and was within our planning range for the sales processes.\nMoving to our adjusted results for the year. In the Electric segment, earnings per share increased by $0.36 in 2022, primarily due to higher volumes, favorable weather and rate increases in North Carolina and Florida. Partially offsetting these or higher interest expense and storm costs. Absent storms, O&M was flat to prior year, which was in line with our guidance.\nIn the Gas segment, earnings per share increased $0.07 and was primarily due to the Piedmont, North Carolina rate case and riders.\nIn the Other segment, unfavorable returns on investments and higher interest expense drove results lower by $0.15.\nTurning to Slide 8. We are reaffirming our $5.55 to $5.75 guidance range for 2023 with the midpoint of $5.65. Within Electric, we expect retail volume growth in 2023 of roughly 0.5%. We also entered the year with updated rates for Ohio and Florida already in effect and we'll see growth from 3 Carolinas rate cases as we move through the year.\nAdditionally, we will continue to see growth from the grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida, namely the Indiana TDISC and Florida SPP plans approved in 2022.\nMoving to cost mitigation. We've identified $300 million of savings in 2023, which is primarily related to rationalizing our corporate and business support cost structures. Examples include streamlining IT support and reducing our real estate footprint. These cost reductions will be realized ratably over 2023 with approximately 75% of the savings being sustainable into future years. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers are higher financing cost as well as depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base.\nWithin our Gas segment, growth drivers include the Ohio rate case currently underway, cost mitigation efforts and customer growth, partially offset by higher interest expense.\nFinally, we expect the Other segment to be unfavorable due to higher interest expense.\nTurning to retail electric volumes on Slide 9. In 2022, we saw load growth of 2.5%. These strong results were driven by residential customer growth of 1.8%, higher usage per customer from hybrid and remote work and a continuation of the post-COVID rebound in the commercial class. Our total retail load in 2022 was about 2% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. This is equivalent to an average annual growth rate of around 0.5% when smoothing out the year-to-year fluctuations. In 2023, total retail load growth is projected to be roughly 0.5%.\nBased on 2022 U.S. Census Bureau data, 3 states within our regulated footprint were in the top 6 for net population migration. This illustrates the robust customer growth experienced in our territories, which we expect to continue in 2023. We expect load growth in the commercial class to moderate this year following 2 years of significant growth. But the upside in industrial as easing supply chain constraints fuel a continued rebound for certain large manufacturers. Longer term, we expect annual load growth to be about 0.5% through 2027.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'd like to provide an overview of our 5-year capital plan, which has increased to $65 billion. When compared to prior periods, the capital plan has steadily increased as we move further into the clean energy transition. This increase is net of removing almost $3 billion of commercial renewables capital, including the previous 5-year plan. This means that we've increased the regulated plan by approximately $5 billion, resulting in a 7.1% earnings-based CAGR through 2027.\nWhile the investment needs of our utilities continue to accelerate, customer affordability remains front and center. Affordability has consistently been a pillar that governs our planning, and we have several tools to help keep rates low and assist customers who are struggling to pay their bill. First, the benefits of our cost mitigation efforts go back to customers over time, easing bill impacts as we recover capital investments. As I mentioned, we expect 75% of our 2023 cost mitigation efforts to be sustainable.\nAdditionally, we are targeting flat O&M from 2024 through 2027. Our long-term O&M trajectory is supported by smart capital investments within our plan, including modernized equipment and technology investments that will help reduce fuel and operating costs.\nNext, the Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial benefits for carbon-free resources, including nuclear and solar PTCs and other renewable tax credits. We are beginning to incorporate these benefits and updated resources plans and rate adjustments. Over the next decade, we will fully leverage IRA benefits across all of our jurisdictions in order to maintain low cost for customers as we execute our clean energy transition.\nFinally, assisting vulnerable customers has always been an area of focus. But since the pandemic, we worked even more closely with our communities and customers in need. For example, in 2021, we created a specialized team that partnered with agencies across our service territories and help connect customers to nearly $300 million in energy assistance funding over the 2 years.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet, and we remain committed to our current credit ratings. In December 2022, we received $1 billion in cash proceeds upon the closing of the second tranche of the Indiana minority stake sale. We expect to receive proceeds from the Commercial Renewables transactions later this year, which will be used for debt avoidance at the holding company.\nTurning to FFO to debt. We ended 2022 below our 14% target, largely due to deferred fuel balances. We have started recovering these amounts through established recovery mechanisms and we'll continue to file using mechanisms in place for the remaining balances. As we recover deferred fuel costs over the next 1 to 2 years, we expect FFO to debt to steadily improve and return to our long-term 14% target, demonstrating our commitment to our current credit ratings.\nAs we look ahead, about 90% of the electric investments in our capital plan are eligible for modern recovery mechanisms, which is critical to maintaining a strong balance sheet, mitigating regulatory lag and smoothing rate impacts. With the steps we've taken to reposition our business and improve our cash flow profile in the years ahead, we are not planning to issue equity through 2027.\nMoving to Slide 12. Our robust capital plan, strong customer growth and constructive jurisdictions provide a compelling growth story. And our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand its importance to our shareholders and 2023 marks the 97th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the dividend balancing our targeted 65% to 75% payout ratio with the need to fund our capital. As we begin 2023, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.\nWith that, we'll open the line for your questions."

My name is Brica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Duke Energy Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nJack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nJack Sullivan\n\nVP of IR, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Brica, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nSo with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nJack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the work of our team in responding to Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful and destructive storms in U.S. history. Duke Energy mobilized 20,000 people, working day and night, to restore power to over 2 million customers across Florida and the Carolinas. And what's more impressive is the speed in which we did it, with 99% of our customers restored within 72 hours. This is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to our strong corporation, the tireless effort of our restoration teams and the value of our grid-hardening investments.\nMoving to our financial results today. We announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 for the third quarter. We continue to see strong volumes from the electric utilities, offset by lower contributions from commercial renewables due to fewer projects placed in service compared to 2021.\nTurning to the commercial renewables business, we've completed the strategic review, and our Board has authorized the sale of this business. I'll provide more context about this decision in a moment, but first, I'd like to address what this means for our 2022 earnings guidance. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we will move commercial renewables to discontinued operations and remove it from guidance going forward.\nBringing focus to our core regulated businesses, we are updating full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $5.20 to $5.30. The $5.25 midpoint of this updated range represents our original guidance midpoint of $5.45, less the $0.20 contribution we originally forecasted for commercial renewables. The regulated utilities remain on track for 2022 with strong operating results, offsetting rising financing costs giving us confidence in achieving earnings within this tighter range.\nTurning to Slide 5. In August, we announced a strategic review of the commercial renewables business, which includes our utility scale renewables platform in a smaller distributed generation business. As part of this review, we've worked with advisers to evaluate the strategic fit of these businesses and to test the market on valuation. We've received indications of interest for the utility scale business at attractive valuations and this process will continue through year-end. We expect to announce a definitive transaction in Q1 2023 and close as early as midyear. We're preparing the sale process for the distributed generation business, which includes REC Solar and expect this transaction will follow a similar time line to closing.\nThe majority of proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce holding company debt. This will strengthen the balance sheet and allow us to fund our clean energy transition with our common equity issuances through at least 2027. I'm very proud of our commercial team, who has remained focused on maximizing the value of the portfolio, continuing to expand our robust development pipeline and operating a renewables fleet with excellence.\nWith this pending change in our business mix, I'd like to walk you through our earnings trajectory over the next 2 years. For 2023, we're introducing a guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75, with a midpoint of $5.65. This reflects 5% to 7% growth of the updated 2022 EPS midpoint of $5.25. It also includes a partial year benefit from lower interest expense after reducing holdco debt with sales proceeds.\nTurning to 2024 and beyond, we expect to grow 5% to 7% off the $5.65 midpoint of our 2023 guidance range through 2027. The 2023 guidance range reflects what we know today, including the present interest rate environment, inflation, supply chain constraints and an economic forecast that continues to support positive GDP growth in 2023. But the economic outlook remains uncertain, and we'll continue to closely monitor trends. Consistent with past practices, we'll do all we can to control costs to match challenges in our business while maintaining excellent service to our customers.\nAs a result, we've increased our 2023 cost mitigation target from $200 million to $300 million. We expect about 75% of these savings to be sustainable over the long term. We will keep you apprised along the way and look forward to sharing our traditional guidance package on the year-end earnings call in February.\nBrian will provide more on our 2023 earnings drivers, but I want to underscore the strength of our underlying core utility business. We operate premier regulated franchises and growing service territories with constructive regulatory jurisdictions and robust customer-focused investment opportunities. They have always been the lifeblood of our company. And this portfolio transition will fully highlight the strong, predictable, transparent earnings and cash flows from our premier regulated utilities and strengthen our overall investor value proposition.\nNext, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the important strategic work underway throughout our jurisdictions. Moving to Slide 6. In October, we filed our first performance-based regulation application under HB 951. We filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, requesting a review of the significant investments we're making for our 1.5 million Duke Energy Progress customers served in North Carolina. The rate increase will cover upgrades we've made to improve grid reliability and resiliency and to facilitate a clean secure energy future.\nOur application contains a traditional base rate case, based on historical investments and known measurable changes projected through April of 2023. Our request is mitigated by a reduction in annual operating costs of over $100 million since our last rate case. In addition to historic investments, our application includes gradual customer rate step-ups over the next 3 years to recover future investments we will make through the multiyear rate plan. This consists of roughly $3.8 billion of capital projects that are projected to go into service by 2025, approximately 75% of which is related to transmission and distribution investments.\nEvidentiary hearings are expected to begin in the May 2023 time frame. Consistent with past practice, we intend to implement temporary rates in June for the historic base case subject to refund. If approved, we expect year 1 revised rates to be effective by October 1, 2023.\nTurning to Slide 7. Our focus on providing customers with affordable, reliable and cleaner energy continues to advance across each of our jurisdictions. In North Carolina, Carbon Plan hearings conclude in late September after almost 3 weeks, and we submitted our proposed order at the end of October. During the hearing, we presented strong testimony that confirms the need for our near-term development activities. The MCU team will make a final decision on the Carbon Plan by the end of this year. We expect to file a Duke Energy Carolinas rate case with the NCUC in early 2023.\nIn South Carolina, we filed a rate case for Duke Energy Progress in September, as we continue to work on increasing system reliability and resiliency and enhancing the customer experience. To ease the impact of these investments on customers, proposed rates would go into effect over 2 years beginning in the first half of 2023. In Florida, the Public Service Commission approved our storm protection plan update in October. Over the next 10 years, we expect to deploy $7 billion in capital investments through this rider.\nShifting to the Midwest and Indiana, we're updating our integrated resource plan. We've held the first of 3 public information sessions with stakeholders to share information about plans under consideration and we anticipate filing CPCNs for new generation resource needs with the Commission beginning in early 2023. And in Ohio, we completed a hearing in October for our electric distribution rate case. We expect to receive a final order by the end of 2022 or early 2023.\nMoving to Slide 8. I'd like to update you on our ongoing review of the clean energy provisions under the IRA legislation. High energy costs are top of mind for our customers and the IRAs clean energy tax credits present an opportunity to help address those issues. We expect to qualify for a variety of PTCs and ITCs that will generate billions of dollars in tax credits over the next decade. These tax credits will be returned to our customers, lowering our overall cost of service, and providing for a more affordable energy transition.\nWe will continue to evaluate the impact of the corporate minimum tax as new information and guidance from treasury becomes available. Because of the credits generated by our substantial clean energy infrastructure investments, we do not expect this to have a material impact on our cash flows. In closing, we're advancing our strategy across our jurisdictions, balancing the progress of our clean energy transition while preserving affordability and reliability for our customers and communities.\nI'm confident in our long-term earnings growth and ability to execute our strategy moving forward. As I look ahead, we're well positioned to deliver exceptional value to our customers, stakeholders and investors.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian D. Savoy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. As shown on Slide 9, we had reported earnings per share of $1.81 compared to $1.79 last year. As Lynn shared, we are moving forward with the sale of our commercial renewables business, and we'll move those results to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter. For presentation purposes, going forward, our focus will be on the strong earnings profile of our core regulated operations, which delivered $1.78 in adjusted EPS in the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, our core operations generated earnings of $4.15 compared to $4.10 for 2021. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation included in the earnings release for more details.\nWithin our core business segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.06 compared to the prior year, driven by higher retail volumes and lower O&M. Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base. We continue to be encouraged by the sustained retail load growth in the post-COVID environment, and I will provide more on the volume trends in a moment.\nShifting to Gas Utilities & Infrastructure, results were $0.01 higher than last year due to increases in riders in the North Carolina Piedmont rate case. And in the other segment, we were $0.07 lower primarily due to higher financing costs, timing of tax expense and lower returns on investments.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'll touch on electric volumes and economic trends. On a 12-month rolling average basis, total retail volumes are up 1.7%, in line with our 2022 low growth forecast of 1.5% to 2%. In the third quarter, higher year-over-year volumes were driven by residential customer growth of 1.7%. We continue to see strong and steady migration to our service territories and continued expansion in the commercial class, including higher data center usage. This was partially offset by lower industrial volumes, isolated to a few automotive customers experiencing supply chain constraints. We are closely monitoring how these factors and other potential economic dynamics are impacting our customers' usage, but we continue to expect 2022 volume growth to land within our 1.5% to 2% range.\nOur economic development achievements, to attract jobs and capital investment to our service territories, were recently recognized by Site Selection magazine, which named Duke Energy a top utility for economic development for the 17th consecutive year.\nWe've continued to accelerate this work into 2022. We partnered with our states to win record-setting projects in North Carolina, with semiconductor manufacturer Wolfspeed; in South Carolina, with BMW's entry into the EV market; and in Indiana with the Stellantis-Samsung EV battery plant. These projects and others announced throughout 2022 involve capital hitting $20 billion, and we'll bring more than 24,000 jobs to our growing service territories. We'll begin to see top line growth from these business expansions as we progress through the 5-year plan.\nWe'll break down the outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 11. We are well positioned to achieve our updated $5.25 adjusted EPS midpoint for 2022. Year-to-date, our core regulated business has generated earnings -- adjusted earnings of $4.15. We expect a solid finish to the year with continued strong performance in our regulated utilities. We have good line of sight to the remaining $1.10 in the fourth quarter.\nLet me take a moment to highlight some of the key drivers. Beginning with the Electric segment. We expect year-over-year revenue favorability from higher volumes, which were impacted by the Omicron variant in 2021, a return to normal weather and the Florida multiyear rate plan and other riders.\nTurning to gas. We will benefit from rate cases and our integrity management riders. We will see lower O&M across our electric and gas operations. The timing of plant outages and shaping of O&M led to higher O&M in the first half of 2022 as compared to 2021. We saw this trend begin to reverse in Q3 and expect it to accelerate in Q4. Finally, we expect the Other segment to be unfavorable to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense.\nMoving to Slide 12. I'll highlight the key growth drivers for 2023 that support our $5.55 to $5.75 EPS range for the year. 2023 reflects the acceleration of investments in our clean energy transition across our service territories and the implementation of key provisions from House Bill 951. Beginning with the Electric segment, we'll enter 2023 with load that is 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, we expect load growth to be back in line with our pre-pandemic consumption of flat to 0.5% growth per year. This will be offset by weather, which has been favorable year-to-date in 2022.\nShifting to rate cases and riders. We have an active regulatory calendar across our jurisdictions. This includes 3 rate cases in the Carolinas and 2 rate cases in Ohio. In Florida, we'll move to the second year of our multiyear rate plan with an updated 10.1% ROE. Finally, we see growth through continued investment in our electric and gas riders. Macroeconomic conditions remain dynamic. And as Lynn mentioned earlier, we're exercising our business agility by increasing our 2023 cost mitigation target from $200 million to $300 million.\nWe have a strong track record of pulling both structural and tactical levers to flex our costs to meet business challenges head on and are confident we can achieve these savings. Lastly, we will enjoy a partial year benefit of interest expense savings from reduced holdco debt with proceeds from the commercial renewables sale.\nBefore we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 13. With the pending sale of our commercial business, we'll transition to a fully regulated business with robust investment opportunities, roughly $145 billion over the next decade. This also positions the company with a derisked earnings profile, giving us confidence in achieving our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75 and 5% to 7% growth rate.\nWith that, we'll open the line for your questions."

My name is Joanne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nJack Sullivan\n\nVP of IR, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2022 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings.\nThe appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nSo with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nJack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 for the quarter, delivering strong results driven by continued growth in electric volumes and favorable weather. We remain on track to deliver within our original guidance range and are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 with a midpoint of $5.45. We're also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2026, off the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range.\nTurning to Slide 5, I'd like to offer context on our announcement this morning to perform a strategic review of our Commercial Renewables business, which has been an integral part of Duke Energy's renewable energy platform over the past 15 years. Since 2007, we've built a portfolio of approximately 5,000 megawatts of Commercial wind, solar and battery projects across the U.S. and established a robust development pipeline. While it represents less than 5% of Duke Energy's earnings, we're proud of the fact, it's among the top 10 largest U.S. renewable companies.\nBut as we look forward to the remainder of this decade and beyond, we have line of sight to significant renewable grid and other investment opportunities within our faster-growing regulated operations, as we execute the industry's largest clean energy transition. We believe this is the appropriate time to review the ongoing strategic fit of our Commercial operations as we prepare for an acceleration in capital spending within our regulated businesses. Our strategic review will be thorough yet timely. We expect to conclude the review later this year or early next, and we'll update you along the way.\nToday, our regulated utility operations represent over 95% of Duke Energy's earnings profile, and have long been the growth engine of our company. We operate premier regulated franchises in growing service territories with constructive regulatory jurisdictions and robust customer-focused investment opportunities. Our regulated businesses are strongly positioned to grow within our earnings guidance range of 5% to 7%, providing consistent earnings and cash flow and supporting our attractive dividend.\nTurning to Slide 6, let me share an overview of the proposed carbon plan we filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission on May 16. We've already made significant progress in the Carolinas, and this plan continues our transition to lower carbon resources, while maintaining affordability and reliability. Our plan contains 4 portfolios that achieve the interim 70% carbon reduction target and carbon neutrality by 2050. Each portfolio presents a road map to lower emissions through an orderly retirement of coal, replacing it with a diverse set of carbon-free and dispatchable resources.\nThe primary difference among the portfolios relates to the pace of deployment and availability of replacement resources. As part of the filing, we've requested the approval of a defined set of near-term activities, related to replacement resources needed regardless of the path selected. This includes new solar, battery storage, onshore wind and hydrogen capable natural gas. We also requested to begin early development of long lead time 0 carbon resources, which are needed in the early 2030s, including offshore wind, small modular nuclear, and pumped storage. These activities help us preserve option value for a broader set of resources.\nThe results of these development activities will be filed in 2024 with an updated carbon plan, providing the commission with more information as they consider resource selections required to meet carbon reduction targets. We look forward to continued engagement with stakeholders as the NCUC finalizes the carbon plan by year-end. Our proposed plan has also been shared with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. And the final plan will be foundational to the next comprehensive South Carolina IRP in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 7. We have a robust regulatory and legislative plan that is underway in the vibrant economies we serve. Our thriving jurisdictions were highlighted recently in CNBC's Annual List of America's top states for business, which ranked 5 of the states we serve in the top 15, including North Carolina, which ranked #1 for the first time.\nI'd like to touch on the progress we're making in each of our jurisdictions to continue providing affordable and reliable energy for our customers. In North Carolina, we expect to file a DEP rate case in the fourth quarter, and likely a DEC rate case early next year. Both cases will introduce the modernized rate-making tools approved in HB 951 including multiyear rate plans, performance incentive measures, and residential decoupling. The NCUC hosted a T&D Technical Conference in late July. DEP presented to the commission, stakeholders and discussed key transmission and distribution investments that enhanced grid resiliency and flexibility, and expand the use of renewables and distributed energy resources on our system.\nIn South Carolina, Storm Securitization legislation was signed into law in June. This creates a valuable tool to recover prior and future storm restoration costs, while saving customers millions of dollars compared to traditional recovery mechanisms. We expect to file an initial application with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina in August, and expect to issue Store Bonds in late 2023 or early 2024.\nEarlier this week, we gave notice of an upcoming DEP South Carolina rate case. Our first case to be filed in South Carolina since 2018. We expect to file the case in September and anticipate rates to go into effect in the first half of 2023.\nIn Florida, we have placed 3 out of 4 solar projects planned for 2022 online, and we remain on track to install a total of 300 megawatts of solar by the end of this year.\nShifting to Indiana. The commission approved our $2 billion TDSIC plan, which includes grid modernization investments and improved reliability and resiliency. We will begin executing in 2023 following the completion of our initial TDSIC plan this year. In May, we received a robust response to our request for proposals for generation resources in Indiana. We're evaluating the proposals now, and we'll incorporate the results into our CPCN filings later this year.\nAnd turning to Ohio. Our electric distribution rate case continues to move forward, and the hearing is scheduled to begin in mid-September. In June, we filed an Ohio gas rate case, which is our first detailed review of gas base rates since 2012.\nMoving to Slide 8, I'd like to touch on the Inflation Reduction Act that was announced this week. Duke Energy has always advocated for policies aligned with our mission to deliver affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy to our customers. And the clean energy tax provisions of this draft legislation do just that. If passed, the clean energy tax credits will lower our cost of service, which in turn reduces the cost to customers of our energy transition.\nFurthermore, the transferability provisions can help direct the intended value of these credits to our customers more efficiently. The bill also recognizes the important role that existing nuclear plays with nuclear PTCs awarded to operators of highly efficient nuclear stations. Duke Energy operates the largest regulated nuclear fleet in the U.S. with some of the highest efficiency measures. As such, we would likely qualify for significant nuclear production tax credits, also to the benefit of our customers in the Carolinas.\nWe're pleased to see the strong support of the clean energy provisions in this draft legislation, and we look forward to tracking the bill's progress, and we'll keep you informed along the way.\nIn closing, we have a clear path ahead of us as we execute our energy transition, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver value to customers and shareholders.\nBefore I hand the call over to Steve, I'd like to comment on some important organizational changes we announced earlier this week. Effective September 1, Brian Savoy, currently Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Commercial Officer, will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Steve. Brian's deep financial acumen and broad business experience have prepared him well for this role, allowing for a seamless transition.\nSteve will become Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. One of Steve's main priorities will be to oversee the strategic review of our commercial renewables portfolio that we announced this morning. Steve is an exceptional leader. And during his 40-year career, has played an instrumental role in transforming Duke Energy into the strong company it is today. He has been an extraordinary partner of mine and a trusted counselor and his commitment to our company, customers, communities and employees is deeply appreciated and recognized by all of our stakeholders.\nBrian also shares this commitment and will play a critical role in advancing our strategy while delivering sustainable value to our customers and shareholders. The depth of leadership at this company is impressive, I would say it's second to none. And these changes will further position us for success, as we execute the industry's largest clean energy transition.\nAnd so with that, thanks to Steve, and let me turn the call over to him.\n\nSteven Keith Young\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year.\nAs shown on Slide 9, we had reported an adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. This is compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 and $1.15 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation included in the earnings release materials for more details.\nWithin the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.03 compared to the prior year. Results were driven by favorable weather, higher retail volumes and rate increases. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M, including timing of outages as compared to last year, and higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base.\nShifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were $0.02 lower due to timing of O&M. In our Commercial business, we were flat with higher wind resources offset by fewer projects placed in service. And in the Other segment, we were $0.02 lower, primarily due to lower market returns on benefit trusts.\nTurning to Slide 10. I'll touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We continue to see strong volume growth, and our results for the second quarter were approximately 1.5%, were up approximately 1.5% year-over-year. On a rolling 12-month basis, volumes are up 2.6% and are slightly higher than volumes for 2019, the last full year prior to COVID. We continue to expect our rolling 12-month volume growth rate to moderate throughout the year, but now forecast 2022 load growth between 1.5% to 2%, above our original guidance of 1.5%.\nLooking at the customer classes, Residential volumes were up 1.2%, bolstered by year-over-year customer growth of 1.8% and the continuation of remote and hybrid work for many office workers. Our Commercial and Industrial classes both increased 1.7%. Within Commercial, we saw the benefit of return to normal business hours. And in Industrial, our load growth was driven by a continued rebound for existing customers, coupled with new load for companies attracted to our service territories. We remain encouraged by our volume recovery, which is supported by the vibrant economies we serve.\nMoving to Slide 11. I'd like to go over timing considerations for the second half of the year. We expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be slightly lower than 2021, mainly due to favorable weather in the prior year, higher interest expense, tax timing and lower contributions from Commercial Renewables. This will be partially offset by higher revenues from rate cases, riders and wholesale. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see favorability from several drivers, including normal weather, higher loan, lower O&M and higher revenue from rate cases and riders.\nAs we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect to hold O&M flat for the year, absent our first quarter storm cost. I'd like to take a moment to discuss several initiatives we're working on to respond to rising interest rates and inflation. To address these macroeconomic headwinds, we're targeting cost mitigation of $200 million across the enterprise beginning in 2023. The key areas we're focusing on are employee-driven productivity and cost savings initiatives, digital automation, leveraging our size and scale to reduce cost to our supply chain, tax optimization and reducing regulatory lag through CapEx timing.\nWe believe much of this will be sustainable, similar to what we achieved in 2020 in response to COVID. Over the long term, this effort will benefit our customers and help enable our energy transition, as lower O&M will moderate future rate impacts. For every dollar of O&M we eliminate, we can invest about $7 of capital without increasing cost to customers. Work is underway for each of these initiatives, and we'll provide additional details as we move through the process.\nBefore we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 12. We're off to a strong start in the first half of the year and are well positioned to achieve our 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 with a midpoint of $5.45. And this marks the 96th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividends and the 16th consecutive annual increase. As Lynn discussed earlier, we are undertaking a strategic review of our Commercial Renewables business. We will keep you updated on any decisions from the evaluation and any impacts it may have on our future financial guidance.\nWith that, we'll open the line for your questions."

Thank you for attending today's Duke Energy Quarter 1 2020 Conference Call. My name is Amber, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I now have the pleasure of handing the conference over to our host, Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations with Duke Energy. Mr. Sullivan, please proceed.\n\nJack Sullivan\n\nVP of IR, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Amber. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws.

So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nJack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 for the quarter, delivering strong results to start the year, driven by continued growth in electric volumes. That growth was partially offset by $0.07 of higher expense from severe winter storms. I'd like to take a moment to thank approximately 19,000 restoration workers, who worked tirelessly to restore power to over 1 million customers across a series of winter storms, the most we've seen in 8 years.\nDespite the Q1 storms, we remain on track to deliver within our original guidance range and are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60, with a midpoint of $5.45. We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2026, at the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. We're monitoring economic trends and will take action if necessary as we continue to execute the important strategic work we have underway in the Carolinas, Indiana and Florida. I will touch on this more in just a moment.\nTurning to Slide 5. We published our first ESG report in late April that expands our historic sustainability themes and adds more insight on social and governance topics. We've included some highlights and key accomplishments on this slide. We've got a strong track record in each of these areas and have established ambitious targets for the future. Our work has been recognized across the ESG community, including by MSCI, which upgraded our ESG rating to AA in February. We're also laying the groundwork for even more progress with our proposed carbon plant in North Carolina, our IRP in Indiana and our ongoing solar and grid investments in Florida. We look forward to sharing additional updates throughout the year and during our ESG Day on October 4.\nMoving to Slide 6. Let me spend a few minutes on North Carolina. There's a meaningful progress in the state implementing the framework set forth in House Bill 951. As a reminder, this landmark bipartisan legislation provides for a clean energy transition as well as modernize performance-based rate-making provisions, including multiyear rate plans, performance incentive measures and residential decoupling.\nWe've been working closely with stakeholders on the development of our proposed carbon plan, which we will file with the commission on May 16. The plan will outline multiple portfolios to achieve the 70% carbon reduction target, including proposals around timing of coal plant retirements and resource additions. We expect substantial solar and battery additions, demand-side management and energy efficiency opportunities in every pathway. Onshore and offshore wind will be presented for consideration as well as small modular nuclear reactors. Each portfolio has been rigorously tested for reliability and affordability for our customers.\nFollowing the May 16 filing of our proposed carbon plan, the commission will gather additional stakeholder input, make adjustments and approve a final plan by the end of the year. The plan will be updated every 2 years thereafter. In February, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued its order on rulemaking for performance-based regulation. And in April, the Commission issued its order on rulemaking for coal plant securitization. This allows our North Carolina utilities to securitize half of the remaining carrying value of certain coal plants upon their early retirement. Both orders were constructive, establishing processes that are fair, balanced and consistent with the policy objectives of HB 951.\nAnother strategic priority for 2022 is to file a rate case, introducing the modernized rate-making tools approved in HB 951. The NCUC has established a process for these filings that include technical conferences on the multiyear rate plans prior to filing. We currently expect to file a DEP North Carolina rate case in the fourth quarter and likely a DEC North Carolina rate case early next year.\nTurning to Slide 7. I'd like to touch on the key initiatives across our service territories. In South Carolina, storm cost securitization legislation continues to move forward. The proposed legislation has passed in the Senate and is now being heard in the house. If enacted, this legislation would provide an additional tool to recover prior and future storm restoration costs, creating significant savings for our customers as compared to traditional recovery mechanisms.\nMoving to Florida, we're making investments to harden the grid under our storm protection plan. We recently filed our updated plan, which includes $7 billion of capital investments over the next 10 years. In Indiana, we filed request for proposals for up to 2,400 megawatts of new generation through 2027, which includes both intermittent and dispatchable resources to support our transition from coal. We're pleased with the response to our intermittent RFP, having received bids from 13 developers on more than 30 different projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts. On May 2, we received the bids for the dispatchable portion of the RFP and are reviewing them now. We expect to file CPCNs with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission later this year.\nIn November, we filed our second TDSIC plan in Indiana. The 6-year, $2 billion plan includes investments to improve customer reliability, harden the grid and prepare for distributed generation. A hearing was held in March, and we expect to receive a decision from the commission in July. If approved, the program would begin in 2023.\nShifting to the LDCs, we continue to make investments to build needed infrastructure, improve reliability and to comply with federal regulations. In South Carolina, we filed a general rate case in April. If approved, we anticipate revised customer rates will be effective by October. And in Tennessee, legislation was recently passed that will allow natural gas utilities to invest in low to 0 emission capital projects. This legislation will help enable our decarbonization vision for our natural gas business unit and could serve as a blueprint for legislation in other states across the country.\nIn closing, we're making progress on all fronts across our jurisdictions, meeting our commitments and executing our clean energy strategy. We have a clear path forward for 2022, and believe our investment plan will deliver sustainable value to shareholders and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next 5 years. And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven Keith Young\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. As shown on Slide 8, our first quarter reported earnings per share was $1.08, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.30. This compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 and $1.26 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation included in the earnings release for more details.\nWithin the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to higher volumes and base rate increases. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M, primarily attributed to severe winter storms and weaker weather than last year. In our gas LDC business, we were flat year-over-year, with contributions from rate cases and riders, offset by higher O&M due to timing and costs associated with new investments. Results from Commercial were $0.02 lower due to fewer growth investments compared to 2021, partially offset by favorability from fewer winter storms impacting our commercial fleet. And in the other segment, we were $0.04 lower, primarily due to lower market returns on benefit trusts.\nTurning to Slide 9, let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We started off the year with continued load growth, improving our rolling 12-month retail growth rate to 3.8%. This figure has continued to steadily improve over the past 4 quarters as we've been replacing weaker quarters experienced in the first year of the pandemic, with stronger quarters during the second year. We believe Q1 '22 represents the high watermark for this rolling 12-month figure and expect the growth rate will moderate as we move further into 2022, ultimately landing around 1.5% for the full year. This is consistent with the 2022 load forecast we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nThe favorable first quarter results for the electric utilities are mainly driven by sustained residential customer growth of 1.8% and the loosening of COVID restrictions for commercial and industrial customers. We also benefited from residential customers who continue to work from home and from incremental load in the Carolinas and Midwest as customers rode out several winter storms from home.\nFor commercial and industrial classes, we saw a continued rebound of our existing customers. And looking ahead, we will start to see incremental growth from new customers due to the outstanding accomplishments of our economic development team. In 2021, we helped attract nearly 12,500 new jobs and $6.2 billion in capital investment to our service territories, creating vibrant economies and accelerating growth in our communities. We have seen this momentum continue into 2022.\nWhile these results are a great start to the year, we are watching key economic indicators such as moderating GDP growth, rising inflation and supply chain constraints. We will actively -- we will activate agility measures and leverage our size and scale to counteract rising cost and secure necessary materials through vendor relationships, advanced ordering and other measures. This work will continue for all aspects of our business to control O&M costs, to secure the materials and services we need to execute our growth plan.\nWith ongoing constraints impacting the global supply of solar panels, let me take a moment to address this matter. On our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we reduced our 2022 net income projection for the Commercial Renewables segment to approximately $150 million, down from our original range of $200 million to $250 million. This related to a strategic decision to prioritize our regulated solar projects with our existing panel supply.\nHaving taken those steps in February, we are well positioned on all solar projects slated for 2022 across our regulated and commercial operations. Looking to 2023 and beyond, we're closely monitoring the Department of Commerce investigations. We assess the timing of our solar projects. On the regulated side, we expect no delays in 2023. For commercial renewables business, we are targeting approximately 800 megawatts of solar in 2023 and have line of sight on roughly half at this time. Panels have been secured and PPA negotiations are underway.\nThe remaining solar projects are in various stages of development and largely dependent upon panel price clarity. If delays persist, we may see a few projects shift from 2023 to 2024, resulting in the commercial business delivering more in line with 2022. We are planning for a range of outcomes and have a pipeline of capital and agility levers to maintain our 5% to 7% annual earnings growth trajectory. As a reminder, our commercial solar capital for 2023 represents approximately 1% of our total CapEx for the 5-year plan.\nTurning to our nuclear operations. Duke Energy owns and operates the largest regulated nuclear fleet in North America. As such, we have a significant inventory of enriched uranium product and have agreements with a diverse set of suppliers across several continents. Regardless of any potential sanctions related to the Russia-Ukraine war, our existing uranium inventories, contracts and supply flexibility are sufficient to fuel our nuclear fleet.\nLet me close with Slide 11. We are off to a good start in 2022, and feel confident of our earnings guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60, with a midpoint of $5.45. Let me discuss the earnings profile for the remainder of the year. Compared to 2021 second quarter, we will see higher O&M, simply due to the different slotting of planned outages in a given calendar year. Additionally, the Florida rate settlement timing and wholesale contract recognition will pick up in the second half of 2022. The growth in the natural gas business unit, resulting from rate cases, riders and customer growth, will largely impact the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Commercial Renewables, the majority of the negative variance, compared to 2021, occurs in the first half of the year. Again, we are on target for earnings in 2022, but these factors will impact the quarterly shaping of those earnings. In conclusion, we continue to make meaningful strides in 2022 towards the advancement of our clean energy strategy, with a keen focus on affordability and reliability for our customers. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities and robust service territories provides a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Sullivan\n\nVP of IR, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Samira. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2021 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.\nSo with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn.\n\nLynn J. Good\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nJack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. During our call this morning, we're pleased to share our 2021 results and our outlook for 2022 and beyond, including progress on our clean energy transition. The fourth quarter capped off a strong finish to a very productive 2021 where we made great progress against our strategic and financial goals. As a result, today, we announced 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $5.24, putting us above the midpoint of our updated guidance range. We also announced our 2022 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 with a midpoint of $5.45, extending our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate through 2026, off the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range.\nOur clean energy strategy requires significant investment, and we're now budgeting $63 billion in CapEx over the next 5 years, 80% of which represents investments toward our clean energy transition. This growing investment base in constructive and thriving jurisdictions give us confidence in our ability to earn within our 5% to 7% earnings guidance range throughout the next 5 years and in the top half of the range as our plan progresses. Steve will go into more details on our 2021 results and our updated 5-year financial plan.\nBut before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to highlight some of the important strategic work underway.\n2021 was a transformative year for our company. And in each of our 3 regions, we made meaningful progress, and we enter 2022 on strong footing. In North Carolina, leaders came together to pass House Bill 951. This landmark bipartisan legislation defines the state's clean energy transition and work is underway to implement it. The North Carolina Utilities Commission is developing rules on the performance-based ratemaking provisions in the legislation. We're confident the commission will adopt a balanced set of rules that provide flexibility to implement performance-based rates in a way that achieves policy goals and aligns with customer interest. We expect an order later this week.\nThe North Carolina Commission is also developing rules related to the securitization of 50% of subcritical coal plants upon their early retirements. We proposed a set of rules consistent with the North Carolina storm securitization bonds we issued last fall. Those bonds will save customers approximately 35% or $300 million over the next 20 years. We expect an order on securitization by mid-April.\nWe plan to file our carbon plan in May after gathering stakeholder input over the next several months. HB 951 provides a framework to reach 70% carbon reduction by 2030 and the carbon plan will be a roadmap to achieve this objective. The plan we submit will have multiple portfolios that weigh the costs and benefits, including reliability and affordability of various resource types. We will also evaluate with stakeholders and our regulators the full range of potential risks and opportunities related to new clean energy technologies. We expect an order on the carbon plan by the end of this year.\nIn Indiana, we submitted an IRP in December after extensive stakeholder engagement. As the largest generator in the state of Indiana, we are retiring more coal and adding more renewables than any other Indiana utility. Our preferred scenario reduces carbon emissions from our Indiana fleet by 63% by 2030 and 88% by 2040 compared to 2005 levels. It adds over 7 gigawatts of renewables over the 20-year horizon and accelerates the retirement of coal generation with a targeted exit from coal by 2035. This plan also includes natural gas and a prudent amount of market purchases for capacity and energy requirements. As is the case in all jurisdictions, we expect a robust review of all planned resource additions to achieve the environmental, reliability and affordability goals of the state. We will issue a request for proposal for new generation later this month.\nAnd following the RFP process, we will file CPCNs with the Indiana Commission later this year.\nIn Florida, we received approval of the $1 billion Clean Energy Connection solar program, which calls for 750 megawatts over the next 3 years. We'll begin the first year of that program in 2022, along with completing the final solar projects under the SoBRA rider. To date, we've put approximately 600 megawatts of solar generation in service in Florida with another 150 megawatts currently under construction.\nLet me close by putting our progress and our plans for the future in the context of our climate strategy. Given the scale of our company, we're leading the industry's most ambitious clean energy transformation. This demands active engagement with regulators, policymakers, customers and stakeholders to make the vision a reality. It requires candid discussions about the appropriate energy policy for each state, recognizing the unique differences of existing resources, customer bases and policy objectives. It also requires a focus on keeping customer bills affordable, a critical variable as we pursue this transformation. We continue to make progress and are strongly positioned to achieve our clean energy vision.\nSlide 6 captures our progress and the work underway. Let me share a few important highlights. We're executing the largest planned coal fleet retirement in our industry, targeting energy from coal to represent less than 5% by 2030 and full exit by 2035. Embedded within Duke Energy is a top 10 U.S. renewable energy company. We now own, operate or purchase more than 10,000 megawatts of solar and wind energy. We plan to reach 16,000 megawatts by 2025 and 24,000 megawatts by 2030. We've reduced our carbon emissions by 44% from 2005 levels, and we're on track to exceed 50% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050. We're actively engaged with policymakers and advocating for and piloting new clean energy technologies necessary to meet our net 0 goal.\nWe're also stepping back and evaluating our climate goals more broadly as we engage with our shareholders and discuss the growing importance of Scope 2 and 3 emissions. And just yesterday, we announced we're expanding our net 0 goals to now include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, such as upstream emissions related to procurement of fossil resources and downstream emissions from our natural gas customers' consumption. These initiatives will be a key focus area for our management team and across the entire company in 2022 and beyond.\nWe look forward to sharing more details about what it will take and the ways we're building upon our success to advance our long-term business strategy at our next ESG Day planned for October 4. I encourage you to join us for this interactive live streamed event. We accomplished a great deal in 2021. We delivered on our commitments while also strategically positioning the company for the future, derisking investments, simplifying our business and modernizing our regulatory frameworks. We have a clear vision to meet the needs of our customers and communities while remaining a strong steward of the environment. We believe this strategy will deliver strong, consistent and enduring benefits to our customers, communities and investors.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven Keith Young\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Duke Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. 2021 marked a year of strong growth in our core businesses. As shown on Slide 7, our full year adjusted earnings per share was $5.24, above the midpoint of our revised guidance range. In the electric segment, we benefited from 2% volume growth, the full year impact of constructive rate case outcomes in North Carolina and Indiana, increases in Florida from their previous multiyear rate plan and solar installations and continued rider investment in the Midwest. Additionally, we met our goal of delivering $200 million in sustainable cost savings in 2021.\nIn our gas LDC business, we saw higher results from Piedmont rate cases in North Carolina and Tennessee and contributions from customer growth and rider mechanisms. Results from commercial were lower due to fewer growth investments compared to 2020 and the impact of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021.\nTurning to Slide 8, we are introducing our $5.30 to $5.60 guidance range in 2022. For Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, we expect growth due to expansion in our robust service areas and earnings on infrastructure investments. Specifically, in Florida, we began the first year of our new multiyear rate plan, coupled with the benefits of strong customer growth. In the Carolinas, we will see earnings growth from new customers, grid investments and wholesale revenues. In the Midwest, we continue to benefit from the steady investment in T&D infrastructure.\nOur Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment is expected to benefit in 2022 from customer additions and integrity management investments as well as base rate increases following settlements approved in North Carolina and Kentucky.\nIn Commercial Renewables, we expect fewer projects in 2022 as we ramp up deployment of renewable assets in Florida and the Carolinas and provide breathing room to work through supply chain challenges. As such, the timing of some Commercial Renewables projects will shift within the 5-year plan.\nFinally, we expect the Other segment to be unfavorable, primarily due to higher interest expense as we grow our energy investment base.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. Consistent with our updated guidance on our Q3 earnings call, we achieved 2% growth for total retail volumes. This includes residential load growth of 0.7%, helped by the continuation of remote work and strong customer growth of 1.6%. In fact, 3 of the states we serve were among the top 5 states for net population migration in 2021, strong evidence of our attractive growth profile. Since the pandemic began, approximately 200,000 new customers have moved into our service areas, boosting the need for energy infrastructure. Commercial and industrial sales rebounded nicely due to increased demand for goods across many sectors. We expect continued expansion in 2022 and project load growth to increase approximately 1.5% in 2022. After '22, we expect longer-term growth to moderate to flat to 0.5% per year.\nAs I mentioned before, we delivered on our O&M target for 2021.\nOn Slide 10, you will see the work we've undertaken to lower our cost structure and bolster our potential growth. Duke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost mitigation, driven by digital capabilities, data analytics and re-skilling our workforce. Since 2016, we have not just absorbed inflation, we have removed approximately $400 million of O&M, creating value for our customers and our shareholders. For every dollar of O&M we eliminate, we can invest about $7 of capital without increasing cost to customers. Our $400 million in savings over the past 5 years has created headroom for approximately $3 billion worth of capital projects with no incremental bill impacts.\nLooking forward, we expect to hold O&M flat throughout our plans. We believe there are significant opportunities across the enterprise to further improve efficiencies, which could lower the O&M trajectory as we advance our fleet transition strategy, replacing coal assets with less O&M-intensive forms of generation is a perfect example of this and the investments we are making are designed to lower our cost structure while maintaining high standards of safety and reliability. Our size and scale remain key differentiators as we work to mitigate supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures across our cost structure.\nTurning to Slide 11, we expect to deploy over $130 billion over the next decade with $63 billion to occur over the next 5 years. This represents a $4 billion increase over our previous 5-year capital plan and strengthens our rate base growth to 6.5% to 7%. Approximately $52 billion or over 80% of our capital plan throughout 2026 will fund investments in our fleet transition and grid modernization. This will include improved reliability and resiliencies. We add more renewables to the system and extend the life of our carbon-free nuclear fleet to better serve our growing customer base.\nAs coal is phased out from our generation profile, it will be replaced with zero-carbon resources and prudent investments in cleaner natural gas. We formed strategic partnerships to study the long-term potential of hydrogen co-firing and storage, including a pilot program we launched this year, where we believe our natural gas units are well positioned to take advantage of hydrogen technology as it evolves.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our sizable capital plan, high-growth service territories, proven capability to control costs and constructive regulatory frameworks give us confidence in our ability to consistently grow earnings at 5% to 7%, and potential to earn at the top half of the range in the back half of the plan.\nMoving to Slide 13. Our ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and we remain committed to our current credit ratings. In September 2021, we received $1 billion in cash proceeds upon closing the first tranche of our minority interest sale of our Indiana utility. The second closing will occur by January 2023 and will result in another cash infusion of $1 billion. This combined $2 billion of proceeds provide good support to our credit metrics.\nWe closed out 2021 in line with our 14% FFO-to-debt target, and we expect to maintain 14% in 2022 and beyond. Our financing needs are driven by our investments. And we have constructed a plan that achieves 5% to 7% earnings growth through 2026, while maintaining our current credit profile. Our current plan does not contemplate any additional common equity through 2026, but we will monitor a variety of things that may influence future needs, including the pace and size of our capital deployment, future regulatory outcomes and the potential for supportive tax policy. To the extent there becomes a need for additional equity, we will evaluate all options and pursue the ones that finance our growth in the most efficient manner and support our earnings growth trajectory.\nBefore we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 14. Our focus on the future sound investment strategy and demonstrated dexterity offer a strong long-term growth proposition. Our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand how important it is to our shareholders, and that's why 2022 will mark the 96th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the dividend, balancing our desire to offer investors a strong 65% to 75% payout ratio with our need to fund our capital plan. 2021 was exceptionally productive and we have a strong momentum as we begin 2022. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

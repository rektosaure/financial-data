The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder that there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through to November [indiscernible]. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJason M. Shore\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. A strong quarter at CMS Energy from an operational, regulatory and financial perspective. I am very pleased with the results and continue to see us well positioned for the full year and in the long term. Our consistent industry-leading performance is rooted in our investment thesis that delivers for customers, coworkers and investors.\nSpeaking of strong performance and consistency, throughout the quarter, we delivered key regulatory outcomes, which highlight the positive and constructive regulatory environment in Michigan. We received the final order in our renewable energy plan that approved an additional 8 gigawatts of solar in 2.8 gigawatts of wind through 2035 and insurers will meet Michigan's clean energy law. A portion of these investments will be woven into our next 5-year plan.\nThis order also provides further certainty and confidence for our long-term customer investments. And as a reminder, this renewable energy plan is a key input into our integrated resource plan that we'll file mid-2026. We also received a constructive order in our gas rate case, approving approximately 75% of the final [ ask ] and 95% of the infrastructure investments for work like domain in vintage service replacements, which are critical to ensuring a safe affordable and cleaner natural gas system. Share scripts comments from that meeting continue to support thoughtful and deliberate adjustments in ROE and suggested we have reached the floor for ROEs and in his words, driven out any excess.\nRecently, on the electric side, staff filed their position in our pending rate case supporting approximately 75% of our revised and approximately 90% of our capital ask. This case includes investments supporting reliability and resiliency, which benefits our customers and are well aligned with our reliability road map and MPSC direction.\nAgain, one of many proof points in our supportive regulatory environment in a strong starting position for a constructive outcome. As shared in previous quarterly calls, we continue to see strong economic growth in Michigan. As I highlighted in the Q2 call, we have an agreement with the data center and continue to see growth with manufacturing as well as a robust pipeline. Year-to-date, we have connected approximately 450 megawatts of the planned 900 megawatts of industrial growth in our 5-year plan. I'm also pleased to share that we've been successful adding another approximately 100 megawatts of signed contracts year-to-date. This growth is coming from new projects, the expansion from existing customers in the areas of food processing, aerospace and defense and advanced manufacturing. These products bring jobs and supply chains, home starts and commercial opportunities to the state and create further visibility to our 2% to 3% forecasted annual sales growth over the next 5 years.\nOn the slide, we're showing our economic growth pipeline. You'll know we continue to move projects into and along the pipeline, bolstering our confidence and additional growth from data centers and other diverse industries. As I mentioned on our Q2 call, we have an agreement with a data center with up to 1 gigawatt of load planning to come to our service territory beginning in early 2030 and ramping up from there. You'll see that project in the final stage of our process at near final terms and conditions. I expect further progress, specifically contract signature as the large load tariff is finalized in November when we expect an order from the MPSC.\nYou'll also see other large data centers in the final and advanced stages of development, which speaks to the robust nature of our pipeline. I continue to be confident and excited about the growth coming to our service territory. The data center and manufacturing pipeline is robust and advancing, and we are well equipped to serve and meet their needs as they advance.\nOn the left side of the next slide, you see our current 5-year $20 billion customer investment plan. On the right side, you see the robust and [ verse ] additional investment opportunities we have going forward. Over $25 billion of additional customer investments supported by our Electric Reliability Roadmap, renewable energy plan and integrated resource plan. As a result of more load growth, we're focused on resource adequacy and the clean energy law which means more renewables, battery storage and natural gas generation to meet growing demand. And as I shared earlier, our recently approved renewable energy plan provides visibility and certainty on our plan for future investments.\nOur integrated resource plan that we'll file in mid-2026, will also detail additional capacity needed to replace retired plants and support existing and future growth we are realizing. As we see that full plan come together, we anticipate needing more battery storage and gas capacity. And as a side note, you can expect further growth from capital-light mechanisms, like financial compensation mechanism on PPAs and our energy waste reduction program.\nOn our distribution system, we see a significant need for investment in pole replacement, undergrounding and system hardening as we work to significantly improve customer reliability and resiliency. And again, well aligned with our reliability road map and MPSC direction. As I shared before, a robust and growing capital plan, which will continue to provide investment opportunities to serve customers and deliver value for investors.\nNow this long runway of customer investments must be balanced with affordability. We have demonstrated our excellence in reducing cost, and we do this better than most through the CE Way, digital and automation, [indiscernible] cost-saving opportunities, low growth and energy waste reduction. This is a significant advantage for us to maintain affordability as we make immediate investments in our system. Today, our customers' utility bill remains roughly 3% of their total expenses or what is often referred to as share of wallet. This is down 150 basis points from a decade ago, while investing significantly in our system to the tune of $20 billion. Our residential bills are solidly below the national average and continue to be over the 5-year plan period as we continue to make thoughtful customer investments across the system.\nAffordability is an area where we will continue to focus and deliver cost savings for customers. keeping customer rates at or below inflation and bills below the national average. I am proud of the work we have done to develop excellence in this area. We have built strong cost management muscle across the company and it continues to benefit customers today and well into the future.\nAs I shared in my opening, a strong quarter. For the first 9 months, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.66, up $0.19 versus the same period in 2024 and largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases and a return to more normal weather. Given our confidence in the year, we're raising the bottom end of this year's guidance range to $3.56 to $3.60 per share from $3.54 to $3.60 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. We are initiating our full year guidance for 2026 at $3.80 to $3.87 per share reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's revised range, and we are well positioned to be toward the high end of that range. It is important to remember we always rebase guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call, compounding our growth. And like we've done in previous years, we'll provide a refresh of our 5-year capital and financial plans on the Q4 call.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, CMS Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 9, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first 9 months of 2025 and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2024, both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis.\nIn summary, for the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $797 million or $2.66 per share, which compares favorably to the first 9 months of 2024, largely due to higher rate relief, net of investment costs and favorable weather-related sales. With respect to the latter, we experienced a warm summer in Michigan, which in part drove the $0.37 per share positive variance on a year-to-date basis. Rate relief, net of investment costs resulted in $0.28 per share, a positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our electric rate order received in March and the residual benefits of last year's gas rate case settlement.\nFrom a cost perspective, you'll notice in the third bar on the left-hand side of the chart, $0.04 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2024. Our year-to-date cost performance was largely driven by increased vegetation management expense due to higher spending levels approved in our March electric rate order and in accordance with our electric reliability road map.\nBefore we leave the cost bucket, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that given our strong financial performance to date, we put several operational pull-aheads in motion across the business over the course of the quarter. These discretionary measures provided additional funding for gas system projects, electric reliability and programs catered to our most vulnerable customers. A portion of these costs were incurred during the quarter, while the balance will flow through our forecasted year ago operating expenses delivering incremental value for customers while derisking our financial plan and the prior year to the benefit of investors.\nRounding out the first 9 months of the year, you'll note that $0.42 per share of negative variance highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary drivers of the negative variance were related to the planned outage of our Dearborn Industrial Generation or DIG facility early in the year, and the timing of select renewable projects at North Star, which I'll note remain on track, coupled with higher parent financing costs. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.15 per share of positive variance for the remaining 3 months of the year, given the roll-off of mild temperatures experienced in the last 3 months of 2024.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.03 per share of positive variance, driven in large part by the constructive outcome achieved in our gas rate order in September, which will go into effect on November 1. On the cost side, we anticipate $0.06 per share of negative variance for the remaining 3 months of 2025 due to our ongoing vegetation management efforts as well as the aforementioned supplemental spending on operational and customer initiatives at the utility. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year and the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note an estimated range of $0.05 to $0.09 per share of negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year, partially offset by nonutility performance fueled by achievement of key economic milestones on select renewable projects, among other items.\nAs Garrick highlighted, we are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives for the year and are establishing a solid foundation for 2026 through prudent contingency deployment as we head into the final 2 months of the year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet on Slide 10. I'll note our recently reaffirmed credit ratings at the utility from S&P in September, and we anticipate a reaffirmation of the parent's credit ratings in the coming weeks. From a financial planning perspective, we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings as per long-standing guidance from the rating agencies. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which, coupled with a supportive rate construct and predictable cash flow generation minimizes our funding costs to the benefit of our customers and investors.\nSlide 11 offers an update to our funding needs in 2025 at the utility and at the parent. I am pleased to report that we have completed virtually all of our planned financings for 2025 the latest tranche of which was our settlement of approximately $500 million of forward equity contracts at share price levels favorable to our plan. Given the attractive market conditions, we'll continue to evaluate potential pull-ahead opportunities for some of our 2026 financing needs the parent. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been striving through year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Rejji. At CMS Energy, we deliver a strong first 9 months of the year and well positioned for the full year. Our strong pipeline of new and expanding low bolsters our confidence in our growth and provides us with opportunity to invest in infrastructure across both our gas and electric businesses to serve customers with safe, affordable, reliable and clean energy. It is an exciting time in this industry and CMS Energy is well positioned.\nWith that, Alex, please open the lines for Q&A.",

Our investment thesis is robust and solid, continuing our track record of industry-leading results. You know this, and you have seen the results it delivers. As I've said before, Michigan is open for business. Today, I'm pleased to announce we have reached an agreement with a new data center, which is expected to add up to 1 GW of load. This load is incremental to our plan and part of the 9 GW pipeline that we have been working to locate in our service area. We expect this load, early ramp, to start to show up in the latter portion of the five-year plan. We continue to see positive momentum with data centers within the 9 GW pipeline, and expect additional progress once we finalize the data center tariff. In addition to load growth from data centers, Michigan is on the move.\nGrand Rapids, the heart of our electric service territory, was recently ranked the number one city on the rise in the US by LinkedIn, highlighting their diverse industries from tech, insurance, manufacturing, and healthcare. This area is growing nicely, bringing jobs and people to the state. CNBC ranked Michigan as the top 10 best state for doing business, and we are seeing it. As I shared in Q1, we continue to see strong housing starts, alterations, as well as upgrades and relocations, all signs of positive growth among residential and commercial customers. All of this drives our long-term annual sales growth estimates of 2%-3%. Remember, this is before this new data center is fully online. We're excited about and committed to Michigan's future prosperity, and we are prepared and ready to serve its growing energy needs.\nOn this next slide, I want to connect a few dots, which highlight the investment opportunities we see above and beyond our five-year plan. Specifically, I want to share some early insight into our upcoming Integrated Resource Plan filing. Let me start here. A long runway of customer investments is great, but isn't sustainable if your customers cannot afford them. I like starting with customer affordability. What we know to be true is that growing demand, like I shared on the previous slide, enables longer-term cost savings for our customers. As our load grows, we can expect, or we can spread, fixed costs over a larger customer base. A win for all. Add to it our ability to realize savings through the CE Way, episodic cost-saving opportunities, and our energy waste reduction program. We have multiple ways to keep bills affordable for our customers.\nIt is our strong focus on these cost-saving opportunities that keep bills affordable, both gas and electric, and allow us to make needed customer investments. There are many customer investment opportunities, greater than $25 billion, above and beyond our five-year plan. We've talked previously about the investments needed in our electric grid, which drive resiliency and reliability for our customers through our electric reliability roadmap. In addition, we have important investments clearly articulated in our Renewable Energy Plan, or REP, to meet Michigan's Clean Energy Law. Today, I want to highlight our Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which we'll file in mid-2026. We are still preparing for this filing, but getting a clearer picture on what will be required for the future. As I mentioned, we are building renewables required by the law and included in the REP, which provides energy but limited capacity.\nOur IRP will primarily address capacity. When we model the 2%-3% sales growth that we are realizing, the need to replace plants, existing capacity that will retire over the next five to seven years, and the need to replace a large PPA that will expire in 2030, the model points to additional storage and gas capacity. We anticipate needing to build more storage than the amount required by the 2023 Energy Law. We currently see this as a mix of owned and PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism. Of course, we'll take advantage of supportive tax credits for storage. We also anticipate new gas capacity at multiple locations, and we are well into the planning and preparations to realize this need. Our first cut looks like an additional $5 billion of opportunity outside the five-year plan.\nUnderstand that this is an early number and could be higher. We'll continue to keep you updated as the preparation continues prior to the filing of this important IRP. As I've shared before, CMS has a long history of working effectively with all administrations, and I continue to be proud of our agility as the federal environment continues to evolve. Let's start with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and how it impacts the utility. As we understand the provisions today, our renewable projects within the five-year financial plan are well positioned to meet timelines and requirements to receive full production and investment tax credits, as well as transferability through 2029. These de-risk $4.5 billion of capital, the renewable portion of the five-year plan, at the utility. It also ensures full transferability of the tax credits, which Rejji will summarize in a moment.\nThis puts us well on track for the 2030 renewable requirement in Michigan's Energy Law in a way that maintains affordability for our customers. Recall that to the degree we see affordability concerns post-2029, we have options within the law to mitigate costs, including out-of-state PPAs where capacity factors may be higher, or an extension to the compliance period. At a minimum, we're seeing cost savings on self-build projects through good lean engineering, the CE Way, to further take costs out for our customers. Now, let me address NorthStar. Again, this business makes up approximately 5% of the earnings mix, so it is small, with the majority of the growth at Dearborn Industrial Generation, or DIG, with energy and capacity sales. The renewables portion of the business is very small, where we typically complete one to two solar projects a year with utility-like returns or better.\nAt NorthStar, our renewable projects are safe harbor through 2027, with some options in 2028. Many of these projects are already contracted with off-takers, materials secured, and a solid plan to execute, including strong contractual language. As we move forward, we'll continue to evaluate the need for capital across the business, as we always do. We'll be mindful of the return on those investments. In light of the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill and subsequent executive order, we're using a sharp pencil in the five-year planning process, which is well underway. This includes growing value at DIG, and recontracting both energy and capacity as both markets continue to be strong, and the ability and willingness to shift capital to utility investments that benefit our customers.\nShifting to the Federal Power Act 90-day emergency order, in May, we were ordered by the Department of Energy, or DOE, to continue to operate our J.H. Campbell coal facility. We are complying with that order and dispatching into MISO. We are also currently reviewing our maintenance and investment plans for the facility should we see a push for longer-term use. Keep in mind, the DOE's order provides for cost recovery. We have filed a request with FERC for recovery from all MISO North and Central customers who are served and benefit from this supply resource. We expect a positive outcome from this proceeding that will be good for all stakeholders. Finally, our minimal exposure to the auto industry, diverse supply chain, and continued focus on moving to US-based suppliers further limits potential tariff impacts.\nRecall, much of the exposure is related to capital equipment, which means any impact would be spread over the life of the asset, with minimal impact to earnings and customer rates. To date, we've only experienced about $250,000 in increases. Again, I appreciate the team's efforts on multiple fronts to continue to position CMS Energy for success in what is a dynamic federal environment. I want to take a moment to highlight Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. Last month, the commission approved the first-ever storm deferral at the utility, a new precedent for Michigan. It speaks to our performance during the March and April ice storms, and the constructive nature of this commission. Well, this isn't a unique aspect in the utility sector. It was noted as a best practice by Liberty Consulting in the third-party distribution audit, and was approved by the commission in a timely fashion.\nThis is a great step to strengthen an already strong regulatory environment in the state. We continue to be supportive of the Liberty audit of our distribution system. It was commissioned by the MPSC, and the results point directly to the important investments needed to improve reliability for our customers, and bolsters the game plan we laid out in our reliability roadmap. We will continue to weave the audit findings into future rate cases. Now, jumping to the rate cases, on the electric side, our current rate case filing is larger than what you've seen from us in the past at a $460 million revenue increase, and is well aligned to significantly improve reliability for our customers through additional capital investments and O&M, including vegetation management.\nTo frame this case from an affordability perspective, if we were to achieve 100% of the rate case asked, our residential electric bills will continue to be below the national average. In our gas case, we saw a very constructive recommendation from the staff supporting approximately 80% of our revised ask and about 95% of our capital. While we're always open to settlement, we're confident in the investments we need to make, the quality of our case, and comfortable going the distance to a fully adjudicated order. For our longer-term filings, we expect an order in our Renewable Energy Plan, or REP, by mid-September. Our REP will further define our renewable investments and feeds into our Integrated Resource Plan that we'll file in mid-2026.\nWe are making important investments for our customers in the future of our growing state, and we continue to see constructive outcomes time and time again. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to welcome our new commissioner, Shaquila Myers, who was appointed earlier this month by the governor. Commissioner Myers has an impressive background. She was a member of the governor's senior leadership team and previously led Speaker of the House, Joe Tate's office, as his chief of staff. She understands the importance of economic development to bring good-paying jobs to Michigan, and played an instrumental role in the development of the 2023 Energy Law. We look forward to working with Commissioner Myers, and the rest of the commission and staff, as we have in the past, to reach constructive regulatory outcomes. Now, on to the financials for the quarter.\nWe are in a strong position heading into the second half of the year. For the first half, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.73, well ahead of our budget and where we had planned to be according to our full-year guidance. The team has delivered strong performance, particularly in Q2, on all fronts: regulatory, operations, and financial. Therefore, we remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook, and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full-year guidance remains at $3.54-$3.60 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6%-8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone.\nOn slide nine, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first six months of 2025 and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2024, both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the first half of 2025, we delivered Adjusted Net Income of $518 million, or $1.73 per share, which compares favorably to the same period in 2024, largely due to the absence of unfavorable weather from the prior year, and continued constructive regulatory outcomes. To elaborate on the top-line impact of weather, favorable weather in the second quarter, largely in the month of June, coupled with a relatively normal winter in Q1, provided an aggregate benefit of $0.32 per share of positive variance.\nIt's worth noting that the weather outlook in our service territory remains quite good for the balance of the summer. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, resulted in $0.09 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our electric rate order earlier in the year, and our gas rate case settlement in the second half of 2024. Moving on to cost trends, you'll notice in the third bar on the left-hand side of the chart, $0.04 per share of negative variance versus a comparable period in 2024, due in large part to increased vegetation management in accordance with our electric reliability roadmap.\nWhat's less visible in that bar on the chart, but still quite meaningful, is the favorable impact of the aforementioned service restoration expense deferral granted by the commission in June, which enabled us to establish a regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the substantial costs incurred during the March-April storm. This timely and supportive action by the commission is not only a testament to the historic nature of the storm and our strong restoration efforts, but it's also worth repeating the constructive nature of the Michigan regulatory environment. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note a negative variance of $0.27 per share, highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart.\nThe primary drivers of the negative variance were related to the planned outage of our Dearborn Industrial Generation facility, which I'm pleased to report is fully operational and expected to deliver normalized earnings for the remainder of the year. In addition, we anticipate back-end-weighted tax benefits from select renewable projects at NorthStar. Other notable drivers in this category include the impact of current financing activities thus far in 2025, and slightly lower electric and gas non-weather sales volumes. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.11 per share of positive variance for the remainder of the year, given the absence of the mild temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, we're seeing $0.18 per share of positive variance, which is largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year, and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower O&M expense at the utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, which we're estimating at $0.01 per share of positive variance. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side of the chart, you'll note an estimated range of $0.14-$0.20 per share of negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select one-time countermeasures from 2024, and the usual conservative assumptions around weather normalized sales and current financings, among other items.\nGiven our strong year-to-date performance, particularly in the second quarter, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year financial objectives to the benefit of all stakeholders. Moving on to credit quality, it is worth noting that Moody's reaffirmed our credit ratings in May, as noted at the bottom of the table on slide 10, and we are currently working through the review process with S&P. Longer term, we will continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and will manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. Slide 11 offers an update to our funding needs in 2025 at the utility and at the parent. With two quarters under our belt in 2025, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the vast majority of our financing plan for the year.\nAs you'd expect, we're busy evaluating alternatives for our remaining funding needs at the parent. To that end, it's worth noting that we have executed 40 equity contracts of approximately $350 million, thus de-risking roughly 70% of our planned equity needs for the year. Lastly, we continue to see strong appetite in the bilateral market for tax credit transfers and are on track to complete our planned monetizations for the year. Longer term, we'll continue to utilize this funding vehicle as a source of liquidity while available. To that end, as Garrick noted, based on the expected in-service dates of our renewable project pipeline, as well as the construction status on projects in the outer years of our plan, we are well positioned to execute on approximately $700 million of tax credit transfers in our five-year plan.\nAs I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors. This year is no different. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Rejji. We've had a great quarter, and we are well positioned to deliver on the full year. What I'm even more excited about is how this team continues to deliver great outcomes for our customers and investors.\nThe data center agreement is a big win and reflects progress in our growth, as well as the opportunity to invest in new renewable and thermal resources. It is an exciting time in this industry, and CMS Energy is well positioned. With that, Seb, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by number one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order that you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star followed by number two on your touch-tone telephone.\nWe'll pause for just a second while we register the questions. Our first question is from Julian DuMoulin-Smith at Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien DuMoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you very much, and nice progress again. Good morning to you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Julian. Hey, guys. Good morning. I'm looking forward to the next video, Julian. I was going to say, I'm looking forward to the next video, Julian.\n\nJulien DuMoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYes, indeed. You better believe it. We got to wear another rally cap. With that said, speaking of rally, how about this gigawatt that you announced this morning? I just would love to get a little bit more details here. I mean, how do you think about the ramp and the load? You said it's towards the end of your outlook. Can you elaborate a little bit more specifically?\nCan you elaborate a little bit more about how this fits into your resource mix? I know that this is somewhat dynamic itself, but can you elaborate at least preliminarily on how you're thinking about it? When you say it's ramping up in the back half of the plan, when do you get to that gigawatt? I mean, is it just a few hundred megawatts towards the back half of the plan? Just give us a little bit more if you can, and I appreciate it.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, we're excited about the opportunity here. The team's done a nice job of converting part of this 9 GW pipeline. We have agreement in place, and the counterparty has put a significant amount of money or capital into this agreement. That is really to secure materials and equipment and be able to do final design work.\nAgain, nice progress from that perspective. From a ramp perspective, those conversations continue with the counterparty. Specifically, it's in 2029 or 2030, and we're also looking at that ramp rate, right? That's kind of the framing. We'll see early ramp, early megawatts show up in that 2029 or 2030 timeframe. How fast is still being determined in the discussions with the counterparty. That gives you a little flavor of that. You talked about the resource mix. Just to give you a little context about how we're thinking about this, I love the fact that that ramp is in that 2029, 2030 into the next decade. That gives us a ton of flexibility from a resource perspective. Remember, I'm a little long from a capacity perspective. It's a good starting point.\nI'm still building capacity today, even though I'm long on building capacity, because I have a renewable energy law. I'm building renewables. Now, those have limited capacity, but I'm also building storage. That's already underway. We're doing that as well, as well as a few PPAs on storage with an FCM. Hopefully you heard in my comments this willingness and preparations to build out gas capacity. What I talked about was specifically the 2%-3% load growth. This would be incremental to plan, but hopefully there's some flexibility to build out gas. I would just say we're well into preparation phases for gas capacity buildout. That's kind of the mix of the supply resources that will serve this customer.\n\nJulien DuMoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome.\nIf I can just follow up quickly here, that 9 GW number on the pipeline side, how are you seeing that evolve here? I mean, I think it's flat quarter to quarter. I suppose that's in this modern day and age. I'm curious on how you're seeing it evolve. Specifically, to the extent that you were to see any of it materialize, would it be kind of tail end of the period or beyond at this point, just given what you're seeing on ramp rates for other customer contracts?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThat 9 GW pipeline continues to fill, is what I put it. It's conservative. If you look at some of our other public documents, you would see a larger pipeline. We feel confident in the nine, and I've talked about that being a gradient.\nThere are some customers within that pipeline where we continue to exchange terms and conditions and red lines. One of the next stage gates specifically is this data center tariff. I would expect that additional customers could convert once we have that data center tariff in place. We continue to see good progress with that pipeline. I'll also make a note. We haven't talked much—we've been talking a lot about data centers. There's a good manufacturing base in there as well. There are over 200 customers, 200 customers that are non-data centers that are a part of that overall large growth potential. Again, things in Michigan look strong and look good for the future.\n\nJulien DuMoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome, guys. See you soon, all right?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYep. Thanks, Julian. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Nicholas Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey. Morning, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Nick.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for the time.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey. I just wanted to—I wanted to pick up where you left off there and just be a little bit more clear on how the 1 GW of new data center customer interacts with the $5 billion of CapEx upside in the IRP. Is it just—is there a tipping point where if you do another 1 GW, then you'd go back and revise that $5 billion number? Where is the point in which you'd look at a higher than 2%-3% long-term sales outlook, if that makes sense?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Let me broaden your question a bit as well. When I think we'll, of course, do another capital update in the Q4 call, there are several things that I see about that. We'll update the grid numbers.\nThe reliability, resiliency piece, and the economic development projects will fall into that, so you'll see that grow. We'll have the REP. It'll be approved by that time, and you'll see the renewables, and that'll be a big piece of that five-year plan as well. Here's the thing about that renewables piece that I want to point out is that what we're seeing with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is that there are more developers that are pulling projects forward. That gives us an opportunity to do transfer arrangements. It allows us to do maybe some PPAs and some with a financial compensation mechanism. That might grow a little bit, particularly in the near term for the utility. There are going to be some dollars for this IRP. Now, we've got to balance that, right?\nWe're going to file an IRP in 2026. It takes 10 months to get a rate case approval. That puts it in 2027. We're going to have to run some things in parallel in that because to be able to build out the capacity we need for the future, we're going to have to move in that direction. You'll see some of that sprinkled into the plan going forward. Now, to get to your question, that $5 billion plus is really what we need to deliver today with the 2%-3% sales growth, with realizing the retirement of some plants, replacement of a large PPA. This gigawatt is\nincremental, so we'd have to adjust that number up. Again, let us play that out in the Q4 call as well as in other filings, and you'll see that get woven into future capital plans.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nExcellent. Excellent. Okay. That's very clear. How do you feel about the gas case at this point and the ability to potentially settle that? I know that we've been looking at a little bit more kind of litigated full-distance outcomes on the electric side. We wanted to just take your temperature on the gas. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe're in a great spot right now. When I say great spot, 80% of the revised ask, 95% of our capital's improved. That's a great case from a quality perspective. It's the right investments to make in the state. We continue to be open to settlement. August, we should have a PFD on it. Hear me out here. We're in a good spot, and so I'm comfortable going to a fully adjudicated order.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat.\nIf I could squeeze one more in, just really appreciate the financing update, Rejji. Seems like you're executing 2025 as planned. How are you kind of thinking about 2026 and whether there's an opportunity to kind of de-risk the equity in 2026? Is that something that you'd be open to?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks. Yeah, I appreciate the question, Nick. The quick answer is that as we look at the second half funding needs we have for 2025, we will also take into account funding needs we have in the front half of 2026. If there are opportunities to pull ahead some of those financing needs in an efficient transaction this year, we may look to do that. We're keeping all options on the table, as you'd expect. The funding environment remains quite good. Again, we're going to keep as much flexibility as possible. Okay.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I'll hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Seb. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road. Take care, and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's CMS Energy Q2 2025 call. Thank you all very much for joining.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, please press star followed by zero. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00PM Eastern Time, running through 1 May. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJason Shore\n\nTreasurer and VP of Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy: consistent, predictable, dependable. Twenty-two years of steady hands at the wheel. It's what you expect, and it's what we deliver. Even more important in these times of broader economic uncertainty, it starts with our investment thesis, which is based on conservative planning paired with disciplined execution, a commitment to excellence across our electric and gas businesses, constructive legislation and regulation, and driving growth across the state with a robust economic development pipeline. Our customers can count on us to deliver safe, reliable, affordable, clean, and equitable energy under all conditions, and our investment thesis is what keeps us on track. It's our focus. It's what you count on us for every year.\nIn fact, I'd like to take a moment to shine a spotlight on our recent storm response, which included company crews, dispatchers, call centers, coworkers, contractors, and volunteers who were committed to delivering excellence for our customers during the recent historic storms that impacted Michigan in late March and early April. These storms packed it all in: 14 tornadoes, nearly 100 mile-per-hour winds, and in northern locations, over 1.5 inches of ice. The team executed well. We were prepared and ready to dispatch prior to the first wave of weather with 500 crews pre-staged and 900 total crews dispatched. Fighting storms on two fronts, we restored customers safely and quickly, then continued to serve, supporting local co-op utility customers in their restoration efforts. We saw favorable customer and positive policymaker support because of our response. Yes, our investments and process changes are making a difference.\nI'm extremely proud and thankful for our coworkers and how they showed up in the work they do daily to improve performance for our customers. I want to start today with Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. We are pleased with the recent electric rate order in March, approximately 65% of the revised ask, nearly double the investments included in the investment recovery mechanism, and solid support for our investments to improve electric reliability for our customers. We work hard to ensure our filings are transparent and high quality, and we are seeing the results, achieving constructive regulatory outcomes time and time again. We'll continue to work closely with MPSC staff, interveners, and the Commission on the importance of our investments to bolster our electric and gas systems to ensure we continue to serve customers during sunny days and extreme weather.\nGiven our continued focus on improving electric reliability, you can expect us to file our next electric rate case in Q2. In our gas rate case, we did recently see staff testimony, which we view as a constructive starting position. As we've shown in the past, we're always open to settlement, having settled our last four gas cases. The dynamics of these gas cases are different than our electric cases, and we feel good either way: a settlement or fully adjudicated order. For our longer-term filings, we expect an order in our Renewable Energy Plan, or REP, by mid-September. Our REP will help define our clean energy future, and feeds into our Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, that we'll file next year. Earlier in my prepared remarks, I referenced broader economic uncertainty.\nAs you would expect, we are closely monitoring the landscape, potential changes, shaping as needed, and preparing to adjust as necessary. Our conservative planning, strong fundamentals, as well as our track record of delivering through any event, gives me confidence that we are well-positioned to effectively navigate any scenario. This confidence is further bolstered by our diversified service territory, with minimal exposure to the auto industry or any other large sectors. We're actively monitoring the landscape and have a diverse supply chain, which limits our exposure to tariffs. Our direct and indirect spend is approximately 90% domestically sourced, and we continue to shift US-based vendors to lower our exposure. Much of the exposure is related to capital equipment, which means any customer impact would be spread over the life of the asset, and our earnings are largely insulated.\nNonetheless, we're actively working with all suppliers to manage fluctuations in price and sourcing to keep customer bills affordable as we execute on our plan. In the context of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we've seen good support from Republicans in our individual conversations, including the 25 who have signed on in support of continuing tax credits. Our read is that there may be a partial repeal of portions of the IRA, and although we do not expect changes to the renewable tax credits, we continue to safe harbor equipment for projects within our five-year plan. As a reminder, we have a supportive energy law in Michigan that mandates renewables and 100% clean energy resources by 2040. The law shapes our customer investments through our REP and IRP.\nTo the degree there are changes in the IRA, Michigan's law offers us enough flexibility to achieve the intent of the law and ensure resource adequacy and affordability for our customers. As for industry exposure, I'll remind you the auto industry is about 2% of our total gross margin. The heart of our electric service territory is in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, which is diversified with commercial businesses, manufacturing, and includes significant jobs and state investment. We're also seeing expansion in other industries, including defense, aerospace, polysilicon, semiconductors, and agriculture. At CMS Energy, our core business is to serve under all conditions. Our mindset of preparedness and conservative planning ensures we are ready for multiple scenarios, calm in the storm, and steady at the wheel.\nI want to talk for a moment about Michigan's exciting growth renaissance and our work to help our service territory in the state thrive and prosper. First and foremost, we see strong progress in the continued construction and work that make up the 2% to 3 load growth within our five-year financial plan. We have seen one large data center project accelerate their load ramp-up by almost a year, and another large new manufacturing project has requested to expand service by an additional 10%. All positive indicators. Both we can deliver. Since the beginning of the year, with the elimination of the sales and use taxes for data centers, our pipeline has grown to 9 GW, with more of that shift, about 65%, toward data centers. We're seeing the data center pipeline continue to progress and feel confident some of these projects will materialize into contractual agreements.\nThe data center tariff, which we filed in February with the Commission, is the next logical step in that process. The tariff provides a great opportunity for data centers and protects our existing customers. We'll continue to work through this proceeding, with settlement being a possible outcome. As I've shared before, we are also excited about the manufacturing growth in our pipeline that brings with it secondary and tertiary benefits, including new and growing commercial business, as well as residential load. We're excited about and committed to Michigan's future, and we are prepared to serve its growing energy needs. Now on to the financials for the quarter. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.02. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook, and are reaffirming all our financial objectives.\nOur full-year guidance remains at $3.54 to $3.60 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On slide 8, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the quarter and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2024, both on a first quarter and nine months-to-go basis. In summary, through the first quarter of 2025, we delivered adjusted net income of $304 million, or $1.02 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2024, largely due to the absence of the mild weather experienced in Q1 2024, coupled with higher rate relief, net of investments.\nThese sources of positive variance were partially offset by higher O&M costs at the utility, driven by the continued execution of our electric reliability roadmap and the timing of select items at NorthStar, like our planned outage at the Dearborn Industrial Generation Facility or DIG, among other factors. To elaborate on the impact of weather, we experienced a relatively normal winter in Michigan in the first quarter for the first time in a couple of years. As such, we saw $0.26 per share of favorable variance, which largely reflects the absence of the mild weather experienced in the first quarter of 2024. Rate relief net of investment-related expenses resulted in $0.07 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in last year's electric and gas rate orders, in addition to the benefits of ongoing renewable projects.\nMoving on to cost trends, as noted, in accordance with our electric reliability roadmap, we continue to increase the size of our vegetation management program as we glide path to a seven-year trim cycle across our low-voltage electric distribution system. The associated financial impact was the key driver of the $0.05 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2024. In our catch-all category, represented by the final bucket in the actual section of the chart, you'll note a negative variance of $0.23 per share, largely driven by a strong 2024 comp at NorthStar due to normalized operations at DIG and the timing of tax benefits from renewable projects. Other notable drivers in this category include the impact of parent financing activities in the quarter, and select one-time reversals from last year.\nLooking ahead, we plan for normal weather as always, which equates to $0.12 per share of positive variance for the remaining nine months of the year, primarily due to the absence of the mild temperatures experienced in the fourth quarter of 2024. From a regulatory perspective, we're assuming $0.16 per share of positive variance, which is largely driven by the constructive electric rate order received from the Commission in March, ongoing benefits of renewable projects at the utility, and the assumption of a supportive outcome in our pending gas rate case. On the cost side, we anticipate higher overall O&M expense at the utility for the remainder of the year, largely driven by the expectation of increased service restoration costs attributable to the large weather system that impacted our service territory in late March, extending into early April that Garrick mentioned.\nIt's worth noting that this storm was the costliest in our company's history at roughly $100 million of operating and maintenance, or O&M, expense, per our preliminary estimates. As you would expect, we're already busy at work identifying and implementing countermeasures such as limiting hiring, reducing our use of consultants and contractors, and eliminating other discretionary spending, among other potential offsets. Of course, we expect increased productivity from the CE Way, which our workforce has delivered every year since we instituted the lean operating system roughly a decade ago. It is also worth noting that we have sought a deferred accounting order for the financial impacts of the storm, given its historic nature, which we filed earlier this week.\nThe recalibration of our service restoration expense for the remainder of the year, net of anticipated savings from the aforementioned countermeasures, will drive an estimated net impact of $0.04 per share of negative variance for the remaining nine months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll see an estimated range of $0.03 to 0.09 per share of negative variance, which incorporates further risk mitigation to the financial headwinds encountered in the first quarter, and provides additional contingency should we need it, namely in the form of opportunistic financing activities. Before moving on, I'll just note that our track record of delivering on our financial objectives over the last two decades, irrespective of the circumstances, speaks for itself.\nThat said, we'll always do the worrying so you don't have to, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial and operational objectives this year to the benefit of all stakeholders. Moving on to credit quality, it is worth noting that Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings in March, as noted at the bottom of the table on slide 9, and we are currently working through the review process with Moody's. Longer term, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and will manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. Slide 10 offers an update to our funding needs in 2025 at the utility and the parent.\nDuring the quarter, we issued $1 billion of junior subordinated notes or hybrids with a 6.5% coupon at the parent, which I'll note was identical to rates achieved by some of our much larger peers, and had the tightest credit spread achieved for a hybrid in recent memory, which speaks to our credit quality and a strong receptivity to our paper in the market. As you'll note in the table on the left-hand side of the page, the hybrid issuance addressed a good portion of our financing needs at the parent for the year, while offering significant financial flexibility on our remaining needs. We'll look to complete the balance of our financing plan at the parent and utility over the remaining months of the year, with a keen focus on maintaining our consolidated credit metrics around the mid-teens area from a funds from operation to total debt perspective.\nAs always, we'll remain opportunistic and look to capitalize on market conditions. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Rejji. As the landscape continues to evolve, I want to remind everyone about our long history of delivering under all scenarios for all our stakeholders. Remember, our business is preparedness and response. Through uncertainty, recession, bad weather, it doesn't matter. We've seen it before, and we've navigated the waters. Bottom line, we deliver. Our track record speaks for itself. We focus on what is necessary to deliver for our customers and investors, and we remain confident in our outlook for 2025 and beyond. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks very much, Garrick. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit 1 on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you've seen us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit 2 on your touch-tone telephone. We'll pause for just a second. Our first question will be from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey. Hey. Hey. Good morning, Garrick. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate all the commentary around tariffs and IRA. One question was focusing on NorthStar. Maybe just can you remind us what percentage of capital—I appreciate it's small versus the rest of the company—what percentage of capital is going towards solar storage? Just given the IRA discussion and repeal risk, do you kind of reprioritize that capital, potentially maybe switch that with higher regulated capital? Your comments around safe harboring, do those apply to NorthStar as well as you try to kind of secure those tax credits into the future? Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks for your question, Durgesh. Great question. Again, context is really important here in the context of NorthStar. We're talking about 5% of the EPS mix here, so small. Remember, the big driver here is DIG, or Dearborn Industrial Generation. That's the big story in the energy and capacity markets. When it comes down to the amount of capital that we're spending on renewables, it's small. Rejji will have the numbers here in a bit, but there's nothing on storage, zero on storage. It's all really renewables, and those are, again, projects that are well laid out for the future. Now, how do we de-risk those projects? One, we have contracts in place that allow for escalators. That's an important piece. We've done a lot of great work in terms of securing panels.\nI've got panels secured through 2030 through a variety of vendors, through contracts, some already on site to be able to navigate any implications from a tariff perspective. I'm out in 2028 from a safe harbor provision in the main power transformers. We feel good about the runway there of projects, renewable projects, and what we've done to de-risk that. As you know, and your question alluded to, there's tons of flexibility. We have plenty of opportunities to invest in the utility itself. Those are decisions we make on a year-by-year basis on where the needs are for the company and are best suited. Again, feel good about NorthStar's ability to deliver, not just in the year, but also from a long-term perspective.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Durgesh, I'll just build on Garrick's comments there. Yeah, we certainly feel good about NorthStar's prospects going forward, and have done a lot to de-risk renewable projects on both the utility side and the NorthStar side, and have done some things in supply chain that further fortify our position going forward. From a capital perspective, we're planning, and this is in our 10-K that we filed last quarter, about gross investments, a little over $2.5 billion. I say gross because we have planned to recycle capital, largely at NorthStar through the sell-down of common equity stakes. That is providing a lot of liquidity to fund their projects. The equity infusions from the parent are relatively light, probably about 20% of that or so, or half a billion. Gross capital investments of about $2.5 billion to support commercial renewable projects over the next five years.\nThe reality is, if we do see some repeal of the IRA, we will just increase the bar or raise the expected hurdle rate for those renewable projects at NorthStar. If we saw the economics of those projects being less attractive, we would certainly allocate more capital to the utility. As you know, capital is not an issue at the utility. There's plenty of opportunity. Our current five-year plan, a $20 billion capital investment at the utility, has another $20 billion or so on the outside looking in. I think that that's the low end of capital investment opportunities outside of the plan. There is a lot of flexibility to allocate capital to the utility versus NorthStar, again, if we see the economics of those projects start to soften over time. Really good flexibility going forward, and no concerns with the economic outlook there.\nIs that helpful?\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nVery helpful. A lot of flexibility there, it sounds like. Thank you for that, Color. Just quickly, Rejji, the deferred accounting order on the storm costs, have you guys done that before? Sorry, I should know, but I don't. Maybe just remind us if you have done that before. If not, what are sort of the procedural steps here? Is there a timeline that the Commission is going to sort of rule this on by, or is this just a one-off type event and there's no set procedural schedule here? Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMaybe I'll just take your question and do a little bigger picture on it, and then we can go down in this process from a storm perspective. As Rejji talked about in his prepared remarks, there is a number of levers and opportunities, everything from the CE Way to technology to what Rejji shared in his prepared remarks on how to deliver the year, and for both the customers, and really investors, and really all stakeholders. That's the tools in the toolbox. What we're doing with this particular storm, what I would say is historic storm and really extreme weather, as I characterized in my remarks, is leveraging the Liberty audit. If you go into the Liberty audit, that's the distribution audit, it specifically calls out best practices with jurisdictions and utilities is to have a mechanism for extreme weather.\nThat's what we filed, and that's going to be the first time we filed that with the Commission in this kind of framework. We've had constructive conversations both with staff and the commissioners on this. Again, an ex parte filing, the timeline has not been established at this point. Durgesh, I'm going to go a little off the record here. I'm an old farmer. I grew up on a farm, and I don't count my chickens before they hatch. That's a true thing from a farmer perspective. Understand this, we're not counting on that. It's important. We think it's needed in Michigan. Again, constructive conversations, but we have a lot of tools in our toolbelt to be able to deliver the year.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Durgesh, all I would add, and I wish I had a farming analogy as well, but I do not, is just a couple of things to Garrick's good comments. You asked, I think, specifically about the timing of approval. Because it's an ex parte filing, I think that will be at the Commission's discretion. Obviously, our expectations are tempered, but we would love to see just a fairly quick resolution to the matter, so we at least know what the outcome is in a timely fashion. In terms of our history around this, we have sought mechanisms like this in the context of rate cases. I can't recall the last time we sought an accounting order like this outside of a rate case, maybe once in the past in my eight years as CFO.\nThis is fairly atypical, but we think given the historic nature of the storm, it's justified, and I believe we've made a strong case in the filing as to why we should get support here. I just wanted to address those two direct questions you had.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nAwesome. Thank you. Appreciate the off-the-record and on-the-record commentary. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today will be from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Partners)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Shar.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Partners)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nActually, Constantine here for Shar.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nOh. Great.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Partners)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nActually, Constantine. Hey, good morning. How are you thinking about the execution on the financing plan, just given that optically the balance of the equity needs is resolved through the hybrid? Is there kind of more execution to come in 2025, or is there some efficient financing that unlocks a CapEx pull forward or any other opportunity in the near term?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Constantine, this is Rejji. Appreciate the question. Per my prepared remarks, we still have a bit of financing left in the plan for the year. At the parent, just going back to our original guidance, we said we had about $1.8 billion to do. A billion three of what I'll just say non-equity financing, and our working assumption was senior debt assumption, senior debt financings, and then up to $500 million of equity. Obviously, the hybrid transaction that you noted really took care of a good portion of those needs. With the equity credit ascribed to hybrids, that creates a lot of financial flexibility. We still have about $700 million or so left for the remainder of the year. We're keeping all options on the table.\nWe've seen really attractive execution across a variety of securities offered in the first quarter from some of our peers. We're keeping all options on the table, but have quite a bit of flexibility. At the opco, just to round it out, we've got $1.1 billion left, and I think the working assumption for those financings will be first mortgage bonds. As always, we'll look at which securities are priced most attractively at both the parent and the opco, and we'll be opportunistic as we always are. With respect to pull aheads for capital, we've got $3.7 billion in the utility per our plan this year. We're focused on executing on that. We'll see what the rest of the year has in store for us.\nWe're acutely focused on the current plan for this year and really haven't thought about pull aheads in any respect, if that was the spirit of the second part of your question.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Partners)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYep. Understood. Maybe a higher-level question in terms of your energy supply needs. How are those evolving, especially as you get feedback through the RED process? Is there more dispatchable generation needs that you see kind of going into the next IRP cycle? Do you think that there's a better case for kind of a big buy-in into the opco?\nA portion of our energy supply needs are spelled out in the Renewable Energy Plan, and that addresses some of the energy needs and the compliance with the 2023 energy law. As we've seen the need to get to the 50% and 60% renewable targets, as well as because of the 2% to 3% load growth that is in our five-year plan, you can see and have insight into those both renewable needs, as well as storage needs in the future. The broader need for capacity and to be able to continue to deliver to the load growth and the pipeline within the state will come together in the Integrated Resource Plan. We'll file that in 2026.\nIt will evaluate and look at natural gas plants, the existing natural gas plants we have in the state, the longevity of those plants, considerations for carbon capture and sequestration technology. That modeling work is still underway, as you might imagine, for our 2026 filing, and will be also based on the Renewable Energy Plan. That's really all I can share at this point. As you imagine, as you're growing the state and you have this pipeline, there will be additional needs in the future for supply assets.\nOkay. Understood. Maybe you're hitting quickly on Durgesh's question around storms again. As you're kind of noting the impacts on the offsets in the quarter, do you anticipate those to be recurring, or would those potentially unwind with that potential deferral filing?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I would say, Constantine, similar to prior years when we saw significant financial headwinds, we'll look at all opportunities that cost. Cross-structure. I'd say it's premature to think about what's recurring and what isn't. What I have been encouraged to see, really, per my prepared remarks over the last 10 years, is every year we establish a target for how much productivity and cost savings, whether that's hard cost savings or avoided costs associated with the CE Way. Every year we exceed that target pretty significantly. By definition, the savings generated by the CE Way are recurring savings. I'll give an example. Last year, we had in our target, we had a target for the CE Way of around $50 million or so. We delivered $110 million of savings, and those are obviously recurring.\nI would say we've exceeded expectations year in and year out on what we expect to achieve from a productivity perspective. We'll also look at one-timers. I mentioned we'll look at sort of financing activity. We may start to take a look at liability management as we had in the past. We'll also look at other potential cost deferrals, which would not be recurring. It'll be a good mix of all of the above, like we've done in prior years.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIf I can just take a moment to elaborate on this toolbox of opportunities, and Rejji characterized it well, it starts with conservative planning, right? That is part of our mindset, part of our approach. We're not redlining the engineer. This is just how we think about different scenarios. That's point one. Rejji emphasized the CE Way. There's so much opportunity in the CE Way that our coworkers deliver on. You take and improve a process, you take waste out, coworkers feel better, customers feel better, and you cost file. The other one that we've been really highlighting too is in the space of technology. The IT team calls it app realization.\nI make fun of them when they talk about it because I'm like, what the hell is that? The reality is it's looking at all our software, all our hardware, and how we are leveraging to get additional benefit out of it, where there's real savings there as well. You apply AI in some places, and we get better predictions, and that takes cost out as well. There were all the things that Rejji mentioned in his prepared remarks. I feel confident in just the ability to leverage these, and a portion of them, a good portion, will be sustaining. As Rejji indicated, some will be one-time.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Partners)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nExcellent. Appreciate you taking the questions.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Constantine.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today will be, apologies, the next question today will be from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHi. Good morning, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nI just wanted to pick up with the gas case. Good, how are you? Just wanted to pick up with the gas case. Given what's come out so far, the appetite for settlement or just any other thoughts at this point? I know you said you'd be happy going either way, but just wondering any incremental color you could provide.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI'm going to even pull it back a little bit and just put these words. I am very pleased with our track record of delivering constructive outcomes in Michigan. There are all kinds of data points: electric, four-gas settlements. It doesn't matter—electric or gas—we just continue to deliver time and time again. In the Q4 call, what I shared was full-throated, a constructive—we'd see a constructive electric order. How did I know that? One, because of the quality and the visibility we put in this case, the constructive legislation we have. It's not perfect, as I shared, but we continue to work on improving that. If you look at the staff, the MPSC staff are professionals. When you have a good staff position or a constructive staff position, you get good outcomes. That's what we did.\nThat's another data point with this electric rate case. I'm excited about this gas case as well. It is down the fairway or straightforward. We're replacing gas pipe, making the system safer. That's important from a gas business perspective. We're ensuring capacity to deliver to customers and growth in the gas business. When you do all that right, you also reduce carbon emissions. It's a trifecta, right? It's a great case the team has built. Straightforward. I'm excited about staff's position. It is a constructive starting position within the gas case. We'll go through the process, go through rebuttal as we always do. ROEs, we're going to push on those. If I look at the external environment, risk has not declined, right? We'll push on the ROEs in rebuttal. That'll be an important piece for us to lean into.\nAs I said always, I'm open to settlement. There's a variety of different points of view and different intervenors on that. We'll work through that process. If we see that, I would imagine it would be before the PFD, which is expected in the August timeframe. Here's my confidence in our ability to go the full distance too and just continue the track record of constructive outcomes in Michigan.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. No, that makes sense. Just wanted to pivot to a smaller point, if I could, the deferral. That's baked into the guide right now. Just wanted to be clear on the treatment there.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nJeremy, this is Rejji. We have not presupposed approval of the deferred accounting order. Like I said, I think we've made a very compelling case given the historic nature of the storm and our efforts to restore customers as quickly as possible, both inside our service territory and out. We think we've made a compelling case. As you know, given our conservative nature, we have not presupposed approval of that.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. Just a last one, if I could. As it relates to ITCs and the unregulated part of the business, what's the magnitude of earnings exposure in your plan here? Really, if you could just outline a bit more how tax equity impacts this, and any other relevant considerations, and how potential tariff risk at the project level could influence growth here. I know you touched on it a bit before, but just wondering if you could flesh out those points a bit.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Jeremy, I'll take this as well. This is Rejji. I would say in the context of 2025 guides, in our original guidance, we guided NorthStar at $0.18 to 0.22 given the planned large outage at DIG, which historically and really going forward is the flagship earnings contributor to NorthStar. We are anticipating more contribution from commercial renewables projects. We have two solar projects that are well on their way of delivering constructive outcomes later this year. I would say the exposure from a renewables perspective this year is a little bigger than other years or prior years. Of that $0.18 to 0.22, assume about three quarters of that is delivered by residual benefits from ongoing assets, a little bit of NorthStar, but primarily from two solar projects we have underway.\nAs we look at the outer years of the plan, still anticipation of solid renewable project development over the course of the plan. Again, you should always assume that DIG will be the primary contributor of earnings to NorthStar over the course of the next five years. Let me pause there and see if there are any questions on that.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nNope, that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today will be from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHi, Nick.\n\nOperator\n\nNicholas Campanella from Barclays. Your line is now open if you'd like to proceed with your question. Apologies, we're not receiving audio from Nicholas's line there. We're moving on to the next question being from the line of Julien Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, team. Good morning and pleasure here. I hope I get as candid a response from Garrick as earlier here. I think we're developing a new pattern. Just on economic development, I'd just love to understand how you guys are thinking about them. I heard the comments on the call with respect to data center activity and ongoing development year-to-date subsequent to the legislation. In parallel, I'll also note the Goshen developments from the county board here. How are you thinking about what's included in the 900MW of demand in the current plan? Are there puts and takes in that, or is it still kind of static pending some more formal updates here? Just to understand how you think about both the positives and the negatives that are accumulated year-to-date.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. That 2% to 3 that makes up that 900MW, that's a conservative approach. You know that about how we plan. There is an economic development. There's always that. Even in the best of times, there's some slowdowns in some projects and some speed-up in some projects. What's great about that 2% to 3 is we have line of sight into that work. We're constructing the lines, we're constructing the substation, and in many cases, we can see them building their facilities and the long-term plans they have for that. That's exciting. That gives us confidence in that 2% to 3 load growth, and there's always a little puts and takes.\nAs I shared, one of the data centers that we're constructing right now is actually accelerating their load growth and their ramp-up, which is a positive sign. It's the same with the large manufacturing. To the degree there's a pause with Goshen, there's also some acceleration with some as well. That's all kind of in that mix to the 2% to 3. Now, if we go to the 9GW, as I shared in my prepared remarks, let me offer a little more clarity. There's a lineup of data centers there of 65%. Some of them are moving faster and jumping the line, moving to the front of the line in the progress. That gives us a lot of confidence that those will materialize.\nThe next logical step in that process is get this tariff complete with the commission. Again, I'm optimistic that settlement's an option there to be able to move those forward, and for those data centers to take the next logical step. Does that help?\n\nJulien Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. No, absolutely. Thank you for that. Actually, just to clarify that last piece since you bring it up, just with the tariff here, you alluded to potential settlement, certainly a possibility in other states as well. Could that be paired up with a more formal commercial arrangement? To the extent that you get the clarity on the tariff, would that be sort of the catalyst to announce any larger commitments here?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nCertainly, the data center projects and possibilities want to have clarity on that in the context of that. It's just from a special arrangement perspective, special contract. We don't do those. That creates a lot of long-term risk, particularly for the company and for shareholders. This tariff really is the best option. As you might imagine, when they have clarity on what that looks like, that'll be the next logical step in moving some of those projects forward.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome, guys. You guys take care. All the best. Thank you so much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, thank you, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today will be from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nJust. Hi. Hey, guys. Just wanted to ask quick on how you're thinking about the risk of transferability potentially going away. I think you've given us some numbers on what you embed there in your plan, just what that scenario would look like if you were to lose the ability to transfer tax credits.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nLet me offer some high-level comments, and Rejji, you'll get into some specific numbers. Many of the Republican jurisdictions, areas have benefited from the IRA. What I think is even more important is the conversation that I'm having, part of the team's having, EEI's having with a number of Republican congressmen and women. That is one support for these PTCs and ITCs, as well as the tax monetization or transferability component of it, because they see in these times the importance of affordability and how that transfers directly to savings for our customers. That's been an important part of the conversation. That's what gives us—we'll see how legislation takes place and how it all evolves, but that gives us some certainty, I guess, optimism about the ability to maintain PTCs and ITCs and this transferability going forward.\nRejji, to offer some additional comments on the dollars.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Michael, appreciate the question. Just to talk about potential offsets or countermeasures, as I still see it, in the unlikely event we saw transferability go away, we would look at a variety of financing sources. I think the good news in this environment and in prior environments is that the capital markets remain broad and deep. We would certainly look at more junior subordinated notes as a potential option. Clearly, there's quite a bit of capacity in the market there. Based on even our recent issuance of $1 billion that I noted in my prepared remarks, we still have, in this year alone, $2 to 3 billion of additional junior subordinated note capacity. That amount of capacity accretes over time as your book capitalization grows through retained earnings.\nA lot of opportunities to potentially look at more junior subordinated notes. Obviously, we could look at doing additional equity as well. We feel very comfortable with the equity levels that we're issuing over the course of this five-year plan, and still think we have capacity to do additional equity to fund this attractive growth opportunity we have at the utility. Incremental equity would also be a potential offset. It is also important to note just the significant flexibility afforded to us through the energy law and the ability to earn on PPAs as we look to comply with the energy law and the significant renewable opportunities associated therewith. That creates a lot of balance sheet flexibility as well. As we look at subsequent five-year plans, we may transfer or shift—transfer is probably not the right word there. It's a pun not intended.\nWe could look to potentially shift our spend mix from instead of investing and owning some of those renewable opportunities, we could potentially contract and earn about a 9% FCM on those, which obviously, again, creates a lot of balance sheet capacity. Those are all potential countermeasures in the event transferability went away.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nVery helpful. Just to double-check, the $700 million-plus number from the year-end call in terms of what's in the plan is still good?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThat's still the current plan, yes.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nAlex Lerman\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, this is Alex Lerman for Dave. Good morning. Starting with the storm tracker, could you talk about the strategy going forward to get it approved? Is there any specific changes you plan to make to address the pushbacks?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIn reference, just for clarity for those who might be listening to the call, in a number of the previous electric rate cases, we've proposed a storm tracker or storm recovery mechanism in those. We've heeded some of the comments from both staff, as well as the commissioners, on sharing and greater sharing of those mechanisms. Unfortunately, we have not had success in that mechanism. We continue to look at options to be able to offset some of the costs. Again, I'd go back to the liberty audit, which again recommends best practices for jurisdictions and utilities, and ultimately for the customer, is to have a mechanism in place for extreme weather. The storm recovery mechanism or tracker is one way to go about it.\nAnother way that we're obviously filing for here and filed for this week is just through this deferred accounting mechanism for, again, regulatory treatment of historic or extreme weather.\n\nAlex Lerman\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you. Back to the data centers demand in Michigan, did you see a big change in interest after the state approved the tax exemptions late last year?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThat is correct. Of our pipeline, it was primarily about 65% manufacturing prior to the signing of the sales and use tax. That flipped. The actual pipeline grew to 9GW, and a majority of it, specifically about 65% of it, is data centers as a result. We attribute that to, in part, the sales and use tax exemption. Also, there are other RTOs that have had some challenges. MISO continues to be an RTO, and frankly, we have a nice energy law that supports the ability to put on the supply that's needed and necessary for these important projects.\n\nAlex Lerman\n\nVP, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Very clear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOn the electric rate case, wonder if there were any lessons learned or aside from the headline numbers, anything in the case decision that you'd like to go back for or you hoped to get. Anything like that? You mentioned the storm tracker, but anything aside from that?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy",
    "content2": "There's always room for improvement in our cases. I want to be real clear. We've had a successful track record, but we're not perfect. There are a lot of opportunities for us to improve. We get the feedback from the staff, we get the feedback from the commissioners, and there's important work to do. One of the important pieces, that are comments that was made by the commissioners when they provide the order, was the mix of capital and O&M. Recall that in that case, the liberty audit or the distribution audit kind of came midway through. We had capital in there, and the recommendations on tree trimming and vegetation management were not in there. You can imagine that in this next case, we'll have a greater degree or greater amount of vegetation management.\nWe'll also match that with the important capital investments because it's both. You have to deliver the reliability and long-term resiliency. I would expect to see filing our reliability roadmap, more capital investments, but also a much larger investment, too, in vegetation management to improve our reliability for our customers. That's an area of improvement. There was also from the bench a small thing in just following where the dollars went. We got more granular in some of our bucketing, so we could see the benefits of that work. There was some feedback that you couldn't tick and tie as easily, so we're going to improve that as well and just make a key.\nI'm in the weeds now, but just a key to be able to make that clear for interveners as well as the staff and commissioners to file. Those are ways we're always looking to improve the process.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Travis, all I would add, this is Rejji. Aside from a 10.25% ROE, which was on my personal wish list, the other subtlety or a smaller element of the filing that we did seek and unfortunately did not get support for, but over time, I do think it would be helpful, is we did propose a wildfire risk mitigation plan. Though Michigan is not as susceptible as a lot of states to the west of us to wildfire, we do think you cannot plan soon enough for wildfire risk mitigation. We had $12 million of capital ascribed to it, $4 million of which was for strategic undergrounding. Covered conductors was another bit of the spend, and then what I would call strategic vegetation management.\nWe do think over time, we'd like to start to put in place a program because, again, I don't think you can plan too soon for that. That was the other item on the wish list that we'd like to get support for going forward.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay, that's great. I think we all have 10.25 on the wish list. The REP, when you get that September ruling, what's kind of the next step? Would there be any immediate, I guess, disclosures from you or changes potentially in the capital plan? Is that something that's going to evolve as you do perhaps RFPs or some other type of solicitations along the way? Anything that's going to happen, say, in September or October after the decision?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, it certainly gives us more clarity on the clean energy and a portion of the investments that are in the five-year plan. There could be additional investments in that. That, again, flows into the integrated resource plan. You'll see that approval is important to build out the integrated resource plan. Those are the couple of components that you will see. Of course, we'll have greater clarity and certainty around what those renewable energy supply assets are.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGreat. That's all I had. Thanks a lot.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Travis.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from the line of Greg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGregg Orrill\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Hey, good morning. I wasn't quite sure I understood what the $0.04 impact in the balance of the year related to the storm accounting order was. Sorry if I missed that.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I'm not sure, Greg, this is Rejji, where you got the $0.04 impact, just to walk through the details of the estimated. I say estimated because we're still doing all of the closing out of contracts and invoices from third parties who helped us. As you'll see in the regulatory filing we submitted yesterday, the estimates for the storm was about $100 million, so call that $0.25 per share of impact. As you think about the waterfall I walked through for the bridge of financial performance over the course of the year, we are assuming a good portion of that storm impact will flow through that cost bucket, or what we're calling specifically reliability storms, including productivity.\nThe 4 cents of negative variance that you see in year-to-go, when you add that to the 5 cents of negative variance we saw in our year-to-date actuals, what you see is basically a 12-cent per share swing versus our original guidance. That basically adds up to about $50 million pre-tax. We've baked into the assumption of additional service restoration expense, productivity in the form of CE Way, the CE Way, and all the other cost-out items I enumerated in my prepared remarks. We're assuming that we're going to have an increase for sure in service restoration expense, but we will also net those down with cost reductions. We've also assumed cost performance as well in that parent financing tax and other bucket.\nIf you look at the comparison of what we have in our current waterfall versus our original guide, you'll see about $0.11 per share, or $45 million, roughly pre-tax, of improvement versus the original guide. That's where you see the balance of cost takeout, or support to fund the impact of that service restoration expense increase. That's what gets us to our full-year guidance. It's flowing through the cost associated with the service restoration expense. It's flowing through that reliability storms, including productivity line item. Again, the countermeasures are flowing through both of those sort of latter two buckets in the waterfall. Let me pause there and see if you have any further questions, Gregg.\n\nGregg Orrill\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nNo, that's great. I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will be from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Good luck settling the gas rate case. If you make a five-timers club like Saturday Night Live, I think you get one of those cool black velvet jackets.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, I look forward to wearing that jacket. That's good.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nJust want to clarify. I think you kind of just answered this on the last question. To clarify, are you already in cost-cutting mode after that storm, or are you just reminding us of your proven ability to do that?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nNo, Andrew. We got in the foxhole very early in the first quarter. I'd say once we started to get visibility that a significant storm was underway. Also, even earlier in the month, we started to see pretty mild temperatures in the month of March. We already started to get in the foxhole and start identifying and implementing countermeasures really in the early part of March. They were already well underway. This is beyond hypothetical and academic. We're in implementation mode. Still more work to be done, but we are already in implementation mode based on the visibility we got earlier in the month and then as the storm started to materialize. Let me pause there.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nI guess my question is, should this deferral be approved, which of course would be a good situation, what would you do then? If you're already cutting costs and then you get the good news of getting this approved, what happens?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. It certainly creates additional flexibility in the plan, which we like. I'll remind you that the CE Way will be one of the anchor countermeasures that we'll lean into. We see no downside in overachieving on our CE Way targets year in and year out because it just creates additional headroom going forward, and rate reduction opportunities for customers going forward. There's no reason to dial back those efforts. We may take a harder look at some of the planned cost deferrals and some of the other measures, like I said, where we would limit hiring and some of those other flex-related items that are more one-timers. It just gives us more flexibility to potentially turn back on those spigots in the event we get success there.\nIf we see opportunity to execute on recurring savings opportunities, we would obviously carry on with those. Does that make sense, Andrew?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nYeah, it does. Given the weather challenges, it's been a while since you were in invest mode as opposed to lean mode. That would be a good situation.\nOkay. My other question is.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, one can only dream.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nI think I asked, yeah, kind of like the 10.25.\nMy other question, I think I asked you this after a storm a few years ago. What grade would you give yourselves in terms of reliability from this storm? I know obviously it's been a focus, and the Liberty audit came out last year, but how would you evaluate the performance after the storm?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMuch, much, much better. I would point to customers and policymakers, real positive sentiment with both. We're not seeing what we saw in 2023, which was just a lot of aftermath after the storm. We've improved greatly through process, through investments, and we've got a lot of positive feedback. I don't want to be too boastful, so I'm still kind of going to grade myself hard. Let's say like a B-plus. I still think there's room for improvement, but it's a lot different fact pattern than we had back in 2023.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nVery good, thank you so much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSophie Karp\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHi. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe I can just ask you a high-level question on the economy in Michigan. I guess with the unemployment rate, which was a little elevated for the state, what are you seeing from your customers, if anything, in terms of what are they saying about the activity? Are they adjusting to the new kind of reality with the tariffs and everything else? Any color would be helpful.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI still see a lot of positive indicators in Michigan. Part of it I talked about in response to a question in my prepared remarks, particularly in the 2% to 3% load growth. The fact that data centers are accelerating, the fact that manufacturing customers are still moving forward with projects, we can see that construction, and then in some cases asking to expand, or at least in one case, asking to expand, are promising indicators. If I go right down to today, right, and remember when we follow the margin and it's in the residential, commercial space, we still see solid performance there. If you look into, and we do this, we look into permits and housing starts. If you look at that Grand Rapids metropolitan area, permits, housing starts for single-family continue to increase. For multi-family, commercial, continue to increase.\nThose are positive indicators. The other one I look at is relocations, is what we call it, or alterations. Those are customer-requested work for changes at their home or their business. Maybe they need a larger meter to be able to serve their load. Maybe they need the meters moved because they're putting an addition on their home or their business. That, of course, went up in the pandemic as people went home and invested in their homes. That is still elevated. That's still above pre-pandemic levels, which is another good indicator about people investing in businesses and in their homes, particularly in the residential and commercial space. That gives us a lot of confidence that the sales piece of resi and commercial continue to be, and where the margin is, continue to be solid.\nThe other thing I'll point out is there's always pluses and minuses when you get in the industrial space. I talked about that a little bit with Julien in the Goshen piece. When I look at our mix and how diversified Michigan is, and we surprise people with this number sometimes, there are 4,000 businesses in Michigan in the aerospace and defense industry. 4,000, including now Saab in our service territory. In this federal administration, you can make a strong bet that defense spending is going to increase, so that's a real positive for Michigan. The other one I'd like to point to is that we're the second most diverse state from an agriculture perspective. What we've seen over the last 10 to 15 years is more of that processing of foods move closer to the fields, move closer to the farm.\nAs a result, there's a lot more processing and manufacturing of food, and that's growing in this environment. Even in the worst scenarios, even in the worst scenario of a recession, people still need food, bread, milk, and those dairy products. A long-winded way of saying we still see a lot of positive indicators in our service territory, which gives us a lot of confidence of Michigan and a forward look.\n\nSophie Karp\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nThank you. That's all for me. Appreciate the call.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our Q&A. I'd now like to hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Harry. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming AGA Financial Forum. Take care, and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation."

The earnings news release issued earlier today, and the presentation used in this webcast, are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, please press the star key followed by zero. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00PM Eastern Time, running through 13 February 2024. This presentation is also being\nwebcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJason Shore\n\nTreasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call\nover to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In the words of James Brown, I feel good. CMS Energy, 22 years of consistent, industry-leading financial performance every year for over two decades. You can count on us to deliver. We do that through our simple but powerful investment thesis, coupled with disciplined execution across our electric and gas businesses. We take our legacy of service and excellence seriously at CMS Energy. We play to win every day. We have a lot to celebrate about 2024, and today I will highlight a few key successes, among many, to demonstrate how we deliver for all of our stakeholders year in and year out. First, our\nwork to improve customer reliability.\nOur five-year reliability roadmap, which we filed in 2023, set bold commitments to improve service to our customers, to never have more than 100,000 customers disrupted per event, and have service restored within 24 hours. We are making progress. In 2024, we restored power to over 93% of customers within 24 hours, compared with 87% in 2023, and the average customer experienced 21 fewer power outage minutes. Although there is still more work to do, it is clear the investments are making a meaningful difference. I'm also pleased with the work on the electric supply side. In November, we filed our 20-year renewable energy plan. This critical long-term filing highlights the\nthoughtful changes we will make to our generation portfolio as we transform our system for more renewables, and a diversified mix that includes nine gigawatts of solar and four gigawatts of wind over the next two decades.\nThis filing details to the Commission our commitment to leading the clean energy transformation and achieving the targets established in Michigan's 2023 energy law. Most importantly, it demonstrates our commitment to diversify the energy portfolio, and invest in supply infrastructure to serve our customers with reliable, clean energy in the most affordable manner. Of course, our gas business continues to grow. I'm extremely proud of our coworkers' efforts to build and replace infrastructure that ensures a safe, reliable, and clean natural gas system. The system has proven invaluable to customers throughout the year, and even more recently in the extreme cold experienced in\nJanuary.\nI could give many more examples, and some are listed on this slide, which speak to the winning program at CMS Energy and are further proof points of our investment thesis in action, ensuring you can count on us to deliver value for all stakeholders every year. On slide five, we've highlighted our five-year $20 billion utility customer investment plan, up $3 billion from our prior plan, a significant and needed increase designed to deliver better customer service through improved reliability, both in distribution and supply. Driven largely by our reliability roadmap as we bolster our electric distribution system, and by investments in our supply portfolio as we expand our renewable\npipeline to meet the energy law, this plan supports 8.5% rate-based growth through 2029. In addition to the robust customer investment plan, we have growth drivers outside traditional rate base.\nThese are important and sometimes overlooked, so let me spend a moment here. The financial compensation mechanism, which allows us to earn on PPAs, grows during the five-year period, offering approximately $20 million of incentives by the end of the decade, and continues to grow thereafter as we secure additional PPAs. There's more than $60 million per year of incentives through our energy efficiency programs, enhanced by the energy law. We also expect incremental earnings from our non-utility business, NorthStar Clean Energy, as we continue to see attractive pricing from capacity and energy sold at Dearborn Industrial Generation, or DIG. I want to take a moment\nto highlight the long runway of customer investments, which are incremental to our five-year plan and give us confidence in our financial performance and continued growth of our company.\nSlide six shows the detailed filings we expect over the next 10 years and beyond, which will be incorporated into future five-year updates. On the slide, you can see key investments in the electric distribution system to improve reliability for our customers through rebuilds, undergrounding, hardening, and technology. $10 billion of opportunity not in the five-year plan. In the middle of the slide, the renewable energy plan, an ambitious and thoughtful plan to achieve 60% renewables by 2035 as required by the energy law, and in response to significant load growth in our service area, providing for additional wind and solar resources. $10 billion of opportunity not in the five-year plan.\nFinally, the 2026 Integrated Resource Plan filing, which will shore up the intermittency of renewables, build out battery storage, and deploy clean energy required under the energy law.\nThe modeling for this filing is underway and will provide additional customer investment opportunities. Altogether, well over $20 billion that is not in the five-year plan. Now, let's talk about our formula to keep rates affordable for our customers to accommodate these needed investments. You know our track record. You've heard me share in the past about our deliberate and sharp focus on taking cost out, whether it is episodic cost savings through plant closures or renegotiating PPAs, operating our plants better than the market, leveraging the CE Way for process improvement, the use of digital technologies to improve efficiency, or strong economic development. I'm confident\nin our ability to keep bills affordable while delivering on the needed customer investments, ensuring every dollar is maximized and adds value. Speaking of economic development, I've said it before, Michigan is in a renaissance of growth.\nOur five-year plan now incorporates the significant economic development we are seeing with upwards of 2% to 3% annual load growth. We feel really good about the quality of growth we see materializing across our service area and the state, both data centers and manufacturing load. While we see a nice mix coming to the state, the manufacturing growth brings with it jobs, supply chains, commercial activity, housing starts, and residential growth, which allows us to couple customer investments with affordability as we spread fixed costs over a larger customer base. We are committed to growing Michigan, and we are pleased with what we've contracted and the now nine-\ngigawatt pipeline of opportunities not yet in the plan. We work hard every day to win our customers' business, and we are honored when businesses see the value in investing in our state and our service area.\nJumping to Michigan's regulatory environment, we continue to see a strong and supportive energy policy that ensures timely recovery of investments and incentives above and beyond stated ROEs, as well as constructive regulatory planning mechanisms like renewable energy plans, integrated resource plans, and investment recovery mechanisms that streamline the rate case process. In 2024, we delivered successful outcomes in our electric rate case, settled our fourth consecutive gas rate case, and saw support for our distribution investments through the Liberty audit. For 2025, we expect a constructive outcome in our electric rate case with an order by the end of\nMarch. Our gas rate case is in the early innings, but we expect good support for the needed investments to keep our system safe.\nAs I shared earlier, our renewable energy plan with an expected outcome in late Q3 2025 is something to look forward to, given the large amount of renewables needed to meet the energy law and the growing demand we're seeing across our service area. Now, on to the financials. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.34 toward the high end of our guidance range. For 2025, as you might expect, we are raising our 2025 guidance off 2024 actuals from $3.52 to 3.58 to 3.54 to 3.60, which represents 6% to 8% growth, and we continue to guide toward the high end. We also continue our long-standing tradition of compounding off actuals, providing our investors with a\nhigher quality of earnings.\nLonger term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We continue to target a dividend payout ratio of about 60% over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2024 with adjusted net income of $998 million, which translates to $3.34 per share and toward the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our 2024 financial performance included constructive regulatory outcomes, a solid beat at NorthStar, cost performance fueled by the CE Way, and a variety of non-operational countermeasures, which more than offset the many challenges we saw throughout the year.\nFor the second year in a row, we experienced significant weather-related financial headwinds, primarily in the form of mild winter temperatures in the first and fourth quarters. In fact, per our records in 2024, we had the warmest winter in the last 25 years based on heating degree days. Yet, despite these challenges, we managed to offset the weather-driven headwinds without compromising our commitments to our customers, communities, or coworkers. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2024, on slide 11, you'll note that we met or exceeded all of our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive, I'll just note that we successfully invested $3.3\nbillion, as per our original guidance, to make our electric and gas system safer, more reliable, and cleaner on behalf of our three million customers at the utility.\nWe managed to do this while funding the business in a cost-efficient manner, largely through operating cash flow, well-priced bonds at the utility, and tax credit transfers in the inaugural year of this new financing vehicle. This funding strategy enabled us to maintain our solid investment-grade credit metrics and associated ratings as affirmed by each of the rating agencies over the course of the year, most recently by S&P in December. Moving to our 2025 EPS guidance, on slide 12, you'll note the rebasing of our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance off of actuals. For additional clarity, our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance increased by $0.02 per share on the low and high ends of the\nrange, commensurate with the amount by which our 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.34 exceeded the midpoint of last year's EPS guidance range.\nOur increased 2025 EPS guidance implies 6% to 8% growth, with continued confidence toward the high end of the range, as Garrick noted. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility, providing $4.01 to 4.05 of adjusted earnings as we plan for normal weather, constructive rate case outcomes, and earned returns at or near authorized levels. At NorthStar, we're assuming an EPS contribution of $0.18 to 0.22, which incorporates a planned maintenance outage at DIG, offset by ongoing contributions from NorthStar's clean energy business. Lastly, our financing assumptions remain conservative at the parent segment, with the expectation of\napproximately $1.3 billion of new Holdco long-term debt and up to $500 million of equity to support the increased capital plan at the utility. Our 2025 guidance also assumes the absence of liability management transactions.\nTo elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range, you'll see the usual waterfall chart on slide 13. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are measured on a full-year basis and are relative to 2024. From left to right, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.39 per share of positive variance, given the expected absence of the atypically mild winter temperatures experienced in 2024. Additionally, we anticipate $0.21 of EPS pickup attributable to rate relief by the residual benefits of last year's successful gas rate case settlement, and the expectation of constructive outcomes in our pending electric and gas\nrate cases. Outside of the general rate cases, we also expect to see earnings contributions from our renewable investments as construction of these projects progress.\nAs always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes, and utility interest expense. As we turn to the cost structure in 2025, you'll note $0.03 per share of positive variance due to the anticipation of continued productivity driven by the CE Way. We also expect a healthy reduction in operating expenses attributable to the closure of our remaining coal units mid-year, which will be largely offset by increases to vegetation management, and other electric reliability-related cost categories, all of which align with our pending electric rate case. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance,\nwhich largely consists of the reversal of select countermeasures in 2024, and expected capital costs associated with the aforementioned parent financings. We're also including the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and taxes, among other items.\nIn aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.37 to 0.43 per share of negative variance. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. On slide 14, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. As Garrick noted, from a dividend policy perspective, we're targeting a payout ratio of about 60%, and anticipate remaining in that area over the course of our five-year plan. Given the elevated cost of capital environment, and the breadth and depth of customer investment opportunities before us, we continue to believe that it is prudent to retain\nmore earnings to fund growth. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and will continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business.\nAs such, we intend to resume our at-the-market or ATM Equity Issuance Program in the amount of up to $500 million in 2025, as mentioned earlier. We expect this level of equity issuance to trend down in the outer years of our plan, as we increase the size of our tax credit transfer program, given the substantial renewable build-out underway in accordance with Michigan's energy law. Lastly, we also expect select large multi-year economic development projects to begin coming online in 2025, yielding approximately 1% weather-normalized load growth for the year, with run rate assumptions of 2% to 3% in the outer years of our plan, as other large projects come online. Slide 15\nprovides a look into the historical performance and estimated growth of NorthStar's DIG facility, with upside potential beyond 2026 as capacity prices in Zone 7 continue to increase.\nGiven the rising cost of new entry, we have updated the potential range of outcomes accordingly, as you can see in the bars on the far right-hand side of the chart. We remain bullish on the opportunities in the bilateral market for DIG, and will continue our strategy of layering in contracts over time. Slide 16 offers more specificity on the funding needs in 2025 at the utility and the parent. The only additional financings I've mentioned for the year are the planned debt issuances at the utility, which we anticipate being a little over $1.1 billion. It is also worth noting that we have not assumed the issuance of any junior subordinated notes, also known as hybrids, in our 2025 financing plan or in our\nfive-year plan, which offers a potential opportunity if we see attractive price points in the market.\nNeedless to say, we'll remain opportunistic throughout the year. On slide 17, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable, and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse and battle-tested workforce remains committed to our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent, industry-leading financial performance. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Rejji. I'll finish where I started and with James Brown.\nI feel good, but I can't hold a tune, so instead, I'll finish like this: 22 years, 22 proof points of consistent industry-leading financial performance, providing you with predictability, and strong growth, compounding off actuals, which very few do in our sector, providing you with a higher quality of earnings. We had a great 2024, and we remain confident in our strong outlook for 2025 and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone.\nIf you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone. We'll now pause for just a second. Our first question today will be from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHey, good morning, team. Nicely done. Thanks again for the time. Appreciate it. Hey. Good morning, Julian. Let me kick it off here. Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Look, let me just kick it off on something a little bit more timely here.\nJust with respect to the permitting, you guys have a lot going on the renewable front. I'd love to hear your thoughts about the ability to execute in this environment. You guys specifically have wind in your outlook. I'm just curious to get your thoughts here, given some of the backdrop here on the ability to execute, and especially given the permitting regime has been something of a conversation in recent times in your geography. I'll pivot back to some of the financials.\nWell, the team is doing some amazing work from a pipeline perspective, both on wind and solar. I'll just give you some context of that before I jump into kind of the administration, kind of federal administration piece. We just finished up a wind project in late last year, which was very successful.\nWe got two large solar projects underway, a Muskegon solar project, 250MW. We just announced this last week, another 360MW we're building in southwest Michigan. This team's got a long pipeline. This whole permitting thing, here's the secret to it, and it's not much of a secret. It's being on the ground, right? It's working with the locals, the local townships, and local communities to get acceptance for the projects and the tax dollars that come with those projects. It's working with landowners. That's been our success. When it comes to specifically wind in this administration, that's particularly aimed at federal lands. We're not doing anything offshore, and we're not doing\nanything on federal lands. It's all private. That's where our point of success is. We do see an opportunity for future wind projects. In many cases, it's in repowering.\nIt's expansion within existing parks, and there's a couple of new projects that are underway and under consideration. I feel good about our ability to build out these renewables. Remember always that this renewable energy plan, it's an iteration. If I got to make an adjustment in a year, we'll do that. That's what gives me a lot of confidence about our future and ability to continue to deliver on this important customer investment agenda.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. Excellent. Thank you for that. I know that a lot of folks are kind of curious to understand exactly how that gets implemented, if you will. Pivoting back to the financials, I mean, obviously, very nicely done here. Thank you for the updates on the load-growth front. I mean, can you speak a little bit to what the legislation does and especially could do prospectively?\nYou kind of alluded to it in broader terms. Can you speak a little bit more specifically in terms of what the contribution is in the 2% to 3% and what the big moving factors could be, especially subsequent to this legislation, which was fairly recent, right, in terms of what's reflected in that 2% to 3%?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYou're talking about state legislation, just to clarify your question, Julien?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Apologies. Yeah. I'm thinking about the sort of the data center avenue and to what extent is that reflected in that 2% to 3%. Again, is it just a little bit too nascent given how recently some of this stuff materialized?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI want to be really clear about our sales growth. This is an exciting piece because it's evident in our renewable energy plan that we filed in November.\nIt's part of our five-year plan that we're talking about today. This 2% to 3% load growth is not a pipeline. It's not hypotheticals. This is stuff that's contracted. We have a high confidence that we're building substations to support. Some of this load starts to come on in 2025 and then continues out throughout 2029 in this five-year plan. There's a high degree of confidence about this 2% to 3%. That's the important piece. If you look forward, there's a nine gigawatt pipeline. Several quarters ago, I talked about that pipeline. It was smaller. It's grown, and it's shifted a little bit to more data centers. It's about 65% data centers now. The rest is manufacturing. That's in part due to this\nlegislation passing, the sales and use tax. That passed at the end of the year.\nThe governor just signed it mid-January. We're starting to see a nice uplift there. You hear, like you've heard, Microsoft acquiring land. We're working with other hyperscalers as well. You've also heard about a semiconductor project in Genesee County. There's a lot of energy here, no pun intended, a lot of excitement about the sales growth here, both what we've secured and that pipeline. I'm excited about Michigan.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Julian, all I would add to Garrick's comments is when you think about the 2% to 3%, just to give you additional specificity, we've got multiple projects embedded in that, I'd say six or seven larger ones, and it's well-diversified. Data centers are represented in that mix. Again, there's a lot of non-data center activity, as we've talked about for some time, just given the attractiveness of Michigan.\nRemember, it's not just competitive rates. We've also got, obviously, good fiber network. We've got really good access to freshwater, which is attractive for a lot of these manufacturing businesses because they do include water in their processes. We've got a lot of energy-ready sites because we've been doing the hard work for many years now, not just over the past couple of years. We are well-prepared to welcome these opportunities into Michigan. The opportunities embedded in that 2% to 3% in our five-year plan are either signed or imminently signed. Again, there's not a whole lot of beta around those opportunities. The one thing I would circle back to on your question about the\npermitting is that, as Garrick noted, all of the projects that we're executing on are on private lands.\nAs I understand it, the private lands are also to some extent in the crosshairs a bit, but I think that that's also centered on wetlands associated with private property. None of our projects are situated in wetlands that could be subject to federal regulation. Again, to Garrick's comments, we feel very good about our fact pattern with respect to permitting and the associated build-out of renewables over time.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAll right. Excellent, guys. I'll leave it there. See you guys soon. All right. All the best.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nTake care, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from the line of Jeremy Tennett with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tennett\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nOperator\n\nJust wanted to dive in a little bit, if I could, with regards to, I guess, how you feel about the regulatory environment in Michigan.\nThere's been some concern in the marketplace with recent orders, and figured it would be good just to hear from you guys how you think about things these days.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nJeremy, you like sausage? I mean, I love breakfast sausage. I got to tell you this. I got to tell you this. A breakfast burrito, an egg scramble, I love seasoned sausage. The reality is I don't like how sausage is made. No one wants to see how sausage is made, right? I think that's the challenge. Everybody's getting wrapped around the axle about the Michigan regulatory environment, and that's just the nuances of the environment. You got the pluses and deltas. Everybody's paying attention to it. The bottom line is, the bottom line is we get constructive outcomes. 2022, 2023, remind you of 2024, successful electric outcome, our fourth consecutive gas settlement.\nWe'll get a constructive outcome in this electric rate case. Yeah, there's this push and pull that goes on within the regulatory environment, but I'm not here wringing my hands. Our job is to sweat the small stuff. That's what we do. We sweat the small stuff. We work through the commission process, and we get constructive outcomes. When we're out there talking about 6% to 8% toward the high end, and there's consistency and predictability that our investors can count on, it's because we sweat it day in and day out. Bottom line, we work through all that at the commission, and we get the good outcomes. I think that's the bottom line, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tennett\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Sausage. Understood. Just wanted to go, if I could, pivot to DIG for a second here. It seems like I think you mentioned outage.\nJust wondering how much of a headwind that is for EPS, to see if you could quantify that.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, first of all, I'll let Rejji walk through the numbers on that. The teams did this just like any major outage. We do these every seven, eight years. Teams prepared, ready to execute. Materials are all there. We've talked about this last year, and this is part of the plan this year. There are some renewables that are part of the mix that help with the EPS numbers and contribution from NorthStar.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I think Garrick summarized it well, Jeremy. We'll probably lose about a little less, or rather a little more than 50% of DIG's contribution in prior years, but that will be offset by contributions from existing operating assets. Remember, we do have a thermal generation fleet beyond DIG.\nWe also have existing renewable projects such as the Aviator project and others. We also do have some multi-year projects that are underway that we expect to achieve commercial operation date, or COD, in the second half of this year. It's a combination of additional contributions from new and existing operating assets. That should offset DIG's contribution this year.\n\nJeremy Tennett\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nRight. I guess I was just thinking, I mean, guidance might have been even higher if not for this turnaround. Understood your points there. That's a good thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, yeah, outages are a reality of the business. Unfortunately, this year, we'll have a modest DIG divot, but in the subsequent years, we expect to see additional growth, which we highlighted on slide 15 in the materials.\n\nJeremy Tennett\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question today will be from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning. Hey, hey, Garrick. I didn't eat breakfast, so you're making me a little hungry on this sausage talk. I usually eat before the weekend.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI can't treat myself all the time. I got to wait for the weekend.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThere you go. There you go. Actually wanted to start with Rejji just on the financing side. Do you mind just maybe bridging us a little bit from the $3 billion CapEx increase to what you increased on the equity side? It seems like maybe a little bit less than what we would have otherwise expected in terms of equity need. How much is maybe tied to tax credit transferability? Any additional color there would be helpful.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah.\nI'm happy to provide some information on that, Michael, and appreciate the question as always. As you may recall, in the past, we've talked about this sensitivity between every dollar of capital investment funded by about $0.35 to 0.40 of common equity at the Holdco. That's about where we are. If you just think about the glide path from this vintage we've just rolled out today of a five-year plan versus the prior, to give you specific numbers, we're up $3 billion vintage over vintage of aggregate CapEx. That implies about another $120 million or so of equity. The prior plan had up to $350 million of equity starting this year. You add $120 million on top of that, you start to get in that\n$500 million range.\nThat's what we expect from an equity issuance perspective over the next two to three years. As we get to the outer years of this plan, it does step down. That's why I said on a long-term basis, the average will be about $450 million. What you see is we're expecting about $85 million or so, roughly, of tax credit monetizations this year. That will step up over the course of this five-year plan as we execute on more renewable projects to comply with the energy law. We expect over $700 million of tax credit transfers in aggregate over the course of this five-year plan. That compares favorably versus the expectations in the prior five-year plan, which was closer to a little over half a billion.\nThat tax credit ramp-up or that tax credit transfer ramp-up is really what's driving down the equity needs in the outer years of the plan. I would say in the front end of the plan, pretty directly consistent with our historical sensitivity between CapEx and equity needs.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, that's really helpful. My second question, I'm going to stick with you here, Rejji. In terms of the liability management side, how do you think about if there's more to potentially do if necessary? I know you didn't bake it into the plan, but if weather is mild again for the second or third year in a row, are there more levers to pull on that front? Maybe if I could also tie in, again, where you were conservative without baking in any hybrid issuances, is that available to you currently, you think?\nJust wanted to be really conservative. Yeah, just trying to think about where you have some of the flex.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nAbsolutely. I would say with respect to liability management, certainly that was a very helpful tool in the toolkit over the course of 2024 and 2023, I'd remind you. We did lean into those. I think the benefits are several-fold. I mean, obviously, we want to peg them to weather. We'd have to see what weather does over the course of the year if we were going to go down that path because we view opportunities like that as transitory, like weather. We would want to peg them to weather. I'd say given our utilization of those over the past couple of years, there's certainly more opportunities there, but we'd have to see where interest rates go.\nI mean, right now, it certainly makes the environment hospitable because rates have remained range-bound and fairly high, which creates the discounts on extinguishments that drive the gains. We'd have to see where weather trends. Needless to say, going on year eight here at CMS, and as we've said before, we don't discriminate when it comes to the cost structure. We look broadly, whether that's tax planning, whether that's operational O&M-related flex, whether that's the CE Way. We will continue to look throughout the cost structure and execute on levers wherever we find them. That's why we've been successful for so many years now. It's just staying paranoid,\nidentifying risk, quantifying risk, and making sure we have opportunities that exceed the risk. That's what we'll do going forward. That's the playbook. I don't see us deviating from that.\nTransitioning to the question around hybrids, certainly that's an opportunity, as I think we may have talked about in the past. The real limitations there is obviously we'll see where market conditions are, but it seems like there's pretty good depth and appetite for junior subordinated note paper in the market. We saw some issuances recently, and at pretty interesting levels. There was quite a bit of activity last year, I think catalyzed by Moody's increasing the equity credit they ascribed to hybrids in Q1 of last year. Certainly an opportunity. We were doing those long before that became a thing. I'd say it represents less than 10% of our book capitalization. There's a threshold by S&P at 15%, and\nthat gives us about $3 billion of additional capacity to do hybrids. Again, it's a tool in the toolkit.\nWe'll be opportunistic if we see the right pricing. That can allow us to do both credit and EPS accretive deals from a financing perspective versus plan. We'll certainly look to do that.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nReally appreciate it. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. You covered a lot of areas. Just one quick thing I wanted to clarify on the dividend. The pace of the increase has decelerated the past couple of years. Wanted to just understand the payout ratio for 2025 should be right around your target at 61% based on the midpoint of guidance. You obviously tend to beat the guidance midpoints, as we all know. My question is, looking to 2026 and beyond, how should we think about the dividend growth?\nI understand it's a board decision. Rejji, I think you made a comment about wanting to retain more earnings to finance growth. How should we think about the pace of dividend growth relative to earnings going forward starting next year?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I appreciate the question, Andrew. I'll take a walk down memory lane because, as you may recall, when we sold InterBank in 2021, and at the risk of sounding self-serving, boy, has that transaction aged well. We increased the growth rate at that time. That's when we started going toward the high end, the 7% to 8%. We just thought it was prudent to decouple the dividend per share growth at that time from the EPS growth. Also, we did have to right-size it because we went up to like 65% payout, which we thought was not comparable versus our growth year peers.\nAt that point, we've been on this sort of glide path of DPS growth. It was initially sort of low, 6%. It's now sort of 5% to 7% toward the low end. That has made a lot of sense as we glide path down to a 60% payout ratio. Just frankly, again, to your comment and my comment, my prepared remarks, retain more earnings so that we can redeploy those earnings into the utility growth and rate base growth. That will be our MO. As I look in the outer years, again, we'll probably have pretty consistent dividend per share increases. You'll see that growth kind of be in the low 5% year over year. I still think we'll be, not I think, I anticipate us being sort of in that sort of low 60s, high 50s range for some time.\nTo your comment, we'll obviously have to confirm that our board is supportive of that year in and year out, as we always do. It should be around 60%. Again, it may be sort of high 50s or thereabout. I think that, again, is the most prudent use of capital in the current environment because we've got a breadth and depth of CapEx backlog that really warrants significant support from a funding perspective. We just don't think it makes sense to sort of recycle the capital through the external markets. Why not just retain more and redeploy it into the business? That's going to be our MO for some time. Is that helpful, Andrew?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nIt is. I certainly don't disagree. I just wanted to make sure you're comfortable going into the 50s. It sounds like you are. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Nicholas.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for all the information.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning,\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nmorning. Hey, I just wanted to ask, just to follow up on Jeremy's question a little bit further on NorthStar and the DIG opportunities. You've outlined some of the potential upside there, but to the extent that you have just better bilateral opportunities that come down the pipeline that are incremental to that, is that still just a further extension of the 6 to 8, or would you kind of reevaluate at that time? Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I'm going to use three words, Nick, with which I think you're well familiar, and our bias is always to strengthen and lengthen the plan.\nWhile there certainly may be additional opportunity with the roughly 25% open margin that we highlighted in the outer years of our plan, which could be recontracted at really attractive rates, just given the tightening we continue to see in zone seven, it just gives us additional opportunity to strengthen and lengthen the plan. I think it's worth reminding folks, and Garrick highlighted this in his prepared remarks. I mean, remember, we compound off of actuals year in and year out. You really want to make sure that you've got enough support to do that because it gets harder every year by definition. Again, that's been our bias for some time, and that would be the intent. As you can\nsee on slide 15, too, yes, there's open margin, there's a tightening market, and there's additional opportunity.\nIt's also important to note we did realize a good portion of that in this plan. You can see in that bar that says 2026 through 2029, we've stepped up the earnings power of DIG pretty handsomely by, again, contracting at really attractive rates. There's still additional opportunity on the outside looking in, but we did realize a good portion of that in this plan. Let me stop there and see if there are any further questions beyond that.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nNo, hey, that's helpful. My only follow-up is on the REP. I know it's early, but just is this something that you expect to take the full distance, or is there a settlement potential opportunity in there too?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe'll always look for settlement opportunities. This renewable energy plan would be more similar to the integrated resource plan.\nWe've had success in settling integrated resource plans. I would look for settlement opportunities in that renewable energy plan. At the latest, it'll go into Q3 of the year. Again, it's a good plan, got confidence in taking the whole way if need be.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thanks a lot. See you soon.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will be from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nHey, team,\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nThanks for the discussion today. Hey, good morning, Garrick. All my other questions have been answered. Just one big question on tariffs. If China tariffs are in effect now, as you know, and if they stay on for a prolonged period of time, just thinking about how it impacts you, especially given you have a considerable amount of renewable investment in the plan.\nMaybe talk to your supply chain, how you deal with seeing that. Just any color you could share, that would be great. Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nReally, the team's done great work. We've really done our homework here. Let me talk through some numbers. When we look at direct spend across our supply chain, and we looked at it both Canada, Mexico, and China, it's a little over 5% direct that is coming from one of those three locations in the world. When we look at indirect spend, and so indirect, you're going with a company that might be US-based, but they have a spend in either, again, Mexico, Canada, or China. That's again a little over 5%. We're talking about 10% to 12% of the overall supply chain mix. It's small in the context of that.\nTo your point, we're actively working to mitigate that. That's one, we've bumped up our supply stock a bit. Two, we've looked at how to migrate to other vendors that are US-based. That's a way to deal with it as well. That's the supply chain. I've got great confidence in our ability to execute the capital plan and keep bills affordable for our customers. Now, the other piece is in electric and natural gas. Let me talk about that homework we've done as well. As part of MISO, Canada is part of the MISO mix. Remember this, given our natural gas plants, we're typically putting energy into the market. We've got great heat rates, got low cost of incoming natural gas, and that's a nice hedge. It saved our\ncustomers over a couple hundred million dollars this year.\nWe'll continue to do that, a hedge if there is any volatility or an increase in electric prices in the market. Really positioned well there. Then gas. We bought last year, and this was a high for us. We bought about 6% of our gas from Canada. Again, that was at a high. Remember, we have seven interconnects. I've got six other interconnects that I can leverage for US gas to be able to mitigate that. Again, I feel like I'm in a really good spot there, or the company's in a really good spot from a tariff perspective for natural gas. Finally, and I imagine we'll get this question over time when we looked at it in some detail, is that often you start to think about other industries.\nOften with Michigan, with our rich heritage on automotive, the question comes up, well, tariffs, how do they impact the automotive industry? I will remind all our investors that a little over 2% of our gross margin is in the automotive space in tier one and tier two. We have a very diversified service territory, which helps mitigate some of that risk that might show up for the automotive industry. There is a lot of detail there, a lot of data. You can tell we've done our homework, but still, we can really manage and mitigate the impact to our customers. I know Rejji wants to get on into this too.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Durgesh, all I would add to Garrick's dissertation is that for the avoidance of doubt, we actually do not directly source any material from China.\nAs Garrick noted, we may have second or third derivative exposure, like I think most global and diversified businesses on the planet do. Again, we do not directly source any material from China. The only other thing I'd mention is that we are obviously using the place and the CE Way when we work with our vendors. We do have operating reviews with our vendors, and we are working very actively with them to ask them the same questions you're asking us. What are they doing to mitigate the risk of tariffs? We're making sure that our contracts with our vendors, particularly those who do have second or third derivative exposure to some of these locations that are in\nthe crosshairs, have the appropriate level of risk transfer or risk sharing in our contracts.\nWe are doing work with our vendors just to make sure that we've got the right level of visibility on their manufacturing footprint and make sure we have clarity on what they're doing to mitigate these risks.\nWow, guys. Really comprehensive. Appreciate all the detail. That actually just prompted a follow-up question that I was just curious about. Is there a way to think about your equipment and your supply chain, how much of that is domestic versus international? Because my thought process is this is just not China, Canada, right? This might be the European Union might be next year. Just how to think about domestically versus internationally sourcing equipment and other things?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, Durgesh, hopefully what you heard from our early response is, again, we sweat the details, right? Our investors don't have to worry. I mean, that's the big message here.\nJust going back to those numbers from, again, Canada, Mexico, China, and certainly Rejji clarified the China piece. We're talking about, and indirectly, about 10% to 12% where there might be materials that are coming from those three countries. Again, most of it's US-based, which gives us a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute the plan.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Durgesh, all I would add is that we do principally source. Yeah, we do principally source most of our materials domestically. Some of them are internationally sourced, but most of them are domestic. Again, I think the key really operationally is it's really important to have a diversified vendor base, and we've done that quite a bit. On the solar side, we're sourcing domestically a lot of solar to de-risk.\nWe've been doing that for many years now, not over the past couple of months, last several years. We've also broadened our footprint to sourcing from Southeast Asia with respect to solar modules, and that's been really helpful as well. Again, we've really taken an all-the-above approach to make sure we're well-diversified and not subject to over-indexing or over-concentration in any particular area.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys, and congrats on the update here. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Hey, thanks so much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI was curious on maybe the broader kind of Michigan backdrop for supporting data centers. I was curious, is there excess transmission capacity as you see it in Michigan or in your own fleet on the generation side?\nDo you have extra buffer to absorb data center projects and some of this load that you're seeing?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, first, start with Michigan. Michigan's been very supportive, both in the sales and use tax. As Rejji mentioned in his earlier comments, we've worked closely with regional and state economic development organizations to help locate data centers, as well as manufacturing facilities, in Michigan. The biggest piece that we do and our economic development team does is help in the placement. There's not tons of excess transmission capacity out there, but there are advantages to where you locate in the state. We help, along with the transmission provider, locate and try to position those across the state. In some cases, it does require transmission build-out, requires distribution build-\nout. We try to make that small so that we're able to keep the cost down, but also so we can do it in the time frames that are expected. From a supply perspective, we feel good about our supply mix. We're continuing that renewable energy plan incorporates that 2% to 3% growth. We're building out those additional renewables to meet the energy law, but also for that sales growth. When we do our integrated resource plan, we're going to, again, look at the needs there. We have these filings to be able to build that out. Remember, out of the last IRP, Integrated Resource Plan, we were at a surplus. We've been able to leverage that as well to be able to attract these businesses to Michigan.\nI feel good about our ability to place them here and have the supply resources to meet that. The final thing I'll add to it as well is, remember, these loads don't come on all at once. There's timing pieces. We work with those companies. We know those timing pieces. For example, we've talked about this. We know that Switch, the data center, wants to be full load by 2026. Well, we're building that. We're constructing that now. They bring a little load on late 2025, and we'll have it on by 2026. We know all those, whether it's manufacturing or whether it's data centers. We can stage those and make sure we have both the physical distribution and transmission, but also the supply resources to be able to meet their needs.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGotcha. Thanks. That's helpful.\nMaybe a quick question, just going back to the rate case. I know it's late in the process, but are there opportunities here to still settle broadly your individual pieces before the finish line?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI'm always open to settlement, you know that. Again, the clock is ticking on this one, and we've had the PFD. I would just offer this. Staff is a really constructive starting position on this. Just as a reminder, these are staff professionals. They do their homework. They've done a lot of due diligence in this case. They put it in testimony. It's a nice, constructive starting spot, which I have a lot of confidence in. Then you also add our experts who bring best practices and bring benchmarking to that. There's a nice blend that should occur between staff's position and the company's position.\nBottom line, I have a lot of confidence we're going to get to a constructive outcome, whether it be settlement or probably more likely through a final order in March. We'll get to a constructive outcome that will be good for all stakeholders.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks for all the updates.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. You bet, David.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask any further questions, please dial star one now. The next question will be from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nHey, quick clarification on the long-term opportunities. When you put the numbers $10 billion on the reliability roadmap, $10 billion on the electric REP, rather, are those opportunities that are simply outside the plan, i.e., year six through ten, or are those opportunities that might come into the five-year plan?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nRight now, that $20 billion plus of opportunities is outside or incremental to the five-year plan. As those filings progress, it's an opportunity to bring them into the five-year plan, or, to your point, add them in years six through ten. As you can see, it's a rich opportunity from an investor standpoint, but they're really needed customer investments, needed from a reliability and resiliency of the system as we see higher wind speeds, more frequent storms, and higher customer expectations. We need to make those investments in the electric distribution system for our customers. The other one is, just in terms of the energy law, we have to have renewables in place, 60% by 2035.\nThose are needed investments for cleaner air in compliance with the law, as well as the supply growth that we are seeing across the state, or supply demand, I should say, that we're seeing across the state that we referenced. Finally, important investments in our gas system to ensure the safety of that natural gas system. Now, that's not on the slide, but that's another important piece of the five-year and then the ten-year.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Great. The 2% to 3% electric growth, if you end up realizing that type of growth, is there a chance that you could get off of that kind of one-year rate case cadence, maybe extend it to two years? Is that a possibility as you've run the numbers if you get that electric demand growth up?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe're confident that we're going to see that.\nI go back because you used the word if, and I just want to make sure we're really clear about this. These are contracts. These are things where we're like, if I take Corning, $900 million investment, 1,100 jobs, we're building the substation now, bringing electric to serve them. These are being realized. I just want to give that level of confidence. Again, our approach, there's occasion where we stayed out for a year on a rate case, but our strategy is really to be in there annually, to do smaller-type increases, to have an active dialogue with the commission. That's where we see the best outcomes, and successful outcomes for our customers. I would anticipate that annual rate case cadence continues going forward.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Great. That's all very helpful. You answered most of my other questions. I appreciate it.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWith no further questions queued, I will now turn the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for some closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Harry. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road this year. Take care, and stay safe. This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation."

Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you. Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our proven investment thesis, which delivers 6% to 8 Adjusted earnings growth and affordable bills for our customers, has been durable for more than two decades because we focus on what matters. Today I'm going to highlight two key areas of our thesis. First, Michigan's strong regulatory environment, built on a solid, constructive framework, much of which is codified in Michigan law: 10-month forward-looking rate cases, important financial and fuel recovery mechanisms, increased energy waste reduction incentives, just to name a few attributes. This robust framework supports Michigan's position as a top-tier regulatory environment and provides important, supportive incentives for needed investments to make our electric and gas systems safer, more reliable and resilient, and cleaner. Second, our continued commitment to affordable bills for our customers.\nAs I've said before, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments, and we keep customer bills affordable. I consider our use of the CE Way, our lean operating system, one of the best in the industry. This approach limits upward pressure on customer bills and is critical in the delivery of our investment plan, and we continue to see a long runway of cost saving opportunities well into the future, delivering industry-leading results for all our stakeholders. From a regulatory perspective, we're off to a strong start for the year. As you can see on slide 4, our regulatory calendar is mostly complete. We received a constructive order in our electric rate case in March, filed our new electric rate case in May, and settled our gas rate case earlier this month. The fourth consecutive settlement in our gas business.\nFour consecutive settlements in gas, yet another proof point highlighting the strong regulatory environment in Michigan. We're very pleased with our recently approved gas settlement, which calls for $62.5 million of effective rate relief, a 9% or 9.9% ROE, and a 50% equity ratio. We plan to file our next gas rate case in December of this year. Outside of rate cases, our upcoming 20-year Renewable Energy Plan, or REP, filing in November is the only major remaining filing for the year. Let me pause there for a moment. Midway through the year, our financial-related regulatory outcomes are known. This is a great place to be. I also want to talk about our formula to deliver customer affordability as we make important investments. Long-term filings like our Renewable Energy Plan detail the significant planned investments that support safe, reliable, clean, and affordable energy for our customers.\nAs we've shared previously, we see more investment opportunities as we make the transition to renewables and clean energy. In addition to the $17 billion of needed customer investments in our five-year capital plan, our electric Reliability Roadmap and natural gas delivery plans highlight important investments well beyond what's in our financial plan now. That's a long way of saying we see a long runway of necessary and important customer investments. These investments must be balanced with a laser focus on customer affordability.\nWe take seriously our ability to create capital headroom to make those investments through continued use of the CUA, which provides over $50 million of annual customer savings, renegotiating over market PPAs, and retiring our coal facilities, which together provide well over $200 million in savings as we transition toward cleaner resources, capitalizing on economic development opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, which brings jobs and significant mission investments, spreading fixed costs over a larger customer base, benefiting all customers. Lastly, leveraging our best-in-class energy waste reduction programs to help customers reduce bills. This is a formula that works for everyone, continuing to strengthen the system with important investments while keeping customer bills affordable. Now let's look at the results and outlook for the first half. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.63, up $0.18 vs the first half of 2023.\nLargely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases, we remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook, and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full-year guidance remains at $3.29 to 3.35 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8, which implies and includes 7% up to 8. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first six months of 2024 and our year to go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a year to date and a year to go basis. In summary, through the first half of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $485 million, or $1.63 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023, largely due to higher rate relief net of investment costs. While we have seen some glimpses of favorable weather, particularly in June, overall weather continues to be a headwind through the first half of the year, equating to $0.05 per share of negative variance.\nThat figure includes the warm winter weather experienced in our service territory in the first quarter, which, I'll remind you, had the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. As mentioned, Rate Relief and NET investment-related expenses, one of the key drivers of our first half performance, resulted in $0.13 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our electric rate order received in March and last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year was negatively impacted by heavy storm activity, including a notable weather system that impacted our service territory in late June, resulting in $0.03 per share of negative variance vs the comparable period in 2023.\nRounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.13 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at NorthStar and higher weather-normalized electric sales.\nLooking. Ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.20 per share of positive variance for the remaining half of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the final six months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.12 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the Commission earlier this year, and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which Garrick summarized earlier. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, and the residual benefits from select sustainable cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023, such as our voluntary separation plan, among others.\nCollectively, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share of positive variance for the remaining six months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select one-time countermeasures from last year, and the usual conservative assumptions around weather, normalized sales, and non-utility performance, among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.35 to 0.41 per share of negative variance. In summary, despite a challenging first half of the year, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan, slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2024, which at this point are limited to debt issuances at the utility.\nI'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financing of the utility. Specifically, we are now planning to issue approximately $675 million in the second half of the year versus the implied estimates in our original guidance of $500 million to rebalance the rate making capital structure at the utility in accordance with recent rate case outcomes. Although not highlighted in the table on the slide, I'm pleased to report that we have completed all of our planned tax credit sales for the year at levels favorable to our plan, and ahead of schedule. I'll also reiterate that we have no planned long term financings at the parent in 2024, but remain opportunistic should we see a cost efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs.\nAs I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively, and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors. This year is no different. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before. The Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Rejji. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent, industry-leading financial performance. I have confidence in our strong outlook this year and beyond, as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch tone telephone. We'll now pause for just a second. Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Utilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning Jeremy, how are you?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Utilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood, good, thanks. Just wanted to turn towards DIG for a little bit here if we could, and just want to get updated thoughts with regards to recontracting overall, and just, I guess, the outlook in this environment given kind of trends in power prices?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI would suggest, Jeremy, it's consistent with what we shared in the past. Energy and capacity markets, that upward pressure continues to be a ripe opportunity, and we continue to strike nice bilateral contracts to secure higher energy, and energy capacity prices well above our plan. Again, it's a good opportunity to continue to do that, and as we've shared in the past, this just continues to strengthen and lengthen our financial performance.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Utilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it, thank you for that. If you, it seems like halfway through the year, CMS is in a pretty good position overall. Just wondering any thoughts you could share with regards to, I guess, how weather is looking and impacts for Q3 as it stands right now, and really getting towards, I guess, cost management thoughts and whether you might be in a position to pull forward cost to further derisk the future outlook and how you think about all that.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nJeremy, it's Rejji, appreciate the question. I would say weather outlook looks fairly good for Q3, but obviously early days, and I will just say personally I don't give a lot of credence to two and three month outlooks. I'm much more focused on the 10 days ahead, which appear to be a bit more accurate, and we always remain paranoid about weather. Just based on year to date, weather has not been all that kind, and we'll continue to execute on cost performance related initiatives. We've had some good success over the last several years in executing on cost management over the course of the year, and we'll continue to do that through Q3. As I mentioned in the first quarter call, it's still premature to start thinking about pull aheads for 2025.\nI'd say historically, even in the best of years where weather was really helpful in the first couple of quarters, we still didn't think about flexing up or pull ahead or any of those types of de-risking mechanisms until we got deeper into Q3 and had a real good outlook on the fourth quarter. Hopefully, more to talk about from a 2025 de-risking perspective next quarter. At this point, it's too premature to get into that.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIf I could just add to that, Jeremy, part of the call here, my prepared remarks, I talked about the confidence. Confidence comes from the fact that we're executing on the CE Way. We've done that historically. We typically have been at a run rate of greater than $50 million on an annual basis. We see that continuing. There are a number of things that we did in 2023 in terms of, as Rejji shared in his prepared remarks, voluntary separation, contract control, those continue to yield benefit in the year. Also, we're applying a lot of digital solutions, everything from work in the field to automate work all the way into the office, things like work management that continue to provide additional cost savings in the year. Again, confident, as I shared in the call here earlier, in delivering guidance for the year.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Utilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it, appreciate that. If I could just wrap with, you know, thoughts on opportunity to service data centers going forward here, and I guess the interplay with regards to legislation in Michigan, whether that comes to fruition and how that might impact the pace of such type of development.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nJeremy, you know us well enough, the Hayes-Rochow team here. We're pretty conservative in our approach to financials, and as I shared in the Q1 call, we want to make sure there's sign on the dotted line, you might say, before we talk about it, so we don't inflate our sales forecast. I would just say that there's a lot of interest in both manufacturing and data centers in the state. As I shared in the Q1 call, seeing a lot of manufacturing growth that continues into Q2, we saw data centers, we talked about one that we signed in Q1, 230MW. There continues to be strong interest in the state, both the hyperscalers, and also we're seeing some growth in what I call mid scalers from a data center perspective. Those continue to move forward regardless of legislation in the state.\nThe sales and use tax piece will continue in the conversation in the legislature. Again, it's a bit of a cherry on top of sundae, you might say.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Utilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Makes sense. Fair enough. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Jeremy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Shahriar Pourezza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director in the Energy, Power, and Utilities Sector, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey guys.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Shahriar.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director in the Energy, Power, and Utilities Sector, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning, Garrick. I know you guys noted previously that the, you know, the FCM mechanism could be incremental sort of on the new generation, not in plan. As we're kind of getting closer to the November REP filing, any thoughts on where demand is headed and how maybe CMS would be positioned for upside there? Any thoughts on incremental CapEx vs the PPA options? Have you started to embed any higher load growth in your assumptions? Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nSure. I was really hoping for a rate design question. I mean.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director in the Energy, Power, and Utilities Sector, Guggenheim Partners\n\nIt's coming. Hang tight. That's my follow-up.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nLet's talk about this. We see, we definitely see as a part of this energy law additional, additional upside that shows up in ownership of assets. It shows up in the financial compensation mechanism. Both those are true. Let me talk about how they'll play out though. We're going to file this, our Renewable Energy Plan, in November. It's a 10-month process. We'll know in 2025, in the latter half of the year, what that looks like. In our 2026 capital plan, you'll see what that means, our 2026 financials, both from an FCM perspective, as well as what might the ownership mix look like. That's where it will play out.\nIn addition to that, that's probably a portion of the story because in 2026 we'll also file our integrated resource plan, which will talk about some of the reliability pieces and some of the work to deliver the capacity component of that. Between 2026, 2027, and 2028, I think that's when you'll see the capital impact as well as the Financial Compensation Mechanism play out. In terms of our financials, I will say this. We've seen some good economic growth in the state that will show up in our renewable energy plan. We're definitely seeing a greater need than was in our original 2021 IRP. I'll leave it at that. Certainly, that will provide additional upside opportunity in terms of capital growth in addition to the energy law.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director in the Energy, Power, and Utilities Sector, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Just a quick follow up, and obviously I'll dedicate this to Garrick. Just on the rate case filing on the electric side, it's obviously in the early innings. It's kind of more of a 2025 event. The provisions and sort of the mechanisms like the IRM and DR remain unchanged, I guess. Do you feel there would be sort of an opportunity for settlement after testimony given? This is kind of a less complex case, I guess. How are you sort of thinking about settlement paths vs the prior litigated path? Is there anything, and I dedicate this to you, any of the rate design stuff in there that can cause some contention? Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI set myself up for that one, didn't I? As I shared on these calls, I will always look for settlement opportunities. I'm also very confident in our team. We put a great case together, and we can go the full distance, just as we did this year in our March order. When I think about this electric rate case, there are some things that have to be figured out to really get some context around the opportunity for supplement one. I think it's really important to understand that electric cases are more complex than gas cases. For example, we have fewer than 10 interveners in our gas case. We have a little over 20 in our electric rates electric case. That's not abnormal. It's just a more complex case. There are more interested parties, so we'll have to navigate through that.\nI also think it's important to find where staff is and where the attorney general are at in this case. That will come in September. Those are important points to know in the context of settlement opportunity. Understand this, I am very confident in this case. It is focused on electric reliability that's well aligned with what customers are asking for, what the commissioners and the staff are asking for, and what I've committed to do. This case has great capital investment. Undergrounding has important work hardening the system, automated transfer reclosers, technology on the system. There's important work in O&M and tree trimming, our number one cause of outage, and other important maintenance work across the system. We're going to leverage the infrastructure recovery mechanism we'll certainly look for. We're going to try another storm mechanism in this case as well.\nI feel confident in our ability to get the very constructive outcome just given how well aligned we are across the commission staff, as well as our customers. Hopefully that gives you some context on the case. Now, on rate design, we just talked a little about rate design specifically. Data centers are not at our economic development rate. We had ex parte filing that made an adjustment in that, that was approved. In the meantime, they are an industrial rate. We call it our GDP rate, and what that does is a better balance both capacity, energy costs, the cost to serve those customers. The commission, as well as the utility, has been looking and exploring at the opportunity specific data center rate.\nIn the interest of time, the GDP is a good proxy for that in our mind and so well suited from a rate design perspective. From a data center perspective, I also, I said GDP. I think that's the wrong thing. I was hoping for something different there. Maybe that was a, but GPD is what I meant. GPD. Sorry about that, Shahriar. I had my eyes on the economic. You know, it's election time. I have my mind on other things like what's going to happen with our economy.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director in the Energy, Power, and Utilities Sector, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThere you go. I appreciate it, guys. I think he just set up the next caller to ask you about election question. I'll see you soon. Thank you, guys.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nMorning. Morning. Just wanted to go back to the data center legislation discussion. I think on the last call you talked about a 230MW data center coming in 2026. Was that contingent on the legislation, or your understanding is still moving forward, and are there any other examples of that, or is everyone else could wait.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt was not contingent. That one's still moving forward. That's the sign piece. I guess that's my point. What we hear from data centers, it's more important about how fast can you get transmission here, how much cash can you build that conversion from transmission distribution to substation, how fast can you get supply here? We're able to do that. Many of those mid-scalers and hyperscalers continue to make forward steps regardless of the progress on the sales and use tax. Just to give you a little context, at the end of the spring session, the legislature was focused on the state budget. In the words of our governor, we got to fix the damn roads, and we got to fund schools. Right. Those are important things too. We want smart kids in the state, so those are important things underway.\nThat conversation on data centers and the sales tax will continue into the fall. Now we're in elections, so it'll be difficult for me to predict how fast that will move or it could happen in lame duck. We'll continue that conversation in the state. Again, it is not stopping things from moving forward. Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, is that like a good proxy for how long it takes new load to come onto your system? About two years, with that one being 2026.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThere's a number of variables there, Mike. In the case of that data center, what we talked about is they're bringing on load by 2025, 2026, and where they're located on the system makes a big difference. We're able to accommodate that depending on where a data center locates from a property perspective, which makes a difference. Just as far as how far do we have to extend lines, is this greenfield, is this brownfield, there's all kinds of variables that go into it, but we're in that two to three years. Again, even if you're at the tail end of that cycle, data centers are moving quickly, and that doesn't seem to be holding them up too much.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, great. Separately, just kind of sticking with legislation, I think there were some comments a few months ago from the PSC Chair about rate case timelines being a bit compressed these days. Are you hearing any chance of legislation coming up that would, you know, revert back to 12 months for a cycle from then, and just a general sense for rate fatigue in the state in light of those comments?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThe short answer is no. As you know, what makes Michigan great is much of the regulatory environment is set in law. 10-month forward-looking rate cases is in the law, financial compensation mechanism, energy efficiency incentives are in the law. We just went through that law, it was just open and it was just signed here last November. We're hearing nothing in terms of opening that law back up or looking at different provisions. We continue to always have a constructive dialogue with the commission and the staff. I do think there are opportunities, right, in terms. I'll give you one example, just one example of probably many you could think about. We have a great process for an Integrated Resource Plan and a Renewable Energy Plan that lay out an energy supply portfolio.\nWe get it pre-approved and then it flows into rate cases. It really streamlines rate cases. What if we could do the same thing on the distribution system? Wouldn't that be great? Let's build a five-year Reliability Roadmap. Wait, we've already done that. Let's do that. Let's approve that, and then have that flow into rate cases. That could really streamline the process, and if done in the right way, you could potentially see a path where you could stay out for a period of time. Again, done in the right way. Kind of the nature of Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. Let's explore that. Let's see if there's opportunities there to even further bolster Michigan's constructive nature.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, that's really helpful color. Thanks a lot.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nPartner, Portfolio Manager and Research Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nHi, good morning. I just have two quick ones. First, C&I weather -adjusted volumes were down in the quarter. It's a bit of a reversal from the first quarter. I know the first quarter was extremely mild weather, so those numbers are probably a little bit goofy. Any commentary on the underlying trends and the near term outlook for the rest of this year, maybe early thoughts on 2025?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nSure. Andrew, this is Rejji. I'll take it and appreciate the question as always. Yes, we did see a little bit of a pullback in Q2 vs Q2 of last year for weather-normalized sales for electric. I will always caveat, and I think you alluded to it, that it's a very imperfect science, and the team does a really good job trying to pull these numbers together with real accuracy. Again, it's very difficult to get real precision here. Just so everybody's grounded, residential for the quarter vs Q2 of 2023 was slightly up, about 0.1%. Commercial was down about a point, industrial down about 2 points excluding one large low-margin customer, and then all-in blended was down about a point. That is, to your comment, unfavorable from the trends we were seeing in the first quarter.\nI would say on a year-to-date basis the trend remains quite good. We continue to be surprised for the upside really across all customer classes because our assumptions were incredibly conservative, as they always are for the year. We are outperforming across every customer class what our initial expectations were that were embedded in our original guidance. We are still seeing non-weather sales upside. I'll also note, as I've said before, that we had energy waste reduction incorporated into all of those numbers that you're seeing. You should always add 2% to each of those customer classes because we're delivering the 2% reduction across every customer class year-over-year. We've been doing that now really since the 2008 law or thereabouts.\nAnother way to think about those numbers I just quoted is that you should add or gross up 2% across each of those if you want to get the underlying economic conditions. We still remain quite good, and we still remain quite pleased, rather, with the results. When you think about on a year-to-date basis, resi is up about a point, commercial is up over 1%, industrial down about a point, and all in is up about a little over 0.5%. Again, all things considered, particularly when you gross up for energy waste reduction, we think conditions in Michigan remain quite good, really, across all customer classes. Was that helpful?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nPartner, Portfolio Manager and Research Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nYes. Good reminder on the efficiency. Yes, we all know that you're conservative. Next, an operational question. You noted there was some heavy storm activity in the quarter. What kind of score or grade would you give yourself in terms of restoration efforts? Reliability is obviously a big focus for you. You talked about that in your comments. What would you say went well? What could have gone better? How does this fold into your efforts as part of the electric rate case and the audit?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe're seeing a number of great improvements as a result of the investments we have made to date. More needs to be done along those lines. In fairness, I'd give ourselves a B in the context there's more needs to be done for our customers, and that's evident in the rate case filing that we're doing. Where we've worked a lot this year is reducing the size of the outage. We put in a lot of fusing. What I mean by that is you have fewer customers impacted when the tree comes on the line. That's important work. We've more than doubled our tree trimming work over the last three years. That's also provided benefit. When we trim trees in there, we see a greater than 60% reduction in the number of outages. You may ask why not 100%?\nWe still see trees outside the right of way that impacts our performance. I would also put it into context. Rejji talked about the last week of June, and there was a larger event in June, but there were a lot more smaller events, which we would anticipate. We're trying to shrink the size, which makes restoration easier, but there are a lot of pockets throughout the state. We brought in a number of resources, and we leveraged a lot of our existing union resources to be able to respond to that. We had good response from that perspective. We measure in terms of restoring our customers within a 24-hour window. We want to have all customers restored within a 24-hour window. Last year, in 2023, we were at 90% within a 24-hour window. This year, we're upwards of 95%.\nThat shows the directional improvement. Now the year's not done, we've got a lot of work to do, and we'll continue to make some important investments throughout this year. Again, this electric rate case shows the path for more, so hopefully give that some context. Now I know Rejji wants to add to it as well.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nAndrew, all I would add to Garrick's good comments on the operational side is really applying a financial lens. I would give us about a B+, A- on the financial side because through utilization of the CE Way, we've done a really good job reducing unit costs in our actual service restoration. We're seeing at this point over $40 million of avoided costs. Needless to say, I talked about negative variance attributable to overall service restoration costs versus last year. However, the cost would have been decidedly higher, as in the problem solving we've done throughout the year. We're contracting third parties more efficiently, we're using more automation to reduce manual inspections, and definitely leveraging the tools of the CE Way to really execute on storm restoration much more efficiently than we have in the past.\nIn addition to all the operational feat that Garrick highlighted, we're also applying a really thoughtful financial lens as well to make sure that we're bringing customers back online as quickly as possibly and as quickly as possible, and as cost efficiently as possible. I'd be remiss if I didn't add that as well.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nPartner, Portfolio Manager and Research Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nCertainly sounds better than years past. Thank you very much. Appreciate the details.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Good to chat with you guys again.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, good to hear from you again.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah, likewise. Garrick, what are you putting your hat. When are you putting yourself in the ring here for VP, given all the political conversation here right now, you want to fix damn roads.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI don't know, I don't know if it has a ring to it. I'll give it a try. I'll give it a try.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nLove it. Anyway, look, you guys are clearly, you got your front foot forward here for sure. Look, you. You favorably have pulled back on O&M savings here. You're talking about leaning in, being in a good position against near-term and longer-term targets. You've issued more debt, I think it was $675 million vs the $500 million to rebalance your equity ratio. What's driving this level of outperformance? I'm just going to try to clarify the debt signaling as well as just overall the commentary, especially considering the O&M factor that you flag here. Typically, you lead with costs, but I'm wondering what other factors there are.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nJulien, it's Rejji. Appreciate the question and welcome back, really good to hear your voice. Let me start with a few of the just premises or working assumptions you offered up in the question. Let me start with the debt at the utility just for factual purposes. We are planning to issue about $675 million in the second half of the year at the utility as part of our financing plan. It was initially half a billion, so we've slightly increased, and that's really just because of our rate case outcomes, which had modestly lower equity levels. We'll have more debt at the operating company, and I just wanted to make sure that that was abundantly clear. Obviously, we'll look to execute on that financing as cost efficiently as possible, and we'll be thoughtful about the maturity profile as well.\nThe outperformance has been, obviously, we always try to deliver on the cost performance side, but as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, rate relief net of investments has been helpful, getting constructive orders. The electric rate order in early March, the gas rate case last year, we're still seeing the residual benefits from that. That's really what's helped us in the first half of the year. Also, though it's embedded in that catch-all bucket, as I noted in my prepared remarks, NorthStar has really outperformed. They had a really soft comp in the first half of 2023, just given last year's plan was a bit more back-end loaded, and there were also some outage-related issues at DIG given a transformer issue. This year they've really gotten out of the gate pretty strong.\nDIG is up about $0.05 year over year, and we're seeing the residual benefits from some solar projects that came in late last year. I'd say it's a combination of rate relief, net investments, outperformance at NorthStar, as well as some cost performance as you alluded to, offset by mild weather conditions, which have hurt the top line, as well as storms as we talked about in the prior question. I'd say it's a combination of all of that, which gives us just good confidence going into the second half of the year.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Rejji, just to follow up on that real quick, you know, a lot of that dynamic with NorthStar, some of it is true up there. You talk about outages year-over-year. You should, in theory, some of that should have been expected. The solar in service. I mean, I'm curious, the outperformance here, I mean, is this more of a true-up or is there sort of a compounding effect across the subsequent years? How do you think about the leading indicators there?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, good question. NorthStar on plan. We anticipated a front-end loaded year for all of the regions you noted. A good portion of NorthStar's performance was on plan. I will say big did surprise a little bit to the upside in the first quarter because operationally, not only are they executing very well, but they're also executing on a lower unit cost basis, which drives a little bit of additional margin. There also are opportunities for off-peak margin that the team has capitalized on. I'd say it's a combination of being on plan because it was a front-end loaded plan at NorthStar, but also our operational efficiency, which we've seen. That's really the thrust of it at NorthStar.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. All right, guys, chat soon. All right, thank you. Good luck, Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nSee you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning. Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities Sector, Evercore\n\nHey, good morning, Garrick. Thanks for taking my question. All my other questions have been answered. I just wanted to see if there's an update on the performance-based rate making docket here coming out of the legislation last year. Where do we stand there? Can you just update us on that, please?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nSure. That's been a very constructive dialogue as I've shared in the past. It started really wide in the number of metrics, and then through good dialogue, it was narrowed down to the next four benchmarkable metrics. It's grown a little bit to accommodate some storm provisions. However, there's still a constructive dialogue underway here in July and August. There are filings to be able to navigate that. There are a few things we still want to work through and get, and get dot the I's and cross the t's on, you might say. I expect that this is going to play out over, you know, over several rate cases. It is not going to be implemented here immediately.\nI think it just speaks to the constructive dialogue we have in Michigan here, a lot of good intervenors and filings that go back and forth to really make sure it's going to be a productive, productive rate making mechanism.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities Sector, Evercore\n\nGot it. Just kind of the framework of this would be a potential earnings uplift, and then on the downside, a potential penalty on certain metrics. When did you say this could go into effect? This is a 25 item, 26. Just any thoughts there?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI would put it several rate cases, over maybe a year, two years out. From an implementation perspective, again, that's my view, just what I see of the world. The intent is for it to be symmetric, so there's upside opportunity and downside opportunity. The downside opportunity is marked about $10 million at this context, which is manageable in the context of the year. That means the upside opportunity is roughly that same amount, at least as it's proposed currently.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities Sector, Evercore\n\nThanks so much. Appreciate the time.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please dial star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nVery high level on electric demand. Wonder if you could elaborate on how it's trending vs your 2021 IRP and how, as you'd mentioned earlier in the call, how that would affect potentially the renewable energy plan filing here? Is it trending higher or lower, and how does that impact the REP?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. It's definitely trending higher based on all the economic development activity that is, again, not speculating on that, that is signed or we're out building transmission, not building transmission substations, and there's transmission being built to serve these customers. In our Renewable Energy Plan filing, you should anticipate that there's additional sales referenced there above and beyond our 2021 IRP.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nIs it fair to make the leap then that you would need more renewable energy on that same percentage basis, as what's in the law?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYes, generally speaking, yes.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Okay. I've seen a lot of talk in the media about Palisades. From your perspective, is it accurate that you're seeing development moving forward on that plant? If so, would you be interested in either implementing that in your plan in terms of the capacity and energy, and/or signing a PPA?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nPalisades is making forward progress in the state from a state budget perspective. Another $150 million was allocated toward the forward direction of the facility. We're having public meetings that are going on right now on site. Again, forward steps in moving forward that plan. I'll remind you that a PPA has already been struck for the offtake from the Palisades facility that goes to a co-op in Michigan and a co-op in Indiana. It's already spoken for. It's good for Michigan that Palisades is returning, and we at CMS Energy do not see any adverse impact as a result of Palisades coming back.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot. That's all I have.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Nicholas Campanella of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Lead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks and hope everyone's having a great summer. Just one for me today. I know, Rejji, you know you said you would be opportunistic in your prepared remarks around financing and, you know, potentially pulling things forward from 2025. I'm just cognizant that you do have kind of, you do start to issue equity in 2025, and maybe you can just kind of give us some more color. You're just kind of talking about pulling forward hybrid or debt or everything on the table, how we should think about that? Thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, appreciate the question, Nicholas. I would say, in short, I wouldn't say everything is on the table, so you won't see us issuing equity in 2024. What we have done in the past, though, is we have executed on forwards opportunistically to at least take some of the price risk off the table.\nI would say where the equity is today, I don't think that looks, seems like the most likely trade. I was speaking more towards parent debt financing needs, and certainly our thinking is quite expansive. Everything from senior notes to hybrids and those types of securities, all of which we've done pretty opportunistically in the past. As you may recall, we've got about $250 million coming due at the Holdco next year, and we're mindful of that. We have, I'd say, modest new money needs on top of that. We will see if there's good pricing in the market, particularly if the speculation around potential dovish monetary policy from the Fed comes to fruition. I have stopped wagering on that. We'll see what happens.\nIf we start to see a correction in the yield curve that's favorable and it creates opportunities for Holdco debt financings, we'll look to do that. Again, I'd say the equity needs still, as is, up to $350 million starting next year. I don't see us pulling any of that forward.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector and Lead Analyst of US Power and Utilities, Barclays\n\nAll right, that's super helpful. I really appreciate it, and I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference in September. Thanks.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nSee you then.\n\nOperator\n\nWith no further questions in the queue at this time, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Harry. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, please press the star followed by zero. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00PM Eastern Time, running through 2 May 2024.\nThis presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJason Shore\n\nTreasurer and VP of Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.\nI'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent industry-leading results. What sets us apart is our performance, and it starts with our investment thesis. It is how we prioritize and focus our work to deliver the service our customers deserve, and the financial outcomes you expect. As we look ahead, we see ample investment opportunity over the long term as we lead the clean energy transformation and deliver the critical work needed to improve the reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas systems.\nThis important work is supported by legislation and a constructive regulatory environment, which provides confidence in making required investments to strengthen our system and prepare for a clean energy future. We plan ahead through our electric reliability roadmap, natural gas delivery plan, and our upcoming renewable energy plan, which all provide visibility and transparency on the work we'll deliver to keep our systems safe, sound, and clean. At CMS Energy, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments in our systems, and we work to keep bills affordable.\nOur CEWA Lean Operating System helps us improve our performance, increase productivity, and take costs out of the business. We are hard at work to grow Michigan through economic development, ensuring Michigan thrives well into the future. These efforts are important and help us keep customers' bills affordable. At CMS Energy, we make our investment thesis work year after year, and it continues to set us apart in the industry, delivering results for all our stakeholders.\nToday, I'm going to share three focus areas that have me excited about our future and give us confidence in our outlook. First, our electric distribution system. As our world becomes more dependent on electricity for business growth, technology advancements, devices, and vehicles, our system needs to be stronger, smarter, and more resilient for our customers. Our vast electric distribution system is aging. It needs to be modernized and strengthened for increasingly severe weather. Over the past five years, we have seen some of the highest wind speeds on record and more frequent storm activity.\nWe have responded to this need through our electric reliability roadmap, currently a five-year, $7 billion plan to improve performance and harden our system for the future. The plan utilizes best practices from across the industry, including designing the system with stronger poles, undergrounding, sectionalizing, and further automation. Given the size of our distribution system, 90,000mi of line, nearly 1,200 substations, and a historically lower investment per mile compared to peers, we see a long runway of needed investment. We've incorporated roughly half of the incremental $3 billion you see on slide four into our current capital plan,\nand you'll start to see this investment show up in our next electric rate case, which we'll file in the Q2. These important investments will mean fewer and shorter outages for our customers, and we are already seeing meaningful improvements in the investments made over the last few years. The second focus area I want to share is our continued leadership of the transformation to clean energy in the industry.\nIn the past, I have shared our approved plans to eliminate coal in 2025, reduce carbon, grow energy efficiency, and build out renewables in pursuit of our net-zero target and cleaner air for our customers and our planet. In late 2023, much of our clean energy targets were bolstered by Michigan's new clean energy law. This law is unique in the industry and is good for all stakeholders. It provides us with the opportunity to further reduce our carbon footprint while maintaining resource adequacy, affordable customer bills, and delivering for our investors. On the right side of the slide, you'll see the opportunities ahead as we prepare to meet Michigan's new clean energy law.\nIt supports an accelerated plan for the decarbonization of our system with an enhanced financial compensation mechanism, which provides a roughly 9% return on clean purchased power agreements. In addition, there's an increased incentive on energy efficiency as we target 60% renewables by 2035 and 100% clean energy by 2040. It gives us important flexibility as we think through how to best meet our customers' needs with renewables across the broad MISO footprint. This mechanism and the flexibility in the law help us balance customer affordability as we work through this transition.\nFor our customers, all this means stronger, more resilient, and cleaner energy. For our investors, an exciting and robust investment runway well into the future. Now, let's work the other side of this investment equation. The third focus area that I want to share today is how we are helping Michigan grow and thrive, which is good for our company and our customers. Growth across our service territory is good for Michigan. It helps keep bills affordable for our customers and provides headroom for the investments I just referenced. I couldn't be more excited about the growth we are seeing in our state.\nMichigan has a strong fiber network, access to freshwater, temperate climate, energy-ready sites, and attractive energy rates. In February, we secured a contract with a large data center in the heart of our service territory. The majority of the 230MW of new load is expected to be online by 2026. This is nice load growth. I'm even more excited about the manufacturing load growth we are seeing in Michigan, which is a differentiator for us. Our statewide leadership of projects such as Goshen, Hemlock Semiconductor, Ford, and many others continues to drive new and expanding load in our service territory.\nThese projects bring significant jobs, supply chains, commercial growth, housing starts, and broad Michigan investment. The ancillary benefits of manufacturing growth are good for all customers and bolster our confidence in our plan for 2024 and beyond. Our customers thrive when Michigan thrives, and I'm proud of the diversity and quality of new load our leadership is working to bring to the state. Now, let's get into the numbers. In the Q1, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.97. Although we experienced a warmer than normal winter, the healthy set of countermeasures we deployed in 2023, as well as our active use of the CEWA, continued to benefit us in 2024.\nWe remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook, and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full-year guidance remains at $3.29 to 3.35 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On slide seven, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the quarter and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a Q1 and nine months-to-go basis. In summary, through the Q1 of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $288 million, or $0.97 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023, largely due to higher weather-normalized sales and lower service restoration costs at the utility, partially offset by mild weather.\nTo elaborate on the impact of weather, we experienced another warm winter in Michigan during the Q1, which had the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. The warm winter weather resulted in $0.06 per share of negative variance, which appears modest on the surface given the historically low number of heating degree days.\nHowever, it's important to note that last year's winter was also quite warm. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, resulted in $0.05 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our most recent electric rate case and last year's gas rate case settlement, coupled with residual benefits from our 2023 electric rate case settlement approved last January. From a cost performance perspective, our financials in the Q1 of 2024 were positively impacted by lower operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses, primarily attributable to lower service restoration costs than we experienced last year.\nAlso, as Garrick noted, we continue to see benefits from select cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023, which have offset modest inflationary trends we've experienced in various cost categories, such as wages, as planned. We anticipate this trend to continue over the remainder of the year. In our catch-all category, represented by the final bucket in the actual section of the chart, you'll notice a healthy pickup of $0.19 per share, largely driven by weather-normalized sales, which contributed almost half of said positive variance, particularly in our residential and commercial customer classes.\nIt's worth noting that the leap year impacts comparability with 2023 for weather-normalized sales. Even absent the effects of the leap year, our residential weather-normalized sales were up about 0.5%, and our commercial customer class was up almost 2.5% versus the prior year, which highlights the continued solid performance of our higher-margin customer classes. Looking ahead, we plan for normal weather, as always, which equates to $0.22 per share of positive variance for the remaining nine months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced for virtually all of 2023.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, we're assuming $0.18 per share of positive variance, which is largely driven by the constructive electric rate order received from the commission in early March. We are also assuming a supportive outcome in our pending gas rate case. On the cost side, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CEWA and last year's voluntary separation program, among other 2023 cost reduction initiatives that continue to bear fruit.\nWe also assume lower service restoration costs, given last year's record level of storm activity in our service territory. In aggregate, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share of positive variance for the remaining nine months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select one-time countermeasures from last year, and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and non-utility performance, among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.52 to 0.58 per share of negative variance.\nSlide eight offers the latest updates on our regulatory forward calendar. As you'll note in the top section, we plan to file our Renewable Energy Plan, or REP, by mid-November, which will highlight our strategy for complying with the various renewable energy targets associated with Michigan's new clean energy law. We are excited by the prospects of the new law, which will support our net-zero carbon by 2040 goal, and look forward to socializing our filing with key stakeholders in the coming months. Once filed, the commission will have 300 days to issue an order, which will likely be in the Q3 of 2025.\nTherefore, as mentioned during our Q4 call, you should expect that the five-year plan that will roll out in the Q1 of 2026 will incorporate a greater portion of the financial impacts of the REP. Moving on to our general rate case filings, you can expect our next electric rate case to be filed in the late May to early June timeframe. This filing will incorporate some of the initial spend we have outlined in our five-year electric reliability roadmap that Garrick touched on earlier.\nGiven the 10-month stipulated period for rate cases in Michigan, we would expect to receive an order from the commission in the Q1 of 2025, and thus the related financial impacts. Lastly, we anticipate an order in our pending gas rate case by mid-October, absent a settlement. While we do not always include a balance sheet update in our formal presentation, it is worth noting that Moody's and Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings in March and April, respectively, as noted at the bottom of the table on slide nine.\nLonger term, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings and will continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and provides us with confidence for a strong outlook this year and beyond. Twenty-one years of consistent industry-leading financial performance, 21 proof points. Regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. With that, Drew, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone. Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning, morning. I guess, firstly, just given you have an upcoming electric case, how are you thinking about any kind of incremental construct improvements there? Would you kind of seek an expanded IRM framework? Do you need to address any kind of the rate design issues with CNI rates, especially as you're trying to accommodate new load, like data center growth, especially as you're trying to kind of balance that customer rate impact?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nShar, you want me to get into rate design? You guys are all going to fall asleep on this call if I go into rate design. Let me start out with the fundamentals of this electric case, because I think this is really important. You've heard me time and time again, whether it's investor meetings or our calls, on the importance of improving reliability. We've seen higher wind speeds, more frequent storm activity, and this is our focus as a company: how do we improve reliability and the longer-term resiliency of our electric system? You can also hear that from the commissioners. They're very clear about that expectation. I would say there's really good alignment there.\nThis reliability roadmap does just that. It's aimed at those important capital improvements. There's some O&M work associated with that as well. These are best practices in the industry which we're deploying across our system, and it's going to be a meaningful benefit for our customers. In addition to that, we're focused on the affordability piece. This is how the fundamentals of this. Great to invest the capital, but you also have to be focused on the affordability piece for our customers. It's driving down unit costs through the CEWA, and it's other cost offsets.\nThere's a whole range of things we're doing to make sure this next electric rate case delivers for our customers in terms of improved reliability and offsetting from a cost perspective. That's the fundamentals of the case. We're going to look at different mechanisms in that case. As I've shared before, I would anticipate that we, again, take advantage of our infrastructure recovery mechanism that was supported in the last case. We'll look at a storm recovery mechanism. We've utilized that in previous cases. We'll continue to look at that optionality and what that could look like in this case.\nAgain, longer term, we'll file this end of May, first part of June. I feel confident about what we're putting together based on the important merits of the case that are going to improve reliability and well-balance the important components of affordability. Now, your question on rate design, there's a lot in rate design. I really will put you to sleep if I go there. We're going to make sure, as the state expands and we have this important low growth, that both the energy and capacity components, that cost of service mechanism is appropriately allocated to where those costs are. That's what we've done historically. That's what the commission supported.\nWe'll look at that, certainly, within the context of this case. It's really smaller in the grand scheme of the important work of this case.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Perfect. Lastly, as we're thinking about the energy law construct in you and Rick, I guess, what are some of the first changes you can implement, especially as we're thinking about the upcoming IRP update? Would you lean more on sort of that FCM construct, and is any of this kind of embedded in your longer-range growth guidance things?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt's still early days on some of this modeling. We'll file our REP, our Renewable Energy Plan, 15 November. As I've shared historically here or previously here, there's a broad spectrum of ownership versus PPA. The PPA obviously have the opportunity for the financial compensation mechanism, or if you're going to build everything and own everything, you have the opportunity to earn your ROE. There's a broad spectrum. You can do all either end. Those are the bookends. I think it's somewhere in the mix, and there's a lot of variables we need to consider that we're modeling out right now.\nThat's why we're not prepared to share what that looks like. Let me hand it over to Rejji. I know he has some additional thoughts on this.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nShar, good morning. Thanks for the question. All I would add to Garrick's comments is that in our current five-year plan, what we've incorporated is just a modest amount of PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism. That's solely because of the fact that any PPA put in place after June of this year would be subject to the new FCM, which is around 9% versus the prior of about 5.5%. We have a portion of that, albeit a small portion, incorporated in this five-year plan. We've also incorporated the enhanced economic incentives associated with energy efficiency, so that's flowing through our plan as well.\nRemember, historically, we've, on the electric side, been reducing load about 2% year-over-year. Before the new energy law, we'd get a 20% incentive on top of that spend. That's now 22.5%. That's also a source of financial upside embedded into this plan. To Garrick's earlier comments, the much more expansive opportunities, whether it's scaling contracts, the ownership opportunities, or, more specifically, the rate-based opportunities, those are not incorporated into our five-year plan and really won't be until 2026.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Garrick, for the record, your rate design answer was not boring at all. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the morning. I guess, just thinking about the other offsite opportunities, could you maybe give us an update on your conversations around DIG and the recontracting opportunity there, and how those discussions have been progressing? Is this something that we can maybe see an update on by year-end, or is it more a 2025, 2026 item? Maybe just talk about timing there. Thanks.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Good morning, Nick. This is Rejji, and I appreciate the question. Yeah. As we talked about on our Q4 call, we still have about 30% to 35 open margin in the outer years of our plan, really starting in sort of 2026 or second half of 2026 going through 2028. We certainly are seeing attractive reverse inquiry for that open margin on the capacity side. We're sold through on the energy side through 2028 or through the duration of this five-year plan, but there still are opportunities on the capacity side. We'll be thoughtful. We never are too aggressive in selling down that open margin.\nWe like to have a little bit of optionality, particularly with a really attractive technical that we continue to see in zone seven with the tightening of supply and upward pressure in demand. We'll provide an update in our next five-year plan, as we always do. I expect that we'll be selling down a portion of that open margin radically over the coming months and quarters, but should still have probably a little open margin as we provide a new five-year plan in the Q1 of next year. Is that helpful?\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat is helpful. I appreciate that. I guess, thinking about the rate case cadence and outcomes, on the electric side, the last case, you kind of pursued a fully litigated outcome. On the gas side, you just received staff testimony. I think, Rejji, I heard you say you get an order in Q4 absent a settlement. Just what's your reaction to staff starting point here, and what are your thoughts on being able to settle the gas case?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI'd go back, Nick, to the fundamentals of that case. Aiming for a safe natural gas system. You're continuing to reduce methane across that and deliver affordable natural gas to our customers. Again, the imbalance, that equation of making the investments in the natural gas system, also just like we're doing the electric business, aiming for an improved affordability across the gas system through unit costs, through cost out using the CEWA, and the like. Those fundamentals are true. Staff position I would categorize as constructive, a constructive starting point. We'll look.\nOnce we have that position, we're going to look for the opportunity for settlement. We've been able to work with a number of the intervenors in the past and have a good track record there. Also hear this. I'm confident in the testimony and the merits of the case. If we need to go the full distance, we will and get a constructive outcome both for our customers and stakeholders.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nAll right, thanks so much. Have a great day.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYou too, Nick.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks. Just wanted to dive in, I guess, to the sales outlook. Came in a bit better than expected, I guess, for the Q1 and for the balance of the year. Looks like that's trending better than expected. Just wondering, by customer class, if you could dive in a bit more on the drivers that you're seeing within each class that is leading to this uptick.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Jeremy, this is Rejji. Appreciate the question. Yeah, we were pleased with the Q1 performance of non-weather sales. We provide good color on that in our earnings digest, which you probably saw. Going through the customer classes, we saw residential up just under 1.5% versus Q1 2023. On the surface, that looks quite good. It's important to note that the leap day in the quarter, because it's a leap year, drove about two-thirds of that. Still, even absent the leap day, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, still up about 0.5%.\nI still think we continue to see continued upside of the return to work or return to facilities trend, where I think we had pretty conservative assumptions about return to facilities. We are seeing a stickiness to folks having or corporations retaining what I would describe as a hybrid workforce. That is still, I think, delivering some surprise to the upside. It is a higher margin customer class, as you know. On the commercial side, really quite pleased with what we've seen. The number was just under 3.5% increase versus Q1 of 2023. The leap year only affected about 1/3 of that. Pro forma for the leap year, we were still just under 2.5%.\nVery pleased with that. Our speculation, we've seen some of the subsectors within commercial that have performed pretty well. Agriculture, mining, up about 6.5%. We also saw entertainment up about 3%. We've seen some of the subsectors perform pretty well. We also think, because folks are actually going to the office at least three days a week, that does create foot traffic in communities, and folks are going to cafes and things of that nature. That's also part of it as well. That's a bit more speculative. That's our sense. Within industrial, if you exclude one low-margin large customer, we're at just over a percent—sorry, just slightly up, let's say, about 20 to 25 basis points.\nThe leap year did have a big impact on that class. Pro forma for the leap year, you're down about 1%. I will always caveat two things whenever we talk about weather-normalized sales. One, remember, those numbers include the fact that we're reducing our load by 2% each year in electric due to energy efficiency. All these numbers should be, on a gross basis, up 2%. You should provide that color to these industrial numbers. The other thing I always caveat is that weather-normalization math, as good as our team is, as hard as they work to get it right, is a very imperfect science.\nIt is very difficult to get these numbers exactly right. What I would say in terms of industrial is that we feel very good, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks, about the economic outlook and just have a robust pipeline, and a very diversified pipeline, of industrial opportunities, which really aren't reflected in our numbers at this point and won't be until the outer years of our plan. We'll be disappointed if that opportunity doesn't continue to bear fruit for the next several years. That's the color I can offer across each customer class, but certainly happy to take any follow-ups as needed.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you for that. Maybe just pivoting a bit here, it seems on the sides as they lay out, there's a bit of cushion to hitting the guide in 2024. Just wondering, I guess, how you feel confidence level guide in 2024 at this point. Does it put you in a position to start thinking about 2025? Just wanted to get a sense for how that stands.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Well, I would say, Jeremy, early days. Obviously, we're delighted that 2024 is not 2023 in that we don't have a big storm, as well as mild weather to start off the year, which we obviously saw last year. To be clear, we still saw negative variance in terms of weather, top-line related weather, and so there's still some work to do. We are countermeasuring and, again, very confident in the outlook. It's a little early before we start thinking about de-risking 2025 and beyond.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Fair enough. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks so much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI was wondering what you're seeing in terms of maybe data center demand in the pipeline. Any uptick in further requests to connect beyond the big kind of megawatt addition that you called out? I am wondering if that customer class, I guess, would potentially be involved in the voluntary renewables plan. Any upside potential there?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks for your question, David. A couple of things on this. I typically don't like to talk about the pipeline just because it's pretty speculative on that. Many of these data center companies are testing the waters in a variety of different utilities. We typically talk in terms of contracts. When we talk about economic development, whether it's manufacturing or data centers, it's secure contracts, which we, again, feel really good about. Let me reflect a little bit on this project, and then I'll talk. I will highlight the pipeline. I will get to your answer. This particular project, this data center expansion that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is 230MW.\nOnline by 2025, majority of the load in place by 2026. That does speak to our ability and capabilities to be able to deliver for these customers. You see Michigan, and I said this in some of my remarks, temperate climate, which is great for the heating and cooling load of a data center. A lot of fresh water, and then energy-ready sites, attractive energy rates, good fiber network. All that comes together to make Michigan really attractive. I will say, within the state of Michigan, there is a sales and use tax that exists. There are roughly a dozen states that have this sales and use tax in place, about 6%.\nThere is an exemption process that's being—bills that are being considered in the House and Senate. It's passed the House in a bipartisan way. It's moved over to the Senate for consideration. We think that's going to move forward, that exemption, probably in the June to July timeframe at the end of this session before they go on summer break. That will open up Michigan a bit more for that pipeline. There are companies that are exploring Michigan right now, large data center providers, names that you would recognize. Again, a little bit, they're testing the water in a lot of different locations.\nWe'll see how Michigan progresses. We're certainly an attractive place to do business, and we'll look to attract that load growth appropriately. As I stated in my previous remarks, we want to make sure there's a good balance, that they're picking up the cost associated with that load as well, both from an energy and capacity perspective. That's all the things we're working to balance, David. Hopefully, that provides some light to your question. Let me know if I didn't strike the right balance there.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nIt does. That's helpful. Yeah. Are you thinking there could be upside to your long-term load growth expectations, or is it still early?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe have between the manufacturing load that's contracted and the data center load that's contracted. As Rejji said, it's a nice piece of low growth that we factored in not only the latter years of this five-year plan, but future five-year plans. We're excited about what that means, and there's a strong pipeline, both from a manufacturing perspective and, to a degree, the data center perspective as well. I'd be disappointed if some of those projects in the pipeline didn't materialize.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. That's helpful. On a separate topic, I was wondering your just latest expectations for the performance-based rates process in terms of timing and where that outcome might be headed.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThat's progressed in a constructive way. We had close to 10 or a dozen metrics that were originally proposed. That's narrowed to four metrics that are benchmarkable, and there's good standards. Again, that constructive process plays out. There's more work to do from our perspective, and we filed comments in the February/March timeframe. We're expecting a report from the Michigan Public Service Commission staff in May. We'll see the next round of thinking. I would suggest it's a couple of electric rate cases away, not this case, perhaps the next case before we see implementation. Again, this is an evolving process with the Public Service Commission.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Rejji Hayes.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, thank you, David.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe. Your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe\n\nHey, Garrick. Yeah. Just sticking with the data center conversation, it sounds like you're kind of optimistic on this legislation. If that does pass and start to bring more interest to the state, what do you think about the potential for DIG being used in its entirety as a behind-the-meter solution for a larger-type data center build-out? I know there's been a lot of focus on that on the nuclear side of things elsewhere, but people talking about gas as well. Just curious your thoughts there.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nSimilar to Rejji's comments, from an energy perspective, energy tools, and a capacity of the bilateral contracts, much of DIG has been spoken for at a really attractive position that either meets our expectations or is above our expectations. There is really, unless you're beyond 2028, maybe even the 2030s decade, DIG's really not available because it's already been secured, and with, again, attractive energy tools and bilateral contracts for capacity.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Makes sense. Just on your upcoming electric case filing here, just to set expectations, I know one of your peers in the state recently filed and got a pretty quick response from DIG. Are you anticipating something similar with yours? Should we just be prepped for that?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt is. We got primaries in August, and that means early absentee ballots start in June. It's political season already in Michigan. I would anticipate that. Look, the attorney general participates in all our cases. That's been a historical practice. Sometimes those are more public than other times. We stand, as I shared earlier, by the merits of the case, both in our gas case that's underway right now and this electric rate case. The team just went through a walk-through this week, and I couldn't be more proud of the work the team's putting together on it. As I shared earlier in my responses to questions, we're focused on reliability.\nThat's going to improve for our customers. That is absolutely the right thing to do, well aligned with the Public Service Commission. We're working hard to create affordability, and we're good at that through the CEWA, through reducing power supply costs, through unit costs, from execution of capital. When you get that mix right, that equation right, it makes it, you get good outcomes. I'm excited about this case. It's certainly going to be a step up in capital.\nThere's going to be some O&M work too. It's focused on reliability, but there's also some offsets that are really exciting that make us, get me excited, as you can tell by the tone of my voice, about what we're filing and what we're putting together because it's going to be good for customers, and it's going to be good for all stakeholders.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe\n\nAll right. Yeah, you sound pretty pumped. Sounds good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everybody.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey. Good morning, Andrew. How are you today?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nA couple of follow-ups on the rate cases here. Good. Thanks.\nYeah. Just a couple of follow-ups on the rate cases. First, I think you just alluded to this for the electric side. You're going to have more capital and more O&M. Just from a headline perspective, should we expect a larger revenue increase request than what we've seen in past filings in terms of percent increase to customer bills?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYes. The short answer is yes. Again, important work from a capital investment perspective on reliability, and we've done a lot to offset some of the O&M cost components of this to strike that right balance. That's what I mean by the important fundamentals or merits of the case.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Very good. Procedurally on the gas side, I know this case is unique in that there's no ALJ. Does that change the timeline at all or the potential for settlement? You talked a bit about settlement, but the lack of ALJ, does that factor in at all?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nNo. The team is excited about the opportunity to get to the table now that we have staff's position, now that we know where intervenors are at, to talk settlement. As I shared, we've been able to navigate that with success in the past with all intervenors, all stakeholders, and we'll look to do that. Also, hear my confidence in the merits of the case that if we need to go the full distance, we will. I know that will get a good outcome for our customers and for stakeholders.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nAll right, sounds good. Appreciate all the updates today.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, thank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll now hand back over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Drew. I’d like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nJust a reminder, there will be a brief broadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through February 8. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Srikanth Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\n\nSrikanth Maddipati\n\nVP of IR & Finance and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.\nAs some of you may know, this will be my last earnings call as I have transitioned to a new role in the company responsible for our electric supply and [indiscernible] a 25-year veteran in the CMS has been named Treasurer and VP of Investor Relations. As I hand over the baton, I'm confident in Jason and our very experienced Garrick. And now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get started, I want to thank Sri for his leadership in the finance area, and I look forward to his continued growth and impact as he takes on this important role in electric supply, where he'll lead critical filings like our renewable energy plan and Integrated Resource Plan, which I will discuss later in this call. We have a deep bench of talent at CMS Energy and it is critically important that we develop our leaders in key areas of the business, continuing to strengthen the bench, build dexterity and provide challenging growth opportunities. I know both Sri and Jason will make a big impact in their new roles. I've shared before on these calls, this isn't our first rodeo. The CMS team delivers now 21 years of exceptional performance. I am proud to share with you the highlights of the year, and I am proud of this team.\nYou will see the numbers and our operational highlights, 2023, what incredible year. We met and face challenges that tested our team, and we rose to the occasion. First, let's talk about the weather. The 2022, 2023 winter was in the top 10 warmest on record. And then there was summer, when much of the world saw warmer temperatures [ or ] summer influenced by El Nino conditions was cooler than normal. And then December 2023, the second warmest December on record, add to that record storm activity within our service territory. To say the least, it was a challenging year. Despite severe storms and unfavorable weather, we delivered and offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, serving our customers with heat and light and keeping our financial commitments for our investors.\nThis world-class team comes together, and we do what we say we will do year in and year out, no excuses, just results. As I said earlier, I'm proud of the team at CMS Energy. There are a number of great things we delivered in the year, even more than are represented on Slide 4.\nIn the interest of time, I want to hit on just a few. I want to highlight the Freedom Award from the Secretary of Defense and why this is so special. This is the highest recognition a company can receive for supporting their employees who serve in the Guard and Reserve. The nomination was submitted by one of our employees and demonstrates the commitment of our entire company. This is an important part of our culture to support and care for our people and to honor our coworkers who serve our customers and our country.\nWe continue our focus on leading the clean energy transformation. In 2023, we retired over 500 megawatts of coal, further reducing our carbon footprint. Alongside these retirements, we ensured resource adequacy with the acquisition of the 1.2 gigawatt covert, natural gas generating station and brought online our 201 megawatts of [indiscernible] wind farm. This thought will transition ensures customer reliability as we move our portfolio from coal to clean.\nI also want to give a shout out to our small but important North Star Clean Energy team. They performed well in 2023, exceeding our expectations for the year, completing the new Port Solar project and demonstrating strong operational performance at Dearborn Industrial Generation. DIG. Another solid year of execution at CMS Energy across the triple bottom line, delivering industry-leading, sustainable premium growth.\nIn 2023, Michigan also passed new energy legislation, starting the course for cleaner energy in Michigan, while maintaining resource adequacy, customer affordability and strengthening our financial plan. This legislation speaks to the constructive nature of Michigan, provides more incentives to grow our clean energy portfolio, furthering invest certainty of recovery.\nNow it's still early days. We're evaluating all aspects of the new law, including the strategic advantage of owning versus contracting supply, the increased incentive on PPAs. So what makes sense -- what makes the most sense for us and for our customers. The law provides a lot of flexibility and options, which is important. You'll see this play out in a couple of upcoming filings. I want to draw your attention to the renewable energy plan.\nThis is not a new filing but becomes a more important input in the Integrated Resource Plan. The renewable energy plan will detail our path to meet the 60% renewable portfolio standard by 2035. As you might imagine, this work is underway, we plan to file in the second half of the year. Following our renewable energy plan filing, our next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan is due in 2027. Together, the renewable energy plan and Integrated Resource Plan will align our supply resources to deliver cost competitive, cleaner and reliable energy as we target net 0.\nThey also provide important transparency and certainty as we advance the business forward with investments in renewables and clean energy. Michigan Energy Law continues to support its strong regulatory environment in needed customer investment. While the recent legislation provides opportunities while our updated renewable energy plan, regulatory calendar is fairly routine in 2024. Our electric case -- our electric rate case, excuse me, continues toward a constructive outcome.\nWe've seen positive indicators with key stakeholder support for recovery of customer investments, and important investment mechanisms such as the IRM and our undergrounding pilot.\nWe expect an order from the commission on or before March 1. We follow our gas rate case in mid-December with an ask of $136 million with a 10.25% ROE and a 51.5% equity ratio, request lines with needed investment outlined in our 10-year natural gas delivery plan. We expect an order for the end of the year.\nOn Slide 7, we've highlighted our new 5-year $17 billion utility customer investment plan, which supports approximately 7.5% rate base growth through 2028. You will note that about 40% of our customer investment opportunities to support renewable generation, grid modernization and main and service replacement on our gas business, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. The plan also includes an increased investment in the electric distribution system to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers.\nWe also have growth drivers outside of traditional rate mix. These include adders built into legislation for incentives, our energy efficiency programs and the financial compensation mechanism we earn on PPA that I mentioned earlier. We also expect incremental earnings provided by our nonutility business, North [indiscernible] Clean Energy as they see attractive pricing from capacity and energy sold at DIG. It's important to note we have a long and robust runway of additional investment opportunities, both within and beyond the 5-year window.\nAs an example, we've incorporated a little less than half of the incremental $3 billion of customer investment associated with our electric reliability road map. We've also not yet included the customer investments associated with the new energy law. These will be included in our renewable energy plan filing and will provide more opportunities for investment.\nI feel good about our 5-year utility investment plan. It is focused on our customers. It positions business for continued success in delivers for all stakeholders. With that, I'll conclude with the 2023 results and long-term outlook before passing it over to Rejji who will cover the financials in more detail. 2023, no excuses, no weather, storms, just results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 for the high end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2024 adjusted full year EPS guidance to $0.02 to $3.29 to $3.35 from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, compounding off of 2023 active results.\nLet me repeat, compounding off of actual, that is a differentiator in this sector. We continue to expect to be toward the high end of our 2024 guidance range, which points to our confidence as we start the year. Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase grew $2.06 per share for 2024. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies it includes 7%, up to 8%.\nOur dividend policy remains unchanged. We continue to grow the dividend. You'll see that we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of about 60% over time. Finally, we remain confident in our plan for 2024 and beyond, given our long-standing ability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, CMS Energy Corp.\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone.\nAs Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2023 with adjusted net income of $907 million, which translates to $3.11 per share towards the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our 2023 financial performance included strong cost performance throughout the organization, fueled by the CE Way, a solid beat at North Star and a variety of nonoperational countermeasures such as liability management and tax planning, which more than offset the significant weather-related headwinds experienced throughout the year. And to further underscore the magnitude of cost reforms delivered by our workforce, our fourth quarter operational operating and maintenance or O&M expense, exclusive of service restoration and vegetation management was approximately 25% below the comparable period in 2022 and over 20% below our 5-year average for this cost category, a truly impressive achievement.\nAll in, we managed to offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds without compromising our operational commitments to our customers and the communities we serve. At CMS, we've had plenty of years of adversity followed by impressive operational and financial feed. But I can't recall 1 quite like 2023, a year in which our workforce personified grid and displayed that perennial will to deliver for all stakeholders.\nTo elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2023. On Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $178 million in equity forward contracts in November and settled the remaining roughly $265 million in forwards in January. As a reminder, these forwards are priced at levels favorable to our planning assumptions. The only financial target missed in 2023 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $3.7 billion. We ended the year below that at $3.3 billion, primarily due to siting and permitting delays at select solar projects.\nAs mentioned in the past, we fully intend to build out all of the solar projects approved in our IRP and voluntary green pricing program. Within -- with the Michigan renewable energy siting reform bill passed last fall, we should see better progress here going forward. Moving to our 2024 EPS guidance.\nOn Slide 11, we are raising our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3.29 to $3.35 per share from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, as Garrick noted, with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility providing $3.74 to $3.80 of adjusted earnings, the details of which I'll cover on the next slide.\nAt North Star, we're semi EPS contribution of $0.16 to $0.18, which reflects strong underlying performance, primarily a big and ongoing contributions from our renewables business. Lastly, our financing assumptions remain conservative at the parent segment, and our 2024 guidance range assumes the absence of liability management transactions. As always, we'll remain opportunistic in this regard, and we'll look to capitalize on attractive market conditions that they arise. To elaborate on the glide path, which leave our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range, you'll see the usual waterfall part on Slide 12.\nFor clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are measured on a full year basis and are relative to 2023. From left to right, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.43 per share of positive year-over-year variance, given the absence of the typically mild temperatures experienced throughout 2023. Additionally, we anticipate $0.23 of EPS pickup attributable to great relief, driven by the residual benefits of last year's constructive gas rate case settlement and assumed support of outcomes in our pending electric and gas rate cases. As always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs which is depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense. As we turn to our cost structure in 2024, you'll note $0.16 per share of positive variance due to continued productivity driven by the CE Way, the ongoing benefit of cost reduction measures implemented in 2023, which is our voluntary separation plan, which reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10% and initiatives already underway. It is also worth noting that our cost assumptions exclude the impact of the catastrophic ice storm we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.\nLastly, in the [indiscernible] bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the reversal of select onetime cost reduction measures. These are partially offset by the ongoing benefit of our well-executed financing plan in 2023, and we're assuming the usual conservative assumptions around weather normalized sales, taxes and nonutility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.58 to $0.64 per share of negative variance. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risk and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors.\nOn Slide 13, we have a summary of our near- and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll focus my remarks on those metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. As previously mentioned, we have already settled the remaining equity forwards and have no additional equity needs in 2024. Longer term, we intend to resume our at-the-market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year beginning in 2025 and extending through 2028, which is essentially the same assumption in our previous 5-year plan, but for the extension of an additional year.\nWe're able to maintain our pre-existing equity needs despite an increased utility capital plan, given the expectation of strong operating cash flow generation and the ability to monetize tax credits courtesy of the Inflation Reduction Act. It is also worth noting that this morning's decision by Moody's to increase the equity credit ascribed to junior subordinated notes, which represents about 40% of our debt at the parent company is not embedded in our plan, thus providing further cushion in these metrics.\nSlide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2024, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, over half of which has been opportunistically issued as noted on the page. And the coupon rate on this [indiscernible] debt is favorable to plan, thus providing a helpful tailwind as we start the year. Over the coming year, we have no planned long-term financings at the parent and already redeemed its low maturity in January at par.\nLonger term, we have relatively modest near-term maturities at the parent with $250 million due in 2025 and $300 million due in 2026.\nOn Slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized. Our model has stirred and we'll continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse and battle tested workforce remains committed to our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance.\nBefore I hand it back to Garrick, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to echo Garrick craze of Sri. I've worked closely with over the past 7 years. Sri's contributions to the finance team and the company have been immeasurable since he joined CMS. So thank you, Sri, for leaving it better than you found it, and I look forward to working with you and Jason in your new roles. And with that, I'll pass it on to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Rejji. You all know this last slide very well by now. Over 2 decades, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. Given the challenges of 2023, I'm extremely proud of the team's efforts. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business. It has withstood the test of time and provides us confidence for a strong outlook in 2024 and beyond. With that, Emily, please open the lines for Q&A.",

The earnings news release issued earlier today, and the presentation used in this webcast, are available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, please press star followed by zero. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00PM Eastern Time, running through 2 November 2023. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. What sets us apart in this industry is clear, and it's been proven for over two decades: our simple, cleaner, and leaner investment thesis. We've talked about this in many calls and many investor meetings, and it works. A long and robust capital runway, a best-in-class ability to take cost out of the business, to create headroom for needed investments, and keep bills affordable for customers. Couple that with a constructive, top-tier regulatory environment, and that is our recipe for premium total shareholder return. Today, I want to highlight one part of our investment thesis: infrastructure renewal. It starts with our five-year, $15.5 billion\ncapital plan, which supports a long runway for important customer investment. This allows us to do what is most important for our customers: deliver safe, reliable, affordable energy, and lead the industry in the clean energy transformation. We are one of the first vertically integrated utilities to switch from coal to clean by 2025, leading the industry with net-zero carbon by 2040, aligned with customers, policymakers, and our strategic plan, positioning us for the future. In our gas business, we are on pace to net-zero methane by 2030, and with a 20% reduction in scope 3 emissions, one of the few in the industry, making the gas system safer and cleaner. In our electric distribution\nsystem, we are hardening the grid to make it more reliable today while preparing for the resiliency that will be required for EVs, connected devices, and to mitigate impacts of climate change. Our electric distribution system is vast, covering much of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, but it's aging, and we are seeing more frequent and severe weather, which proves the future will require something different because our customers count on us for reliable service. Last month, we filed our electric reliability roadmap with the Michigan Public Service Commission, which outlines our plan to improve reliability and prepare the system for greater resiliency. Over the last 20 years, we've\nseen an increase in both the frequency of storms and higher wind speeds, with some of the most extreme winds within the last four years. We're clearly seeing the effects of climate change. Given this, and the increasing dependency on the electric distribution system, we have set forward a plan that bolsters the system now and builds for the future. We worked with the leading industry research institute, EPRI, benchmarking companies, as well as advancing technology to build a robust and comprehensive plan. This five-year electric reliability roadmap calls for $7 billion of capital investment to harden the system, expand undergrounding, update infrastructure, increase\ncapacity, and advance automation. To give you a small snapshot, our plan includes roughly 1,000mi of system undergrounding in the near term. In the longer term, significantly more undergrounding to ensure our system is prepared to withstand severe weather. Originally, our design standard was for 40mi-per-hour wind. With wind speeds we are seeing today, our new standard is for 80mi-per-hour wind and 0.5in of ice loading. This plan also includes further automation in machine modeling, adding technology to more precisely locate and isolate damage, reroute power, and better predict problem areas, keeping more customers online, and responding to outages faster.\nWe've put our stake in the ground. We've identified the steps to improve reliability, a step change, and build an electric grid that can better withstand extreme weather and better serve our customers in the future. With commission support, this plan will reduce the frequency and duration of outages. While moving us into second quartile for reliability, coupled with additional customer investment, the longer-term vision delivers a grid where no outage will affect more than 100,000 customers, and no customer will be without power for more than 24 hours. We expect these investments to be part of our upcoming electric rate case filings and will be implemented upon\ncommission approval. Let me be clear, we are already making progress. We've doubled our investment in vegetation management over the last three years, shortening our trim cycles. We've seen greater than 60% benefit where we've done the work. We've increased the amount of customer investments and upgrades using and hardening, installing nearly 15,000 fuse devices in the last two years, more than we've ever done, reducing the number of customers impacted per interruption. We've increased our maintenance inspection frequency, finding potential failures before they occur. Just last week, we were notified that of the nearly 300 companies who applied for grants\nfrom the Department of Energy, we were one of seven companies who were awarded $100 million for sectionalizing and improving circuits in disadvantaged communities. This is great for our company and our customers. First, it accelerates investments, which were already part of our $7 billion electric reliability roadmap. Second, it strikes the important balance of reliability improvement and affordability. Finally, because these are matching grants, it provides greater line of sight and certainty for recovery of these needed customer investments. We take our commitment to serve seriously. What our customers deserve, what we wake up every day to deliver, it's why we constructed our\nelectric reliability roadmap. On slide five, I want to take a moment to provide an update on our regulatory calendar. In September, we revised our position in our electric rate case to $169 million and maintained our position for a 10.25% ROE and a 51.5% equity ratio. We're requesting approval of a 10mi undergrounding pilot with plans to underground over 400mi annually beginning in 2027, which aligns with our electric reliability roadmap. A small but important step in building out a program that can be supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission and will deliver significant improvement for our customers.\nWe also requested a recovery mechanism for investment in our electric distribution system to improve reliability, similar to the mechanism we've utilized in our gas business, which creates greater clarity on the investment and customer benefit, while improving certainty of recovery. We expect a final order by March of next year. We also recently received approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission on our gas rate case settlement, providing continued value for our customers and investors. These rates became effective 1 October. We plan to file our next gas rate case in December of this year. This case brings a continued focus on a safe, reliable, affordable,\nand clean natural gas system, while supporting needed customer investment. As we've shared in previous calls and in investor meetings, we continue to see the Michigan regulatory jurisdiction as constructive and providing a good balance for all stakeholders, living up to its ranking as top tier. Moving on to the financials, for the third quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 and $2.06 per share year-to-date. Rejji will provide additional details, but despite a significant storm in the third quarter, we remain on track to deliver on our full-year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share, and expect to deliver toward the high end. Given that confidence, we are initiating our full-year\nguidance for 2024 at $3.27 to $3.33 per share, reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range. We are well positioned, just like 2023, to be toward the high end of that range. It is also important to remember that we always rebase guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call, compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year, with continued confidence toward the high end, and remain committed to dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Like we've done in previous years, we'll provide you with an update on our 2024\nguidance based off of actuals, as well as a refresh of our five-year capital plan on the Q4 call. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver the year and in our longer-term outlook, providing exceptional value for all stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Rejji to offer some additional details.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a solid third quarter delivering adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share, driven by numerous cost reduction initiatives, which have largely offset the headwinds that we have faced throughout the year, most recently in the form of a severe storm that hit our electric service territory in August. To put the weather we have experienced in 2023 into perspective, we are approaching a record level of storm activity this year, which further supports the needed investments in our electric system that Garrick highlighted. We have seen heating and cooling degree days of 11% and 24% below historical levels, respectively, on a year-to-date basis.\nThat said, we do not make excuses and have implemented numerous countermeasures throughout the year to mitigate these risks and are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives this year for the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year, and on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with Adjusted EPS of $2.06 per share, given our progress on the aforementioned countermeasures, which I'll elaborate on shortly. In the waterfall chart on slide seven, for clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are measured relative to the comparable periods in 2022. The actuals are quantified on a year-to-date basis,\nand the prospective period reflects the final three months of the year. Starting with actuals with respect to weather, the previously noted unfavorable weather experienced in 2023 has driven $0.49 per share of negative variance. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, has resulted in $0.20 per share of positive variance driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our financial performance through the third quarter has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance, our O&M expenses to the tune of $0.21 per share of negative variance due to higher service restoration expenses attributable to\nstorms. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses exclusive of service restoration expense are down roughly 10% versus the third quarter of 2022, which highlights the significant cost performance we've realized across the business. To that end, as previously noted, we implemented numerous cost reduction initiatives earlier in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT projects, and eliminating other discretionary spending. We have also supplemented these efforts with a voluntary separation program, or VSP, that reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%. More importantly, as we leverage\nCEWA, our lean operating system, we will continue to eliminate waste and increase productivity going forward. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note the $0.27 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. We've seen this bar increase throughout the year as a result of our continued success in realizing cost savings through financing efficiencies, liability management, strong tax planning, and favorable non-weather sales in our electric business during the summer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, as always, we plan for normal weather, which we expect will have a neutral impact on our financial\nperformance versus the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect a similar financial impact for rate relief, net of investment-related costs, as the benefits of our recent gas rate case settlement and our 2022 electric rate case settlement are largely offset by the absence of tax benefits associated with a prior gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, as noted during our Q2 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility, driven by the ongoing benefits of said cost reduction initiatives, which equates to $0.17 per share of positive variance. It is also worth noting that the Q4 2022 comp for this bucket is notably soft, given the higher-than-average O&M expenses\nincurred during that period. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, you'll note in the penultimate catch-all bar on the right that we're anticipating $0.23 to 0.29 per share of positive variance. As we've discussed previously, the key drivers here are the absence of significant discretionary actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to last year's electric rate case settlement and the filing of our voluntary refund mechanism, which collectively equate to $0.12 per share. The remaining notable items that we anticipate in this bucket are from Norstar, our non-utility business, achieving its full-year guidance, and favorable non-weather sales at the utility, which have\ntrended well over the past two quarters. All in, we remain confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance for the year, and as always, we'll take none of this positive momentum for granted, and will approach these last two months of the year with the usual degree of paranoia by maintaining our cost discipline and flex additional opportunities as needed to deliver the consistent financial results you have come to expect. Moving on to the balance sheet, on slide eight, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens EPICO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade\ncredit ratings. Our financing strategy and strong balance sheet position as well, given the market volatility we've seen recently. At the utility, our annual rate case cadence and the use of forward-looking test years allow us to incorporate higher interest rates into our filings and recover the associated costs with minimal lag. At the parent, where funding costs are non-recoverable, we have limited refinancing risk in the near term with $250 million due in 2024 and 2025, and $300 million coming due in 2026. As noted during our second quarter call, the 2024 maturity has already been pre-funded with proceeds from our convertible debt issuance in May. It is also worth noting that\n100% of the debt at the parent company is fixed, and over 40% is hybrid in nature, thus receiving equity credit from the rating agency. In addition to strong liability management, we have continued to plan conservatively. Though debt funding costs have increased in the current environment, they remain consistent with the assumptions embedded in our long-term financial plan. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which, coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation, supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of our customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan, slide nine\noffers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023. In short, I'm pleased to report that our financing plan for the year is largely completed. In fact, at the utility, we've completed all of our planned first mortgage bond issuances for the year at a weighted average coupon of approximately 4.8%, which is below our planned estimate. The only remaining opco financing is a securitization funding to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base at our recently retired Karn Coal facilities. As for the parent company, given the timing of the aforementioned convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards at\nprice last year. The roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled in the fourth quarter. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively, and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of customers and investors. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Rejji. You hear us say it every year. We deliver. Our track record spans two decades of consistently delivering industry-leading results in all conditions for all stakeholders. This year will be no different. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing star followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using speaker function, please make sure you pick up your handset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone. We'll pause just for a second. Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy, your line is open.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, Jeremy. How are you?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning. Good, good. Thanks. I just wanted to start with the electric rate case if I could here. Thank you for the color that you provided, but I wonder if we could dig in a little bit more on how recent conversations have been tracking in the case. Could you walk us through the core differences between SAS recommendation and your proposal? What items should we be looking for? More specifically, is settlement possible when tracking mechanisms are disputed? Is a fully litigated case preferable in this area so there's no kind of gray areas?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGreat question, Jeremy. I feel good. I feel good about the progress of our electric rate case. Just to give you a little flavor on where we're at with that, in rebuttal, we came back at $169 million. As I shared in my prepared remarks, 10.25% ROE and 51.5% equity ratio. That reflects just the differences in the business from when we built the case to where we're at now in the forward-looking test year. Staff's at $88 million. The gap's pretty small between our ask and where the staff is, which, again, I see as very constructive. We're really at a constructive starting point in the conversation. Much of that delta is made up with just really the cost of capital, ROE, and equity ratio. That's a big\npiece of the difference. There's a few other what I call cats and dogs, important cats and dogs nonetheless, but things that are helpful for our customers. That's the big difference. Now, let's talk a little bit about settlement in the context of settlement. I've certainly been on a number of these calls where I'm open to settlement. If settlement presents itself, that's great, and we're certainly receptive to that. As you pointed out, there's an important mechanism in there, and there's undergrounding. Those are two key things that we need to see come out of this case: investment recovery mechanism to have some certainty on our electric distribution investments, and this\nunderground pilot. This is important to get this started, and there's a real benefit for our customers. Those are harder to get in settlement. Just to be fully transparent, typically they're a black box when you go through settlement. We're prepared to go the full distance. I'll just be honest with the entire call, it's likely we're going to go the full distance. I have confidence that we can get a really constructive outcome going to the full order.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful there. Maybe pivoting a bit, could you walk us through your longer-term expectations for DEG, particularly as it relates to recontracting here? Could you speak to the longer-term potential for this business, and for non-regulated renewables growth in the future as well, given the changing landscape?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. Our non-utility growth continues to be small in the bigger scheme of things. Our primary business continues to be the utility space. It's about a 95/5 mix. As shared in the prepared remarks, we expect them to be within guidance range, and that's a good piece. It continues to be contracted renewables. Again, Rejji uses these words, singles and doubles. We're not swinging for the fences here, just thoughtful contracted renewables that have a utility-like return, long-term contracts, assuming no terminal value. Again, really conservative, almost utility-like. Then there's Dearborn Industrial Generation, or DEG. We continue to see upward pressure on energy and capacity prices,\nand we're fully contracted out to 2025 with energy and capacity. We're filling in 26, 27, and the out years. We plan conservatively, but those bilaterals and the contracts that we are inking are certainly better than expectations. Now, don't read into that a sugar high. You've heard me say no sugar highs in the past. You can anticipate 6% to 8% growth on this, again, expectation toward the high side of that growth. We'll continue to reinvest as needed versus the sugar high. Hopefully that's helpful as we see Norstar.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Understood. No sugar highs, but certainly helpful towards the upper end of the range there. Thank you for the color. We'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Julian Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien, your line is open.\n\nJulian Smith\n\nSoftware Engineer, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, team. How you guys doing?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, Julian.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nMorning, Julian.\n\nJulian Smith\n\nSoftware Engineer, Bank of America\n\nCongratulations on the announcement there.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey.\n\nJulian Smith\n\nSoftware Engineer, Bank of America\n\nGood work of your team.\nHey, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Hey, look, I'm just following up on the speaking of the good work, the distribution plan, right, the $7 billion that you guys talked about there. Can you elaborate just if you think that that's really kind of incremental versus your prior plan? It seems like that's probably kind of a net $1 billion increase over five years. Can you talk about is that incremental or as you talk about sugar highs, is that going to offset capital elsewhere, if you will, to smooth things out? Just curious on how you think about that fitting into the grander plan as you update that more holistically.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI'm really excited about this plan. We've talked about and we've seen the storms this year. Certainly, we have an opportunity to improve reliability in the here and now, and then prepare for an aging system, a system that's seeing higher winds and more severe weather, and preparing for the future. The team has really done a nice job of putting a good plan together. Now, when I look out at the five years, it's more than an incremental $1 billion. It's an incremental $3 billion, right? What's in the plan right now is $4 billion in our five-year plan. I want to be really careful and really clear about this. When we get to the Q4 call, we're going to grow our capital. You can expect we're going to grow our capital.\nYou can expect with these needs on the distribution system that it's going to be biased, or it's going to be more growth on the electric distribution system. That $4 billion number should grow. That's what I would anticipate and expect. However, I wouldn't just do the simple math of taking 15.5 and adding $3 billion to it. That would get you the wrong answer, the wrong number. It's important that we get commission support. As we go through the steps, we'll get that in the electric rate case filing, and we'll weave that into that capital plan over time. It should give you a picture of the strength of our five-year plan. It is robust. There are plenty of opportunities out there, and that extends even beyond 10 years into a really nice long capital runway. Helpful, Julian?\n\nJulian Smith\n\nSoftware Engineer, Bank of America\n\nOh, absolutely. Thank you for giving a little bit of context there. In fact, speaking of context, capacity markets writ large have attracted a decent amount of attention of late, and certainly some of the inflationary dynamics around them. Can you speak a little bit to the status of DEG, both your contracting status through the long term and, more importantly, how you think about your commercial strategy here with pricing as elevated as it seems to be getting in some of these markets? Just curious on what you guys are seeing and what the opportunity is and how that fits into the plan.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. Similar to my previous answer here on this, at Dearborn Industrial Generation, we take a very conservative, utility-like approach. As you know, over time, we've just stacked in contracts for energy and capacity, bilateral contracts to make sure that we are avoiding risk and market volatility. We certainly see some upward pressure on both energy and capacity prices, as you noted. Much of the energy and capacity's already contracted and already in place through 2025. We're filling in the gaps of 2026, 2027, and out years. We plan conservatively, and those contracts are, I would say, exceeding our expectations or exceeding our plan, which is great. We'll continue to\noperate just as we have historically, in a really conservative mode and a conservative plan. You can see we're layering in the future right now and feel good about the opportunities for growth at DEG.\n\nJulian Smith\n\nSoftware Engineer, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Just quickly, if you don't mind, the status of the solar projects, just where that stands in the schedule for bringing those into rates. Sorry, just to clarify that. I just wanted to hit that as a last quick one.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. We feel good about our renewable build. In this electric rate case, we pulled out some of the renewable build. I'll be honest with you, 25 years in this business, been in engineering and operations much of my career, there's projects and contracts that move between years. That's not a big deal. Much of our build this year is in wind. We're going to be COD here end of the year at our Heartland wind farm. We're building another 201MW of wind. There's a lot of renewable build that's underway in these years. Those projects that we're referencing in the electric rate case were some of the ones that early got caught up in some of the Auxon Solar complaint-related issues. We've talked\nabout that. That's been hashed through in this industry. I feel good about the projects we have in mid-development right now. We got line of sight into panels. We got good siting pieces, and that'll play out as part of our IRP build. The other thing is these build projects don't go away. Remember that. These are part of the IRP, and they'll get constructed here. It's just a matter of timing. That timing's being refined here. I think at least one of them is going to go this year anyways. We're going to see some construction there. Remember, because they're approved in the IRP, they get AFUDC along the way, so there's no earnings impact. Make sense?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst and Managing Director, JPMorgan\n\nTotally awesome. Good luck, guys. Thank you so much. We'll see you soon.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Shariyah Pourreza of Guggenheim. Shariyah, your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGood morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGood morning.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nGood morning. Just as we reflect on your kind of prior guidance for $350 million of equity starting in 2025, does kind of that increased CapEx plan move your equity needs proportionally higher?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nShar, this is Rejji. Yeah, we're still in the relatively early stages of building out.\nShar.\nSorry, Shar? Shar, this is Rejji.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nYep, I'm here.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nIf you can hear me. Yeah. We're in the early stages of rolling out our five-year plan. We're still calibrating what the financing needs will be. As I've said before, the estimate that we have in our current five-year plan will reset up to $350 million a year of equity starting in 2025. I don't see that number materially changing. As the CapEx plan increases, we always recalibrate. You may see a slight shift upward, but we have to take a look at all of the puts and takes, the capital investments, the cash flow generation. I think at the end of the day, you're not going to see us with any sort of need to do block equity. I still think even without seeing the numbers, we'll be able to dribble out the\nequity those outer years. Still early days on those calculations.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nOkay. Perfect. Just from a stakeholder perspective, where is the MPSC going with sort of their investigations into storms at this point? I guess what's the range of outcomes you guys anticipate? I mean, we've seen some comments filed, but there seems to be a negatively skewed mechanism for penalties versus rewards.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThere are two pieces. I wouldn't put a negative take on it. All the conversations we have with staff and commissioners continue to be constructive. Frankly, we're both aligned on the same thing. We want to improve reliability. We have a longer-term view of resiliency. When we're aligned, it makes for constructive conversations. There are two pieces that I'm hearing in your questions, Shar. One is the audit that's underway. That was started in September. Liberty Consulting Group is the one doing the work. They've participated with other utilities, very skilled organizations. Right now, they're in the data collection phase. That's well underway. We expect an interim report\nabout the end of the year, and then a full report likely in the September-ish timeframe. It's been about a year report then. I'll just be fully transparent with you and honest. I want reliability to improve in the state. I want resiliency to improve in the state for our customers. If they have findings on how we can do work better, my gosh, I'm just going to agree to them. We should build that into the electric rate case. We should do that because we want it better for our customers. It doesn't bother me at all. I think this is good that we have an outside party looking and looking at how we can improve. It's only going to add to our reliability roadmap. The other thing is on this performance-based rates\nor PBR, the work group's underway. It was initiated in the first, second quarter timeframe, April-ish timeframe, I believe. That conversation is underway. A straw proposal was put out. We have put comments through that process. We're continuing to participate in work groups. At the end of the day, I think you're going to have a nice balance of incentives, disincentives from an electric reliability perspective. The important piece for us is making sure there's a nice line of sight into capital, the capital recovery, and their certainty. That's why we're so focused on this investment recovery mechanism. We also think the same thing is required for storm and some of the O&M expense that occurs\nin the year. As long as we can navigate all that and get to that point, I feel good. I feel good this will lead to good outcomes for our customers.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nGot it. Perfect. Thanks, Garrick. Appreciate it. Thanks, Rejji.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Andrew, your line is open.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everybody.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHi, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nMorning. My first question is about supply chains. I know solar has been in focus as you just alluded to that a moment ago, how about the availability of grid-level equipment like transformers or switch gears? If you do see shortages, is there a risk that might slow down your planned pace of spending?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWell, first of all, I appreciate your analysis. You did a nice write-up on that. It was about a week ago, two weeks ago. Some good work of what's going on in the industry. We're highly, highly focused on the supply chain. I'll give it over here to Rejji in a minute. He has responsibility for that area. They've done a lot of good work to be able to secure and have line of sight. When I think about the projects we have underway, particularly those that are in mid-development, the team's done a much better job to make sure we have panels, transformers, and the likes so we can do that build. Now, there's longer lead times, most definitely. You've got to be prepared, and you've got to be planned in that. The\nteam's just done a phenomenal job.Rejji, your team's doing great work. Maybe add to it.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Garrick. Appreciate the question, Andrew. Garrick's exactly right. We have really been attacking challenges in the supply chain for the last 18 months or so. What we've done to really make sure that we've got sufficient supply, not just on the solar side, but really across the business, is we've been very focused on diversifying our vendor sources. That has been a very concerted effort. Again, over the last 12 to 18 months, we've also done what we would describe as value engineering and looking at other alternatives, particularly in the context of transformers that could be compatible with our electric grid. We historically used a standard of grain-oriented steel.\nWe're now using amorphous core and introducing that into our system. We've also been very successful in refurbishing damaged transformers and using a variety of third parties to help us with that.All of those countermeasures have really led to us getting to a sufficient level of supply across our most highly used transformers. Now, there's still issues in the supply chain across a variety of materials, and we're spending a lot of time on hypercare. For those highest velocity materials, we feel like we're in really good shape at this point. Really appreciate the question.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI just got to note something. Just Rejji's dexterity. Great CFO. When you can talk about amorphous core, that's really awesome to see.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOne other question for the team here. Can you give us any updates on the legislative environment in Michigan? I'm talking about the fact that Democrats have full control. Is there any talk of potential updates, either big change to the 2016 law or maybe more likely incremental, marginal support for clean energy? Are you hearing any potential around that?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI'll start with the big picture. In the governor's first term, she came out with her healthy climate plan. That was a nice plan, supportive of the plan, very pragmatic, and balanced with clean energy, reliability of supply, and affordability. The governor came out in August and said now in her second term she wants to make a portion of this into law. That's been in the Senate right now. It started out in committee. There were a number of bills that were put together on that. As you imagine, in committee, there's a discussion, and we're actively engaged in that discussion. That's moved on now to the full Senate for consideration. It still has not made it to the House. There's important work going\non to define what that looks like.I'll just, again, stand back and look at the bigger picture of this. Much like 2008, much like 2016, this legislative body, as well as the Public Service Commission, continues to provide a constructive approach to the future. We see a constructive out of these bills, if they even move forward, if they even get agreement. We see a pass of constructive regulation going forward, and a constructive policy going forward. That's currently where it stands, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Well, stay tuned. Thank you very much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYep, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Durgesh, please go ahead.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nMorning, Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, team. Good morning, Garrick. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few questions. You've already answered them. Maybe just on the O&M savings, obviously, you've done a great job here offsetting weather and storms. That's a big number, like $0.60, $0.70 year-to-date combined impact from weather and storms. Is there a way for you to quantify for us what these O&M savings that you're using, that you're offsetting weather and storms with this year, how much of that can be carried forward to 2024 and beyond? I'm just looking for what level of these savings is sustainable, or are these truly one-time in nature?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. Durgesh, this is Rejji. Appreciate the question, and I appreciate also the compliments. We are really proud of the work done for the first three quarters of the year, offsetting the headwinds we've seen on the weather side, both in terms of mild weather as well as the storm activity. The organization has really rallied around the cause. Obviously, when it comes to cost savings, we never discriminate when it comes to operational versus non-operational, and we've been quite expansive in our approach. To get to the spirit of your question, I think it's difficult to quantify to what degree the savings will be sustainable. I do think a decent portion will be because when you think about the\nseparation plan that I mentioned, we reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%. We do not assume that we will go and restaff that over the next year or two or even next several years. We'll see sustainable savings from that, and that'll be a significant portion. Some of the other bigger opportunities, in Q2, the tender financing, obviously, that is a one-timer. We wouldn't count on that being sustained. There are other opportunities we've executed on. We've been really disciplined in rationalizing our contractor base and some of the consultants we're working with. Again, we'd like to think we can sustain that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we accelerated some longer-term IT\nprojects, and we think we'll see productivity from those actions for some time now. I'd say it's tough to really ascribe a specific percentage to it, but I'd say a decent portion should be sustained going into next year, and we'll provide some tailwinds when you think about not just our guidance next year, but also affordability, because we always look forward to passing on those savings to the customers. The last thing I'll note is on the financing side, we've seen quite a few efficiencies with the convert where we pulled ahead some costs that we were going to have or some financing needs we had in 2024. That's going to have a sustained level of savings. The operating company\nfinancings, we've done those in really efficient fashion at a weighted average coupon of 4.8% below plan, so we'll see sustained savings from that. I'd say on the operational and non-operational side, you've got some one-timers and then some that'll be sustained, but I can't give you a specific percentage at this point.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's very helpful, Rejji. I appreciate it. Maybe one quick clarification on the financing plan. I'm not trying to jump the gun here, but you mentioned you're going to update us on the Q4 call. For 2024, next year, still no equity. That's still accurate, correct?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThat's exactly right.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director of Power and Utilities, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHi, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You alluded to this in the last question, but maybe just directly on, as you're looking to 2024, what's your comfort level? You've pulled a lot of cost levers for this year. To the extent there are any incremental challenges into 2024, do you still feel like you're setting up with the same kind of quantum of flexibility around cost structure and the overall expense structure as you look toward hitting your guidance next year?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, David, appreciate the question. This is Rejji. As you think about the glide path to deliver on the guidance we initiated today, we're guiding $3.06 to 3.12 in 2023 and then $3.27 to 3.33 in 2024. That implies somewhere around $0.20 of pickup year-over-year to get to midpoint to midpoint or thereabouts. As I think about it, obviously, the weather we had this year, we're looking at roughly $0.30 of weather hurt. That's just the mild weather experienced over the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate basically being flat in the fourth quarter. You have to imagine that because we plan for normal weather, we shouldn't anticipate that $0.30 of weather impacting us next year.\nNow, the reality is there have been some one-timers, as I've mentioned in my prior remarks on the sort of tender financing side. We'd have to assume that those don't recur as well. When you net the two of those out, you get about $0.10 of pickup. If you think about the pending rate case we have, we had a very constructive gas rate case settlement in the third quarter of this year that was approved by the commission. We've got a pending electric rate case, and we'll file another gas rate case in December of this year. With the anticipation of constructive outcomes on those proceedings, that offers about, per preliminary estimates, maybe somewhere between $0.10 to 0.15 net of\ninvestment-related costs of pickup. A lot of the cost savings I enumerated earlier, we expect a decent portion of those to be sustained, so we'll get additional pickup there. You can get to a glide path of that $0.20 per share, again, for that year-over-year growth relatively easily when you look at those pieces. There are always puts and takes. There are some things that will roll off going into 2024. I think what's highly debatable is will we see the same quantum of service restoration expense going into next year, because clearly we've had a record level of storm activity, as I noted in my prepared remarks. As we think about the glide path, it's going to be a combination of rate\nrelief, net of investment-related costs with our pending proceedings. We'll see the weather roll off. We'll see some of the one-timers roll off. We expect some of the savings from a lot of the cost reduction initiatives to provide a tailwind on a net basis next year as well. That's what gives us confidence that we can deliver on the 2024 guide. Is that helpful?\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, very helpful. Appreciate all the color, all good points. Let's see. We're also just going to check on, could you just give the latest update in terms of what you're seeing with the voluntary green pricing program, potential upside from that program, and just expectations for how customer additions could trend from here?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, it continues to be very positive. Remember, we're in what I'd call a tranche of 1,000MW that is being contracted out. There's significant demand from our customers for those products. We're well over 400MW of contracted load, and that continues to grow. That's driving to more build from a renewable perspective. We've announced, even within the quarter, the intent to build a solar facility on the Carnewetok, a coal facility that will help meet some of that portion of that need. Again, very robust, continued strong interest from our commercial and industrial customers.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Nicholas Campanella of Barclays. Nicholas, please go ahead.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question, everyone. Just one for me. A lot of them have been answered, I guess just looking at the resiliency plan, you kind of start to show the SAIDI score is improving 2025, 2026. I was just trying to dig in more on how you're thinking about operational risk reduction for 2024, just given lessons learned from last year's storm cycle. I assume you're probably actively deploying some of this technology now. Just how should we kind of think about storm risk 2024 versus this year? Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation",
    "content2": "Great question. I'm glad you're digging into it. That's a fun plan to look at. Right now, that's why I shared in some of my prepared remarks, we're not waiting. The commission has been supportive of additional tree removal or vegetation management. That's more than doubled our spend over the last three years. That's active work that's underway. There's close to 300 crews that are on our system, contracted crews that are out doing that work today and have been over the course of the year. In those areas where we do the work, we see greater than a 60% improvement, well underway. In addition to that, fusing, 15,000 fuses over the last two years in a plan to do more\nnext year as well. That takes, when there's an interruption on the system, it's like your fuse box in your home. Rather than the whole home going out, you might lose the bathroom or the kitchen. Same type of thing on the electric. We're fusing that, so when there's an interruption, fewer customers are impacted. We're seeing SAIDI performance improvement already from the deployment of those fuses. We've never done this level of fusing, never across our history. We continue to add automation. I just saw a great one the other day. One of the things on our high-voltage distribution system, we've got what's called a Victor insulator. Now, Victor insulators are prone to failure. That's a\nknown problem, but once you put them on the grid back in the 1970s, we didn't have the best kind of control on where those went. To be able to identify them, you got to be able to see the small little V on top of the victor insulator. Before, we'd have to stick a bucket truck up there to see that. That's very inefficient. Now, with drones, with the ability to automatically pull from a picture to see that little V, we're able to find those victor insulators and be very strategic about replacing those. I'm excited about the technology we're bringing to there as well. Those are just a few examples. There are hundreds of examples. We are not satisfied with our reliability performance. We are going\nto make it better. We've seen the improvement over 2022. We continue to be on a good pace this year, even with the storms. We're going to keep the—sorry, with the analogy here. We're going to keep the foot down on the floor, on the accelerator on this.\n\nNicholas Campanella\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nAll right, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nTravis.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHi, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nHi. On the distribution plan, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you expect the timing of the regulatory review on that to be.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWell, it's going to be—those will get woven into electric rate case filings. The plan by itself will get some comment, but that's not a contested filing. What'll happen is that'll be—it's truly a roadmap. It's truly a vision of where we're headed, and the important pieces that have to come together for that. Those get brought into electric rate case filings, and then with commission support, they can be approved. I would just highlight one thing, one announcement we've had here in the last couple of weeks, though, a Department of Energy grant of $100 million. That really jump-starts some of this important work. Again, to the previous question, we're not waiting around. We see some opportunities to put this to work immediately. Again, the regulatory process is through the rate cases.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. That suggests you'd probably continue that annual-type run rate of electric rate cases and even potentially gas rate cases, especially the electric. Is that roughly correct?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYes, you should expect an annual rate case-type filing. I would just offer, too, in these, particularly with the interest rates the way they are, 10-month rate cases and forward-looking test years and kind of the annual strategy really eliminates some of that drag that you get with higher interest rates. There are a lot of benefits of that approach.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Just real quick, would the investment recovery mechanism change that timing at all, or even if you get that, still kind of a one-year type of rate?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nIt'll still be a one-year approach. The IRM is not big enough at this point. It's a starting spot. Over time, we'd look to enhance that. The first step is to get it in place, which is part of this current electric rate case.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nYep. Okay. Very good. That is all I had. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYep. Thank you, Travis.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Sophie Karp. Sophie, please go ahead.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHi, Sophie.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A lot of questions have been answered, but I wanted to ask you about the cost of capital and the ROEs, right? It's a little bit of a push-pull in Michigan as in many other states right now. I'm just kind of curious how the conversations about the need for higher ROEs are landing with the stakeholders at the commission. I'm not sure if people are catching on to how fast the rates have risen, and that really needs to—you're going to have some adjustment to how the ROEs were viewed, I guess, in the last few years. Any color on that would be helpful.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, Sophie, it's Rejji. Appreciate the question. Let me just start by saying we're certainly making the case and have made the case really for the last few years around the need to have higher ROEs just given the changing cost of capital environment. I think treasuries are probably a couple hundred basis points higher than where they were when we first had 9.9% established as the prevailing ROE across our electric and gas businesses, and DTE's at parity as well. We're certainly making the case, and I think the case becomes stronger and stronger every day as we see continued hawkish monetary policy. If to give you any confidence, I think we feel very good about the fact that\nthere's a good floor at the 9.9% prevailing ROE, but we're going to continue to make the case that it should be higher. As Garrick noted, we're seeking 10.25% in our pending electric case. I think the data support that point of view. We try to make the case in addition to all the different ways in which you can calculate the cost of equity. The fact is that we compete for capital against other utilities and other jurisdictions. Given the quantum of capital that we have, not just in our current five-year plan, but in what we anticipate being our next and subsequent five-year plans, we do think we need to be as competitive as possible on all fronts because you can take your dollars elsewhere as\ninvestors. We've been making the case loudly and clearly. I think DTE has as well. Hopefully, we can start to see a change in the wind here with respect to ROEs.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGot it. Thank you. Maybe if I can squeeze one more in, you've been doing your undergrounding pilots, and I'm just curious, what have you learned so far from this pilot project, maybe in terms of cost or approach that needs to be taken? Curious if you can provide any color on how that is going.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWell, just a point of clarification. What's introduced in the electric case is a pilot, a pilot of 10mi, and as I shared, small but important so that the Public Service Commission has the opportunity to evaluate. Now, we do do undergrounding already. We do it in the context of subdivisions and the like. We have done a couple of trial runs. What we've seen is very cost-effective. Because of our gas business, directional drilling underground is one of our specialties. We certainly have the equipment and the expertise to do that. We are able to be very competitive from an undergrounding perspective. Our plan stays out of congested areas, stays out of three-phase construction. We\nare talking single-phase, more rural construction where you have the right soil conditions. We do over much of Michigan, which helps from a cost perspective. We've shared historically, or not historically, more current, I guess, in that $350,000 a mile is, we think, very achievable.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nAll right, thank you so much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today is from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Anthony, your line is open.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, hey. All my questions have been answered. Thanks so much. I'm good.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGood to hear from you, Anthony.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Now, our next question is from the line of Ross Fowler of UBS. Ross, your line is now open.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nManaging Director and Head of North America Power and Utilities Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, Garrick. Hey, Rejji. How are you?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nMorning, Ross.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, Ross. How are you?\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nManaging Director and Head of North America Power and Utilities Equity Research, UBS\n\nMorning. Let's take it to the full hour. Why not? Garrick, you're allowed as many auto analogies as you'd like in the answer to this question. I just wanted to get an update on the estimated bills meter installation issue given the commission filed that show cause a couple of days ago. I know, Rejji, we kind of talked about this back when I saw you in August, but just an update there. The second part of the question is, do you think that has any sort of lateral impacts on the rate case proceeding? From your perspective, is the commission really looking at these as two separate filings and issues?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI don't know if I have any auto analogies for this one. We talked about this in great detail, and I provided probably a long answer, maybe too long an answer on the Q2 call. I'll try to be brief, but this is just the next step in that. What I shared back, again, briefly, what I shared in Q2 was, recall that we had some 3G meters that were no longer supported. Our vendor could not meet some of the supply chain needs, again, considered a carryover from the pandemic, and did not meet some of the required reads out in the field. That created some billing issues for our customers. That's a problem. The Public Service Commission clearly identified that. We shared in our Q2 call that\nthat issue is behind us.We filed a report in August, and this is the next step to reach resolution. It's an important step. It gets us to the final end of this with the commission. I don't see any spillover impact into the electric rate case or in any other filings.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nManaging Director and Head of North America Power and Utilities Equity Research, UBS\n\nAll right, thank you very much.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYep. Thank you, Ross.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have no further questions in the Q today, so I'd like to hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any final remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Harry. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you at EEI. Please take care and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation."

Your conference call will begin momentarily. Your patience is appreciated. My apologies, please do not disconnect your lines. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CMS Energy's 2023 Second Quarter Results Conference Call and News Earnings Release. The earnings news release was issued earlier today, and the presentation used in this webcast is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.\nToday's call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be provided at that time on how to queue up. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, please press star zero. As a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00PM Eastern Time, running through 3 August.\nThis presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nVP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We apologize for the delay as we're experiencing technical difficulties. If you have any questions and we're unable to participate on the call, please feel free to give me or Travis and our colleagues a call after this earnings call. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, we deliver. We say it, and we back it up. What makes it work for all stakeholders is this investment thesis that we start with in nearly every earnings call. I've reiterated the key points of this thesis on many occasions. Today, I want to draw attention to three key components. First, we continue to make industry-leading progress on the transformation to clean energy. This is required to position the business for the future, and I will share more evidence of our good work this quarter with the exit of our coal units at our current facility and the acquisition of the Covert Generating Plant.\nNext, Michigan continues to be a solid place for investment.\nOur energy legislation is one of the best in the country, and we operate in a top-tier regulatory environment, providing important certainty for critical customer investments, and there continues to be evidence to support it. I'll share the details on our fourth consecutive settlement in our recent gas rate case. Finally, you'll hear from me on the strong progress we've made in cost management, the CE Way, and other countermeasures to offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I'm pleased with the progress and remain confident in our plan to deliver 2023 and beyond.\nOur investment thesis is simple. It's worked for more than 20 years, regardless of conditions, to deliver the operational and financial results across the triple bottom line for all our stakeholders. At CMS Energy, we like to say, \"Leaders lead,\" and we are leading the clean energy transformation. We've set industry-leading ambitious net-zero targets for both our gas and electric systems, and we continue to get it done. Our actions today serve as proof points that we can and we will achieve our targets.\nIn June, we retired our Karn units one and two, removing 515 MW of coal generation from Michigan, further reducing our carbon profile. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the service of the individuals at Karn who dedicated their careers to providing energy for our customers. I had the opportunity to be there in the final days of the facility's operations, and I'm proud to share the pride our coworkers have for their work. I'm also proud of the work we have done to provide a just transition, either to retirement or a new place within our company for those who served at this facility.\nAs we transition out of coal, it is imperative that we maintain reliability for our customers and our state. In June, we assumed ownership and operations of the Covert Generating Plant. This existing 1.2 GW facility maintains important, low-cost, reliable electric supply in Michigan and further bolsters the MISO footprint. I'm proud to share our industry-leading commitments are being noticed, and we are now included in the MSCI ESG Leaders Index, the only vertically integrated utility to be included in this index.\nThese are proof points, evidence in our leadership of this important transformation across the industry and will help us attract incremental capital to CMS Energy to bolster our customer investments.\nAdding to the good work of the quarter, we signed more contracts in our voluntary green pricing program, which has now grown to 341 MW of own generation, and I see further growth on the near horizon. We received approval for nearly $11 million in grants for R&G facilities to support farms we partner with as we decarbonize our gas system.\nAnd we expect our 201 MW Heartland Wind Farm, which qualifies for a 10.7% ROE, will be operational later this year. Well, these are just a few highlights. They demonstrate what we do at CMS Energy. We set big goals. We get after it every day, and we deliver, leading the clean energy transformation.\nTurning to slide five, I want to take a moment to talk about the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan.\nRecently, the governor reappointed Chair Scripps to a full term ending in 2029 and appointed Alessandra Carreon to fill the remainder of Commissioner Tremaine Phillips' term, which ends in 2025. The appointment of Commissioner Carreon and continuity in leadership through the reappointment of Chair Scripps further reflect the constructive and stable nature of the Michigan regulatory environment, which remains one of the best jurisdictions in the country. We've connected with Commissioner Carreon, and she has a strong background in decarbonization and transportation electrification and is well-suited for the role.\nWe look forward to working with her and this commission. As for the regulatory calendar, our gas rate case settlement is one more in the streak of settlements and our second gas settlement in just over a year. I'm pleased with the outcome and the team's work.\nThis is a clear demonstration of the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan and speaks to our ability to work with multiple parties to provide the best outcome for our customers and our investors. We expect rates to go into effect on 1 October with the start of the new test year. In our electric rate case, we are awaiting staff's position by the end of August and a final order by March of next year. Within our filing, we are requesting approval for a small undergrounding pilot, roughly 10mi, and plans to underground over 400mi annually.\nThis is an area where we have a lot of opportunity to strengthen our system and improve reliability and resiliency while aligning with our Midwest peers. Solid energy legislation, strong regulatory construct, and the evidence to support it, a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. Moving on to the financials.\nFor the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.75. We had a strong quarter driven by operational and financial performance, and we continue to build contingency through the CE Way as we deliver on our year-end financial objectives. Today, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including our full-year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%.\nAs I stated in our Q1 call, this is not our first rodeo. The team has done a remarkable job of mitigating the gap left from a warm winter and a large ice storm.\nThrough the CE Way, operational cost measures, financing, and other countermeasures, we have made great progress year to date. Year after year, we deliver, and this year will be no different. This is not about winning one game or one season. It's about winning multiple seasons, a winning program, continuing the long track record of consistent growth and compounding off of actuals, bringing our investors a high quality of earnings and doing it year after year.\nNow I'll hand the call over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter delivering adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share driven by numerous cost reduction initiatives foreshadowed on our Q1 call, which I'll elaborate on shortly. Our financial performance over the past few months has materially offset the weather-driven challenges we faced in the first quarter. As such, as Garrick noted, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year, and on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $1.45 per share given the back-end-weighted nature of our plan this year.\nAs you can see in the waterfall chart on slide seven, weather has been a significant headwind to our financial performance in the first half of this year, driving $0.37 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022.\nRate relief, net of investment-related expenses, has resulted in $0.06 cents per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year has been significantly impacted by higher operating maintenance, our O&M expenses to the tune of $0.15 per share versus the comparable period in 2022, attributable to storm restoration costs in the first quarter.\nHowever, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses, which represent the majority of our O&M expense and primarily exclude costs associated with our energy waste reduction programs and employee benefits, have trended favorably during the second quarter, and we are down roughly 10% versus the second quarter of 2022.\nSo we're seeing the fruits of the numerous operational cost reduction initiatives we put in place earlier in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT cost reduction initiatives, and eliminating other discretionary spending, and of course, leveraging the CE Way, our lean operating system. We anticipate that our strong cost performance will continue as we move through the second half of the year.\nRounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.18 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022 highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary source of upside here was related to financing efficiencies. In short, we capitalized on attractive conditions in the convertible bond market by pricing an $800 million issuance and using the majority of the proceeds to prefund future parent company financing needs.\nUsually, prefundings like this are subject to negative carry. However, given the current inverted yield curve, we've managed to reinvest the proceeds at deposit rates favorable to the underlying funding costs. Lastly, we used the balance of the proceeds from the convert offering to tender a portion of select bonds well below par, which has delevered our balance sheet. All in, this opportunistic financing transaction was earnings accretive and has further strengthened our liquidity position. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022.\nDue to the absence of strong sales of the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer, we anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief, net of investment-related costs, which we have quantified at $0.08 per share versus the first half of 2022. Our estimates reflect the terms of our recently filed gas rate case settlement agreement, which is subject to commission approval, and the residual benefits of our 2022 electric rate case settlement.\nClosing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense of the utility driven by the ongoing benefits of the aforementioned cost reduction initiatives.\nSome expected favorable year-over-year variance related to service restoration costs and the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, which collectively equates to $0.26 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Lastly, as we discussed during our first quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share of pull ahead exercised in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs per our original guidance, all in, we estimate these items will drive $0.17 to $0.23 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. In summary, we made great progress to offset the challenging weather experienced in the first quarter, but needless to say, we'll continue to plan conservatively and execute as we always do. Moving on to the balance sheet, on slide eight, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings for Moody's.\nAs you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which, coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow growth, supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan, slide nine offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility.\nThis includes both first mortgage bond financings and a securitization financing to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base at the recently retired Karn coal facilities. As for the parent company, given the timing of the convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards that priced last year. So the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled commensurate with the needs of the business over time.\nAs I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Rejji. Our track record spans two decades and consistently delivers industry-leading results in any conditions. This is what we do. We deliver for all stakeholders year in and year out, and this year will be no different.\nWith that, Michelle, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the electronic question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw from the queue, please press star followed by the number two. And if you are using a speakerphone, please lift the handset before pressing any keys. We will take questions in the order they are received, and we will take as many questions as time permits. One moment, please, for your first question.\nYour first question will come from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood, good. Thanks. Maybe just wanted to start off with the undergrounding pilot, if we could, and just wondering if you could expand a bit more, I guess, on what would define success there or, I guess, future outlook for how quickly that could fold into the plan in larger size over time.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nSo I've got an interesting story on this, Jeremy. I was out with our crews here about two weeks ago, and we had done undergrounding and replacing undergrounding in a subdivision area. So remember, in Michigan, subdivisions are underground. A lot of people request their service underground. And so we know how to do this work. And in fact, we have a large gas business that does a lot of undergrounding, and so we're sharing practices back and forth.\nAnd so again, right now, we're starting out with a pilot, and that's just a nice way to step into this with the Public Service Commission to show them our capabilities and being able to deliver that at a low cost for our customers. Again, as I've shared in past calls, the cost for undergrounding in Michigan, given the soil, given where we intend to put the undergrounding, it's really conducive.\nIt's really at almost at parity with above-ground construction. So it makes it really affordable for our customers. And so we intend to use that practice. It's recognized through EPRI as a best practice, not everywhere, but strategically or selectively across our system. And so it starts with 10mi. We've got six counties identified. We've got a project starting up in one of the north of Grand Rapids area here in about two weeks.\nThe Public Service Commission will be on that site as well to watch that, observe that. And what we intend to grow that is to about 400mi annually. As I've shared in the past, about 10% to 15% of our system is undergrounded. Other Midwest peers are around 35% to 40%. And so again, it's a best practice, and we see it as a way to improve reliability and resiliency for the future.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And storms have been topical in Michigan, obviously, in recent time here. And just wondering if you could provide a bit more color, I guess, on your efforts, hardening efforts, and where you stand, where you want to be to improve resiliency there and just kind of how you feel local stakeholders are aligned against this outlook in the state.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nAs I shared in the Q1 call, our focus is clearly on reliability and resiliency coming off the large ice storm. We're making a lot of investments, considerable investments across that electric system, and we've seen good performance here over the course of the summer. Even just last night, we had 65mi winds come through, and the system performed well. We've got 20,000 customers out this morning, and we're quickly restoring them. And so the investments we are making, it's a large system, but the investments we are making are certainly showing benefit.\nAnd so we've got a great plan. We're filing that plan here in September with our five-year infrastructure plan. This audit that's underway that will start here in September will be another point of alignment for the right investments across the electric system to improve reliability and resiliency. So those things are going well, and our system is performing well, and so I feel good about our performance this summer, and we'll continue to be focused on it.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nHeidi Hauch\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning. This is Heidi Hauch for Julien. Thank you for taking my question.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHi, Heidi. Good morning.\n\nHeidi Hauch\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Hi. Just first question, noting your plans to file another IRP in the next year or two, do you see any read-throughs for your next IRP related to the latest peer IRP settlement approved by the Michigan PSC, either from the coal retirement front, renewables, investments, or otherwise? Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, first, I want to congratulate that peer utility that had an IRP settled this week. So congratulations to the DTE team. A lot goes into those IRPs, and if you take one thing away from that IRP, it just speaks to the constructive environment here in Michigan. Four settlements for us, a settlement and IRP for DTE, that's really good. So we'll obviously look at their IRP and look at what we want to take into our next IRP.\nThe other things that we'll consider, the Inflation Reduction Act has certainly changed PTCs and IPCs and is shaping the industry. Investment Infrastructure and Jobs Act has also shaped some things in our industry. And so all that will go into our next IRP and in some of our thinking.\nThe IRP process takes about 12 to 18 months to build really a thoughtful and thorough plan that would submit to the commission. I anticipate we'll start that process in 2024, building out that. So if you play it out, that means we file maybe late 2025, 2026 timeframe. And so there's still some work to define that and tie that down, but that's our early indications of how we think about our next IRP.\n\nHeidi Hauch\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then second question from me, can you comment on the latest MPSC investigation into the natural gas meters and new service delays? How are you planning to address or improve these issues, and are there any potential capital opportunities that may result from this investigation? Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you for your question. It probably goes without saying this, but I'll say it anyways. We take every MPSC inquiry seriously. And from a customer perspective and bills, we've got to get that right. But maybe a little background here, Heidi. Our meters communicate wirelessly. That's our Smart Grid. It's all wireless. And obviously, there's a wireless carrier that communicates that signal back to our home offices here.\nAnd as you might imagine, those wireless carriers are moving from 3G to 5G. So they're shutting down some of the 3G systems, moving to 5G. And they made us aware of that, and we were working with our meter vendor to upgrade those meters so they had the right communication components to operate at 4G and 5G technology. That process was underway.\nHowever, the meter vendor ran into supply chain problems, in part due to the pandemic, where they couldn't get the components for the meter. That delayed our deployment of these meters. And so when we walked in in January of 2023, we had about 190,000m that were no longer communicating. Today, that's around 33,000, and we continue to work with our meter vendor to close that, and we expect that to be closed by August.\nAs you imagine, when those meters aren't communicating, it creates the potential for estimated reads. Our meter vendor was supposed to go out and read meters for us to close that gap. They did not meet our expectations around that, and we had to step in and close that gap, which we've done. And our reads are being completed, and any consecutive estimates are now within historical parameters.\nAnd so from a meter perspective, from a consecutive estimate perspective, those are resolved or will be resolved in August. We owe a report to the commission on 4 August, and so we'll do that. From a materiality perspective, we've factored that in, both the reading of the meters and any penalties we may see from the Public Service Commission, and they're incorporated within our guidance that we've offered. I do not see a capital opportunity here, but rest assured that from a customer perspective and MPSC perspective, we are running this to ground. We're doing a root cause on it and make sure that it will not happen again for our customers.\nThanks for your question, Heidi.\n\nHeidi Hauch\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMorning. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe can.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Mike.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Okay. Great. Hey, Garrick. Maybe this one's for Rejji. Just wanted to ask on the delay and the draw on the forward equity and just how we should think about timing there and whether that ends up getting needed at all. I think my recollection is outside of that, you had no other needs until 2025, but yeah, maybe just a little more color on what the equity picture looks like going forward now that you've done the convert.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Mike, thanks for the question. Yeah, we will still plan to settle the equity. It'll likely be, I'll say, the back half of this year and deep into the second half, so call it late Q3 or in Q4, but we do still plan to settle the equity over the course of this year.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. And just in terms of the impact on metrics and FFO to debt from the convert issuance and the tender and delay in equity, does that kind of move you at all up or down within your mid-teens target?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nNo. The convert transaction was, for all intents and purposes, when you take into account all of the puts and takes, it was effectively credit neutral, maybe modestly accretive. And then the delay of the equity settle, again, it's still going to take place over the course of this year. So again, all credit neutral, and so we'll still be right in that mid-teens area and well in alignment with the expectations of the credit rating agencies so we can maintain our investment-grade ratings.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions from the phone line, so I will turn the conference back to Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Michelle. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road soon. Take care and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "Q1 2023 CMS Energy Corporation Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2023 CMS Energy Corporation Earnings Call\n\nCMSNYSEAPR 27, 9:00 AM\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThe number of heating degree days in our service territory during the quarter were approximately 18% below normal weather patterns. The atypically warm weather, coupled with the strong comp in the Q1 of 2022, resulted in $0.27 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022, as noted on slide 7. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, resulted in $0.03 per share of negative variance, as last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements were offset primarily by the roll-off of tax benefits realized in the Q1 of 2022, associated with a prior gas rate case settlement, as expected.\nFrom a cost perspective, as mentioned, our financial performance in the Q1 was significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses, attributable to storm restoration costs, which resulted in $0.20 per share of negative variance versus the Q1 of 2022. It is worth noting, however, that given the elevated storm costs we've seen over the last few years, we have incorporated fairly conservative assumptions for this cost category in our full-year forecast. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022, due to the absence of strong sales at the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer.\nWe anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief, net of investment-related costs, which we have quantified at $0.17 per share versus the comparable period in 2022. Our underlying assumptions for rate relief are largely driven by last year's successful gas and electric rate case settlements, and we have assumed a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense of the utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way. In light of the weather-related headwinds in the Q1, we have supplemented our planned productivity for the year by limiting hiring, reducing our use of consultants and contractors, accelerating longer-term IT cost reduction initiatives, and eliminating other discretionary spending, among other activities.\nThese cost performance measures will support the $0.28 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that none of these actions will impact the safety and reliability of our electric and gas systems. Lastly, as we discussed during our fourth quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar Clean Energy, and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share of pull-aheads achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022, as per our original guidance.\nTo offer further risk mitigation to the financial headwinds encountered in the Q1 and provide additional contingency should we need it, we have supplemented these opportunities with anticipated cost savings at the parent, largely in the form of opportunistic financings and tax planning, which in aggregate we estimate will drive $0.36 to 0.42 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Before moving on, I'll just note that though our track record of delivering on our financial objectives over the last two decades speaks for itself, we remain perpetually paranoid in our financial planning process. More bluntly, we always do the worrying so you don't have to. To that end, I'm pleased to report that we've already begun to see the benefits of the numerous countermeasures implemented in the Q1.\nAs such, I'm highly confident that we'll realize the balance of expected savings over the course of the year. Moving on to the financing plan, slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are largely limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has already been priced and/or funded over the past several months. As we have noted in the past, the parent's contribution to the funding needs of the COVID acquisition is in place with the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts. This equity will be issued in connection with the acquisition of the facility, and we have assumed the associated EPS dilution in our full-year guidance.\nWhile we don't have any further required financing needs at the parent this year, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic financings to de-risk our future funding needs if market conditions are accommodative. Our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the rest of the business. We plan conservatively, and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors. This year is no different. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Rejji. As you look at slide 9, I'll remind you again, our track record spans two decades of consistent, industry-leading results, despite changing commissioners, legislators, and governors, recessions, severe weather and storm activity, or a pandemic. We're here for the long haul. We have powered Michigan's progress for nearly a century and a half, and as we look ahead, we see great opportunities to support the state's growth through critical infrastructure as we help power Michigan through the next century. With that, Bailey, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you've signaled us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone phone. We'll pause for just a second. Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, Jeremy. Your line is now open.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood, thank you. Just wanted to come back to the key focus, I think, in the market at this point, with adverse weather and storm headwinds in the Q1. Great to see that you're still targeting high end of the guide there. Just wondering, as you think about contingency flex this year, If there is anything else that moves against you, do you have more contingency that could offset that if weather shapes up less than expected or anything else moves against plan?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI have confidence in our ability to deliver. That's the first point, Jeremy. We know there's a lot of year remaining, so really, in all our efforts, we look to build contingency out throughout the year. Maybe if I just take a step back, because I know this is a popular question today, and just talk about our playbook. Rejji alluded to it, but let me offer a little more specifics. I'd break it into really five areas. The first one is we plan conservatively. You know this, Jeremy. We've done this year after year after year. That's what leads to our consistency, one of the reasons we have consistent financial performance. Also, we talked about this in Q4, what we did in 2022 to de-risk the year.\nJust adding Rejji's points, we budget for storms, and we budget conservatively for storms because we know they occur throughout the year. In many cases, this is just a weather story. The first piece is just we plan conservatively. The second piece of the plan is the CE Way. This is another strong suit for us. I'll remind everybody, it's industrial engineering, and it's a lean operating system. It's science. It's proven throughout the years for many different companies. I see a great opportunity that we continue to deliver on year after year. Scheduling optimization is one example underway right now. We're making capital IT investments to get other efficiency improvements. It improves customer satisfaction while reducing costs. Our run rate has typically been around $50 million a year, as you know, and there's a lot more muscle we have there.\nThe third piece is really around the labor piece, and that is what you would expect. We release some consultants. Our contractors are flexible, so we dial that down a bit. We pinch back on overtime, and then we hold on hiring. Those things help as well. The fourth area is really discretionary spending. It's limiting conferences, travel, and some of the training. You think that's small, but it's actually big when you apply it across the entire company. The fifth piece, and Rejji hit on it, was good tax planning and just opportunistic financing. That's the recipe. As I said, this isn't our first rodeo. If you go back to the pandemic, we had to find $100 million. Fifty percent of it came through the CE Way, 50% through other actions, very similar to what we're doing right now.\nWe're going to chin this bar, and we're going to add some contingency throughout the year. I feel very confident in our ability to deliver and to weather whatever Mother Nature throws at us throughout the year.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. Maybe pivoting to the gas case, just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. I know the gas case maybe doesn't come as much focus as electric, generally speaking, but what are the key focus points across stakeholders in the gas case at this point? Just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on chances for a settlement without getting too far ahead of yourself.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nFirst things first, this is a good and constructive starting point. If I was just to dissect it a little bit for you, what we saw from staff and the AG as far as ROEs was better than previous staff and AG positions, and that bodes well for an ROE and some of the financial metrics. The other important piece is we built that—remember we built that case over Q3 and Q4 last year, and gas prices were rising. We also saw some expense from a pension and OPEB perspective. When you fast forward to today, those have changed, and gas prices are lower. We snapped the line at the end of the year on pension and OPEB expense.\nWe got a $212 million ask, but that effectively pulls that down because the fact pattern's different than what we saw when we built the case. The big piece that people are talking about here is the sales forecast. There's about a $10, $12 million difference there. Let me walk through that. We have used this method since 2010 to project sales. It's a 15-year regression-type model. We haven't changed it a bit. It's tried and true, and it's accurate. Here's the important point. Back in 2010, the commission ordered us—let me repeat—the commission ordered us to use this method. That was in case U15986. We're doing exactly what the commission told us to do. We feel really good about where we're positioned there. There are other cats and dogs, but bottom line, take this away.\nIt's a good constructive starting point. The other thing you asked about settlement, we'll always look for the opportunity for settlement. Again, we sit in a very constructive jurisdiction, so I'm very comfortable taking it to the end and getting a full order from the commission.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question today comes from the line of Shah Parekh from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, good morning, Shah. You with us, Shah?\n\nOperator\n\nPlease do ensure you are unmuted locally. We will move on to our next question. Our next question today comes from the line of Julien Domoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, team. Hopefully, try two works here. You can hear me?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, Julien. We can, Julien.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey. Excellent. Thank you guys very much. Let me follow up on the first question here just around the uptick in usage, non-utility tax, and other. You guys elaborated on it. Not only have you pressed some of those levers to see the quarter-over-quarter change in 2023 and the range, right? You're talking about $0.36 to 0.42 of positive offsets there now. In addition to that, you've got further levers to go to the extent to which that it might materialize. I just want to make sure I understand the comment from earlier.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGood morning, Julien. This is Rejji. You've got it exactly right. Garrick, I think, offered a wonderful dissertation on how we approach cost reduction opportunities. The only thing I would add to his comments is that when it comes to cost reduction, we don't discriminate. We look across the entire cost structure. When you exclude depreciation, it's about $7 billion annually. About $1 billion of that is a combination of interest expense and tax-related spend, a combination of federal and state income tax, as well as property tax. We look across all of those cost categories to identify opportunities. What you're seeing in that penultimate bar, in that waterfall, are opportunities that we anticipate around potential pre-fundings. As you know, we aggressively look at the maturity profile of our bonds and see if there are opportunities to take out bonds prematurely.\nWe'll look at those. Again, on the tax planning side, we're always looking for opportunities to reduce costs, whether that's for state tax, property tax, or otherwise. That's what's incorporated into that last item. Again, that's all I would add to Garrick's good comments on how we approach cost reduction.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. No, fair enough. Just following up on some of the conversation on regulatory mechanisms, you talked about including an investment regulatory mechanism in your upcoming case. Can you talk about what that looks like, and perhaps talk about that in parallel with some of this conversation on ring-fencing here? I mean, how do you think about ring-fencing to isolate spending on specific subject areas, right? It sounds like this IRM might be related. Also, maybe you could talk about ring-fencing in the context of veg management efforts.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nAbsolutely, Julien. You've obviously listened to Chair Scripps; he's used the word ring-fencing around some of the capital investments. The way we think about it is really, I'd put it in three buckets. The first bucket is really we know that in order to deliver reliability and resiliency for our customers, it's going to take more capital investment. It's just the nature of an aging system with more severe weather. We're all focused on that. The commission, we're certainly focused on a company, and so is every one of our coworkers here within CMS Energy and the broader Consumers Energy. We're squarely focused on that first bucket. The second bucket really is what you brought up, and that's the commission wants to be able to ring-fence it. They're looking at a prudency, accountability.\nTypically, when we've asked for large increases, they want to know that we can do the work, that we have the resources to ramp up. That's an important piece. This IRM, or this tracking mechanism, allows us to do that and provide the accountability that the commission's looking to see. Ultimately, that should lead to the third bucket, which is the recovery piece, which is helpful for investors. I see all those three working together. In fact, I want to give you an example. Back in 2011, and I was engaged in 2011, we did similar on our gas business. We were looking to increase the amount we spent on replacing mains and services. We started a new gas construction group.\nThe commission and staff at the time had questions about, important questions, about how you were going to do that and how you were going to ramp up the resources. We did a similar type mechanism then, delivering improved safety for our customers, replacing mains and services, and creating that ring-fence, that accountability associated with a tracking mechanism. We were very successful. It started out as $85 million back in 2011, and now it's a $250 million program on an annual basis. We're taking that same approach as we go through this case. Is that helpful, Julien?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAbsolutely. Perhaps let me just make sure I'm hearing you right. This IRM, would that help address some lag-related considerations, perhaps shift timing of future cases, or is this principally about accounting and accountability back to the commission to just make sure the dollars and cents are getting spent in the right bucket?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThe latter is the main focus. I mean, over time, it could lead to extend out some rate cases. Our focus right now is just making sure there's the accountability piece, and the ring-fencing that the chair has referenced in some of his public comments.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Excellent. On veg management, just quickly, just with respect to that side of the equation, obviously been a lot of focus on that front. Your commentary saying that you've increased it from 2020, helpful. Any further efforts in that regard? Obviously, there seems to be an acute desire or need for that. How do you think about allocating even more in that direction at this time?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nJust to give you some real numbers on this, in 2020, it was around $50 million on an annual basis. With support of the commission through different cases, we requested more to address this important aspect of reliability. We're up around $100 million on an annual basis. There are a couple components of it. We're continuing to look at other opportunities to invest more in that. We're also looking at the efficiency of that. This is an area where we're using technology, artificial intelligence, and analytics to be able to better predict where to utilize those dollars. Our trees trimmed per mile has actually improved over the time period as well, which is helpful in the conversations we have with the commission.\nWe'll continue to look for opportunities to look at other areas to invest and improve reliability, much like I said during my comments around the capital investment. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nJulien, the only thing I would add is that when we think about the planning year, and particularly years in which we have a little bit of upside or contingency, usually vegetation management is one of the first items that comes up on the flex list. Last year, in fact, when we had a little bit of upside that was weather-driven, we did about $5 million or so of flex related to vegetation management. Our actuals, even though we've budgeted around $100 million, as Garrick noted for last year, I think our actuals were closer to $105 million, certainly over $100 million. Flex is an opportunity for us to do additional vegetation management. Remember, we have that voluntary refund mechanism, which is also a vehicle through which we can do incremental operating expenses.\nThe current voluntary refund mechanism that we have outstanding, we've targeted about $8 million towards additional vegetation management this year out of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. As you know, we obviously pulled that lever in Q4 of last year for $22 million all in. Again, a portion of that will be allocated towards vegetation management, assuming we get commission approval. That's the other mechanism we have as well.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys very much. Good luck.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question today is a follow-up question from Shah Parekh from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nShah Parekh\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Start with that.\nYou know, I got all excited and I don't know why you can't start with that. Sorry if I missed this, but I just want to maybe just round out the storm discussion. Do the storms, will they lead to more resiliency spend? Is it going to increase CapEx or do you see offsets to CapEx? Are you going to seek any kind of new mechanisms? I mean, some things are already in rider-like items. Would resiliency kind of get that similar treatment? Overall, just how do these storms kind of change your thoughts around the five-year plan?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nJust to be really crystal clear on this, there's going to be more capital investments as needed to improve reliability and resiliency. It's a reflection of an aging system with more severe weather. I offered some of that in my prepared remarks, but in this next electric rate case, we're proposing an IRM, or investment recovery mechanism, as a tracker to show greater certainty around our capital investments. That's the intent. We know we have to invest more. There's a number of ways to do that. One is our storm audit and focusing on that and getting alignment with the commission. The other is the rate case. The other one is the five-year electric distribution investment plan. All of those different filings, all those different conversations, lead to better alignment and better support for our electric distribution investments.\nThe long term is yes in that. This IRM mechanism, we believe, will create greater accountability with the commission. Chair Scripps has talked about ring-fencing, and then ultimately should lead to more recovery of those capital investments. Is that helpful, Shah?\n\nShah Parekh\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThe question is, should we be looking at these incremental investments as extending the runway of your growth or accretive to your growth?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWell, we have a long runway. We update our plan every year. That five-year plan includes about $6 billion of investments in the electric distribution system. That was up in this most recent plan. We'll continue to look at, as we model across the system, as there's additional investments, we'll continue to look at opportunities to invest more there. There's a long runway of opportunity just given the nature of our system.\n\nShah Parekh\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Maybe just shifting to financing. Financing has been a bit of a tough headwind, but interest rates seem to have moderated year to date. How are you trending versus the embedded interest costs and plan in terms of 2023 and maybe even opportunities for some cushion versus 2024 since rates have come down versus your original expectations? Thanks.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThis is Rejji. Great question. As always, I think we had a word count of about six or seven times in our prepared remarks where we talked about planning conservatively. That has been the case here. In our plan, we had pretty conservative assumptions at the operating company, and that's where the vast majority of the issuances are this year. We've been fortunate for the issuances we've done to date to issue those at interest rate levels below what we had in plan. We're seeing upside, and that's already flowing through our 2023 numbers. Obviously, we'll benefit from that in 2024 and beyond because we're issuing long-dated paper. Certainly, with interest rates moderating over the last several months, that creates additional opportunities.\nThat's what we'll be mindful of as we look at the final six, seven months of the year and seeing if we can capitalize on, I'll say, the accommodative capital markets that we're seeing right now.\n\nShah Parekh\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nTerrific. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Sorry about the tech issues. I appreciate it.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nNo, no worries.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGood morning,Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, good morning, Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nJust maybe on the just continuing the discussion along storms, can you update us on the investigation that was started by the commission? My understanding is that they were looking for a third-party consultant. Maybe just what's the latest there?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nBroadly from the storm audit perspective, they started that last fall. They're in the process of selecting the vendor or the firm right now. We anticipate that to start in the September timeframe. I'll remind you, the big picture perspective on this storm audit is that we're both aligned, that being the commission and CMS Energy aligned, that we need to improve reliability. I really view this as an opportunity to be able to get further alignment on the needed investments in our system. I'll give you a great example with undergrounding. We want to do more undergrounding. If we look at our Midwest peers, they're around 35% to 40 underground. We're at 10%. Goes back to Shah's question. Is there opportunities for investment? There's a lot of them. We see that as important.\nYou can look at the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI, and they'll say undergrounding improves reliability depending on if it's three-phase or single-phase by 50% to 90%. This is a great example where we need to, with this storm audit, utilize this to get better alignment on the needed investment in the system. Once we have that alignment, then again, we can move forward and get greater certainty around those investments. Does that help, Durgesh?\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nAbsolutely does. The point is, and you've said this before, you don't see anything punitive coming out of those audits as a result as they kind of go through your processes and other things and past practices?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI don't see anything punitive. No.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nGot it. Okay. Just one quick follow-up. I know this is small, but you got a decision on the voluntary refund mechanism earlier in the month. I believe there were some disallowances. Can you talk to that and discuss that briefly?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll tag team it with Rejji. Just the context around this, these are pretty small dollars. Bottom line, we have this option to file a voluntary refund mechanism. We did that in 2022, and the dollars are booked in 2022. It's not a cakewalk. It's not assured that you're going to get approval. Staff and the commissioners have a say in that, right? They really telegraphed the importance of incremental forestry, and some other things with our customers in terms of helping out those low-income customers. They've really given us another opportunity at the bat. We filed that here on 21 April 2023 to reflect the commissioners' and staff's comments. I feel good about getting to a positive outcome on that. It's just navigating kind of the back and forth of the process, Durgesh.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, that's the essence of it, Durgesh. Just to give you some specifics on the numbers. When we filed the VRM in late 2022, it was for $22 million, $5 million of which was to support our vulnerable customers in the gas of the business. That was fully approved by the commission. Where there was some, I'd say, counsel and guidance by the commission was on the balance of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. To Garrick's comments, they wanted to see direct customer benefits. That's why we have recently, as of last Friday, requested additional forestry or vegetation management, as well as additional support for vulnerable customers. That's how it's cut. Just that $17 million is subject to further approval. We're confident that we'll get this recent request over the finish line.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nI appreciate the color, guys. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today, coming from the line of David Carris from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Carris\n\nVP and Financial Advisor, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Morning. Let's see. There have been some legislative bills drafted in the state with some more aggressive net zero targets. I was wondering if that might impact any of your thinking around the next time you address the IRP.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGreat question. I think perspective is really important here because often in Lansing, just part of a bill, there's a lot of back and forth, and there's media releases, and you just got to kind of clear the air and talk about it from a big picture perspective. I'll remind our listeners here that in the governor's first term, she introduced the Healthy Climate Plan. In fact, one of the members on my direct staff was one of the stakeholders in that process and was involved in the review and kind of the language around it. I participated with a group of about eight to 10 CEOs and the governor in the review process. The governor's Healthy Climate Plan lines up really well with where we're headed from a state perspective, but also lines up well with our current IRP and the like.\nNow, the legislature, the Senate specifically, has introduced some new bills that are a little bit more aggressive. I want to remind everybody, this is the back and forth of Lansing. That's the first starting point. That's the first valley, you might say. We're going to continue to navigate that, move forward with that, and manage that process. Ultimately, at the end of the day, if it requires us to do something sooner, we'll do that sooner. That will mean more capital investment opportunities. I want to let everyone know it's really manageable and, again, well aligned with where we're already headed.\n\nDavid Carris\n\nVP and Financial Advisor, Morgan Stanley\n\nGotcha. Thanks. That's helpful. Could you also touch on just what you're seeing in terms of weather normal volumes, sales volumes, and how that's lining up with your expectations so far?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nDavid, hi. This is Rejji. Appreciate the question. Yeah, weather normalized trends, I will admit, we were scratching our heads a little bit at the trends that we saw. Just for everyone's benefit, we saw residential about a little over 2.5% off versus Q1 2022, commercial a little over 3.5% off versus Q1 2022, and industrial was flat, excluding one large low-margin customer. Total was down about a little over 2.5% versus Q1 last year. I would say it's really early days. We are still digging into the data. I would just start by saying as hard as our sales forecasting team works, weather normalized math is a combination of art and science.\nWhen you see, I'd say, dramatic weather like we saw in Q1 of last year, where it was extremely cold, and then a pretty warm winter, as we noted earlier, Q1 of this year, you can see a good degree of imprecision in those calculations. I say all that to say we're looking at it with a little bit of a skeptical eye because the reality is we're still seeing very strong economic indicators in the service territory. Our customer counts, specifically for commercial, are up almost 0.5%, over 0.5%, to almost 1% across the electric and gas businesses. Residential customer counts are still up. While we have built into our guidance that continued return to work, we're still seeing a good level of really not every company in Michigan at this point is four or five days in the office.\nWe still think as we get into those summer months, we may see some of that favorable mix we've seen in the past. I would say early days, there's probably a little bit of noise in the data. I'll just say on the industrial side, we were flat again versus where we were last year. We couldn't have a more robust economic development pipeline borne out of a lot of the constructive federal legislation that's been passed over the past 18 months. We continue to look at our trends versus pre-pandemic, and across every customer class, we're doing as well, if not better, than what we were doing pre-pandemic, particularly when you take into account our energy efficiency programs, which effectively reduce our load year over year by 2%.\nI don't think what you're seeing in Q1 and in the data is indicative of the economic conditions in Michigan. I think it's just more weather normalized math versus anything else.\n\nDavid Carris\n\nVP and Financial Advisor, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, understood. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today comes from the line of Michael Sullivan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, Garrick. All right. You guys answered a lot here. I just had a couple of small follow-ups on what's already been discussed. Just on the undergrounding, can you maybe just give us a sense on what the long-term target is there, how much of the system you are looking to underground, and over what period of time you'd like to get there?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGreat question. It's important to recognize we're not trying to underground the entire system. It's really about selective, or sometimes I've used the word strategic, undergrounding. We know from EPRI research across a number of utilities, you're in a 50% to 90% improvement, whether it's three-phase or single-phase. Ideally, we're trying to get to a point where we can do 400mi a year and then really over a 10-year period increment that up. I would say in the range of around 10,000mi is really what we're trying to get to overall. That's not going to occur overnight, but that does provide a nice opportunity to enhance the reliability and resilience of our system, and provide a nice opportunity from a capital investment standpoint.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Very helpful. Kind of a similar question just following up on the IRM. I think the context you gave on the gas side was helpful in terms of where it started and where it's gotten to. Can you maybe frame that on the electric side? I know you haven't officially filed the next case yet, but just kind of where that could start and ultimately go?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWe're being very thoughtful about our starting point. We see it as an opportunity to grow from there. Our first valley will be in the $100 million range for an IRM, and then we'll grow it from there.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today comes from the line of Andrew Weichel from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everybody.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nLet me first say congratulations again for selling Interbank. I'm very glad we're not spending three quarters of the call talking about that.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI'm glad to.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Yes. First question, just to follow up on undergrounding. You talked about the 50% to 90% operational improvement estimate from EPRI. Do you have any rough sense, rule of thumb, the cost difference versus traditional above-ground spending, and what a break-even might look like?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nOne of the things we're doing—we've done a lot of—I shouldn't say a lot, but we're doing a lot of work with our undergrounding crews right now. That price for undergrounding, particularly on a single-phase, is approaching the price of overhead. It's not quite there yet, but we're close. We're in the range of, on single-phase, maybe like $250,000 a mile for undergrounding. Again, it's directional bore, and give or take, it depends on the conditions of the soil, homes, and other things. That's roughly the number. They're really quite comparable or growing comparable in terms of that price point. We've got pretty fertile soils, we've got pretty soft soils, and we're not in rock in some of those things, which helps from a cost perspective.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, Andrew, the only thing I would add to Garrick's comments when you think about the cost-benefit and the potential opportunity, if you look at the last few years of our vegetation management plus our service restoration, we're spending on average, based on actuals, about $200 million plus per year across those two cost categories. The opportunity would be over time with those investments in undergrounding to potentially reduce that overall cost bucket. That's how we would think about the cost-benefit, in addition to some of the points Garrick raised earlier.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay, great. Next one, are you able to tell what's the deferred fuel cost balances now versus at year end?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nI'll take a stab at that, Andrew. We can follow up with more precision offline if needed. Where we ended the year, we had goodness, end of 2022, just over $800 million across power supply costs on the electric side and then gas inventories on the gas side of the business. Call it about a $450, $400 split, so $800 to 850. We've started to chip away at that. Obviously, we have very strong cost recovery mechanisms in Michigan, which have been kind of tried and true since the mid-1980s. We do expect on the gas side to recover the vast majority of that over the course of this fiscal year. For electric, we did apply a bit of elegance to our recovery process for power supply costs.\nOf the $450 million we had coming due in January, we filed with the commission a plan to recover that over a three-year span, so effectively $150 million per year through 2025. Just given the current environment, we thought that that was the right thing to do to alleviate the cost burden for customers. We also thought our balance sheet could accommodate it as well. The way we've structured it, just the fact that we're no longer going to be recovering those costs through working capital and now through regulatory asset, it's actually credit accretive based on how Moody's calculates their FFO. For a variety of reasons, it was a nice opportunity, and we've exercised it in the Q1.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nVery good. Thank you. One quick follow-up, if I may. Housing, I know there's not a whole lot new for you to announce, but can you just give an updated thought on the timing of potential updates there with the state versus the timing of your next IRP, which I believe is likely to come next year?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWe do know, I mean, it's public information that Holtec International, who is responsible for decommissioning the facility and has the operating rights there on the facility, has requested federal funding. They've also requested state funding within this budget, which is being worked right now, state budget. That'll be figured out in this May, June, July timeframe. They've asked for $300 million in the state budget. Again, this is public information. What I would expect to see from this is a lower cost for power. We've had Palisades. It's been expensive, an expensive PPA, and we expect it to be lower given all the tax dollars that are applied there. That power should flow into Michigan. Those are important components of it. We expect low-cost power, as I've said historically, and we're open to consider a PPA with a financial compensation mechanism.\nAt this point, all right, we've got a good IRP in place. If that comes to fruition, it'll shape our next IRP, but it's really too soon to tell on how it would shape upcoming IRPs.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. The more specific question was, would the timing of your IRP potentially be influenced by the timing of Palisades' resolution?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThat's too hard to tell. Frankly, bringing a nuclear plant back, to my knowledge, has not been done. There are a lot of hurdles and a lot of unknowns there. I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot of unknowns. It's difficult to say whether it'll have an impact or not on our next IRP.\n\nAndrew Weichel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today comes from the line of Alex Manakyan from Mizuho. Please go ahead, Alex. Your line is now open.\n\nAlex Manakyan\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nMorning. Thank you very much. Given that everyone in the industry is kind of always walking the tightrope between reliability and then customer bill impact, can you provide any thoughts on what the tone of the commission has been with regards to the undergrounding? Is this something that they've suggested or something you're bringing to them unprompted?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThere's been a lot of conversations, and there will continue to be more conversations on this important work of undergrounding. We'll be doing some additional piloting within the context of this proposed electric rate case. We'll continue to look at other opportunities to build out on that. Going back to the storm audit, this is really our opportunity to get further alignment with the commission on the important investments that need to be made to improve reliability and resiliency. I would suggest this, that both the commission, staff, the company, and all our coworkers here, too, are really well aligned on ensuring that we're improving reliability and resiliency. You talked about the affordability piece as well, and that's clearly top of mind.\nPart of that is we leverage the CE Way not only to improve our operations and maintenance expense, but we utilize it to improve capital efficiency so that dollar goes further. Just like I shared earlier, we continue to look at opportunities to bring the cost down of undergrounding, and, frankly, of all our capital work.\n\nAlex Manakyan\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nUnderstood. Thank you. Just a little bit more color on the timeline of what this would look at or what this would look like, and then potentially the dollar amount of upside to the CapEx plan. Should we think of this as getting you kind of into the high sevens towards the eight of your long-term guidance, or is this more of extending the 7% out beyond where it is currently?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nWhen we introduced in the Q4 call, we introduced our $15.5 billion capital investment plan. That had more electric distribution and electric-related spend in that plan. It was like $6.1 billion of that, which was an increase. We're not changing our capital plan at this point because we increased it just here in the last call. That may change over time because we look at that capital plan every year. As I've shared, there's a long runway of opportunity there. As we get certainty around these investments, as we build out that five-year electric distribution plan, that'll be an opportunity to look at the longer-term capital piece. Now, going back to the growth piece, 6% to 8%, we said confidence toward the high end. That puts it in that range of 7% to 8%. Historically, I've said this. I'll say it again.\nThere are no sugar highs. We go for consistency year after year, so that's what we compound off, actually. That's the quality of earnings that we aim for and will continue to repeat year after year, because we know that's what our investors value.\n\nAlex Manakyan\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you so much. That's all for me, and congrats again on a great quarter.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYep, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nMorning, guys. How are you?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nHey, Ross.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nMorning. Hey. Just a couple from me here. One, the first part is just any commentary on Commissioner Phillips' resignation and timeline for replacement, thoughts on replacement. Not to beat the dead horse here, you came into the year on my quick math with about $75 million of cost contingency to offset the weather normalization you knew you were going to have to deal with. Now, Garrick, as you went through those five things, you've cranked that up to about $200 million on a round number. There's another $125 million or so coming in. Clearly, you've thought about what in that bucket is one-time and what's more permanent. Maybe can you contextualize for us how conversations with the commission have gone around what's one-time cost improvement and what's permanent improvement in the past?\nWe can kind of look to the future as to how those negotiations go because clearly, there can be some conversation around that as you look at the cost reduction.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation",
    "content2": "Let me start with Tremaine Phillips. I have great respect for Tremaine. He was a great commissioner, and we saw constructive outcomes. He left a legacy at the commission. I'd put it into three areas. One, he really moved electric vehicles in the state. He was forward-thinking and progressive about that work. In addition to that, there was a lot of work on grid modernization and optimization of the grid that he helped position within the commission. The third piece, and this has really played out nicely over the course of the pandemic, is he was laser-focused on low-income and vulnerable customers. I give him credit as well as the commission for the work. We have the lowest bad debt levels across the industry.\nWe've taken care of our low-income customers during some of the toughest times during this pandemic. So much of that credit goes to Tremaine Phillips. I'll also refer you to he's got a public statement out there. He's successful, but so is his wife, who is successful. His wife has went after new opportunities. Many thanks and congratulations to both Tremaine, his wife, and his family as they pursue different career opportunities. This commission has functioned well in the past with two commissioners. We've got two constructive, experienced commissioners in place. I'm not worried about the interim at all. If you look historically, as well as with this governor, Governor Whitmer here, they've been very thoughtful about the placement of commissioners and found experienced and well-suited commissioners to continue the constructive, regulatory environment in Michigan.\nWe do know that the governor is out, and the governor's staff is out looking for a new commissioner. That process is underway. We do not have a deadline or a date out there on when that'll take place. Again, I have confidence in our governor to continue the long-standing tradition of this jurisdiction and constructive jurisdiction. I'm going to pass the call over to Rejji here to talk a little bit about the financial information on your second part of your question.\nHey, Ross. I appreciate the question. Just one last thing on Tremaine, and it's a bit of an advertisement for the Michigan legislative and regulatory construct. I mean, part of the reason why it's really wonderful to have staggered terms for your commissioners is because when you do have turnover on an unexpected basis, you still have that continuity of leadership. We obviously have Chair Scripps and Commissioner Perry still in the seat. They obviously have policy, or their philosophies are aligned with the governor's policies, I should say, around healthy climate. There's that nice continuity there. They have a quorum of two, so we'll still carry on. I'm sure they'll find a suitable replacement for Commissioner Phillips when the time is right. With respect to your question around the cost opportunities, let me just be very clear.\nI'll try to get at the numbers you specified as best I can. If I miss anything, please feel free to follow up with a question. If you think about our guidance at the beginning of the year on our Q4 call, we effectively said, as always, we plan for normal weather. We assumed a level of cost productivity in our plan, so we were showing about $0.04 per share of positive variance related to cost savings. Then we had some estimated opportunities as a result of the warm weather we put to work in 2022 in Q4, specifically with the Voluntary Refund Mechanism and some of the pull-aheads and opportunities we exercised in the context of the electric rate case settlement. That equated to about $0.19 to 0.25 of opportunity or positive variance in the original guidance.\nAs you fast forward to Q1 and you look at the waterfall we're showing today, what's really changed is that we've now seen $0.21 or just over $80 million pre-tax in the form of weather hurt. That's what we're offsetting and solving for in the form of cost productivity, as well as in that catch-all bucket around parent-related opportunities. What we're effectively saying is that there's $80 million of offsets that we need to go identify. When we look at our track record, and we're not trying to be immodest around that, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that. When you think about 2020 during the pandemic, we took out $100 million. When you think about sustainable savings versus one-timers, about 50% of that in 2020 was in the form of the CE Way.\nThat's what will flow through rates. That's what customers will benefit from. There are one-timers that sometimes we do have to resurrect, some of those old plays. Those are opportunities that probably don't get incorporated into rates because you need to execute on those in subsequent years. My working assumption is we'll see probably about a good portion of the opportunities we're trying to execute on and offset this $0.20 or $0.20-plus of weather in the form of CE Way, as well as those opportunities Garrick noted earlier in the call. Whether it's hiring freezes or external hiring type decisions around contractors and consultants, we will take all of those opportunities as part of this portfolio of savings to offset that, call it, $80-plus million of weather. That's how we think about it.\nThat's how we'll go get it. Again, a good portion should be passed on to customers, but some will be one-timers, and those are the ones that you don't necessarily repeat. Is that helpful?\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah, it's helpful, Rejji. In the past, you've been able to have that discussion with the commission. It's really one-time and what's permanent in the context of any debate around that, right? As you look at some of that CE Way money and then some of the hiring-free stuff, The risk from my perspective is the commission would say, well, you have a bunch of one-time stuff in there. Is some of that permanent? Can we get some customer bill relief out of that on a more permanent basis? Maybe contextualize that risk around discussions you've had about that in the past and their understanding of what's one-time and what's not.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah, to be clear, this is the benefit of filing annual cases because as we realize those savings, which again, when they're generated through the CE Way, they are sustainable, we will pass them on in subsequent cases or as part of the adjudicative process because when we file rebuttal, we start to bake in some of those savings midstream. There is pretty transparent dialogue with the commission staff and other intervenors about the opportunities we think are sustainable. That's what we incorporate into our cases. Again, that's the benefit of being an annual filer.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah. Fantastic. I'm with you on the $80 million in cost cuts. Then there's an incremental $50 million between the year-end callback, this deck, and that other usage category. It kind of went through when we answered Julien's question.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nYeah. The only other thing I'll mention, just to be clear, there is a bit of geography you have to be mindful of as well. When we say parent-related savings, whether they're tax planning or financing efficiency, some of that's at the holding company, in which case it wouldn't be incorporated into an adjudicative process because they're not at the optical levels. Some of those will directly go to shareholders. I think that's also very clear to the commission and other stakeholders in the context of a rate case.\n\nRoss Fowler\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nAbsolutely. That's completely correct. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. No additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the call back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy Corporation\n\nThanks, Bailey. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation."

Our net-zero commitments, backed up by the solid plans in our approved Integrated Resource\nPlan, IRP, provide certainty for our investments in clean energy and highlight the supportive regulatory construct in Michigan. Across the company, we are disciplined about taking costs out and working every day to get better.\nWe use the CE Way from corporate functions to the front line to achieve our operational and financial objectives. This focus keeps customer bills affordable. On the regulatory front, it's been an incredible year. We settled not one, not two, but three major cases, highlighting the top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. All of this leads to a premium total shareholder return you've come to expect from CMS Energy. I want to take a few minutes to share some of the big wins we had over the year. First, our commitment to people, our coworkers who show up every day with a heart of service, and our customers who count on us to be there in any weather\nwith safe, reliable, affordable, and clean energy.\nIn 2022, we were recognized nationwide as the best employer for women in the utility sector, a top employer for diversity, and one of the best large employers by Forbes. It's this team of coworkers who continue to deliver results utilizing the CE Way. In 2022, our coworkers' commitment to being best in class in the operation of our generating assets saved our customers roughly $560 million. This is more than double what we delivered in 2021, meaning our team continues to drive more value by running our own generation more efficiently than the market. Just to make this real, in December, during the storm Elliott, when others were short power, this team\nand these generation assets were exporting energy out of Michigan into MISO. I'm also pleased with the growth in economic development we've seen and helped lead in the state.\nAs I shared in the Q3 call, semiconductors, polysilicon, and battery manufacturing are all calling Michigan home. There are 230MW of new and expanding load with over $8 billion of investment in Michigan. A recent Department of Energy study ranks Michigan as a top-three state for planned battery plant capacity, further differentiating our state and service territory. Our commitments across the state have delivered more load growth, more jobs, and more investment, all of which create an environment in our state that looks strong well into the future. We remain focused on getting ready for that future with our IRP, which delivers even more\nsavings to our customers with roughly $600 million in savings over our prior plan and reduces our carbon footprint by over 60% as we exit coal in 2025 and add 8GW of solar and 550MW of battery through 2040.\nWe continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, delivering $58 million of savings in 2022. This level of discipline to continuously improve has been a contributor to the successful regulatory outcomes in our settled electric and gas rate cases, which is highlighted by the $47 million of regulatory mechanisms to support infrastructure investments and assist customers. This year, both our customers and investors will benefit from our $22 million voluntary refund mechanism, a $15 million bill credit, and $10 million of customer assistance. These regulatory mechanisms de-risk 2023 while providing\nneeded customer benefit. It's this strong execution and these results that you and we expect, and it meets our commitment to the triple bottom line, positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. 2022 marks another year of premium growth. The team continued to deliver regardless of conditions.\nIn 2022, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 at the high end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2023 adjusted four-year EPS guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 from $3.05 to $3.11 per share, compounding off of 2022 actuals like you would expect from a premium name like CMS Energy. We continue to expect to be toward the high end of this range, which points to the midpoint or higher, signaling our confidence as we start the year in a strong position. Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $1.95 per share for 2023.\nLonger term, we continue to have confidence toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, and we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8%, with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. Finally, I'm pleased to share that we have refreshed our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by $1.2 billion to $15.5 billion through 2027. I have confidence in our plan for 2023 and beyond, given our long-standing ability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth. It's no coincidence that I started my prepared remarks with our investment thesis. We live by it, and it works. On\nslide six, we've highlighted our new five-year $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan.\nThis translates to greater than 7% annual rate-based growth and supports safety and reliability investments in our electric and gas systems, and paves the way to a clean energy future with net-zero carbon, methane, and greenhouse gas emissions. You will note that about 40% of our customer investments support renewable generation, grid modernization, and main and service replacements on our gas system, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. Bottom line, we have a long and robust capital runway. Beyond our core investments, we have growth drivers outside of traditional rate-based. This includes adders built into legislation\nfor incentives on our energy efficiency and demand response programs, and the financial compensation mechanism, FCM, we earn on PPAs.\nWe also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business, NorthStar Clean Energy, as they see continued growth in their contract of renewables, as well as better pricing from capacity and energy sold at our DIG Facility. We continue to earn a 10.7% ROE on renewables to meet our Renewable Portfolio Standard, and are in the process of completing the Heartland Wind Project in 2023. These regulatory incentives are a core part of Michigan's energy law, which, with our strong regulatory construct, continues to support needed customer investments. In addition, the energy law provides certainty of recovery before looking at 10-month\nrate cases, and regular fuel tracking mechanisms that allow us to help smooth the impact of commodity prices for our customers. I used the word incredible to describe this earlier.\nWe delivered across the board with settlements in our IRP and our gas and electric rate cases, providing more certainty for 2023 customer investments. This wasn't by accident. We have a supportive law, strong regulatory construct, and our improved regulatory approach enables us to work with multiple parties on complex cases and provide the best outcome for our customers and investors. We plan to continue this strong performance in the next rate case cycle. We filed a gas case in December and will file our next electric rate case later this year, with those outcomes providing further certainty for 2024 customer investments. We know a robust customer\ninvestment plan and strong regulatory construct alone do not support sustainable growth. Our customers count on us to keep their bills affordable. Inflation has been top of mind for many throughout 2022 and remains so as we enter 2023.\nFirst, I'll remind everyone that CMS Energy is well positioned as it relates to the key sources of inflation, including labor, materials, and commodities. In addition, we've delivered roughly $150 million in CE Way savings over the last three years, and estimate over $200 million in large episodic savings as PPAs expire and as we exit coal generation. We're also seeing significant new and expanding commercial and industrial load in our service territory. There is a broad spectrum of growth. Some customers have opened new facilities this year, and some are in early construction. These new sales opportunities, both in the short and long term, allow us to spread our\ncosts across a growing customer base, ultimately reducing rates for all of our customers. It should be no surprise why I'm pleased with 2022, and confident in the 2023 outlook. This proven approach continues to deliver.\nNow I'll pass the call over to Rejji, who will offer additional detail.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2022 with adjusted net income of $838 million, which translates to $2.89 per share at the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our full year 2022 financial performance were higher sales driven by favorable weather, and solid commercial and industrial load, the latter of which is indicative of the attractive economic conditions in our service territory, and rate relief net of investment. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher expenses attributable to discrete customer initiatives, which reduce bills, support our\nmost vulnerable customers, and improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems.\nOur strong performance in 2022 provided significant financial flexibility at year-end, which, as Garrick highlighted, enabled us to de-risk our 2023 financial plan to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022, on slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022 enabled us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call.\nFrom a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned, and, more notably, opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted average price of over $68 per share to address the parent company's financing needs for the pending acquisition of the Covert Natural Gas Facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable\nportfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023 and is now under construction.\nMoving to our 2023 EPS guidance, on slide 11, as Garrick noted, we are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility, as it has for the past several years, and we also assume modest growth for our non-utility business, NorthStar Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the parent, given the lack of financing needs in 2023 beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contract for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the\nusual conservative assumptions throughout the business.\nTo elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on slide 12, we plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022. Additionally, we anticipate $0.14 of EPS pickup attributable to rate relief, largely driven by our recent electric and gas rate orders, and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year. As always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes, and utility interest\nexpense. As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway.\nLastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, we're assuming the usual conservative estimates around weather-normalized sales and non-utility performance, coupled with the benefits of the significant reinvestment activity deployed in the fourth quarter of 2022 through our regulatory filings and traditional operational pull ahead. These assumptions equate to $0.19 to 0.15 of positive variance versus 2022. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. On slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial\nobjectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll limit my remarks to the metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and will continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly.\nTo that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing needs until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027, given a substantial increase in our five-year utility customer investment plan. As such, you can expect us to file a prospective supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the\nutility, a good portion of which has been priced and/or funded over the past several weeks, as noted on the page.\nIn fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings addressed to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. We have fully de-risked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance, with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors. As a reminder, the acquisition of the Covert Natural Gas Facility will enable us to exit coal generation in 2025, which makes us one of the first vertically integrated utilities in the country to do so. To conclude my remarks, on slide 15, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling\nassumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized.\nOur model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable, and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse workforce remains engaged, well-trained, and empowered in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent, industry-leading financial performance. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and has withstood the test of time. It delivers in a very balanced way for all our stakeholders and enables us to consistently deliver our financial objectives. 2022 was an outstanding year, marking our 20th year of industry-leading financial performance.\nI'm confident in our refreshed $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan, the ability to execute on it, and in our regulatory construct to support it, as well as our solid track record of managing costs and keeping customer bills affordable. Finally, we deliver regardless of conditions, not by luck or accident, but by a great team that runs a proven model and stays disciplined in the work. This is what led to an outstanding 2022 and provides for a strong outlook in 2023 and beyond. With that, Adam, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question today, please do so by pressing star followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you are using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your handset.\nWe'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star followed by two on your touch-tone telephone. Also, just a second. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shar, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Shar.\nHey, good morning.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nGood. Good morning. Good.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYeah, good.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Garrick, a couple of quick questions here. The CapEx update now includes Covert. Can you maybe comment on the impacts of IRA and the plan you presented today? The clean energy segment went from $2.8 to 3.1 billion, so it was kind of a fairly modest increase.\nWere there sort of any assumption changes around tax equity utilization, or do you anticipate another IRP update would be needed for more fundamental changes to the clean energy outlook? Thanks.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Shar. The $15.5 billion plan, as you indicated, includes Covert and a nice tranche of renewables. I'll also point out from a VGP perspective, that's that large customer renewable program. It includes the first tranche of that as well. Happy to dive in a little bit deeper here. Remember this, that Covert and our renewables build is spelled out in our integrated resource plan. That's the nature of this five-year plan, both from our renewables and the development of renewables, the Covert acquisition, as well as storage and storage deployment. That's set.\nThat IRP really serves as the prudency review, and then we go through the regulatory cases to recover on those. That plan reflects that. Now, your specific question on the IRA, that's additional benefit for our customers. As we've shared, that production tax credit offers savings directly on the execution of that plan. By 2026, that's about $60 million a year of savings for our customers. That IRP, when we originally filed, it was around $600 million or settled it, I should say, it was around $600 million of savings for our customers. That only grows as a result of the production tax credit and the IRA. That's the nature of how we're applying that. I would remind you\nas well, based on AMT, we don't anticipate being subject to AMT for really the remainder of the decade, the way that's framing up.\nI don't know, Rejji, do you want to add any additional comment to Shar's question?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nNo, I think you laid it out pretty well, Garrick. The only thing I would add, Shar, is you did ask about tax equity. At the utility, we're not assuming tax equity for financing for any of these projects.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGot it. Okay.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Lastly, just a question on your updated guidance and sort of the embedded assumptions. You're showing $0.04 of cost savings as a driver for 2023, but also highlighted roughly $30 million or about $0.10 of cost savings related to Karn one and two coal retirements. What level, I guess, of cost inflation is embedded in the $0.04? Is there a headwind on labor, materials? More importantly, how are you sort of thinking about that O&M flex beyond that $0.04?\nIs it closer to the $58 million you achieved in 2022? Thanks.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYes, for sure. I'll cover most of this, and if Garrick wants to add, he certainly can. To answer your last question first, we're assuming around $45 to $50 million of cost reductions attributable to the CE Way. That's what we have embedded in the plan. We've been pleased to observe over the last several years now that we're at a run rate now of about $45 to $50 million, which we hit really in the pandemic. Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention. Prior to the pandemic, the run rate was about $10 million of O&M reduction, and then we had a really nice inflection point during the pandemic of about $40 to $45 million of CE Way-driven savings, and we've held\non to that for some time.\nThat's the working assumption embedded in the plan. I would say Q1 and Q2, we do anticipate those savings coming through. We'll see some of that in our power supply costs with just less coal procurement, but also, obviously, on the O&M side, there's clearly less staffing attributable to gas plants versus coal. You'll see some of the savings there. That's largely the inputs that we have flowing through that cost productivity line item or the $0.04 that you're seeing in the waterfall from 2022 to 2023. Is that helpful?\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nIt is. That's helpful, Rejji. Thank you, guys. That's all I had. Congrats on the quarter. Appreciate it.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey. Good morning, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nJust wanted to start off by digging into DIG a little bit, if possible. If I look at slide 20 here, just wondering if you could walk us through. Is this in plan or is this upside the plan? If you could elaborate a little bit, I guess, the future plan for DIG, what flip to the market, or do Michigan customers want the asset? Just trying to see what's happening there. What could happen there?\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI like the way you teed that up. We're going to dig into DIG. It's kind of like my Ferrari comment when I talk about DIG. I mean, you may not know this, but the DIG plant itself is right across from the River Rouge plant where they make the Ford Lightnings. I just happened to get me a Ford Lightning about three weeks ago.\nIt performs well, better than Ferrari. I'll tell you that. We're going to call it the Ford F-150 Lightning in the garage from now going forward. Bottom line, here's what we do at DIG, and it's been a historical practice which really serves us well. We layer in capacity contracts, multi-year capacity contracts, and energy contracts over time. As everyone knows, energy prices and capacity prices have been continuing to rise. There's that upward pressure in there. As we layer in these contracts, it's provided additional benefit, additional return from that facility. That's what we're reflecting, those contracts that have already been inked, you might say, for the improvement in\nperformance.\nNow, we anticipate that to continue to improve as we layer in additional contracts, particularly in we're about 50% contracted both for energy and capacity if you get out to the year 2026, 2027 in that timeframe. There's potential for upside there. I'll have Rejji walk through what that upside looks like here in just a moment. Why don't you do that, Rejji, and then I'll conclude.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Just to go back to the page you referenced, Jeremy, page 20 in the deck, you see these dark blue bars here at around $30 million. That's a pretty good run rate for the economics we have locked in through capacity and energy contracts, as we're noting here in 2023. As you get to the outer years of the plan, you see these light blue sensitivities in the stacked bar chart.\nThat represents the opportunity if we start to see continued tightening and therefore improved economics in the bilateral market. In the event we see capacity prices go to about $4.50 per kilowatt month, you can see the incremental upside here from a pre-tax income basis. If it gets closer to cone, and I'll remind everyone that Zone 7 is priced pretty much at cone for two of the last three planning resource auctions, you could see us at a higher level than that with about $25 million upside. As Garrick noted, we wouldn't see those economics until the outer years of the plan, but clearly there's some opportunity as margin opens up in sort of the 2025, 2026, 2027\ntimeframe.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nLet me just conclude there. That upside's not in the plan, just to be really clear about that.\nTo the degree there is upside, I want to make sure everyone's clear. There's no sugar highs, right? We deliver 6% to 8%, and we have confidence toward the high end. I just want to be clear on expectations going forward.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nThat's very helpful there, thanks. I just want to continue, I guess, with kind of later-dated elements of the plan here. Looking at the back half of the plan, growth drivers outside of rate-based, can you walk us through timeline for clarity on the pieces there? Just wondering if there's conservatism on those items as we look at kind of outside of rate-based growth later data.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, and just thank you for the question, Jeremy. Just for everyone's reference, this is the content we have on slide six of the deck.\nWe've always talked about the additional growth drivers beyond rate-based as a result of the very constructive legislation we have in Michigan. There's the energy waste reduction opportunities that we have, and we earn economic incentives on that. There's a financial compensation mechanism that we get on PPAs that has been solidified now in two integrated resource plans. There's the 10.7% ROE that we get on renewable projects associated with the Renewable Portfolio Standard of Michigan, which we're still executing on. There's additional contribution from NorthStar. All of those offer growth to our earnings profile above and beyond what we get in\nrate-based. That 7% or so you're seeing for rate-based growth, these would be additive to that. I would say you get steady contribution for the majority of these, Jeremy, to get to your question.\nWith respect to energy waste reduction, we do expect that to increase gradually over the course of the plan. The PPAs, those will actually ramp up as we do more solar on the contracted side attributable to the IRP. We'll see probably more front-end loaded, the wind opportunity, and then just steady growth at NorthStar. That's really how you should think about the economic opportunity for those non-rate-based opportunities over the course of the plan.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Jeremy.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Julian DeMerlin Smith from Bank of America. Julian, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nHeidi Hawthorne\n\nProject Manager, Bank of America\n\nHi. Good morning. This is Heidi Hawthorne for Julian. Thank you for taking your question.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey hi.\n\nHeidi Hawthorne\n\nProject Manager, Bank of America\n\nMy first question is hi, how are you?\nMy first question is to just elaborate on the DIG economics and the opportunity there. How do you see the move from a seasonal auction in MISO to a seasonal auction in MISO from an annual auction kind of impacting that opportunity, if at all? How should we think about that there?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. We are assessing MISO's new rules around sort of the seasonal auction. I still think when you cut through it, whether it's a historical process or the new process, you're still going to see a continued tightening of Zone 7. It's still a peninsula. You still have limited transmission importation access in the southern border, and you still have coal retirements. When you have that sort of construct, you're going to see just an imbalance between supply and demand. DIG will start to open up in those outer years.\nWe anticipate, as I said before, that we'll potentially see more attractive economics as energy and capacity start to free up in the outer years of the plan. The degree to which it's more attractive, we'll see. I think, obviously, it's early days. We certainly think what we're showing on the page and that slide 20 offers at least a representative or is at least indicative as to where prices may go if we see continued tightening. Again, those light blue bars, that upside opportunity is not incorporated in our plan, to be very clear.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nJust to add to that, that old seasonal construct is out there to address resource adequacy. The capacity that has been applied over units has the potential to actually reduce some capacity of units.\nThe need grows, certainly in the short to midterm, across all of MISO, including Zone 7. The value of a place and a facility like DIG should only improve for Rejji's comments.\n\nHeidi Hawthorne\n\nProject Manager, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you. That's helpful. Switching gears a bit here, can you quantify the aggregate voluntary regulatory mechanisms in 2022? As we think about the updated 2023 guidance range, do you have any voluntary mechanisms embedded in the range at this time?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, to answer your last question first, Heidi, we do not presuppose any VRM for the 2023 waterfall, or sorry, for our 2023 guidance, and none of that's incorporated in the waterfall, I should say. With respect to the components of the voluntary refund mechanism, we just filed that earlier this year. To be clear, it's $22 million.\nWe're going to allocate a portion of that towards excess capital investments over the course of 2022 attributable to emerging capital work like asset relocations, demand failures, and new business. That's a portion of it on the electric side. We allocated the balance of it towards our gas customers, particularly those who are most vulnerable. We think that's a very prudent use of those resources during these challenging times for customers. That's really the spirit of it. Were you also getting at the electric rate case settlement commitments as well?\n\nHeidi Hawthorne\n\nProject Manager, Bank of America\n\nYes. Yes, correct. The donations as well as how we should think about kind of what informs the guidance. Yeah. There's none of that incorporated into the 2023 guide either.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nJust to round out the numbers here, in the electric rate case settlement, we committed to a $15 million bill credit that will benefit customers in 2023. Again, we recognized the expense of that in 2022. There was a $10 million, again, of low-income customer support, again, recognized in 2022, and customers will benefit from that over the course of this year. That's really how it works. None of that is presupposed in our 2023 guide.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIf I pull up and look at the big picture here, this is why the Michigan regulatory construct is so strong. You have these mechanisms, whether it's the settlement or whether it's voluntary refund mechanisms, that allow us to de-risk the future year and offer additional customer benefit. That's exactly what this $47 million is.\nThis gives us, this is why I'm so confident, we're so confident in our ability and the outlook for 2023.\n\nHeidi Hawthorne\n\nProject Manager, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you so much, and congrats again on the results today.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Heidi.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Michael Sullivan of Wolf Research. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael P. Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nHey, everyone. Good morning.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Michael. How are you today?\n\nMichael P. Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nGood. Good. Thanks, Garrick. One thing I picked up on in your comments up front, Garrick, was I think you said an improved approach on the regulatory side as kind of being key to some of the settlements last year. Can you just give a little more color on what you meant by that and what that means going forward in terms of being able to consistently settle?\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, you remember Q4 call last year.\nI was in this spot, and we were saying, hey, we need to improve. We didn't get the best order out of the commission. We said a couple of things on that call. One, we need to improve our testimony in our business cases. We did that. We took two months. We delayed the case by two months, and that's exactly what we worked on. We also adjusted our approach for the electric rate case and how we deliver that and interface with the staff on it. That was a learning that we took from our integrated resource plan filing. We extended that to our electric rate case. As we got to August and we saw staff position, it was a very constructive staff position\nbecause of all the work that had been done, the testimony in business cases, the improvement that had been done.\nThat was the foundation. Once you have that constructive foundation, that constructive point where staff is, then it's really an opportunity to work through settlement. That's exactly what we did, working with a number of interveners: the attorney general, the staff, business community, residential community, as well as a number of environmental interveners to really have a very constructive outcome with this electric rate case. As I look forward, we're going to continue to deploy those methods. We're going to continue to improve the process going forward so that we can set ourselves up for settlement, or if we have to go to the final order, that we can\nget a constructive order.\n\nMichael P. Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks. That's really helpful.\nJust shifting to the CapEx plan and the clean energy spend, can you guys just quantify how much on a megawatt basis of renewables you're looking to add over the plan and what that looks like in terms of split between solar, storage, wind?\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI'll take a crack at it here, and Rejji will jump in a little bit too. In our IRP, obviously, we're replacing coal. I'll just kind of walk through the whole piece of it so you can see every component of it. We're going to add about 1.2GW. That's the Covert facility. We got this RFP out there for 700MW. 500 is dispatchable, 200 is renewables, which we'll have a PPA for. That'll get a financial compensation mechanism on that portion of it.\nIn addition to that, we got about 1.2GW of renewable buildout in that plan. That's spelled out in our IRP. Again, 8GW over the longer piece, but 1.2GW roughly in that five-year window. That's a mix of wind, solar, and then bottom line, we have also in here what I call energy efficiency and demand response. Those also play out in that window as well. If you're doing the math on this, we're also keeping Carbon 3 and 4 around. That's part of it as well. That's just more of a capacity look. We're in the process of constructing a wind farm right now. That's part of our renewable portfolio standard. That's the one Rejji mentioned in his comments. It's under construction.\nThat's about a couple hundred megawatts of that plan.\nThe remainder out there is roughly solar and solar build. I will add this. Shar asked this question earlier, and I did not finish it, but we also have in this plan roughly 300MW of voluntary green pricing. This is our large customer renewable program. We have talked about this over previous calls. It is about 1,000MW we have ability to build, and we have to have subscriptions for that. We have our first, you might say, tranche of subscriptions, and then we are building the first, over the course of this plan, we are building the first 300MW. Is that helpful?\n\nMichael P. Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nVery helpful. I am all set. Thanks a lot, Garrick.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nMichael, the only bit I would add is that you asked about storage as well. I think Garrick enumerated every last bit, and I will just add storage. We are assuming around 75MW of storage in the plan.\nI mean, obviously, longer term for the IRP, we'll do more than that. Over the course of this five-year plan, about 75MW. Okay.\n\nMichael P. Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nThanks again. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Andrew, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHow's the new baby?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nNew baby's asleep.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nGood. He's sleeping through the night this week. It's a miracle. I just want to elaborate on an earlier question about the non-rate-based drivers. I guess my question is, what are the offsets? If rate base is growing faster than 7%, plus these adders, you're clear that we shouldn't expect more than 8% growth, no sugar highs. What's keeping the growth below 8%? Is it the equity in the outer years or something else?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nAndrew, hi. It's Rejji.\nThe only thing I would add is that to Garrick's comment, if you ever need help getting your baby to sleep, feel free to play back this call. We try to make these calls for the extent of it. To get to your question, I would say, yes, you will see some equity dilution in the outer years of the plan. As I mentioned, we'll be getting up to $350 million of equity from 2025 through 2027. That's some of the offset to the non-rate-based opportunities. We will have some parent funding costs in the outer years of the plan beyond equity. We'll start issuing a little bit of debt, and that's the other bit as well. I'd say it's largely on the funding side. I think that's helpful. Yeah.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIf I could just add to it, it's also the mindset that we have that we've got great mechanisms in the state in this construct with the VRM that allow us to offer benefit in the next year, both for our customers and for our investors. That really helps to de-risk. That's another reason why we think about it towards really the long term versus one year and a sugar high. Sounds good.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nOn the equity, the number went up. It was up to $250 million. Now it's up to $350 million in 2025 and beyond. Just wondering what's the driver of that increase. I know it's up to, but why the change?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. It's a good question, Andrew. Just to be clear here, obviously, the capital investment plan has increased materially from the prior vintage. We were $14.3 billion.\nIn the prior five-year plan, we're now $15.5 billion. We're effectively addressing the Covert needs, and that drives about $800 million of that increase. The balance, we still have incremental investment opportunities above and beyond Covert. It's really to balance out the funding for that additional CapEx, and obviously maintain our credit metrics kind of in that mid-teens area, which we've always targeted per my prepared remarks. I will also say our general rule of thumb, obviously, is we always want to avoid block equity. We still think even at that level of up to $350 million per year, even where the market cap is right now, that's sub 2%. In a perfect world, the market cap\nwill continue to grow, and it will be much smaller relative to the market cap at that point.\nWe think we can dribble that out comfortably without any overhang or material pricing risk.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nAgreed. It's definitely not a risk. Just trying to understand, though, does that mean it's going to be more than $250 and less than $350 the way you see it now?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nI would say up to $350, yeah, per year.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nFair enough. Thank you very much.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Morning. I was wondering if you could just specify what you're assuming for load growth in the latest outlook. You had some good commentary, too, about industrial activity in the state. What are the recent trends you've been experiencing with Rejji and CNI activity as well?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, David, this is Rejji. I'll take that.\nLet me start with what we saw last year. It was very consistent with our commentary over the course of each quarter. We just continue to see good low growth on a weather-normalized basis in Michigan. We were down about 1% for residential, as we had been highlighting. That was actually a little better than planned. On the commercial side, we were up over 1.5%. Industrial, excluding one large low-margin customer, was up over 2.5%. All in, about a point or 1% on a blended basis. Our expectations are, I'd say, a little tempered going into 2023. We anticipate being a little south of that. We would say probably flat to slightly up all in. Rejji continuing to come in as\npeople continue to go back to work.\nStill, commercial, I'd say roughly half a point, and industrial between 1.5 to 2%. We still anticipate decent load growth. That does not include any of the robust economic development opportunities that we see in our pipeline at the moment as a result of the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to see a lot of activity, whether it's semiconductor fabs, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks, battery, EV battery supply chain, or other energy-intensive businesses. We do hope that we'll see some more lumpy load opportunity in the outer years of the plan. More to come on that.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I just would add to that under Rejji's good comments there. The CHIPS Act and the IRA and even the IIJA, well, that's a soup of acronyms there.\nBottom line, they've helped our business, and they've helped a number of other businesses here in the state from a growth perspective. In addition to that, we've been working closely with the legislature, with the governor's office. There are site incentives that really make our state as competitive as other states that are offering site incentives. That comes in terms of not only investment in the site from a state perspective, but also incentives to locate here, which have been very helpful. We introduced an economic development rate, which further encourages growth here in the state. We're seeing some nice low growth over the last year in\ncommitments to Michigan. I expect more here in short order. I'm excited about that and what that means for our state, both from an investment perspective, growth perspective, and particularly jobs perspective.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for all that color.\nVery helpful. I was just wondering, just looking out to the equity needs later in the plan and the balance sheet and cash flow at that point, I was wondering, are there any cash flow impacts that come over time, potentially from IRA or as you start ramping up renewables and with tax credit dynamics? Anything that could help operating cash flow, free up cash flow to further invest at that point that we should think about just as your investment profile shifts in that direction?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. It's a good question, David. We currently are assuming about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the duration of this plan, so a healthy level. That's kind of run rate $2.5 billion or so per year.\nClearly, we'll benefit, as Garrick noted earlier, from just lower costs as a result of the production tax credits we'll now apply to solar investments. Whether there's incremental upside opportunity for OCF, we'll see. We try to plan conservatively, and we feel pretty good about the estimates for OCF and the fund financing plan going forward. I think it's also worth noting that we don't anticipate being a material payer of federal taxes through the duration of this plan. We'll be a partial taxpayer as you start to get to 2024 and 2025, but federal tax cash payments are not a material source of outflow over the course of this plan. That's kind of been sort of our norm\nfor some time now. The team continues to do very effective tax planning to minimize that outflow.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director and Infrastructure Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, team. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning Durgesh.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director and Infrastructure Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, good morning, Garrick. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, just Rejji, I want to go back to the equity financing plan. The CapEx in both 2025 and 2026 was raised by $100 million, and that seems to all sort of go to the equity from $250 to $350 million. Did the assumptions change on cash flow, or did anything else change, or you're just building some flexibility in the plan? If you could just talk to that, please.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy",
    "content2": "I would say it's more flexibility than anything else. I mean, I would say it's not as formulaic as a $100 million increase in the given year equates to a full 100% equity financing.\nI think it's more you see about $400 million-plus of incremental capital investment above the prior plan and exclusive of Covert. We're just trying to fund that as thoughtfully as possible. It's not as formulaic as incremental $100 million in 2025 and therefore incremental $100 million. It's much more there's a little more art in it than that. I would just say it gives us some flexibility. Hopefully, we don't have to do as much of that. For now, the guidance is up to $350 million per year. We think that prudently funds the business and keeps those credit metrics in the mid-teens level to keep the credit ratings we have that we've worked very hard to achieve.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director and Infrastructure Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAwesome. That makes sense. Maybe just on slide 12 here, the $0.19 to 0.25 usage non-utility tax and other.\nCan you give a little bit of a more detailed breakdown of what's usage and some of the other items if you can?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Usage, non-weather sales, I just provided that in the other question. Like I said, it's flat to slightly up. I would say about a quarter or 25 basis points up all in. We expect residential down over 0.5% as folks come back to pre-pandemic levels. You've got commercial up about half a point and 1.5% to 2% for industrial, again, excluding one large low-margin customer. The other big bucket within that $0.19 to $0.25 is just, remember, we had a lot of discretionary activities in the fourth quarter. Namely, you've got the VRM, which was $22 million, and another $25 million of electric rate case commitments.\nAll in, that $47 million of Q4 flex is about $0.12 that does not need to take place in the fourth quarter of this year. When you think about that comp of Q4 2022 versus Q4 2023, you see a lot of that in there. I'd say it's a combination of those sort of discretionary items that don't need to recur. Then you've got the, I'd say, relatively modest load assumptions. We've got a little bit of uptick in NorthStar as well. That's the other component of that. As you can see, we delivered actuals of $0.12 per share at NorthStar in 2022, and the guide for this year, 2023, is $0.13 to 0.16. That's a piece of it as well. It's really those pieces. Does that help?\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGot it. The usage? Yeah, absolutely.\nUsage and half of it looks like the Q4 flex from 2022 to 2023, and then a couple of pennies at NorthStar.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nManaging Director and Infrastructure Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nBingo. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time, guys. Thank you.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Anthony Croto from Mizuho. Anthony, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Mizuho)\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nAnytime.\n\n[Analyst] (Mizuho)\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nJust hopefully two quick ones. One was on DIG. Is there a desired amount of capacity you want to leave open in the plan? Do you look longer term and say, we want to keep 50% open or 40% open, or are you guys more opportunistic on that?\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, right now, if you look at 2023, 2024, 2025, it's 100% or pretty close to it. We want to, in the upcoming two to three years, fully subscribe from a capacity and energy perspective.\nAs you layer in contracts, by the time you get out to 2025, 2026, it approaches 50%. There's room there. Absolutely, we're going to take advantage of opportunities in the energy and capacity markets to layer that in. Some longer-term contracts to really take advantage of the opportunity out there with energy and capacity prices. Does that help, Anthony?\n\n[Analyst] (Mizuho)\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nYep. Absolutely. Lastly, I want to maybe look a little longer here. Your next IRP filing, I mean, the IRP that you guys finished, I guess, I don't know, 2022 or 2021, very successful, transformational. What's the timing of the next IRP, and what's that going to look like?\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt just feels like I got through that this year with the settlement. I'm celebrating. I'm still in my victory lap of that IRP. It was a landmark.\nYou're asking about the next one? Yeah.\n\n[Analyst] (Mizuho)\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nPark the Lightning in the garage before you do the victory lap. Yeah.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe have to be in there within five years. It's usually a three- to five-year window. We don't have a plan yet on when that'll be. It usually helps to be in around three years just because of the timing of the cycles and of recovery. No set time yet at this point, Anthony. Sorry, I can't give you a date yet. We'll work towards it here in the next few years.\n\n[Analyst] (Mizuho)\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst and Equity Strategist, Morningstar Research Services LLC\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Travis. Good morning.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst and Equity Strategist, Morningstar Research Services LLC\n\nActually, a couple of questions ago, you answered my question about unpacking that other $0.19 to $0.25 on next year's earnings. Just one quick follow-up to that. The usage, so that's $0.07 on the 1% change in the electric side, especially. Is that on the numbers that you talked about in terms of what's in the guidance, or is that incremental to what's on that guidance? Do you understand that question?\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, I do follow you. Yeah. The sensitivities that you see, Travis, on page 15, just highlight what the EPS impact would be if we saw another point, good or bad, relative to plan. The sensitivity around on the electric side is about $0.07 for every 1%. Now, it obviously depends on the mix.\nWe're assuming, like I said, for the usage, about 0.25% up on a blended basis, with Resi coming down a little over 0.5%, commercial about 0.5% up, and then industrial 1.5% to 2%. For modeling purposes, that's sort of the base case. If we saw any deviation, that's what the sensitivity provides visibility on. Does that address your question?\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst and Equity Strategist, Morningstar Research Services LLC\n\nYeah. Yeah. Absolutely. That could be weather sensitivity, right? That's not necessarily just weather. Normally, that would be weather benefit or detriment. Yeah. That's exactly right. Very good. Yeah. That's all I have. Appreciate it.\n\nRejji P. Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions at this time. I'm going to go back to Mr. Garrick Rochow to fill completing remarks.\n\nGarrick J. Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Adam. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call.\nCertainly hope to see you on the road over the next coming months. Take care and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines. All right, here we go."

    "content": "Q3 2022 CMS Energy Corp Earnings Call\n\nQ3 2022 CMS Energy Corp Earnings Call\n\nCMSNYSEOCT 27, 9:30 AM\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nBefore I get into specifics, I want to start with our simple investment thesis, which continues to stand the test of time. You've seen this in our calls and meetings, and you've seen the result: it works. This is where we put our words into action. We remain firmly committed to leading the clean energy transformation. As I mentioned on the Q2 call, the approval of our IRP was a proof point, evidence that we have a clear pathway supported by the regulatory construct to deliver on our leading clean energy commitment. Our investment thesis is fueled by our commitment to eliminate waste, driven by the CEWA. I'd put us up against anyone in our ability to take cost out. This year, we are on track to take $50 million of O&M waste out of the business.\nThe CEWA is critical to delivering our operational and financial performance, and keeping our service affordable for our customers. Another critical element is our top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. In Q2, we not only delivered our IRP, but we also settled our gas rate case. In this quarter, we received constructive feedback on our pending electric rate case, further evidence of the health of the Michigan regulatory environment. A key part of our investment thesis, which we do not talk about enough, is our diverse and attractive service territory. I'm excited about both the pace and impact of new growth in Michigan. Just this month, our governor announced that Gotion, a global electric vehicle battery manufacturer, selected Michigan for its US expansion over many other states, highlighting another example of onshoring manufacturing within the state. This project is expected to add over 2,000 jobs and provide $2.4 billion of investment.\nIn August, President Biden joined Governor Whitmer at Hemlock Semiconductor, headquartered here in the heart of our service territory. Together, they announced an executive directive to guide the implementation of the CHIPS Act, which will boost domestic chip production and bolster Michigan's leadership in the semiconductor industry. Let me put that into perspective. Hemlock is one of the largest polysilicon manufacturers in the world, and one-third of the world's chips are made from polysilicon produced at that facility right here in Michigan. In September, Hemlock announced plans to grow its operation. The project is expected to add 170 jobs and $375 million of investment in the state. Ground has already been broken on the expansion. Also, the expansion of SK Siltron, now in operation, a semiconductor wafer manufacturer, bringing 150 jobs and over $300 million of investment to the state. These are highlights over the quarter.\nFrom the map on the slide, you can see we've secured over 80 agreements year-to-date, which translates to roughly 200MW of new or expanding load in our service territory. This growth is bolstered by collaborative and innovative economic development efforts, supported by competitive rates for energy-intensive customers, and robust policy, which continue to drive growth. Our work with the governor's office, the legislature, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, and the Commission has made it possible for Michigan to not only compete but win investment and new jobs. These economic tailwinds are just a few of many we've seen and continue to see across Michigan. They will help attract more business, grow industrial, commercial, and residential load, and ultimately provide long-term bill relief for all our customers. Our strong commitment to decarbonize both our gas and electric systems is a key differentiator for CMS Energy.\nThe recently passed Inflation Reduction Act is another catalyst for our clean energy transformation, supporting the deployment of renewables and lowering costs for our customers. We see a lot of benefit in this new legislation. The extension of tax credits for both wind and solar provides economic certainty and lowers costs for our robust renewable backlog within our IRP, which includes 8GW of solar, as well as the remaining 200MW of wind we are constructing to meet Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. Production tax credits for solar projects will drive cost competitiveness for utility-owned projects versus PPAs. As we build scale, this cost competitiveness should enable us to own and rate-base a greater portion of future IRP solar investments. The investment tax credit for storage will lower costs and provide greater flexibility as we're able to site storage strategically across the grid.\nOur IRP includes 75MW of battery storage beginning in 2024 and could accelerate or increase to 550MW of battery storage through 2040. These tax advantages reduce the cost of new solar roughly 15%, providing annual cost savings of $60 million versus our plan. Also, with the use of tax deductions and credits, we do not expect a material impact in the alternative minimum tax through the remainder of the decade. All of this helps our customers with more savings. It supports our commitment to grow Michigan, drives the transformation to clean energy, and our growing voluntary green pricing program. Bottom line, this legislation is a great tailwind across the board. Now, let's get into the numbers. Year to date, we've delivered $2.29 of adjusted earnings per share and remain ahead of plan.\nWith confidence in this year, we're raising the bottom end of our guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.89 per share. For 2023, we are initiating our full-year preliminary guidance of $3.05 to $3.11 per share, which reflects 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of our revised 2022 guidance, and we expect to be toward the high end of that range. Remember, we always rebase our guidance off actuals, compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. Our long-term dividend growth remains at 6% to 8%, with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. We'll provide you with an update on our guidance, as well as a refresh of our five-year capital plan on the Q4 call early next year.\nLastly, we are confident in both our outlook and our ability to deliver our financial and operational targets for the remainder of the year, which brings me to my last slide. In a few weeks, Michigan will have elections across the state. New people will join the legislature. We'll also see the results of the race for governor. Whatever the outcome, we will work effectively as we have for decades with whoever holds office. You've heard us say it before, we deliver, regardless of conditions, nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance. You can count on CMS Energy for that. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to offer additional detail.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, our third-quarter results are a continuation of the strong performance we have delivered throughout the year, keeping us ahead of plan and positioning us well to achieve our financial objectives in 2022. To elaborate, year to date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $662 million or $2.29 per share, up $0.11 per share versus a comparable period in 2021, largely driven by favorable weather, including more normalized storm activity in our service territory, and healthy economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on slide 8 provides more details on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As Garrick mentioned, our solid year-to-date performance has driven our revised 2022 adjusted EPS guidance, which reflects an increase in the lower end of the range to $2.87 from $2.85.\nOur 2022 adjusted EPS guidance has now been raised and narrowed to $2.87 to 2.89. As noted, favorable sales continue to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance, largely driven by weather equating to $0.13 per share of positive variance. Our strong sales were partially offset by planned increases in operating and maintenance for O&M expense, largely driven by customer initiatives, which are embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability, and our rate of decarbonization to the tune of $0.03 per share of negative variance versus the first nine months of 2021. It is worth noting that the aforementioned year-over-year increase in operating and maintenance (O&M) expense was partially offset by lower service restoration expense versus the comparable period in 2021, as anticipated.\nLastly, the $0.01 per share of positive variance in the final year-to-date bucket reflects higher non-weather sales at the utility attributable to continued strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, slightly offset by drag at the parent from our preferred stock dividend and select regulatory items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our revised full-year EPS guidance range. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a positive impact of about $0.08 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We are also assuming $0.11 per share of positive variance versus the fourth quarter of 2021, attributable to rate relief associated with the 1 October implementation of new rates from our constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year.\nThese estimates are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes, and interest expense. In addition to said costs, our plan assumes increased O&M expense in the fourth quarter versus 2021 for key customer programs such as vegetation management, one of the most effective measures to reduce system outages. I'll note that we're on course for a record level of vegetation management spend in 2022, given our focus on improving the reliability of our grid. We also expect to continue to benefit from normalized storm activity, which nets to $0.11 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021. To close out our assumptions for the remainder of 2022, we assume the usual conservative assumptions for our non-utility business, and weather-normalized load at the utility.\nWe have also maintained a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance, which, when coupled with our non-utility and load assumptions, equates to $0.17 to 0.19 per share of negative variance highlighted in the penultimate bar of the chart. As such, we have substantial financial flexibility heading into the final three months of the year, which increases our confidence in delivering for customers and investors in 2022 and beyond. Turning to our 2022 financing plan on slide 9, I'm pleased to report that we have successfully completed our planned financing for the year with $800 million of debt issuances at the utility priced at a weighted average coupon of 3.9%, which is well below indicative levels in the current environment.\nWhile our plan did not call for any financings at the parent this year, we opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts during the quarter at a weighted average price of $68 per share. Our timely execution of the equity forwards locks in attractive terms for the parent financing needs of the pending acquisition of the new Covert natural gas generation facility. The settlement of the equity forwards will largely occur in the first half of 2023, concurrent with the acquisition timing and in accordance with our recently approved integrated resource plan. Staying on the balance sheet, as we move into the winter heating season, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper. Needless to say, we'll continue to monitor market conditions to try to lock in attractive terms for future financing opportunities at the utility.\nLastly, it's important to highlight that we have no debt maturities or planned financings at the parent in 2023, and virtually no floating rate exposure outside of the utility, which largely insulates our income statement from future interest rate volatility. Our opportunistic, yet prudent, financing strategy reduces costs while limiting uncertainty in our cost structure, enabling us to fund our capital plan in a cost-efficient manner to the benefit of customers and investors. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Maxine to open the lines for Q&A.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Rejji. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We will proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone. We'll pause for just a second. Our first question comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, thank you. Thanks for the updates. First question, I think there's just been a lot of conversation about the recent opening of the docket for the Michigan storm audit process. Could you just give us an indication of the conversations you've had with the commission, kind of where their head's at, and what the potential range of outcomes could be here?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, thanks, Insoo, for your question. A couple of things on this, and I think it's important to understand, particularly in August here, had some storm. We performed well during the storm, again, it's catching a little media attention. I think one of the things that's really important to recognize here in Michigan is the impacts of the Great Lakes and what Lake Michigan does to the weather and storms. Also, just a longer-term trend we see is increasing wind speeds across Michigan, in part due to climate change. The bottom line is we see a real investment opportunity in resiliency. The commission has been supportive of many of the reliability and resiliency efforts in our electric rate case, but there's more to do. There's more to do in this space.\nI really view this as a collaboration where we can work to, again, I think we're both, both the commission and the company are well aligned here on what we need to do in terms of reliability and resiliency. I really view it as an opportunity where those opportunities are and create the path to improve that for our customers.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nIs there a set timeline on when we should have more clarity on the outcome from all of this?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThere's a first effort that's due here on 4 November. I would imagine the audit takes place over much of the fiscal year of 2023. I see it as a collaborative effort. We want the same thing, we have the same goal, and it's really aligned to make sure we have all the right measures and investments in place to achieve that goal and at the right speed and pacing.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. My last question, just thank you for the preliminary guidance on 2023 and pointing to that upper end. Should we think of, I guess, the Covert acquisition and the financing all embedded in that upper end? I guess what potential items could deviate from that range, even if it could be a potential upside from there? Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, the short answer is yes on Covert, and the financing is in that piece. I'm going to just step back and think of the bigger picture here and how I think about this and how we think about this as a company. This guidance here is 6% to 8%, and we expect it toward the high end. We really think that offers the premium across the sector. We've been doing this for 20 years of industry-leading financial performance. I think what's unique about us and, again, differentiates us and is a strength, and frankly, a premium, is that we rebase off of actuals. We do this time and time again. We're not into sugar highs. It's a long-term play where we're going to continue to deliver 6% to 8% toward the high end. I feel good.\nWe feel good about the guidance we've offered here today at $3.05 to 3.11. One more thing on this, I want to make sure everyone understands too that this is an important balance, a balance of our customers, other stakeholders like regulators, legislators, as well as you, our investors.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thank you so much.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Shah Porreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nShah Porreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Shah.\n\nShah Porreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nMorning, Shaw.\nMorning, morning. Just a question on IRA and, I guess, how that impacted your thoughts around the IRP. I mean, clearly, you guys highlighted the customer benefits and lower cost of solar, but does it or can it trigger, I guess, any sort of revision to the plan as it currently stands? Garrick, I think you may have alluded to a little bit of that in the prepared. In particular, do you have any sort of tax equity embedded in renewable spending, and do you have any opportunity to avoid tax equity where we could see potential increasing rate base?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nI'll tag team this with Rejji here. This IRA is really beneficial for our industry and beneficial for our customers. As you know, we've laid out our IRP to 8 gigawatts, the storage build. It's a nice plan. We go in every three to five years to revise that. In the short term, I really see the benefit of the IRA and this production tax credit flowing right to our customers. That's the $60 million per year versus plan. That, again, keeps our customers' costs low, frankly. Remember, this IRP had $600 million of savings already baked in over that, and this is incremental to that. Again, feel good about that. In respect to my other comments, we'll file/re-file our IRP in three to five years.\nWith the IRA, there's upside opportunities in terms of our tailwind opportunities in terms of pulling renewables forward, potentially pulling storage forward. We'll have to take a look at that. Again, I see this as a real advantage to utility-owned solar and storage versus PPAs. I know, Rejji, you may have additional comments today.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, sure. I would only add a couple of comments here. The other benefit too is just with the continuation of the tax credit for electric vehicles, well, that certainly could be a catalyst in accelerating the tipping point of electric vehicle proliferation in Michigan. Obviously, that would bring rate benefits as well because you're growing the denominator in that rate calculation and bringing kilowatt hours into Michigan, which we would welcome. There's a benefit there that should be, at some point, incorporated into our financials longer term. With respect to your question around financing, we are not presupposing any tax equity in our funding strategy. The IRA, there's been a lot of talk about the transferability of credits. I still think there's more guidance required from the IRS, and we'll see what type of market develops as a result of transferability of credits.\nWe certainly do have credits that we can monetize at some point, but at the moment, we're not presupposing any tax equity in our financing assumptions.\n\nShah Porreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, got it. Sorry, Garrick. Just a quick follow-up. I guess you guys have never had a shortage of capital growth opportunities. It's always been a function of bills and rates being that kind of governor, customer rates. I guess the $60 million incremental in customer savings, does that allow a pull forward of some of that spend because you have that incremental headroom, or do we have to wait for the additional IRP filing? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how that plays in.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, I don't think you have to wait to the IRP filing for that. It's really a function of how we build out our capital plan. As we've shared historically, we look at what the customer can afford, we look at how we can execute work, we look at the business cases, and we look at the mix, where we put in dollars strategically. There's a bottom-up build-up for that capital plan. As we're able to create more headroom, or as we have in the case of Affordable Bills, we'll look at how we put those important capital investments into the system that ultimately provide value for our customers. That's the balance we'll strike, and you'll see it as it plays out here in our Q4 call in the five-year capital plan.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, perfect. Maybe just a quick one for Rejji. Just, I guess, beyond the Covert purchase, as you guys are looking at your five-year plan and rolling in more IRP spending into plan, including renewables, do you anticipate any associated financing need or the issuance last quarter took care of those needs as we're thinking about the current plan and slightly beyond the current plan, I guess?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, appreciate the question, Shawn. Just for semantics, we haven't issued the equity yet. We just put in place forward contracts, so we've locked in the price. We'll issue, obviously, over the course of 2023 in the first half of the year. The forwards we've put in place really provide for the funding for the parent financing needs at Covert. We have yet to roll out, obviously, a new five-year plan. The current plan of $14.3 billion that we're executing on, as you may recall, we've been very consistent in our comments about the equity funding needs being limited to 2025 and 2026, about $250 million per year. Because of the sale of the bank last year, there's no equity needs prior to that. We'll see what happens when we start to update the capital plan.\nIn addition to the comments Garrick offered on how we think about the capital plan, affordability is a constraint we're mindful of. The other one is financing, and we don't want to over-lever, over-equitize the balance sheet. We'll be mindful of that. Obviously, just execution and feasibility of the capital plan, of executing on the capital plan, is the other thing we'll think through.\n\nShah Porreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. That last point was what I was trying to get at. Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate it. See you soon.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Shawn.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Shawn. See you at EEI.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood, good, thanks. Just wanted to talk a bit more on the 2023 EPS guide here, if we could, regarding the drivers. Just wondering if you could flesh out for us the contribution you see from Covert in 2023. When you're thinking about sales trends, what do you anticipate for sales trends for 2023? How does that compare to current trends? Just kind of trying to get a feel for upside versus downside drivers within the guidance range.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nSure, I'll start. I know Rejji will offer some context around it as well. Again, I want to remind everybody, as I stated earlier here, that it's 6% to 8% toward the high end, and we're pleased with that. That includes Covert. As we've said, the Covert strengthens and lengthens our plan here. When I think about this, this is, again, we're playing a long-term game here where we have consistency and repeatability of delivering industry-leading financial performance. That's how we're thinking about it as we move in 2023 and even in the outer years. Rejji, walk through some of the specifics, please.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, sure. Jeremy, again, appreciate the question. The Covert acquisition, as we discussed in Q2 of this year, we anticipate that being about $0.03 to 0.04 of EPS upside versus plan. The financing for the equity should offer a penny or two on top of that. That is all incorporated into the guide, as Garrick mentioned. We could spend more time on the details of that, but that is what is embedded in that $3.05 to 3.11 guide. With respect to sales, as you know, we plan conservatively. We are assuming, as it pertains to weather, that clearly this year so far has been quite good. We would anticipate a little bit of a headwind, just planning for normal weather versus what is a strong 2022 comp.\nOn the non-weather side, we've been surprised to the upside, really, starting with the pandemic. We've just seen a nice bit of upside in terms of favorable mix with residential load outperforming expectations the last couple of years. We'll plan conservatively and still assume that you see that pre-pandemic level of residential load. I think we're seeing very good momentum on the commercial and industrial side, and we would expect that to carry on into 2023. Those are the puts and takes with respect to covert and sales. The only thing I would add just to finish out on the drivers for 2023 is that clearly we had a constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year.\nWe should expect to see the benefit of that increase in rates, which, when effective 1 October of this year, flowing into the heating season in Q1 of next year, for the first three or four months of 2023. We've got a pending electric rate case and anticipate a constructive outcome there as well. These are the primary drivers: You've got Covert, conservatism on sales, and anticipate rate relief. Is that helpful?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYes, no, that's very helpful. I just wanted to pivot a little bit to battery storage if I could. Just wondering if you could provide some more thoughts on how you think the system need could potentially change over this decade, especially if renewable penetration ticks higher than planned from IRA benefits. Is there anything else you're watching out for on this front?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Jeremy. That's a great question. In our IRP, we have 75MW, and that has to take place in 2024-2027. We've already issued the RFP for that work, so that's well underway. You'll see inclusion of that in our five-year capital plan. What is nice about this ITC and the flexibility that's offered within the IRA is you can have standalone solar. Typically, it's been coupled with solar, so the ability to move storage around and have it be not just a supply asset, but to have it be a grid asset provides a greater amount of flexibility in how we use. You can see the value stacking of a storage of lithium-ion and other storage technologies. We look forward to that.\nWe're going to continue to look in our five-year plan, but also in the longer-term strategy on how we might accelerate or how we might think about differently the deployment of lithium-ion and other storage technologies. I know Rejji has some comments on this as well.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Jeremy, the only thing I would add is it's important to remember that the IRP is iterative in nature. We'll be filing one per the statute at a minimum every five years, but our bias will likely be to file sooner than that. The importance of that and the benefit of it is that as we see a potential descent in the cost curve, whether to Garrick's point, it's lithium-ion or any other storage technology, we could incorporate new assumptions in upcoming IRPs. We're assuming in the full plan over the next 15 to 20 years, about 550MW. Garrick noted the 75MW in the short term, but it's a larger portfolio longer term.\nIf the cost curve permits it, we'll look to pull some of that forward and potentially expand it, particularly with the optionality provided with the ITC, using it for standalone storage as well as opting out of normalization, which is helpful too.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Just a real quick last one, if I could. Just wondering what the potential impacts for ratepayers could be should Palisades successfully reopen, and does this change how you think about future customer savings should this transpire?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, I offer a couple of comments on Palisades. If we get into technical questions, like we don't own the plant, we don't operate the plant anymore, and we no longer have a purchase power agreement, which was a significant savings for our customers and power supply costs over the course of the year. Technical questions and related questions should be really directed to Holtec or maybe the Department of Energy. Bottom line, here's what we've shared with the Governor's Office and with the Michigan Public Service Commissions. We'll be open to a purchase power agreement. It has to be much more competitive and much more market-based than it has been historically. We would expect a financial compensation mechanism on that PPA as a new purchase power agreement. That's really what I'd offer on Palisades at this point.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Jeremy. See you at EEI.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Hey, listen, just maybe just starting—hey, thank you. Just starting with preliminary right? I want to focus on that word. Can you emphasize or can you piece apart why you use the word preliminary at the outset? What are the moving pieces in your mind if we can go back to that quickly in terms of when you pivot to a more finalized guidance, and what you're watching here in the next few months? Just want to clarify that.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, preliminary because we rebase off of actuals, and that's the short of it. As we wrap up Q4, which, again, year-end, I feel good about, we'll deliver within that guidance range we've provided, and then we'll rebase off of actuals. When I think about this year and this guidance, of course, we've tightened the guidance, raised the bottom end, which should be an indicator of confidence. I'm really thinking about the midpoint of that guidance and, again, managing the work. Imagine storms and other things that come our way that we typically deal with. We'll look for reinvestment opportunities also as we go through the remainder of the year. Those reinvestment opportunities de-risk 2023 and ensure a path of success for 2023. That's how it'll play out through the remainder of the year.\nI don't know if Rejji, you want to add to that.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Julian, the only thing I would add in addition to just it's Q3, we'll rebase off of actuals in Q4, and take into account any contingency deployment over the next couple of months. The other variables is obviously we have a pending electric rate case, and we'll have a little bit, a couple of months more of visibility into how that's trending. We're certainly in the process of evaluating potential settlement, and we'll see how things go there. At that point, we will have filed a gas rate case. We're still thinking through the size and implications of that, and we'll assume a constructive outcome there, but still some variables in place. That's the other bit of information we'd look for as we establish our 2023 final guidance on our Q4 call early next year.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you. If I can, just going back to the last question a little bit, can you talk about how any revisit of a contract with Holtec and/or Palisades could actually feasibly play itself out vis-à-vis your IRP and/or RFP processes? Obviously, it's a little bit less than traditional. I get that DOE's involvement is also less than traditional, but I just want to rehash a little bit how that would fit into your ongoing processes that are continually in flight and, admittedly, of late have somewhat been crystallized, at least in the near term.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nJust for context, and I know you know this, Julian, but for context for others on the call, there's 700MW within this IRP. That's 500MW that's dispatchable, 200MW of clean energy. That RFP has been issued. It was issued at the end of September. That's going to play out. It's done through a third party because of the potential for an affiliate transaction with the dig. That plays out. We anticipate those proposals to be submitted in the December timeframe. Those will be evaluated again by the third party. That will take to February. We anticipate we'll have some direction in that in the May timeframe. We'll likely share it at the May earnings call timeline. That's how it's going to play out. I do not know who will participate in that. Again, it's by a third party.\nShould Holtec choose to participate with the Palisades plant, if it comes in at a competitive price, it may be an option out there. Again, because it's not an affiliate, we would earn a financial compensation mechanism or a return on that. That's the approach that would play out here over the course of the next eight months.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. All right. I know I can't comment too much on it, but I appreciate it. Thank you guys very much. Good luck. Speak to you soon.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Ocaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Ocaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, David.\n\nDavid Ocaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYou alluded to it, but just any latest thinking on the electric rate case and potential for settlement? I was just curious what timing you would be contemplating for the next electric rate case filing at this point in terms of the gap between the rate cases here.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, just a little background too. I was really pleased with the team. We did a lot of work on this electric rate case to improve the quality of the case. I believe and see it's evident in the staff's position on that. It's a constructive starting point that they provided in August. As Rejji shared, we're looking at the potential for electric rate case settlement. That'll continue until the case is final. We anticipate PFD in December and then a final order in February. That's the current status. Just a longer, we have the opportunity, we're at a 10-month cycle. It'll be early in 2023 when we consider another filing, another electric rate case.\nThat's a little far out for us in terms of we want to see how this one plays out and make sure we're making the right investments for our customers.\n\nDavid Ocaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep, that makes sense. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could give the latest in terms of what you're seeing in terms of cost pressures from inflation, whether it be labor, materials, components, and just how that's impacting the O&M outlook here.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThat's a great question. I appreciate you started with our customers. That's a key piece. Let me give you a little facts here to this. In 2021, we had $75 million of state, federal, and some company funds that went to our customers. In 2022, that number was $79 million. Again, just for context, October to October is the fiscal year for state. I'm really pleased that we've been able to get money in the hands of our customers. You'll see from a quarter, our customers have a lower debt balance or bad debt balance on their bills. They're not carrying a big balance. In fact, from an uncollectibles perspective, we're in a quartile one position. I feel good because our customers are starting out in a better position. I'm certainly empathetic and sympathetic to their needs.\nWhat we know about our customers, when we look at their bill, about 80% of a gas bill is consumption. It's about 90% on an electric bill. We can influence that. We can influence that through our energy waste reduction, energy efficiency programs, and we are doing that. That's great for our customers. In addition, we're putting out 30,000 thermostats—Three thermostats for those that are most in need, vulnerable customers, to help them, again, control the use. We're pushing again with nonprofits and other state and federal funds. Our focus is clearly on our most vulnerable customers here in this time. Broadly as a company, and you asked the question, really, have we seen material prices increase? Absolutely. 7% year over year. There's a lot of things we're doing to mitigate that, particularly in the CEWA.\n$50 million of O&M waste reduction, approaching $90 million on a capital perspective. Our plants ran just again, they ran phenomenally over the summer months. They got a low heat rate, gas and coal. MISO was bouncing all around in the volatility of the market. Ours were steady state. We saved our customers $500 million year to date. Looks like $700 million by year-end. Again, we used our gas assets, all these storage fields to help manage gas cost impact. Those are the here and now. We have a whole host of episodic cost savings, $200 million. Palisades for PPA. Palisades PPA fell off. Karn retires. Karn 1 and 2 retires. $30 million of O&M there. IRA in that PTC. Again, I can go on and on.\nYou can see we're squarely focused on cost reduction for our customers, creating the necessary headroom so we make the right investments to improve the system, again, for our customers to manage that. I know Rejji has even more to offer.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Garrick, I think you covered all the key points on the cost side. The only thing I'll remind you, David, is that we're still looking at load opportunities as well. The announcement of Gotion from an economic development perspective, the global electric vehicle battery manufacturer out of China, that, as we see it, is the beginning of what is going to be likely a fruitful period of good economic development opportunities as a result of the good legislation passed over the past several months. The CHIPS Act and the IRA have really created a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring really good load opportunities to Michigan. That helps the equation as well. I mentioned earlier some of the benefits of the IRA. If it accelerates the tipping point for EV proliferation in Michigan, that helps the load equation as well.\nWe're looking at all the cost opportunities, as Garrick enumerated, but we're also looking at top line as well to reduce rates.\n\nDavid Ocaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. A lot of helpful points there. Thanks so much, and see you soon.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, thanks, David.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Travis.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nI was wondering, you highlighted, obviously, the business load that you see coming in, the industrial load. What does that mean in terms of mix of capital investment need or any kind of other need when you're thinking about distribution versus generation? Is that type of load something where you're looking at more distribution investment to serve it or more generation-type investment to serve it?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt's a little bit of both, but the immediate piece is really in the space of distribution. These companies are located in here. If you take HSC as an example, or Hemlock Semiconductor, they're building out that load right now. We're looking at the existing substation and how do we offer additional redundancy and build out. In the case of Gotion, again, they're constructing their facility, a little further behind from a start point. Again, you're going to be running electric line and build a substation dedicated to that facility. The first steps really show up in the distribution space for investment. You'll see those as part of our five-year capital plan to be able to, again, build and construct those. There's a beautiful part of the integrated resource plan.\nWe continue to look out 20 years and balance the demand needs and the supply needs. Right now, we look long on capacity, really through 2031. We have room to grow and add these investments. As Michigan continues to grow and we continue to add load, we'll make adjustments as we move forward in our subsequent IRPs from a supply side. Is that helpful, Travis?\n\nTravis Miller\n\nAnalyst, Morningstar\n\nYeah, that helps. It's exactly what I was asking. You answered everything else that I had to ask, so appreciate it. See you in a couple of weeks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nYep, take care.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji. Congratulations on a great quarter.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nShah Porreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThanks, Anthony.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nI apologize. This is real semantics. I understand if you just want to ignore the question. If I think about you talk about the IRP maybe strengthened and lengthened the CMS plan, and then when I fold over to earnings guidance of 6% to 8% towards the high end, if I look at 2023, where it's kind of preliminary, it's right now at 7% more than midpoint. I guess I'm trying to reconcile 6% to 8% towards the high end. Is that just take 6% out of your planning, out of our planning assumptions, or is 6% to 8% towards the high end 8%?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nI love your question. I'm not going to ignore it. Let's answer it. Let's go back in history a little bit, even pre-interbank. We got it at 6 to 8, and we always said we had a bias toward the midpoint. That's how we approached it. Now our language is definitely different. It's 6 to 8, and we expect to be toward the high end. That's the approach going forward. Again, we look for repeatability into that. As you saw in our 2023 preliminary guidance, it's off that midpoint of 2022, but again, we're saying 6 to 8, expect to be toward the high end. We'll rebase off actuals, as we always do.\nYou can expect year after year that we're going to be that consistency of industry-leading financial performance, that we're going to continue to guide in that 6% to 8% range, again, toward the high end. That's what I'd offer. Is that helpful?\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Last shot at it, and then I'm finished. If I look back in the last 18 years, you guys delivered very consistent 7%. Do you view the performance, when I look back 2018, that you hit the high end of that 6% to 8% range?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nI don't know what data you have in front of you, but I can only talk about what we have in the context of the call here in our 2023 guidance. We've said $3.05 to 3.11. I would expect that we would be to the high end of that range. Does that clear it up?\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nPerfect.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nI would not anticipate the midpoint. I would expect the upper half of that range.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho\n\nPerfect. Thanks so much, looking forward to seeing you in Hollywood.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nSee you there.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, everyone. Good morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nMorning, Michael. Hey. Just wanted to ask on just with your own renewables becoming more competitive post-IRA, I think the current plan has 50% ownership in there. What is the CapEx associated with that? If you were to be cost competitive across the board and go to 100%, what would that look like theoretically?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Michael, I assume you're asking about the full portfolio of 8GW. Is that fair?\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nIn the current, yeah, yeah, either way. Whatever is easiest for you. The current five-year plan, the IRP that just got approved.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. For the 8gigawatts, we've roughly quantified in the past that 50% ownership of that could be around $4 billion. Again, with cost curves reduced in the way they are, and that was a pre-IRA assumption, so presumably it could be a lower amount of CapEx. We would expect to own, as Garrick highlighted, greater than 50% over time if we continue to see the cost of owning continue to be more and more competitive with the cost of contracting. We'll revise those estimates over time. In the five-year plan, currently, we've got about $1 billion of solar in the plan. Obviously, we'll refresh the capital plan in the first quarter as we have our fourth quarter earnings call next year. We'll give an update then. The current plan had about roughly $1 billion in it.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's super helpful. Just kind of following along that, again, this is kind of theoretical, but if you start finding that you are more cost competitive more regularly here, do you limit that at all if that introduces more equity needs into the plan?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nCFO, CMS Energy\n\nThe current construct per the settlement agreement has a natural cap of 60%. It's effectively a collar from 50% to 60% for ownership. We wouldn't be able contractually to go above that now. In subsequent IRPs, we could potentially earn more than that. We'll revisit it, and particularly if we're cost competitive with contracted solutions, we'd like to think that ceiling could potentially come off. I would say Garrick highlighted this earlier. I emphasized it as well. When we think through the capital plan, the constraining factors are three things. It's affordability, so making sure that the rate increases are relatively modest as we execute on the capital plan. We also think about the feasibility of executing. We do not want to significantly grow our workforce to execute on the capital plan because that has structural cost implications.\nThere's an operational feasibility aspect we take into it. Then there's balance sheet. We would rather not over-equitize or over-lever the balance sheet in order to fund a capital plan. That's generally how we think about building out the capital plan. We'll take that into account as we construct this latest capital plan that we'll provide in the first quarter next year, and obviously subsequent capital plans after that.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, Rejji. Super helpful.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nCEO, CMS Energy\n\nThat concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.\nThanks, Maxine. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Look forward to seeing you at EEI in a few weeks. Take care and stay safe.\n\n[Operator]\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference.

The earnings news release issued earlier today, and the presentation used in this webcast, are available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at the time. If at any time during the conference you need to reach an operator, please press the star followed by zero. Just as a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00PM Eastern Time running through 4 August. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the investor relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Elliot. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm excited to share another strong quarter at CMS Energy in a great first half of the year, bolstered by favorable weather and higher weather normalized sales at the utility. Great tailwinds. Over the course of the quarter, two outstanding regulatory outcomes provide further evidence of the top-tier regulatory jurisdiction in Michigan and give us continued confidence in our plan. First, our integrated resource plan. If I could open this up for just a moment. Eighteen months of sophisticated supply modeling, thousands of pages of testimony, 10-month schedule, alignment across dozens of stakeholders, from interveners, the Attorney General, business stakeholders, and the commission staff to reach a settlement with close to 20 parties. This plan, approved at the end of June, solidly positions us to lead the clean energy transformation. Outstanding. Next, our gas rate case.\nImportant investments to ensure a safe, reliable, affordable, and clean natural gas system settled with many of the same parties and approved on 7 July. A $170 million increase, over 95% of our customer investment approved. Excellent. Both outcomes demonstrate the quality of our regulatory environment in Michigan, and increase our confidence in delivering the rest of the year and our long-term plan. I want to emphasize why we continue to be confident in our plan. Delivering is not new for us. We have nearly two decades of commitments made and kept for all our stakeholders, including you, our investors. A key element in our performance is strong energy law in Michigan. We have a productive and solid energy law passed in 2008, which was enhanced and updated in 2016, both with bipartisan support.\nThis allows for timely recovery of investments, which we've outlined through long-term plans such as our IRP, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution plans, which we've filed in our rate cases. This, coupled with separate mechanisms, allows us timely recovery of fuel and power supply costs, as well as attractive economics on renewable energy investments, energy waste reduction programs, and uniquely position Michigan as one of the safest places to invest capital. Let me be clear. We don't take this for granted. We continue to improve our processes for stakeholder alignment, testimony development, and business cases, so we are confident that our proposed customer investments deliver measurable benefits while keeping bills affordable. At CMS, we deliver. Our productive and supportive environment, and our deliberate approach, ensure that no matter the conditions, we are positioned to deliver industry-leading results.\nWe remain committed to leading the clean energy transformation. On the solid foundation of strong energy law, we delivered and settled our IRP. This makes us one of the first utilities in the country to completely exit coal. As of the end of second quarter, we have nearly eliminated our long-term economic exposure to coal, which is now less than 2% of property, plant, and equipment. Not only have we reduced our long-term financial risk, but we've significantly mitigated our operational risk as well. The acquisition of simpler, more flexible natural gas units means fewer people to operate, a better heat rate, and less maintenance. The ability to quickly ramp up and down the dispatch of these units will allow us to flex with changing market conditions, and to better support the intermittent nature of renewables.\nThe acquisition of Covert, combined with the RFP for 700MW of capacity through PPAs, the buildout of 8GW of solar, and our ongoing energy efficiency and demand response programs ensure that we have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our customers. This plan improves reliability, and limits our customers' exposure to potentially volatile capacity and energy prices. The IRP strengthens and lengthens our financial plan, eliminates our exposure to coal, improves reliability, and is a solid win for everyone. Strong execution and constructive regulatory outcomes lead to strong financial results. I couldn't be more pleased with the first half of 2022. As I stated in my opening remarks, a strong quarter and a great first half of the year where we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 for the quarter.\nWe remain confident in delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.85 to 2.89, and we continue to guide toward the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which, as I noted, is strengthened and lengthened by our IRP. We continue to guide toward long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8%, with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. We'll update our current $14.3 billion five-year customer investment plan on our year-end call to include the anticipated upside from the approval of our IRP. We are strongly positioned to deliver in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to offer additional detail.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a strong first half of the year, are ahead of plan, and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives over the next six months and longer term. To elaborate, for the first half of 2022, we delivered adjusted net income of $499 million, or $1.73 per share, up $0.09 per share versus our 2021 first half result, largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on slide seven provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As noted, favorable sales have been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.16 per share, driven by weather.\nFrom an economic standpoint, we've continued to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather normalized residential load continues to exceed our plan assumptions and pre-pandemic levels. Rate relief net of investment-related expenses contributed $0.03 per share of upside, as we continue to benefit from our prior gas and electric rate cases. These sources of upside were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses, largely driven by customer initiatives embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability, and our rate of decarbonization, which equated to $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the first half of 2021.\nWe'll also note the $0.03 per share of negative variance in the final year-to-date bucket, which is primarily driven by investment costs related to the 2019 rate compressor station incident, for which we are not seeking recovery at this time as per our recent gas rate case settlement agreement, and the company's recent commitment to donate $5 million in support of income-based bill assistance for our electric customers as per our IRP settlement agreement. These sources of negative variance are partially offset by the aforementioned strong non-weather sales performance in the first half of the year. As we look to the second half of 2022, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our EPS guidance range. As Garrick mentioned, we had a constructive outcome in our gas rate case.\nThe approved settlement agreement at $170 million significantly de-risked our financial plan, and when coupled with our December 2021 electric rate order, provides $0.10 per share of positive variance versus the second half of 2021. The forecasted rate relief net of investment-related costs in the second half of the year more than offsets our estimated impact of normal weather, which we assume will provide $0.01 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2021. Moving on to cost savings, we continue to anticipate lower O&M expenses at the utility, driven by the expectation of a more normalized level of storm activity this year versus the atypical levels experienced in 2021, which I'll remind you equated to $0.16 per share of downside in the third quarter of 2021 versus our financial plan.\nWe also expect the usual solid cost performance driven by the [Cost Efficiency and Workforce Adjustment], as well as other cost reduction initiatives in motion. To close out our assumptions for the second half of the year, we assume normal operating conditions at Enterprises given the outage at D. E. Karn in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the usual conservative assumptions for weather normalized load at the utility. Lastly, it's worth noting that we have accrued a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance, as illustrated in the $0.24 to 0.28 of negative variance highlighted in the penultimate bar of the chart, which increases our confidence in delivering for you, our investors. Moving on to the balance sheet, on slide eight, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from all three rating agencies. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens at the foot of debt over our planning period.\nAs always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which, coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow growth, supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning to our 2022 plan financings on slide nine, we continue to plan for $800 million of debt issuances at the utility. While our plan does not call for any financings at the parent this year, we are currently assessing funding options for the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility in the first half of 2023 as per our approved IRP. As a reminder, the current financing plan for Covert assumes the issuance of hybrid securities. However, we're evaluating alternatives, including using our existing ATM equity issuance program, given the relative costs in the current environment.\nIt's worth noting that this would be accretive to the previously provided $0.03 to 0.04 per share of EPS accretion attributable to the purchase of Covert and further strengthen our 6% to 8% long-term adjusted EPS growth outlook. Lastly, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper over the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before Q&A.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Rejji. I'll leave you with this: nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance for you, our investors. Regardless of conditions—administrations, political parties, economic environments, even a pandemic—we deliver. Our strong legislative and regulatory construct, a robust capital runway, industry-leading cost management, conservative planning, and our commitment to deliver across the triple bottom line, all of this makes for a strong investment thesis and makes us an investment you can count on. With that, Elliott, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone. We'll pause for just a second. Our first question comes from Shar Pereza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pereza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Shah.\n\nShar Pereza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYeah, pretty clear-cut print here, but just given sort of the regulatory outcomes that are now secured, like the IRP, the gas settlement, looks like the electric rate case is on track. As we're kind of thinking about maybe the cadence of updates, is the plan to still update CapEx and financing in the fourth quarter? I guess just given the visibility we have, why not provide a full guidance and capital update sometime in the third quarter or EEI timeframe? I guess, in other words, given the regulatory execution that you've clearly highlighted today, could you provide early indication on growth and 2023 numbers ahead of schedule?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, first of all, Shah, thanks for the compliments. We are executing well, and I am pleased with the first half of the year. We're still on plan for our Q4 call for our capital update. Let me offer a little color and context around that. The big reason for our execution and our ability to deliver year after year is one of the things we've worked through is that capital plan. That's from the bottom up. We're looking at every one of those capital investments to make sure that it's going to offer the affordability and benefits to our customers. They'll stack on one another. We want to make sure that we're also able to execute on those.\nThat's a matter of understanding our workforce, the work lined up in a year, and so that we're ensured that we can deliver on that capital plan. You add that IRP. Yes, there's Covert, which is great visibility. One of the other portions of that settlement was bringing in storage, battery storage, 75MW in the period of 2024 to 2027. We've got to make sure that that's constructed and built into this five-year plan, as well as we've spoken in the past about this voluntary green pricing programs, this additional renewables for some of our largest customers. That's materializing as well. That's another factor that's going into that plan. We want to make sure that we can deliver on it. That leads to the success of our execution.\nThat's why we're going to be putting it out in Q4, our Q4 call.\n\nShar Pereza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Got it. Obviously, looking at the results year-to-date and how 2022 is shaping up, July looks like a strong weather month. Obviously, you guys, as you highlighted, you have normal weather and plan for the remainder of the year. Does a strong third-quarter weather push you ahead of guidance? Maybe what are some of the offsets and moving pieces there that we should be thinking about? Just looking at the results to date, it seems like you're well ahead of your numbers, but.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nAgain, Shah, we feel good about where we're at here at the first half of the year. As you know, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan conservatively. Here's what I know. In 2021, during the third quarter, we lost $0.16 due to storms. We still delivered on 2021, yet there's a lot of year left. We are prudent as we move forward. The other thing we look at is where there are opportunities to reinvest to provide benefit for our customers and investors as we move toward the end of the year. That helps to de-risk future years and, again, continues to strengthen and lengthen that long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% toward the high end.\n\nShar Pereza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Terrific. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks, Rejji, too. Bye.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Jeremy.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Just wanted to pick up a little bit, I guess, with the strong results here. It did seem like load performance was just better than expected. Wondering if you could provide a bit more commentary on that. I guess, do you see any of that abating or just kind of things in general from a load, even absent weather, a load growth perspective is going to continue at this pace, or do you see something stopping?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, good morning, Jeremy. It's Rejji. Appreciate the question. Obviously, we feel quite good about the load trends we're seeing in our service territory. I'll just remind folks on some of the specifics. We had residential down a little over 0.5%. That's year-to-date versus year-to-date 2021. Commercial and industrial, and as always, our industrial excludes one large low-margin customer, up about 3%. All in, up about 1.5%. We feel quite good about that. Particularly with respect to residential, we continue to see that good stickiness with the hybrid workforce, which likely will be a trend that continues on. Obviously, that's a high-margin segment. Relative to 2019, residential's up about a little over 2%. Again, that stickiness just really carries on.\nWe continue to see, from an economic development perspective, just good activity in the service territory. Obviously, with some of the news in DC yesterday, I would think that the CHIPS Act and some of the other legislative items that may be coming down the pike could lead to more economic development opportunities or increase the probability of some of the stuff that is coming Michigan's way or is in the prospects for Michigan. Very encouraged with the load trends. Anecdotally, again, we're hearing from our customers that they continue to feel good about the economic environment. Feel quite good about the road ahead. Going forward, again, we continue to anticipate that you'll start to head back to those pre-pandemic levels. We would anticipate that from a residential perspective, but we continue to be surprised to the upside.\nCommercial and industrial continue to trend very well. That's our take on load at the moment.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIf I could just add just a macro factor here, and this is from the governor's office. Just year-to-date, $11.8 billion of investment opportunities announced in Michigan. Those are projects that have agreed to locate, expand. There's actually 30 companies in all, and 15,000 new jobs. That's out of the governor's office here mid-July. It still looks very robust here in Michigan when you look at it from a macro perspective.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful there. I just wanted to pivot a bit towards MISO. We've seen some capacity constraints there, and that's led to some delays in coal plant retirements. Just wondering, should we be thinking about any implications to CMS here or anything else that you want to share on this front?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI love our energy law. I really do. I'm not joking there. The 2016 energy law here in Michigan was solid on the supply and demand side. When we go through an integrated resource plan, we've got to do all the modeling, all the analysis to show that the supply and demand is going to meet and have some reserve margin on that. That's a requirement of a load-serving entity, which we are. I feel good about where Michigan's headed within MISO. Now, I can't speak for all of MISO, but I feel good about where Michigan's at. I'll remind people, remind all the people on this call that part of this IRP is to bring Covert in. Covert right now is in the PJM market, and we're moving it over to the MISO market.\nThat's 1.2 gigawatts of additional supply being brought into MISO and brought here to serve our customers. That's why we feel good about it, our IRP. We're still on pace and plan for retirement of all coal, to be out of coal by 2025.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. Last one, if I could, hot off the press, climate BBB package, climate package being supported by Manchin here. Any preliminary thoughts at this point?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nJeremy, you've given me like, what, 12 hours to digest it all? I mean, here's what I would say. Here's what I would say on it. Because we've done some preliminary review, and we're still digesting a lot of facts on it. Solar PTC is a big win in there. That's something we've been advocating for in Washington, we've been advocating in the industry. Hats off to Rejji. Rejji's been making the calls with CFOs a year and a half ago when it was first being talked about. We're excited about that portion of it and what that means for our 80GW. That's going to be lower costs for our customers as we build out more solar, and it'll put us on par with developers. We like that. We know there's a storage ITC as well.\nThat'll come into play in 2024 to 2027 as we build out 75MW of storage. There's a lot of upside for the industry. We're the birthplace of the automobile. I talked about the $11.8 billion. Most of that's in the automotive space. There's opportunities for load growth in the automotive business to grow as they make their transition. There's incentives in there for solar production in the US. In Michigan, one of our largest customers is one of the world's largest producers of polysilicon crystals, which go into solar panels, technology, and electronics. We see that as an upside. There's a big tailwind on EVs. EVs are a nice part of load growth. It's not in our forecast, but there's the continuing credits for purchase of EVs. There's a lot of good stuff in here.\nWe're still digesting all the specifics, but feeling good. Feeling good with coming out of the Senate. Of course, there's negotiations with the House in front of us.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, Garrick. Rejji, wanted to go over to you on just the latest commentary on the potential looking at common equity for financing Covert. I think that was an $815 million project. Any sense of how much the equity could be, and how materially the 3 to 4 cent accretion could change?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Appreciate the question, Michael. I would say we're obviously still evaluating options. You have the purchase price of Covert spot on at $815 million. As you know, our rate construct, we would fund about half of that with debt at the utility, so call it roughly $400 million, and then the balance would be parent financing. Mathematically, that gets you to about $400 million, but we'll still consider what the alternatives might be. Obviously, we've got quite a bit of time to fund it, so we'll look at our dribbling, our ATM equity issuance program. Whether that'll be the full $400 million remains to be seen. We'll see how the price of other alternatives like those hybrid securities, which for the past six to seven months or so have really priced quite competitively.\nIf that changes over time, we may tranche it a little bit. I'd say it's still early days, but we could go up to about $400 million. We've got that much on the shelf. We'll see how the pricing trends over the next handful of months. With respect to the accretion, at this point, I'd say it's a little premature to offer precisely how accretive it would be to the 3 to 4 cents that we initially provided, because clearly that would depend on the price at which we issue equity if we do choose to dribble. I'd say more variables at this point to provide any prescriptive point of view. It would be directionally accretive just based on the relative cost right now of our equity versus other securities.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Super helpful, Collar. Last question, what do you guys think about making it 3 for 3 with settlements this year with the pending electric case?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nWe'll see. I mean, I think batting at .670 still gets you into Cooperstown. We've been encouraged with the IRP and the gas rate settlement. Electric, obviously, many more stakeholders, many more variables. We've been successful there before. We're cautiously optimistic, but early days. We'll look and see where the staff is in about a month, and we'll go from there. I would say early days to make any prediction at this point.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks a lot.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julianne Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. You guys really do execute. Hey, hey. Always, always. Let me follow up on this legislative angle. Just one nuance here. AMT is going to get a lot of attention this week, I imagine, for all the utilities here. What are you guys saying on that? I know we asked you here for your hot takes a second ago, but just if you could rehash as best you understood your probably assessment of this last year, if you will.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Julian, just to be clear, you're talking about the alternative minimum tax with respect to last night's.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, exactly. The 15%.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nOkay. Yeah, with respect to the climate bill, as Garrick noted, we're still digesting. I think it's about 700 pages. Our folks in federal affairs and on the tax side are really, really good at what they do, and they're fast readers. However, 700 pages is a lot to digest in 12 hours. I'd say based on what we've gleaned so far, as I understand it, the structure that's contemplated is consistent with what we were talking about around EEI several months ago, where there's a three-year average on pre-tax operating income around $1 billion. If you're below that threshold, you're not subject to the minimum tax. From our perspective, given our size, we would likely not chin that bar for some time. Needless to say, we aspire to at some point because we're a growing company.\nIn the short term, I think we'd be perhaps not subject to it initially. We're still looking at, again, if it's structured how it was when we were talking about this at EEI, you could apply tax credits to up to 75% of the tax liability. Again, we're still looking to see whether that's in the bill, but that's how it was structured initially. I'd say there's a bit more work to be done on our side before we can speak to it. I'd say to cut through it in the short term, we don't think there's a significant impact on us. Again, given our size and if they apply that three-year average of $1 billion of pre-tax operating income, we just wouldn't chin that bar for a little while.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, no, that makes sense. Thank you for the hot takes there. Appreciate it. OPEB, contribution to the quarter here, etc. Just curious if you can comment here. Obviously, that subject's gotten some attention late, broadly.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nOh, yeah. From a pension perspective, again, our story has been quite good for some time now. As you may recall, we have been very active in making discretionary contributions to our pension plan over the year, particularly in years in which we were pretty flush from an OCF perspective. We're well overfunded. At this point, we have two pension plans, and both are over 120% funded. Clearly, asset experience is tough for most, but we have relatively low equity content in our pension plans. I would say based on how our pension's structured at this point, we're a bit more levered to interest rate movement. With discount rates effectively going up year over year, we actually see it in the short term as a net benefit. We actually are seeing a little bit of upside, particularly since we recently remeasured our plan.\nFrom our perspective, it's actually net positive at the moment, and we feel quite good about the level of funding for the plan.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nTotally. All right. No material OPEB impact here in the quarter?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nNo. No.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Thank you for clarifying. The last one, just super quick clarification from earlier on solar PTC. I mean, it clearly benefits customers from an NPV perspective, but also, I think, implicitly also helps utilities participate from a rate-based perspective as well, I take it?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Obviously, our rate construct is a little nuanced, but it would help us as well because it would allow us potentially, if you think about the 8GW of solar that we're going to be executing on over the next 15 to 20 years. We're currently structured to, at a minimum, own about half of that. If we can be more competitive because of that benefit with the elimination of normalization, then we could potentially pencil the owned projects in a manner that's comparable with the PPA or contracted portion. That would make a case for owning more than 50% over time. That could add to rate-based opportunities. We feel quite good about what we've read today. Again, more to digest.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Clearly, clearly. Okay. Excellent. Well, thank you, guys. Speak to you soon.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. The line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHi, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nHi. Good morning, guys. Two clarifying questions. First, for 2022, did you say that the entire $0.24 to 0.28 negative red bar is conservatism? I know you said you're trending well, and you've affirmed guidance, but did I hear you right? Is that all conservatism? The second part of that question is, you mentioned the potential to accelerate O&M expenses from 2023. Have you started that yet, or are you waiting to get through the summer and the storm season? How flexible can you be to do that late in the year, in other words?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Andrew, thanks for the question. I would say starting with that $0.24 to 0.28 of negative variance in the six months to go bucket of that waterfall chart on page seven, that is a combination of conservative planning. That's really a catch-all bucket. We've got in there non-weather sales assumptions year to go, a little Enterprises performance, and some parent expenses. There's conservatism as it pertains to those variables. The vast majority of that is just contingency that we've accrued just based on the performance in the first half of the year. Obviously, weather has been a big help. It's offered upside to plan. We've seen a little cost performance as well, and a little bit of non-weather upside. Sales have been strong as well as cost performance.\nThat's what's driving a good portion of that bucket. It's really just where we've parked the contingency, which gives us a lot of flexibility, which kind of segues into the second part of your question about what we're doing with respect to pull forwards. I would say at this point, because we still have six months to go, we really try not to do a whole lot because we still have to get through storm season and see where Q3 is, which not just from a storm perspective, but also in terms of earnings contribution. That's usually where we have the vast majority of our EPS contribution. We've been cautious. We've done a little bit more with respect to forestry, and we've done a little bit more reliability work.\nObviously, we made some commitments as part of the IRP and gas settlements with respect to low-income support. Those are things we like to do, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities for pull forwards to de-risk 2023 some more going into the second half of the year. It's also important to remember we also put in place a really nice regulatory mechanism a few years ago, our voluntary refund mechanism, which effectively allows us to make decisions late in the year from an operational pull forwards perspective, get effectively the accounting benefit in the current year, and then a commitment to do work in the subsequent year. That gives us even more flexibility as we head into Q4 and deep into Q4.\nIf we're seeing upside that's in excess of plan, it just gives us a bit more flexibility to commit to more work and, again, see the sort of accounting benefits of that in the current year. A lot of flexibility going forward. We've made some moves today from an O&M pole or head perspective. Again, we're obviously cautious at this point because we've got a lot of Q3 left, and we're waiting to see what happens with storms and weather.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nGreat. Yeah, that's definitely a helpful mechanism you have. The other question I just wanted to clarify on equity. I guess first question is, when would you decide how to finance Covert? Could that be something like an equity forward to de-risk? Just to be very clear, beyond financing that acquisition, are you still affirming no plans for equity in the general business financing?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. To answer the last question first, if you put aside the potential funding of Covert, as we mentioned on the call today with potentially considering equity, there's no plan to issue equity beyond that until 2025 as per our initial guidance when we rolled out our $14.3 billion five-year plan in Q1 of this year. We're still committed to not issuing equity through 2024, or more specifically until 2025, but for the funding of Covert. In terms of how we'll time that and how we'll think through that, obviously, we'll look at the valuation of the stock versus the relative cost of other hybrid securities. We'll look to be opportunistic from time to time. We've seen just great pricing in the past with those dribble programs, so we'll look to utilize some of that.\nI think we've got a lot of flexibility because we're not scheduled to acquire Covert until May of next year. Quite a bit of time to evaluate, and we'll be opportunistic and dribble out some likely over the coming months.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you very much. That's helpful.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Alcala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHello. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on how you see the equity ratio at the utilities trending over time after we saw it tick down a little bit in the gas rate case.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, David, thanks for the question. Obviously, we would love to see equity ratios, if not stabilize, go the other way and go up because we do believe that we have yet to see a remediation from tax reform when it was enacted in 2017, which led to a 200 basis point degradation in our FFO to debt overnight, as well as cash flow degradation. We're going to continue to make the case in our cases that we filed that equity thickness should go up. Again, we'll make the case going forward. What I would mention is, obviously, in the case of the gas rate case settlement, there were a number of stakeholders involved in that process. We thought, given the circumstances and all the other constructive aspects of the settlement, we were comfortable with the equity thickness where it was.\nAgain, we still think it should be higher than that. I think it's also important to note that we still have deferred tax rollback from tax reform where, again, we're giving back deferred taxes to customers. That has the effect of skinnying or reducing the zero cost of capital component in our rate-making capital structure, which offsets some of that reduction in the authorized equity thickness. To be very specific here, our equity thickness in this gas settlement went down from a little over 52% to about 50.75%, so roughly 130 basis points of reduction. However, about 50 basis points of that was offset in our rate-making equity thickness because of the reduction of that zero cost of capital layer. Again, we'll continue to make the case. We still think equity thickness should continue to go up or should start to go up.\nThe onus is on us to make the case.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thanks. That's helpful, color. The other topic I was curious about was on the VGP. Could you talk about your progress there, and if you see a case for seeing momentum kind of accelerate in customer interest?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. We certainly see a lot of customer interest. We've signed some additional contracts over the quarter. Due to non-disclosure agreements, I can't talk about all of them. One of them I can share is the state of Michigan signed a contract over the quarter. Recall, that's 1,000MW of renewable build incremental to our plan. We're starting to layer in those contracts as we move forward and have those customers secured. In addition, we went out to RFP to look at what it would cost to construct that 1,000MW. I want to put it as 1,000. That's going to come very modular. It's going to come in little tranches as we build out for our customers. Still good interest, really good interest. We continue to line up contracts to support that build. Is that helpful?\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Got it. Yep. No, that's helpful. Thanks. Maybe one more, just quick one. To the extent, Rejji, you were to do common equity or something with kind of 100% equity content here for Covert, does that offset potential equity needs later in the plan, just given the initial thinking was something with a lower equity content, 50% or so?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nI'm just going to go back to what we committed to when we rolled out our five-year plan, again, before the IRP and before Covert, just so everyone's grounded. We said $14.3 billion of capital, and we would not need to issue equity until 2025 and 2026, the outer years of the plan. At that point, we would do about $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. Now, with Covert, we've said we may dribble a portion of that. I would say the funding of Covert, that's not going to eliminate those outer year needs if that's specifically the question. The $250 million we said we'd issue in 2025 and 2026, because we're issuing equity to fund Covert, where we sit today, we don't think that obviates the need to do that equity in those outer years. We'll see.\nI mean, obviously, we'll see what happens with respect to economic performance, load, EPS, how much earnings we retain, and so on. Again, from where we sit today, this does not eliminate the need for equity in those outer years.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. Yeah, that's what I was getting at. Much appreciated.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Ryan.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGood morning. Hoping to follow up on residential load patterns. It looks like year-over-year residential load on a weather-normalized basis was a little bit softer than some of your peers in neighboring jurisdictions. Curious if there's any color you could share around the drivers that you're seeing in your service territory.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Our residential load, to be clear, Ryan, were you speaking about it? You said year-to-date?\n\nRyan Levine\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nElectric.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\n2022.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nYeah. Yeah. Year-to-date and for the, it seemed like second quarter was a little bit better than first quarter, but I'd be curious what you're saying.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Year-to-date, like I said, about a little over 0.5% down versus year-to-date 2021. On a quarterly basis, Q2 was a little up, about a quarter or 25 basis points versus Q2 of 2021. We said in the past, we've actually been quite pleased with what we've seen. We've been quite pleased with what we've seen so far in terms of residential load. It exceeds our expectations. We assumed a much more aggressive sort of return to work or return to facilities type of work environment in 2022. We're still seeing pretty good stickiness in that hybrid work environment and still seeing pretty good load in the residential segment, which obviously is higher margins. It's exceeded our expectations of performance.\nI can't speak for the performance of others, but we've been quite pleased with what we've seen, being down only about 0.5% year-to-date. I'll remind you, we're up over 2% versus where we were pre-pandemic. The stickiness and resilience is still there, and that's obviously offering favorable mix. I think it's also worth noting that we plan and will continue to plan incredibly conservatively, Ryan. When we see performance like that, even though it's slightly down, it's still offering upside relative to plan.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI just want to add on to this too. In both 2020 and 2021, we saw record interconnections, service line connections with residential homes. Record from a company perspective, annual perspective. Again, I can't compare that to what other utilities are seeing. For us, it's really nice residential load performance across our service territory.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAppreciate that. To follow up on some of the kind of potential pull forward of '23 costs into '22, you highlighted forestry and a few other items. Curious if you're seeing anything on the labor front to combat some of the inflationary pressures and competition for labor that may lead to some elevated costs in the back half of the year.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, remember, just roughly 40% of our workforce is unionized, and we have a union contract for those. Those were signed in 2020. That contract is a five-year contract that goes to 2025, so there's some normal escalation. If you go back to 2020 when that contract was signed, again, we didn't see quite this inflationary pressure. Again, it's measured, it's budgeted, it's planned for, so not seeing much change there. Across our non-unionized workforce, we've had roughly our retention rate, we haven't seen the great resignation at all. We've seen solid retention across the pandemic period. Again, we haven't had to go out and do a lot of hiring over the time period, so that's been helpful too from a cost perspective, labor perspective.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAppreciate the color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Elliot. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Take care and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.\nKnow it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain. Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow. Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can. You'd be a big stolen bottle. Yeah. That's why I'm easy. I'm easy like Sunday morning. That's why I'm easy. I'm easy like Sunday morning. Why in the world would anybody put chains on me? Yeah. I've paid my dues to make it. Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be. I'm not happy when I try to fake it. No. That's why I'm easy. Yeah. I'm easy like Sunday morning. Yeah. That's why I'm easy. I'm easy like Sunday morning. I want to be high, so high. I want.",

I'm pleased to share the great progress we have made over the quarter and with our IRP. You've heard me speak about our simple investment thesis on many of these calls. It has withstood the test of time, and this quarter was no different. The industry is leading net-zero commitments. These aren't just words, they're evident in our actions and our results. Our IRP settlement paves the way to be out of coal by 2025, one of the first utilities in the nation to achieve such a milestone.\nOur recently announced net-zero goal for our gas system is not just a dream but evident and proof point in our net-zero methane target and a 20% reduction in customer emissions by 2030. Excellent to the CEA.\nI can't think of a more important time, given inflation and supply chain constraints, for our industry-leading cost management muscle to play out. Rejji will walk through specifics in his prepared remarks, but I continue to be confident in our ability to offset inflationary pressure and alleviate supply chain concerns. This means keeping customer bills affordable through our CEA lean operating system. Top-tier regulatory jurisdiction, the IRP settlement once again demonstrates a constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, delivering important, industry-leading outcomes for all.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't thank the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan Attorney General, customer groups, environmental organizations, energy trade representatives, and the Consumers Energy Work Team for the constructive dialogue that led to settlement and a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the environment for future generations.\nAll of this, along with the fundamentals of our simple but impactful investment thesis, leads to a consistent premium total shareholder return for you, our investors. At CMS Energy, we deliver for all our stakeholders. This is why you own us and what you can count on. Now, let me get on with sharing the great news of the IRP and our quarter. I'm thrilled with this settlement. It provides a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the future of the environment for future generations and ensuring financial certainty. IRP is a win for everyone. Let me share with you why.\nOur customers will see significant savings in addition to cleaner and more reliable energy. We're accelerating our ESG ambitions to decarbonize and lead the way to protect our planet and accelerating 75 MW of battery storage between now.\nOur investors will see capital upside along with the purchase of the Covert plant, demand-side programs, and the continuation of a financial compensation mechanism, FCM, on purchase power agreements, PPAs. We also received regulatory asset treatment at an ROE of 9%, closely aligned with our original filing. We will stop the purchase of CMS Enterprises assets and instead will pursue long-term PPAs of 700 MW of Michigan-based capacity starting in 2025. While we believe the purchase of the CMS Enterprises assets was a good value for customers, our primary concern was ensuring we secured sufficient capacity to meet our customers' needs.\nThe proposed RFP, coupled with the purchase of the Covert plant and a delayed retirement of the Karn 3 and 4 peaking unit, will address this concern.\nDIG and the Peakers and Enterprises will have an opportunity to participate in this RFP, but will otherwise continue to sell capacity as they've done in the past in the attractive bilateral market. This is a win for everyone. In March, we announced plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for our natural gas system by 2050, which includes both our customers' and our suppliers' emissions. This adds to our long-term plan, both electric and natural gas, to further drive decarbonization, and provides meaningful proof points along the clean energy transformation. Net-zero emissions across our natural gas system is certainly an ambitious target.\nHowever, we've modeled this extensively. We believe it's achieved through existing infrastructure and a clean fuel network. It also acknowledges that there are thoughtful ways to reduce and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions across important home heating and thermal electric generation resources.\nBoth are important in ensuring long-term affordability and reliability for our customers. As we've demonstrated across our electric system with this IRP, these aren't just words. They're evident in our actions and our results. The proof points are in both our net-zero methane target and 20% reduction in gas customer emissions by 2030. We're delivering on those plans and investment opportunities. This includes accelerating vintage main and service replacement, and adding renewable natural gas to our system, all included in our five-year capital investment plan.\nIt also means greater energy efficiency, carbon offsets, and potential hydrogen blending, which provide growth opportunities above our plan, strengthening and lengthening our investment. It's good for our customers, our plan, and our investors. This is an important road ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Like I shared at the beginning of my remarks, we've had a great quarter.\nWe're off to a strong start of the year on all fronts. In the Q1 we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This is up $0.11 per share from last year, ahead of our plan, and positions us well as we start the year, giving us confidence as we navigate the nine months ahead. We are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted full-year guidance of $2.85 to 2.89 per share. We continue to guide to the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%. The IRP strengthens and lengthens our ability to deliver on our earnings glide path going forward.\nLooking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8%, with a target payout ratio of about 60% over time. Today, we are reaffirming our $14.3 billion five-year customer investment plan.\nAs we've noted, the IRP does provide upside to our current plan, but we'll remain disciplined in our approach. You can expect to see that update as we report Q4 results early next year. As they often say, strong execution leads to strong results. This quarter was another impressive example. We are confident in the full-year guidance, and we are focused on delivering for our customers, the planet, and you, our investors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're pleased to report our Q1 results for 2022. We delivered adjusted net income of $346 million for $1.20 per share, up 10% off our 2021 Q1 results, largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in Michigan. From a weather perspective, a relatively high volume of heating-degree days in the Q1, coupled with the absence of unfavorable weather during the same period in 2021, provided $0.16 per share of positive variance, as noted on slide seven.\nFrom an economic standpoint, we continue to see in the Q1 contributed $0.04 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021, and it's either at or above pre-pandemic levels across each of our customer segments, particularly when excluding the effects of our energy efficiency programs, which reduced customer load by about 2% per year. Another noteworthy driver of our financial performance for the quarter was rate relief net of investment-related expenses, which contributed $0.03 per share of upside, as we continue to realize the residual effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement.\nThese sources of positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses at the utility in support of key customer initiatives related to safety, reliability, and decarbonization, which equated to $0.06 per share of negative variance.\nWe also realized $0.02 per share of negative variance for the quarter, largely related to annualized financing costs and the timing of tax expenses at the parent company. Looking ahead, we feel quite good about the remaining nine months of the year. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a negative impact of about $0.09 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect the impact of weather will be offset by rate relief, net of investment, which we estimate to be roughly $0.10 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, and is largely driven by our expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year.\nClosing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expenses at the utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CEA, other cost reduction initiatives, and a more normalized level of service restoration expense on the heels of record storm activity in 2021. Collectively, we assume O&M cost performance will drive $0.29 per share of positive variance. Lastly, we're assuming normalized operating conditions at enterprises, given the extended outage at DIG last year, coupled with the usual conservative assumptions around weather normalization.\nAs we've said before, we'll continue to plan conservatively, like we do every year, to ensure we deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors.\nOur ability to deliver the results you expect year in and year out is supported by Michigan's strong regulatory environment. As Garrick highlighted earlier, the multi-party settlement of our IRP provides more evidence of that. As noted, the IRP settlement that we recently filed includes a substantial near-term capital investment opportunity in the acquisition of the Covert gas plant, which strengthens and lengthens our financial glide path to the tune of about $0.03 to 0.04 per share, with the assumption of reasonable parent funding costs and a 9% ROE on the retired coal assets.\nAs we look ahead, we remain acutely focused on obtaining approval of our IRP settlement agreement and making progress on our pending rate cases, which are highlighted in the regulatory calendar on slide eight.\nAs for the latter, just last week, we filed an electric rate case requesting a $272 million revenue increase with a 51.5% equity ratio and a 10.25% ROE. I'll note that even with this request, the typical Q1 of 2023, we also continue to work through our pending gas rate case and recently filed a direct testimony. We anticipate an order for the gas rate case by October of this year. The question we often get when we discuss our capital investment opportunities and regulatory construct is to minimize the rate impact for our customers.\nI'm pleased to report that we remain hard at work on all aspects of our cost structure to preserve headroom for needed customer investments in the long term and to mitigate the challenging inflationary environment in which we live.\nTurning to slide nine, you'll see that several countermeasures have been implemented over the past several quarters to offset inflationary pressures. On the left-hand side of the slide, you'll note that the table highlights the cost categories that have had well-publicized, atypical levels of inflation, specifically costs related to labor, materials, and commodities, and the corresponding risk mitigation efforts that we have employed.\nStarting with labor, our workforce is roughly 40% unionized, and in 2020, we renegotiated all three of our collective bargaining agreements with five-year terms, which provides cost and labor stability over the next few years, with a substantial benefit from a strong retention rate, which is in excess of 95% and allows us to minimize hiring in a tight labor market.\nFrom a materials perspective, we're actively managing our supply chain to include leveraging market analysis to optimize terms and conditions with new and existing vendors, where possible, while broadening our vendor base. We are also deploying the CEA in our distribution centers to eliminate waste, and we are sharing those best practices with our suppliers to reduce their costs and maintain availability of key materials. It is also worth noting that approximately 90% of our material costs are capitalized, which reduces the income statement impact in the short term as those costs are incurred over time.\nLastly, given the well-publicized tightening of solar equipment supply, we'll remind you that our solar buildout is modular in nature and allows us to flex projects over the planned period.\nOn the commodities side, we continue to run our electric generation fleet in a cost-efficient manner to insulate our customers from market volatility when they are dispatched. In fact, the heat rates of our natural gas plants are some of the lowest in the region, which means we can offer power at a cost lower than market, and that provides substantial value for our customers.\nAs we manage inflation risk in the current environment, you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide that we still have substantial episodic cost reduction opportunities longer term, which we estimate will generate over $200 million through coal plant retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements.\nThese cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually through the CEA, which I'll remind you was a key driver in our achievement of over $150 million of cost savings in aggregate over the past few years. Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success, and enabled us to deliver on our financial objectives, and there remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business going forward.\nGiven our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to mitigate risk in the current environment and in the long run to execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for our customers and investors as we always have. With that, Austin, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, it is star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, it is star followed by two. Again, to ask a question, press star one. As a reminder, if you're using the speakerphone, please remember to pick up your headset before asking your questions. We will pause here briefly as questions are registered. Our first question is from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Michael, your line is open.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, hey, hey. More clarity on what you mean by strengthen the 6% to 8% of that as putting you above the 8%.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGreat. Right here. This is a great settlement. There's an important regulatory process that we're still in the midst of, and just like back in 2018 and 2019, there's a few parties that have contested the settlement. That's pretty, pretty typical. We anticipate that to occur over the next month in the regulatory month of May. The commissioners will issue an order, which we anticipate in late June. It could drift into at this point. I do not want to be out in front of the commissioners on this and put the cart in front of the horse, per se. Here's what I'll tell you on this. We feel good about the settlement and the ability because the number of parties around and to be able to navigate that process.\nWhat it means from a plan perspective is, as we've shared, that strengthen our ability to achieve the 6% to 8% toward the high end. As we've shared, this is, again, upside to the plan. The IRP is upside of the plan. Here's how I'd think about it. We know, and we've certainly made it comes into the plan in the main good from a planning perspective. Remember this important piece in the 6% to 8%. We deliver each and every year, and then we rebase off of actuals. That's an important piece. It's that compounding, that quarterly, you know, compounding in the quality of earnings, which you've come to know and expect.\nFrankly, that allows us to do the strengthening and lengthening across the broader plan.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Sorry. If I could just pry a little more on that, I mean, are you trying to imply that there may just be one outsized growth here, and then that's where you would rebase off of that?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nNo. I don't, we don't do sugar highs. You know, we've got nearly 20 years of consistent financial performance. I mean, we're going to deliver, you know, our planning year is to deliver year 20. I think the strengthening and lengthening of that plan comes from the ability to be a 6% to 8% toward a high end. We've got great confidence in that, but also this rebasing. Each and every year, you know our history, we deliver, and then we rebase off actuals, and that provides a nice opportunity to strengthen and lengthen the plan.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Got it. Maybe going in a different direction, the electric rate case you just filed, maybe if you could just walk us through conviction level and getting a bigger portion of the ask this time, given the order late last year, and maybe some differences this time around or lessons learned.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI feel really good about this rate case that we're filing, and I'm, you know, again, confident in this regulatory construct. There's been a number of signals here over the last quarter that gives me confidence in the regulatory construct. Let me start there. We had a rehearing on our electric rate case. That was a positive for us. Small dollars, but a positive. Our gas rate case, we had staff's position. The initial value was constructive, and a great starting spot. This IRP settlement with staff, with the attorney general, provides another data point that speaks to the constructive nature of this.\nWe took feedback after that last electric rate case. I shared that in the last earnings call, and we rewrote a lot of our testimony specifically in the area of electric reliability. I'll just share it.\nWe have more work that we're working on to continuously improve that rate case process, but I feel good about our filing. It's primarily made up of electric reliability and resiliency work, important work to deliver for our customers. There's also the Covert facility is in there. There's a little bit of work on economic development. We've seen a lot of growth here in the state to support that work, and this broader clean energy transformation. I feel good about the case and the strength of the case, and getting a good outcome.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thanks a lot, Garrick. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy, your line is open.\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nHi, Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nHi.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks. Just wanted to go with the IRP a little bit more. You talked about some of the earnings uplift there. Just wondering if you might be able to share, I guess, financing needs that might be possible on the back of that. Separately, could you walk us through the RFP that was agreed to as an alternative to the DIG acquisition? Just wondering, there's been a lot of focus on the state and potentially extending Palisades. Do you think this could be an option here?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nRejji, we'll start with the financing piece, and then we can bounce back and forth on your other questions.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. I'd say with respect to the financing needs coming out of this IRP settlement agreement, we'll be obviously focused on, assuming we get approval, the acquisition of the Covert facility. That would take place around mid-2023, call it the May timeframe. We would plan to fund that with debt at the utility, given our rate-making capital structure. You can assume about half of it's funded that way, so call it roughly $400 million or so based on an $815 million purchase price. Then we fund the balance at the parent. We still feel quite good about the commitment to avoid issuing equity prior to 2025.\nWe would assume that the parent financing would likely include the sort of equity credit-like securities that we've done in the past, either hybrids or preferred, which we have really executed at optimal levels over the last several years. That would be the financing plan as we sit here today. We'll keep an eye on how market conditions evolve over that timeframe. Garrick, I'll hand it to you for the RFP and the Palisades.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. From an RFP perspective, what we agreed to in the settlement is equivalent to 700 MW of, you know, a portion of it, 700 MW of load out there, capacity out there. 500 MW is dispatchable, and that's the nature of that, and available, reliable generation in the state. Then 200 MW is right within the category of renewables and, again, purchase power agreements. For those purchase power agreements that are not associated with the affiliate, there's the opportunity to earn the financial compensation mechanism on those. Enterprise has the opportunity to bid into that 700 MW, primarily in the 500 MW that are dispatchable in nature.\nThat's the nature of the RFP. In terms of Palisades, it's important to remember we're not the owner or operator of Palisades. We've not been involved in any conversations with the Department of Energy.\nIf there's specific questions in this call on Palisades, I'd really direct them to Entergy specific to the plant. Now, our governor has come out in support of keeping Palisades operational. We're certainly supportive of our governor and the administration. Even in a broader context, we believe in nuclear energy as part of the solution here for reliable, dispatchable, and clean energy across our nation and in Michigan. Our PPA on that facility expires at the end of May. It is an expensive purchase power agreement. As we've shared in the course of this call, we're laser-focused on reducing costs for our customers, and that is front and center for us.\nWe'd certainly entertain a long-term purchase power agreement, a new purchase power agreement with the facility, entertain discussions and conversation about that. It does have to be at a competitive price.\nThat'll be an important factor. We expect to receive an FCM on that new PPA as well.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful there. Thank you. Maybe pivoting a bit here towards decarbonization, what investment opportunities are you seeing in support of decarbonization for the gas system? Maybe thinking about RNG a bit more, how much regulated CapEx do you think this could translate into?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, in our five-year plan, there's a hefty amount. There's about $5 billion, a little more, that's aimed at decarbonization of our natural gas system. Again, it's multiple benefits. You're out there replacing old pipe, vintage pipe, as we call it, in services. It makes the system safer, improves reliability in the natural gas system, also eliminates methane emissions, one of the leading causes of climate change. We've got a target of net zero by 2030. Those investments are being made right now over the course of the five years, and we'll extend into the 10-year plan as well.\nWe see renewable natural gas is also part of that solution. It is part of this gas rate case that's underway right now. If you get into the details of staff's position, they were not supportive of that renewable natural gas.\nHowever, they left an opening in there, which we think we can mitigate in the course of rebuttal and move that into the utility. There's some work to be done there in our gas case.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Andrew, your line is open.\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nMorning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning. First question, I want to ask a little bit more about the inflationary pressures. I appreciate all the details you gave. In the past, I think you've talked about limiting bill increases to, say, 2% or 3%, if I remember correctly. My question is, how confident are you about your ability to stick to that in, say, 2022 and maybe 2023? I assume widespread inflation won't be as big of a concern after that, but in the near term, do you still feel comfortable with those past targets?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nEveryone in this sector, and even outside the sector, is seeing inflation. To me, the bigger question is, who do you think is best at managing that? I would put us up toward the top of the list. Our ability to leverage the CEA and to provide cost savings for our customers is certainly, again, we talk about it as flexing our muscle here. We've got great examples of that in 2020. We saw a sales drop. We found $100 million of savings in the organization. In 2021, in August, we had $0.16 of impact just to storms. We offset that. We have an amazing ability to be able to leverage the tools, the CEA, and then plus automation, I would add, to be able to mitigate costs.\nRejji went through a number of examples of the way we're managing that across the system.\nLong-term, when we look at our five-year plan, and even in the short term, there's a nice ability to manage rates and keep them affordable for our customers. In line with kind of traditional inflation, you might say, but I feel confident in our plan to be able to mitigate much of the impact of inflation going forward.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Great. Next question is at Enterprises. You mentioned that DIG and the peakers will likely bid into the upcoming RFP. I don't expect anything too specific for obvious competitive reasons, but can you qualitatively talk about how you think of the trade-off between, say, price certainty and stability that would come with a long-term contract versus the potential for lower revenues given the competitive nature of bidding?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI think, Rejji, and I'll tag team this one. Bottom line is it's something that Enterprises is going to consider. Again, I'm not certain we'll participate in that. We have the potential to participate in that RFP, and we'll make that evaluation. The capacity market is certainly, as we've seen across MISO, an opportunity as well, and for upside with our Enterprise assets. There's an evaluation we'll participate in and take a look at the impact of how DIG participates either in the bilateral market or our bids into this longer-term PPA with the utility.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Andrew. The only thing I would add to that is philosophically, we've always had the mindset that we try to run our non-utility businesses like a utility and as low a beta fashion as possible. If we have an opportunity to get attractive levels for energy and capacity, and we can do that over the long term, you know, that's generally been our bias. We've done that on the energy and capacity side at DIG for some time now. When we owned the bank, that's how we ran the bank as well. It's just trying to lock in as much revenue as possible and run it on a low-risk basis. We'll see.\nI think it's a function of where the market is at the time and how long the PPAs are in the bilateral market versus what might be offered in this RFP.\nWe'll see what the fact pattern looks like, and we'll run the business accordingly.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. That makes sense. Just lastly, what's the timing of the RFP, and when you'll communicate if DIG is in fact participating or not, DIG and the peakers?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI would anticipate, at least initially here, that our RFP would be issued within the fiscal year 2022.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Insoo, your line is open.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, thank you. First question. Hey, Garrick. On the solar, you've talked about just the modular nature of it and kind of shift the timing and whatnot. Just holistically, I guess, whether it's the megawatts that's kind of a bill of transfer or some of the PPAs that are expected to come online, I guess, over the next couple of years that will earn the financial compensation mechanism, just your broad level of confidence, I guess, in terms of being able to mitigate any impact from what's going on in the solar space.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI'll start with the punchline, or the bottom line. No material impact to the five-year plan, continued confidence in our 2022 guidance, and continued confidence in the longer-term plan, the five years, and the 6% to 8%, and being toward the high end. That's the punchline. Now, let me tell you why. This IRP is 8 GW. It's not 8 GW tomorrow or even in the five-year plan. We have 15 to 20 years to build this out. There's considerable flexibility to be able to construct that. Just like everyone else in the industry, the Department of Commerce in this investigation slowed things up in some of our projects.\nThese are megawatts that are going to get built. These are renewable projects that are going to get built because they're part of our broader IRP in nature.\nLet me try to offer some context from a size perspective. We're building out of owned generation here, about 150 MW per year. We're talking about two projects. In 2024, we go up to 250 MW per year. This annual capital spend is around $200 to 250 million. This is manageable, easily manageable. In fact, this is, you know, I've been in operations for 20 years. This is work that happens every year. There's stuff that goes in and out of the plan based on a lot of different variables. Easily manageable from a capital perspective. In fact, just as a reminder, we've got $3 to 4 billion of capital backlog and things like electrical reliability, investments in our gas system.\n80% of those projects are less than $200 million.\nThere's the ability to put them into the plan and offer real value for our customers. The other important part of this clean energy journey, as well as a reminder here, that although solar has been impacted, we're still progressing with wind in the state of Michigan, and we're investing a lot in the space of our hydro facilities. We have 15 hydro facilities. There are smart and thoughtful investments occurring there as well. Those are on progress, are on target. I feel good about that from where we're headed from a clean energy perspective.\nThe last piece that I'll also point to, and I think this is important from a capacity perspective, and I noted it in my prepared remarks, is Karn 3 and 4 continues to operate to 2031. Karn 3 and 4, we originally proposed retiring in 2023.\nThis settlement offers some additional flexibility from a capacity build perspective. Again, we've got some flexibility to weather things and be able to meet all our customers' needs. Again, feel good about the capital plan, confident in our earnings guidance, both in the year and in the long term.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood. My second question, on those enterprise assets, the non-regulated ones like DIG, given it won't be going to rate base through with the settlement, and depending on what you decide on the RFP, whether you'll participate or not, how do you just think about strategically these assets now going forward as part of your portfolio?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThe enterprise assets are an important part of our portfolio. It's small, but important. It makes about 4% of our earnings mix. This goes back a little bit. We used to talk about the Ferrari in the garage, and then it was the Tesla in the garage. It's probably the new electric Corvette in the garage. I don't know how you want to say it, but with capacity prices, there's some certainty upside here in some of our DIG and some of the peakers. By and large, this business is about renewables, and customer-focused renewables. It's small in nature, and we deliver strategic solutions for our customers. Hasn't changed, but it continues to be a consistent performer for our business.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood. It's been a while since we've heard that reference, but I get to hear it again. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI wanted to bring that back. It's a great asset for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shar, your line is open.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, good morning, Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nHi, Shar. How are you?\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGreat. Just one follow-up on Palisades, Garrick. Can you remind us how many megawatts could be potentially re-PPA'd under the assumption the plant can remain viable here? Obviously, the government highlighted that there is a potential owner that's interested in acquiring the asset. Are you having sort of any discussions right now in recontracting, assuming you can keep the asset viable? Timing seems a little bit tight, but just curious on if there's any dialogue.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt's roughly 800 MW, a little shy of 800 MW. I think it's around 780 MW for Palisades. In line with the governor's letter, we're certainly open to conversations and discussions. We've had some conversations, more just to understand the complexities of the situation, understand what's going on, but nothing that's really got to any level of seriousness on a long-term purchase power agreement.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Got it. Just real quick, Rejji, as you're sort of thinking about financing needs, can you just remind us on the preferred options? Do you see a potential to lean more on credit metrics, just given nearly a fully regulated business mix and potentially accretive CapEx updates in the near term?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Shar. We have been targeting that sort of mid-teens FFO to debt for the rating agencies for some time now. Certainly, the sale of EnerBank gave us a nice uplift, at least in the case of S&P. While we do have some cushion to maybe be a little more aggressive in the funding strategy, we've worked very hard to get to the level that we're at today. We've worked very hard to get the ratings we have today. Our intent is not to stress those metrics some. We like the fact that we've got a little cushion on those metrics, and if that allows us to continue to not to issue equity through 2025, we'll look to do that.\nIf we can extend beyond 2025, we'll look to do that, but not to the detriment of our metrics or ratings. We still like that mid-teens area. That's where we are. We have a little cushion there, and we'll continue to plan the business that way.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Terrific. That's all the questions I had. Thanks, guys.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Jonathan, your line is open.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJonathan Arnold\n\nPartner and Head of Utilities and Power Research, Vertical Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\nQuick one on just Palisades, where it to be extended, I guess whether or not that was with a PPA. How would you think about that in the context of your overall IRP plan and capacity needs?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nTwo pieces there, that's really important. It does have to be a competitive purchase power agreement, so I'll re-emphasize that component of it as well. If we were to consider that and have those conversations, again, we would expect a financial compensation mechanism on those as well. It just provides additional flexibility for us in clean energy. It will be a little bit long from a capacity perspective, but there's opportunities to think about different investments and give us a little more flexibility, even further flexibility in our solar build-out.\n\nJonathan Arnold\n\nPartner and Head of Utilities and Power Research, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Just to go back a bit, I think it was early last year that you last gave the slide on DIG and the peakers, showing potential pre-tax earnings, step-up opportunities. My question really is, is that prior disclosure still a valid one that we can think about, or should we be looking for you to tell us something else at some point in the future, or is that still a decent guide?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Jonathan, we still feel good about the revenue opportunities at DIG, particularly now that we do not foresee it being part of the IRP. I am going to go from memory, but we were somewhere around $35 million of revenue or pre-tax earnings associated with DIG. We still think that is a pretty good base case to run. What we are also seeing, probably unsurprisingly, is a tightening of the bilateral capacity market, which I think Garrick accurately noted as attractive in his prepared remarks, because we do continue to see it tighten. We do expect to see even more attractive capacity and energy opportunities on the contracted side at DIG.\nI would say base case, it is good to be around that $35 million area, but there are certainly upside opportunities in the coming years if we continue to participate in that bilateral market.\n\nJonathan Arnold\n\nPartner and Head of Utilities and Power Research, Vertical Research\n\nI guess I was asking more about the $90 million that you had that $35 stepping up from. I wasn't sure if you wanted to.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. That working assumption was if the bilateral market went to cone, which was at the time around $7.50 per kW month. In the event the bilateral market continues to tighten and gets to those levels, that certainly could be within the realm of possibility to see upside at that level. We're certainly not planning for that, given our nature. Yeah, it could be an opportunity over time if we continue to see zone seven tighten.\n\nJonathan Arnold\n\nPartner and Head of Utilities and Power Research, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. Yeah, I think that's it. Thank you.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Travis, your line is open.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you.\nWondering, as you did your long-term reliability modeling as part of that IRP, when did reliability get to be an issue? Is that 60%+?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nRange in 2040 with renewable. There's a number of other variables we look at it from a system reliability perspective. It's an important mix of renewables and batteries, particularly in part of the plan, but also dispatchable generation. You get in things like gas, at least in our case, natural gas in part of the plan. All those come together. This plan that we submitted was more reliable than our previous IRP in terms of the build-out. Our extension of Karn 3 and 4, again, was planned to be retired in 2023, and extending that to 2031 continues to provide additional reliability over the course of this decade.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. You got it. Kind of similar on that, could we expect some of that upside in the distribution and transmission bucket as opposed to maybe more on the generation side? The upside CapEx that you were talking about.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, broader, we have a, again, I look at our 10-year, 15, 20 years, there's ample capital upside. We have about $3 to 4 billion of capital that's not in the plan that are specific projects identified that improve our gas system, more replacement of mains that looks at reliability and resiliency. We've got a large $5.5 billion focus on that. I mean, much of that's in this electric rate case to improve reliability for our customers. Those are the things that fit into that plan and continue to have that long horizon of capital investment opportunities.",

With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.\nThis presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the team continued to deliver strong performance in 2021, demonstrating consistent results across the triple bottom line for our coworkers, customers, communities, and you, our investors. Allow me to take a few minutes to share the big wins this team accomplished in 2021. It is a point of pride that CMS was named the number one utility in the US by Forbes for women and for workplace diversity.\nIt starts with our coworkers, and we know that companies that value and practice diversity, equity, and inclusion deliver stronger performance. Our commitment to people, our coworkers, and customers was in high gear all year. For our coworkers, we delivered the 11th straight year of first quartile employee engagement.\nFor our customers, we delivered first quartile customer experience and launched several programs which support our most vulnerable and prepare all for a cleaner future with EVs and renewable energy generation. This year's highlights include the expansion of our Voluntary Green Pricing Program, which allows for an incremental 1,000MW of owned renewables in our Power My Fleet EV program to meet the demand of Michigan businesses, governments, and schools as they electrify their fleet.\nJust this week, we announced, along with General Motors, the plan to power three existing auto plants with 100% clean energy through our Voluntary Green Pricing Program. I know, yes, yes, I know, all of you want to hear about our IRP. Our clean energy plan, also known as our IRP, places us in a solid leadership position on the transformation to clean energy.\nIt has us out of coal by 2025, which achieves a 60% carbon emissions reduction. I am pleased with the progress we are seeing in the regulatory process. I look forward to landing the IRP in 2022. I also want to share the progress we have made with our gas system. Our commitment to be net zero methane by 2030 is industry-leading. We are making our gas system safer and cleaner by replacing old mains and services with modern materials.\nThis year, we reduced fugitive methane emissions by more than 445 metric tons and executed on our best year ever for main replacement. This stand to reduce methane extends beyond our system, with exciting new programs, which will make a positive impact on the planet.\nWe recently announced a plan to build and own our first renewable natural gas facility with a Michigan dairy farm, which is included in our pending gas rate case. This facility would be a regulated asset, and the emissions reduction will remove the equivalent of 4,000 gasoline-fueled vehicles from the road annually. Clearly, we are on our way to a safe and clean gas system.\nFinally, I want to talk a little bit about Michigan, our home state, our service territory. In both our gas and electric business, we are seeing new service connections up over 2020 and 2019, above pre-pandemic levels. In fact, we have not seen this level of new electric service connections in the last 10 years. We also attracted 105MW of new industrial load to our service territory, which brings with it 4,000 new jobs and more than $1 billion of investment.\nWe are expecting even more new load growth in the state. The work we did at the end of the year on two important growth mechanisms further enhanced Michigan's competitive position. We filed an economic development rate in November, which was quickly approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission in December. We also worked closely with the legislature, business groups, and the governor's office on a package of economic development incentive bills that passed with bipartisan support, signed by our governor in December.\nWith these improvements, I expect further announcements this year on several new projects. For you, our investors, I'm pleased to share we delivered our financial targets with another year of 7% adjusted EPS growth. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way. $55 million of cost savings were realized in 2021.\nWhen I step back and reflect on 2021, it is this strong execution and results that you and we expect, and it meets our commitment to the triple bottom line, positioning our business for sustainable, long-term growth. Strong execution leads to strong results, and 2021 marks another year of premium growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 in 2021 at the high end of our guidance range, and up 7% from 2020.\nIn January, the board approved an annual dividend increase to $1.84 per share. In addition to raising our annual dividend in 2022, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our 2022 adjusted full-year guidance to $2.85 to $2.89 from $2.85 to $2.87 per share. I have confidence in our plan for 2022 and our long-standing ability to manage the work and deliver industry-leading growth.\nLonger term, we remain committed to growing adjusted EPS to the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8%, with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. Finally, I'm pleased to share that we have rolled forward our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by over $1 billion to $14.3 billion through 2026. On slide five, we've highlighted our new five-year $14.3 billion customer investment plan.\nThis translates to 7% annual rate-based growth, and supports the two key focus areas of our strategy: making our electric and gas systems safer and more reliable, and paving the way to a clean energy future with net zero carbon and methane emissions.\nYou will note that about 40% of our investment mix is aimed at renewable generation, grid modernization, and main and service replacement on our gas system to support a clean energy transformation. Furthermore, we continue to increase our investments in what our customers count on us for every single day: safe and reliable electric and natural gas systems. You will also see that we continue to plan conservatively and have ample upside in projects not factored in this plan, such as our IRP and voluntary green pricing program.\nWe remain focused on the regulatory process as we make investment on behalf of our customers. In December, we received an order in our electric rate case. It offered several opportunities for us to improve our case process, and we are hard at work as we prepare our next case.\nThis order did support our plan by maintaining our existing 9.9% ROE, increasing our regulatory equity ratio by 34 basis points, and approving $54 million in revenue requirements, exclusive of $27 million of lower depreciation approved prior to the order. We expect to file our next electric rate case early this year, and anticipate an initial order on our IRP in April, and a final order in our gas rate case is expected by October. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2021 with adjusted net income of $767 million, or $2.65 per share, up 7% year-over-year off our 2020 results. I'll note that our adjusted EPS excludes select non-recurring items, most notably the financial performance of EnerBank, the gain on the sale, and related transaction costs, all of which are disclosed in the reconciliation schedule in the appendix of this presentation, and posted on our website.\nThe key drivers of our full-year financial performance in 2021 were rate relief, net of investment, coupled with strong volumetric sales in our electric business. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer initiatives related to safety, reliability, and decarbonization, and higher service restoration costs from storm activity.\nTo this last point on storms, we saw a record level of storms across Michigan in 2021, particularly in the final five months of the year, including December, and we still managed to deliver at the high end of our EPS guidance range. Our ability to withstand such headwinds, quite literally in the case of 2021, and deliver the financial results you've come to expect highlights our track record of planning conservatively, managing the work, and relying on the perennial will of our dedicated coworkers.\nWe deliver on the triple bottom line, irrespective of the conditions. Moving beyond EPS, on slide eight, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. It is worth noting that even with the aforementioned headwinds, we still managed to deliver over $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded our plan by over $80 million due to strong working capital management.\nThe only financial target missed in 2021 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for roughly $2.5 billion, and we ended the year just shy of that at $2.3 billion, primarily due to the timing of select renewable projects, which were largely pushed into 2022 and 2023. To close the books on 2021, we successfully completed our financing plan ahead of schedule, as noted during our third quarter earnings call, issuing no equity during the year given the EnerBank sale, while maintaining solid investment-grade credit metrics.\nMoving to our 2022 guidance, on slide nine, we are raising our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.85 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.87 per share, which implies premium annual growth off our 2021 results, as Garrick highlighted. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility, as it has for the past several years, and we also anticipate a return to normal operations at enterprises, whose financial performance in 2021 was largely impacted by an extended outage at Dig late in the fourth quarter.\nTo elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on slide 10, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to a penny per share of positive year-over-year variance.\nAdditionally, we anticipate $0.05 of EPS pickup attributable to rate relief, net of investment costs, largely driven by our recent electric rate order and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case later this year. As a reminder, we also continue to see the residual effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. As we look at our cost structure in 2022, you'll note approximately $0.21 per share of positive variance attributable to continued cost savings from productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives, as well as a return to more normalized levels of service restoration expense.\nAs noted earlier, we're also assuming a resumption of normalized operating conditions in enterprises, and the penultimate bar on the right-hand side of the chart, coupled with the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales.\nAs always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. Moving to slide 11, which denotes our near and long-term financial objectives, in addition to the adjusted earnings and dividend per share targets that Garrick noted earlier, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings and will continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly.\nTo that end, given the attractive valuation achieved in the EnerBank sale and our successful closing of the transaction in the fourth quarter, we do not anticipate issuing any equity through 2024, despite the increase in our five-year customer investment plan for $14.3 billion. Beyond 2024, we expect to issue up to $250 million of equity per year in 2025 and 2026.\nAs for 2022 financings, our needs are limited to debt issuances at the utility and the settlement of existing equity forward contracts, the details of which you can find in the appendix of our presentation. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable, and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well-trained, and empowered in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent, industry-leading financial performance.\nWe're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent, industry-leading growth in the long term, given widespread concerns about inflation, supply chain, and natural gas prices, among other risks. Our answer remains the same. Irrespective of the circumstances, we view it as our job to do the worrying for you.\nSustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success over the past several years, and as you can see in the breakout of our cost structure on slide 12, there remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business. As you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide, we estimate over $200 million of episodic cost savings opportunities through coal facility retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements, or PPAs.\nIn fact, our PPA with the Palisades Nuclear Facility will expire in April of this year, which will provide approximately $90 million of savings to our customers. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually, largely through the CE Way, our lean operating system, which, as Garrick noted earlier, was a key driver in our achievement of $55 million in cost savings in 2021 and $100 million worth in 2020. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and investors.\nTo conclude my remarks, on slide 13, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. With that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before Q&A.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has withstood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders, and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we've highlighted today, we have achieved another year of strong performance in 2021, executing on our commitment to the triple bottom line, and are pleased with our strong results. I'm confident we're in a great position to continue our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond.\nWe look forward to updating you as we head into another exciting year. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Garrick. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. If you're using a speaker function, please make sure you pick up your headset. We'll proceed in the order you signal us, and we'll take as many questions as time permits. If you do find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two on your touch-tone telephone.\nWe'll pause for just a second. Our first question today comes from Shah Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nShah Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nShah Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood stuff this morning. A couple of questions here, if I may. First, Garrick, you're guiding to the top end of 6% to 8%, which was kind of a change in language post-transformation, and now you kind of break out in more details the upside potential for non-IRP CapEx. Just to confirm, is this upside included in the updated language around the growth rate?\nMaybe another way to ask is, if you're already at the top end, you have $4 to 5 billion of incremental spending items within and sort of outside of the IRP. How do we think about this growth rate in the context of the upside spending opportunities you're highlighting this morning?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, great question, Shah. Let me offer this real clarity and offer a little bit of context. We're pleased with 2021 and delivering the high end of guidance. As I've shared previously, we've got a lot of momentum coming into 2022, and our raise in guidance should offer much confidence to the investment community on our strength here in 2022, and our confidence in the delivery in 2022. I'll remind you that our 6% to 8%, and again, toward the high end of that range, that's off a 2022 base.\nThat's our projection going forward. You know we plan conservatively, so again, you see a lot of upside in that capital plan, the IRP, the VGP type work. We'll weave those in as those materialize. We don't want to presume success in those. That's why we plan conservatively. Again, we expect to be at the high end of that 2022 base. That's the nature of our growth pattern going forward. I know Rejji wants to offer some additional comments there as well.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, good morning, Shah. Thanks for the question. The only thing I'll add to Garrick's comments, just to be our guess for the avoidance of doubt, is that the guidance toward the high end of that 6% to 8% off the 2022 base just assumes the capital plan we rolled out today of $14.3 billion over that five-year period, and the assumption of no equity through 2024. These other opportunities on the outside, looking in, that Garrick noted, the IRP, the Voluntary Green Pricing Program, or VGP, would give us even more confidence in delivering on that plan.\nAgain, delivery toward the high end off 2022 is just based on the $14.3 billion of capital and the assumption of no equity through 2024. Those are the key drivers.\n\nShah Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Just to follow up, the rate-based growth through 2026 is now 7%. It's a little bit of a slight change from prior year's language of greater than 7%. It's subtle. Is there sort of a law of large numbers taking effect here, just as we're thinking about modeling?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, you certainly do have that because we're compounding off of a higher base. It's a solid 7%, Shawn, so I wouldn't read too much into it.\n\nShah Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Lastly for me, in terms of the disclosures for 2025 through 2026 on the equity side, obviously you're restoring back the historical $250 per year. I'm sure Rejji, you're thinking about this, but do you see sort of any opportunities to maybe mitigate, find some optimization on the financing side, given that you're predominantly 100% regulated? Maybe a way to flex the balance sheet and credit metrics? Is there a way you can offset this?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, we'll see. I mean, the current base case for modeling purposes should be $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. What you'll see in the appendix, Shah, is we are assuming about over $10.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the next five years. If we see upside to that, that certainly gives us more financial flexibility. We've also really done a nice job executing very attractive, I'll say, equity-like securities that get equity credit like the hybrids we've been doing from time to time. We had a perpetual preferred last year that got nice equity credit.\nWe'll see if there are opportunities there. The current working assumption should be that $250 million per year in those outer years, 2025 and 2026.\n\nShah Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect, guys. Congrats on the execution. This is really good. Thanks.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning. How are you, Jeremy?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood, thanks. It seems very clear from the slides that there's various CapEx upside that we could see. Just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more for the timing on when these items could make their way into play and what we should be watching for there.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI assume you're talking about the incremental items, just to clarify your question.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYes, the incremental CapEx opportunity.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nCertainly. As you know, we're in the midst of an Integrated Resource Plan, and we don't want to presume, although we're confident in that plan, we don't want to presume that the Covert facility and the DIG facility will move into the utility. There's certainly a lot of good indicators around that. Nonetheless, we want to make sure that that's where it lands. We'll see a final order in the IRP by June of this year.\nAgain, assuming success there, we would anticipate the Covert facility in 2023 and then the DIG facilities out in 2025 from an incremental opportunity. Our VGP, again, that's subscription-based, based on customers. We saw some positive traction in that that we announced this week with General Motors. That construction would be, as those fill out and as those are subscribed, that construction period would be in 2024 to 2027. That's the nature of, as that materializes, it would show up in that range.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. If these come to fruition, would this impact, I guess, the funding plan on the equity side?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nHey, Jeremy. Hey, this is Rejji. We had said before, in the event the IRP gets approved, we do not believe we would need to materially change our equity issuance needs. Now, the VGP plus the IRP, if we have those high-class problems, we would potentially have to recalibrate. To be clear, that would only be outside of 2024. You think about the timing of the capital investments. Covert would potentially be before 2024. Again, we feel good about not needing to issue equity even in that scenario before 2024.\nWhere we may need to recalibrate is if we get the IRP and good momentum on the VGP, those outer years 2025 and beyond, we may have to take a second look there. For now, again, feel very good about the working assumptions of this plan.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. Just a quick last one, if I could. With regards to the electric rate case here, the outcome might have been a bit lighter than expected. Just wondering if you could comment a bit more, I guess, on the go-forward expectations in Michigan as far as the regulatory construct there, as well as the specific drivers in 2022 that you're using to kind of offset some of that softness.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nRejji and I will tag team this. Let me be very clear. I feel good about the regulatory construct here in Michigan. When I look at this rate case, there are two things to take away from it. One, there's an investor read-through on a strong and constructive ROE, 9.9%. That has been constructive, especially when compared with other jurisdictions. There's good, solid equity thickness. In fact, our regulatory equity ratio grew by 34 basis points.\nThat just, again, speaks to the nature of this commission and this regulatory construct. Again, all based in legislation, so don't forget that piece of it as well. The other piece of opportunity is clear in the order. As a utility, we need to improve our business cases, particularly in a forward-looking test year.\nThe additional investments we want to make on behalf of our customer, we need to do a better job of showing the benefits as well as the cost when compared to historical. That's on us. We own that, and you can expect to see it in our next electric rate case. Let me hand it over to Rejji to walk through a little bit of why we have such confidence in 2022.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Jeremy. As you think about the offsets with the order or from the order, it really highlights the benefits of having a forward test year. Where we had disallowances in that forward test year, we obviously can revise our capital and O&M spend programs. That's a clear offset from some of the disallowances we saw. A couple of things related to 2021 and then in this test year give us great confidence.\nAs you may recall, we had plans to issue equity in 2021. Obviously, given the timing of the EnerBank sale, we did not have to issue any equity that year. We've got some momentum from a share count perspective. That's helpful. I continue to feel quite good about weather normalized load.\nWe saw a really nice recovery from commercial industrial sales over the course of 2021. We anticipate seeing some of that in 2022 as well, particularly given the leading indicators that we've seen with respect to new service requests, which Garrick offered in his prepared remarks. We continue to see upside from our residential customers given the sort of teleworking phenomenon that we think should stick to some extent.\nThen cost performance. Every year, I continue to be surprised to the upside by what the organization can deliver. Last year, our plan was about $45 million, and we delivered $55 million there. In 2020, I can assure you we didn't plan for $100 million of savings, and the organization went and got it. Those are all the drivers that we think will offset some of the downside we saw in the electric rate order.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, thank you. My first question, you guys dealt with a lot of storms, especially in 2021. I think in the last rate case, there were also just conversations about potential spending and whatnot. Did the more string of storms more recently identify any? Could be added to your go-forward plans?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Insoo. Good morning. I want to be real clear with everyone here. We're at our largest electric reliability capital spend that we've had in our company's history, and it's actually 40% over 2020. We're at a good pace in terms of electric reliability. Clearly, as we demonstrated in this electric rate case, there is more to do across our vast system. We'll be making requests in this upcoming electric rate case with, of course, better business. There is room for improvement, and we're well aligned with this.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Final question, just going back to the demand and comments you guys made. For 2022, if I'm understanding correctly, you're thinking more of a modest flag to modest growth, and year-over-year growth. Is that correct? You’ve talked about positive signals. Is there any particular segment or industries that you're seeing that out of?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Insoo, this is Rejji. I think your working assumption for blended weather normalized load on the electric side is about right. Call it just slightly up, flat to about a half a point. Again, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing on the residential side. Last year, we assumed a pretty aggressive return to work, and we ultimately saw residential down about 2.5%, a little over that versus 2020. Our plan was much more bearish, and we saw surprisingly upside versus plan there.\nCommercial, we've already seen commercial over the case of 2021 up about 3.3%. Effectively, at this point, back to pre-pandemic levels when you take energy waste reduction into account. Industrial, I'd say, admittedly, it's still coming back, and that's why we feel good about 2022 versus 2021, about somewhere between 1% to 2%.\nCommercial, basically flat to slightly up. Industrial, we still expect to see pretty good growth there, around 5%. That on a blended basis gets you to around a point. I'm sorry, excuse me. Flat to slightly up, about half a point all in. The positive signal for new service requests, to point to a specific sector, I think, would be challenging because we're pretty diversified in our service territory. Clearly, we're seeing good news in auto.\nNow, again, auto represents a couple percent of our gross margin, so not a great deal of exposure there. Across most sectors, we expect to continue to see Michigan trend well. As Garrick noted in his prepared remarks, we're seeing some very attractive economic development opportunities on the industrial side. We're not in a position right now to disclose those sectors, but we see a number of, I'll say, a combination of old and new economy sectors looking at Michigan as a place to land. We feel very good about the road ahead economically in Michigan.\n\nInsoo Kim\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks. That's a good color. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, everyone. Good morning.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Michael.\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, Garrick. Just first wanted to ask on level of conviction and ability to potentially settle the IRP in the next couple of weeks or months here.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. I'm just going to break this down really clearly. I feel good about taking it the full distance. I want to make sure that's very clear on the table. There's a 60% reduction in carbon by 2025 over 2005 baseline levels, and there's an opportunity for a more resilient supply system. Those are the factors of this. I've said this before. There's a winning here for everyone, and we feel very strong about taking the full length and getting what we need for our customers, as well as for our investors.\nBottom line, whether it's an electric case, gas case, or an IRP, we're going to look at an opportunity to settle. Right now, we're in a sweet spot where there's an opportunity to do that.When there's a win in there for everyone, there's an opportunity to either have a partial settlement or a full settlement. We'll look at that and work with the parties to see if something can materialize there. Just like there's an opportunity there, all those wins allow us to take it to the full distance as well. I feel confident either way that we'll get what we need for our customers, the plan, and for our shareholders. Is that helpful, Michael?\n\nMichael Sullivan\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Super helpful. Thank you. My other question was, Rejji, I think you mentioned one of the main drivers for the lower-than-plan CapEx last year was some slippage on renewables projects. Can you just give a little more detail on that?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Michael. Good morning. We had some renewable projects that we had to push out a little bit. I think the issues around supply chain are pretty well publicized across not just the country, but the planet. We saw some of that with respect to our projects. We still expect to get the projects executed over time, but we did have to push them out a little bit. That was really the primary driver. I'd say across some projects, there were some issues related to supply chain matters.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nMichael, I'm going to jump in on—can I just jump in on this one as well? I've been involved in large power plants and operations for 25+ years. I don't think there's been a year in those 25 where I haven't seen projects move from year to year. Major projects in terms of outages, in terms of construction timelines differed. It's pretty typical in our industry to have a little give and take.\nThis supply chain challenge that's in front of us will dissipate over time. I have no doubt about that. Remember this, we're retiring coal, and you have to fill that capacity somehow. These projects aren't going away. It's just a matter of when we plant them and what year. Again, this is pretty typical for the work we do year after year, this give and take. I'm not worried, not concerned, and this too will pass.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nUtilities and Midstream Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Solution Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question on the new CapEx plan, I see that excludes $1 billion from the voluntary renewables program. My question is, you've been using that billion-dollar number for a little while now. Shouldn't that be higher given the new customers you signed up? I understand the spending might be in kind of the later years of the plan, but should that number be a bigger round?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThe billion dollars equates to 1,000MW of renewables. The way this works is customers subscribe to that, and when we have a certain number of subscriptions, we build out that. The 1,000MW equates to the billion dollars. Does that help, Andrew?\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nRemind me, how many megawatts are you up to signed up now?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe've got it. This program started at 120MW. That is fully subscribed, and we're now in the second phase of subscribing the 1,000MW.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Got it. You still got a little way to get to that billion. Okay. Great. My next question is, if I compare the old CapEx plan to the new one, it seems—I understand there's the roll forward, but it seems like your electric spending is down by about half a billion, and gas spending is up by about a billion. Is that a conscious shift in strategy, or is that just the output of a bottoms-up budget-building process?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt's really a bottoms-up piece. Just let me offer a little bit in the gas. Back in November 2020, we got a large pipeline project approved through an Act 9, which is the equivalent of a certificate of necessity. That is folded into this plan. As you might imagine, replacing 56mi of large transmission pipe, the project's around, I think it's $550 million in that range. That's a big factor that, as you build that bottoms-up approach, it shows up in the gas and in this vintage of capital and capital five-year plan.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. Just one last one, if I could squeeze it in. On the relative growth between the earnings and the dividend, you're targeting the high end of 6% to 8% for earnings. I know your targeted dividend payout ratio is 60% versus about 64% in 2022. You just announced a 5.7% dividend increase. Is that a pace that we should expect for the next couple of years till you get to that 60% ratio?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nAndrew, yeah, this is Rejji. I think conceptually you're right in that you're going to see a decoupling, at least in the short term, between the earnings growth and the dividend per share growth. That's what we're showing with this recent increase in the dividend because we did mention on the heels of the EnerBank sale that we'll glide down or we'll glide path down to a low 60% payout ratio.\nRight now, we're kind of mid-60s, and we'll glide path down over time. You'll see a little decoupling between the earnings growth, which will be a little stronger than the dividend per share growth, but we still think both are healthy and combined offer a very attractive total shareholder return proposition.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nDefinitely. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, team. Hey, thanks for the time. Well done. Perhaps just coming back to a couple of things. The economic development tariffs, just to come to that first here, how do you think about that impacting 2022? You mentioned pretty strong industrial load. Obviously, these economic development tariffs kind of shift those impacts and load sensitivity to earnings sensitivity. Can you talk a little bit about what that could do? I imagine it's not too material, but curious.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Let me offer a little more color on these economic. There are two pieces. We were very successful toward the end of the year in establishing an economic development rate. We filed that in November, and as I said, almost record approval here with the commission, public service commission, and staff, which we see as a really good indicator here in Michigan and the opportunity to encourage job growth and jobs here in Michigan. It is an economic development rate, which is very competitive out there, and it is designed for energy-intensive customers.\nThe next piece is we worked to achieve an economic set of bills that offered incentives to make Michigan competitive. That was offered through, again, bipartisan support through the legislature, signed by the governor. That was close to $1 billion, $1.5 billion of incentives here in the state.\nGM made their big announcement, nearly $7 billion of investment in Michigan, 4,000 new jobs. That is a direct result of that work. We feel good by the initial volley here. As Rejji said, and I shared in my prepared remarks, there are more that are considering Michigan. We see a lot of upside from an industrial and jobs growth perspective, and ultimately the spillover benefits. Rejji, I don't know if you want to add any additional context to that at all.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nNo, I think you laid it out well, Garrick.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAll right. We'll see what happens this year. Perhaps if I could pivot on Campbell, just super quick if I can. Campbell retirement, as you've alluded to several times already, retirement in the 2025 timeframe, that's come up a lot in the IRP and represents a substantive portion of the own-end savings. I think it's order of magnitude $60 million. Do you have offsets for this retirement? Again, as you think about it, if it's pushed back, for instance, in an IRP settlement, or again, how you would think about that fitting into your plan to the extent to which that moves out, if you will?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, in my earlier comments, just to be really clear, $650 million of savings in total requires the retirement of Campbell one, two, and three. I started my career at that plant. You can't do a partial there. It just doesn't work. You need the whole thing, one for the savings piece for our customers, but you can't do a partial retirement. That's critically important in this equation and this IRP. The second piece is when you retire a plant like that, you need the backfill in terms of capacity, in terms of energy. The lowest cost option of that, we've proved through modeling, is through Covert and through the DIG facilities. This is why it all comes together quite nicely.\nIt's very clear what's necessary to see this type of savings for our customers, to improve the supply side from a resiliency perspective, and then also to have a 60% reduction in carbon. That's how we're approaching it. Again, a lot of benefits, a lot of wins for everyone, and we think we can achieve that. Not I think. We know we can achieve that here in 2022.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. Just even further to clarify that, your core base plan, it doesn't reflect Campbell per se. The IRP, shall we say, outside, as we talked about from a capital perspective, and making that affordable is predicated on Campbell, right? Just to segment that apart.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYes. We need Campbell. We need all of Campbell to retire. Again, that's not built into our plans, not our five-year plans at all. Not the savings, not the capital upside. It's not in the plans. Just to be clear there.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent, guys. Well, I wish you the best of luck. Let's see what happens in Michigan this year. Cheers.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThanks, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Nick Campanella at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nVP, Credit Suisse\n\nHey. Good morning, everyone.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nVP, Credit Suisse\n\nHey. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to go back to the electric rate case quick. Absolutely acknowledge really healthy ROE and equity ratio. The commission did seem to push back on capital costs, specifically with that one solar project, at least for this order. Can you confirm you're moving forward with that project still? How should we think about subsequent approvals in your clean energy generation capital plan? Understanding it's obviously imperative for the company's decarbonization goals, the commission does seem to be taking a slower approach to at least your initial set of projects here. Thanks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nI don't agree. I don't agree with that conclusion that they're taking a slower approach. The language is really clear in the ex parte order and in the electric rate case, their support for green energy. In fact, that Washtenaw project, and it's clear that it's been supported from a construction standpoint and a regulatory recovery standpoint. Now, Rejji will walk through a little bit of the financial piece and how we'll progress with that project here over the course of 2022 and 2023.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Nick, so again, to Garrick's point, we feel very confident that it was really a deferred decision by the commission because they did approve the contract in November before the electric rate order. The only reason it wasn't approved in the order is just given the timing in which it was introduced into the case. We do expect to get a constructive outcome and a subsequent filing. As a result of that, to Garrick's point, we'll continue to execute on the project. Because of the high probability of approval, we'll recognize AFUDC equity and debt accounting on this project. There'll be no P&L drag, if you will, and just a little bit of deferred cash flow or lag on the cash flow side.\nWe fully expect to move forward on the project and, again, expect a constructive outcome in the subsequent case. Is that helpful?\n\nSri Maddipati\n\nTreasurer and VP of Finance and Investor Relations, CMS Energy\n\nYep, that's very clear. Appreciate the time today. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold at Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Arnold\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nGood morning, guys.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nGood morning, Jonathan.\n\nJonathan Arnold\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nJust a quick question. Again, on the five-year plan, thanks for the clarity on what's driving the step up and the gap side. That was clear. I'm just curious, though, on the electric distribution line. It seemed to take a pretty meaningful step down in 2022. I think that explained most of the delta. Can you square that, Garrick, with your comments about customer growth, new connections, and the like? Maybe the rate case is partly the answer, but just curious there.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Specifically for new growth, both electric connections, and we have a deferral mechanism on there. We can allocate the appropriate amount of capital for growth and then see recovery in a subsequent case. That has been a practice we've had, at least the last couple of rate cases, that allow us to—it's in three areas, both in new business, asset relocations, and demand capital. That has been very helpful in allowing us to expand our electric capital in year as a result of changes in the environment, like great business growth.\nThat's an important piece. The other piece that I would just, again, point back to, our electric reliability spend is robust. It's the largest we've had here across our company, 40% over 2020. I would offer this: there's better and more important work we need to do in this next electric rate case. We have more capital that we want to invest on behalf of our customers and electric reliability to offer benefits and improve our performance there. We'll work to engage that into the—and build that out in the next case. I know Rejji would also offer some comments as well.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. Jonathan, the only thing I'd add, you noted that there was a slight dip in the front end of the five-year plan in the distribution spend. You can see the little off trend. We tend to, and have historically, been on about a billion-dollar-per-year spend rate for all the reliability work that we know needs to get done in our service territory. The dip in 2022, that's attributable to just aligning the spend plan in 2022 with the rate order. We had about $100 million or so, or thereabouts, of disallowance in the rate order. Obviously, with the four tests here, we can toggle our plans accordingly. That's really what's driving some of that decline in 2022, which is a little off trend.\nOkay. Great. That's perfect. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Travis Miller at Morningstar. Please go ahead.\n\nTravis Miller",
    "content2": "Senior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nTravis?\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nBack to the IRP, just thinking about timing post-IRP, would you get a decision soon enough or have concrete plans soon enough to weave anything from the IRP into the presumed electric rate case filing this year?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWe're going to file our electric rate case here in April timeframe. That's our plan right now. We don't anticipate—initial order could come out very earliest in April, and then a final order in June. I don't anticipate that that'll be woven into this electric rate case.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. What is your thought on timing of maybe specific projects or capital, at least generally, from the IRP? A year out, six months out from the decision? What's your thought there?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWhat? Our intent here is to—again, I don't want to presume approval. I think that would be—I don't want to get in front of the commission on that. Again, confidence in a final order by June. Let's play this out, covert, dig into the utility. We'd look to update our plans, our five-year plans in kind of the normal cycle to reflect those changes.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nOkay. Perfect. Real quick on the enterprises side, any update to the strategy there?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nEnterprises continues to be an important part of our business, although a really small part of our business. Just as a reminder for everyone on the call, it's about 4% of our earnings mix, so again, small. As dig and other facilities move into the utility, that enterprises group grows even smaller. Right now, it's focused on renewables and customer relationships. Let me offer a little bit more context around that.\nFor example, a company like General Motors, or one of the companies that Enterprises works with, they have long-term commitment to sustainability across their global footprint, so they provide a creditworthy party, and we have a long contract period. We help them find renewable assets throughout the US, and that's the role we play. We see utility-like returns or better in that space. Again, we're not out in the auctions.\nWe're not out being squeezed from a margin perspective. It's specifically designed at customer relationships and helping them meet their sustainability targets. It's narrow, it's thoughtful, it's a small part of our business, but important for our strategic customers.\n\nTravis Miller\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Morningstar\n\nGot it. Great. Thanks so much. That's all I had.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey. Good morning. Hopefully, just two quick ones. I don't know if I'm reading too deep into this, but if I think of the '21 actual at $2.65, the range you gave for 2022 of $1.85 to 1.89, the midpoint there is not actually towards the high end of the 68. It's actually above the high end. This is before any of the additional capital. It seems that you're actually not even trending towards the high end. You're above the high end. Was this just smaller numbers and moving a decimal place here or there, or is there more to read through to this?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, here's the good news, Anthony. You said 185 to 189. It's 285 to 289.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nApologies. It's a long morning. Apologies.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nNo problem. We're happy with where we landed this year. We've got a lot of momentum coming into the year for some of the reasons that Rejji articulated earlier. You may want to jump in again on this one. Bottom line, we've offered guidance there. We feel we've expanded and raised that guidance and feel good, really good, and confident about landing there. As I shared earlier, likely in the midpoint range. A lot of year left, but in the midpoint of that range we offer today. After this and really into 2022, that is the base year. We'll grow at that 6% to 8% toward the high side. Anything else to offer on that, Rejji?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nNo. I think you hit the key point, Garrick, which is the 6% to 8% guidance, Anthony, and that sort of confidence toward the high end. That is off of the 2022 base. I think 2023 and beyond, 2022 is a fairly atypical year, again, given the sale of the bank. That's why you see a little bit higher growth in the range of $2.85 to 2.89 off of the 2021 actuals at $2.65. It implies like 7.5% to 9%. We don't foresee ourselves growing at that clip going forward. It's just an atypical year as we reduce the dilution from the EnerBank sale and redeploy the capital.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nWhat has to happen for you guys to hit the 6? Why even the 6 there? It seems that you guys are really fully loaded 7 to 8. I'm just curious, what's the scenario where you come into this 6? Why not remove it, I guess, is my question.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, I mean, even though the range may seem wide on a percentage basis, it's about $0.04 to 0.05 on average, Anthony. We think that that's plenty conservative to give us a little room to land the plane. We feel good about the guidance range, which again, I think is one of the tightest in the sector.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Just last, I think you said digs. The plant had an extended outage in 2021. What was the issue, and is that plant back in service?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah. The quick answer is back in service. There was a supply line of gas that was feeding into the plant that needed some additional construction work. Having been in the gas business for a long time, we know once that type of work's done, it lasts about 70 years or so. We feel good about the fact that that was non-recurring and will be back at normal operations going forward for the foreseeable future. Just to be clear, it wasn't our gas line. It was from a third party. That's now fixed, and we're off and running.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nSenior Analyst, Glenrock Associates\n\nHey. How's it going?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nIt's going well, Paul. Thanks.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nSenior Analyst, Glenrock Associates\n\nJust an apology for the misses, but the normalized storm impact for 2021 that you guys, I guess the delta that you guys are thinking, I see that you're combining it with customer initiatives. How much was the storm? What are you thinking about in terms of how should we think about storms this year, I mean, in 2021 versus in 2022?\n\nRejji Hayes\n\nEVP and CFO, CMS Energy\n\nYeah, Paul, thanks for the question. We've seen, at least over the last four or five years, an increase in sort of the, I'll say, the volume and the intensity of storms. Service restoration has been somewhat volatile. Last year, I'd say, was atypical, even relative to the last few years. I think if you look back from, say, pre-pandemic levels to 2020, we were on a spend rate of somewhere around $70 to 80 million. In 2021, we were a multiple on top of that, I think almost 2 to 3x that. Not 3x, but closer to 2x. We just don't foresee a level of service restoration at those levels in 2022. We expect to be sort of, I think we have in rates about $65 million.\nWe may be a little north of that when all is said and done this year. We certainly do not think we will see numbers in excess of $100 million, $150 million, which is where we were last year. That is how we are thinking about it, sort of more towards where we are in rates and maybe slightly above that. Is that helpful?\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nSenior Analyst, Glenrock Associates\n\nThat is helpful. Just with respect to COVID, I mean, it looks like you guys have done very well during it. It looks you gave a lot of information on the usage and everything. I'm just wondering, is it kind of, are we sort of, is COVID kind of a non-issue at this point? Should we think of that in terms of 2022 and going forward? I mean, obviously, you can't predict the pandemic. I mean, you know what I'm sort of saying. How do you think of COVID impacting stuff, I guess, in 2022?\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nWell, I don't want to deminimize COVID or the health effects to people, and so I'll be sensitive to my response here. Bottom line, in Michigan here, we're seeing all the economic indicators are headed in the right direction. People have figured out a way to be able to work, live, and even play in the midst of a pandemic. As a company, we found ways to work safely with the appropriate precautions in place.\nAgain, we're not seeing what we saw at the beginning of the pandemic, which was economic shutdowns and other factors influencing load. It's really on the upswing, and all economic indicators are, again, headed in the right direction. I would put it in more of a perspective that we figured out how to work within the context of COVID.\n\nPaul Patterson\n\nSenior Analyst, Glenrock Associates\n\nOkay. Great. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\n\nGarrick Rochow\n\nPresident and CEO, CMS Energy\n\nThank you, Garrick Rochow. I want to thank everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Take care and stay safe.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. Have a wonderful day. Thank you."

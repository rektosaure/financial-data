McInerney\n\nPresident, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Jennifer. We finished fiscal full year 2025 with strong financial performance and ever-growing obsession for our clients and a sharp focus on innovation as we build the future of payments. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $10.7 billion, and EPS was up 10%, resulting in full year net revenue and EPS year-over-year growth of 11% and 14%, respectively.\nTotal full year payments volume was $14 trillion, up 8% year-over-year in constant dollars and process transactions totaled $258 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Our financial performance and growth demonstrate how Visa has become a hyperscaler, enabling anyone that wants to be in the money movement or payments business to build on top of the Visa as a Service stack. You may recall the layers of the stack, the foundation layer, the services layer, the solutions layer and the access layer. Throughout 2025 and most recently in Q4, we have intensified our investment in innovation.\nToday, I want to highlight Visa's progress with our clients and the ecosystem at large, across the Visa as a Service stack, starting with the foundation layer. At the foundation of the stack is our global connectivity, our network and our network of networks that enable global commerce and money movement. In full year 2025, we expanded our network of networks in three important ways.\nFirst, more connection points. Visa's network of networks now has approximately 12 billion end points, that's about 4 billion cards, bank accounts and digital wallets each; second, more settlement currencies, we are adding support for 4 stablecoins running on 4 unique blockchains, representing 2 currencies that we can accept and convert to over 25 traditional fee at currencies; and third, we have begun deployment of the next generation of VisaNet, the core processing platform in our Visa as a Service stack. It offers a cloud-ready micro services distributed modular architecture that uses open languages and technologies, enabling easier scaling, configuration and faster feature deployment.\nOver half of the new code base was built with the assistance of generative AI, improving development speed, security and maintainability. We have specific modules in market today with plans to roll out additional modules and markets.\nThe next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our services layer, which encompasses the building blocks of our core capabilities, including credentials, tokens, authentication, risk management, fraud detection and more, which we've turned into discrete modular components. We grew the number of Visa credentials by $270 million this year, and we continue to sign many deals this past quarter to drive further growth.\nI'll share a few regional highlights. We are pleased to have renewed our nearly 60-year relationship with Barclays in the U.K. and the U.S. across their millions of customers in consumer and commercial issuing and acquiring and enabling increased focus on value-added services utilization. In the U.S., Visa continues to be the exclusive payment network for the Southwest Airlines co-brand program and we will soon be expanding our relationship into a co-brand debit offering, providing customers a new way to earn Rapid Rewards points on everyday purchases.\nIn Latin America, We won the new Scotiabank Wealth Management credit card issuance with our Visa Infinite product across 7 countries. And in Mainland China, one of our largest clients, China Merchants Bank, has renewed their long-standing relationship with us as we continue to upgrade China's Magstripe dual-branded cards to contactless EMV chip cards.\nMoving to tokens, we now have over 16 billion Visa tokens, up from 10 billion just in May of 2024. We continue to increase the amount of Visa tokens globally in pursuit of our ultimate goal of 100% of e-commerce transactions tokenized. We continue to enhance our risk management capabilities, including Visa scam disruption which proactively detects scam activity at the network level that no single issuer, acquirer or a merchant could see alone and leverages AI, enhanced merchant monitoring external intelligence feeds and our global expertise. Just a year since launch, we have worked closely with our clients and law enforcement to dismantle more than 25,000 scan merchants representing more than $1 billion in fraud attempts.\nOur stablecoin platform is another key component of our services layer. Since 2020 we facilitated over $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin flows, including Visa users purchasing more than $100 billion of crypto and stablecoin assets using their Visa credentials and spending more than $35 billion in crypto and stablecoin assets using Visa credentials. Within this, we see particular momentum with stablecoins. We now have more than 130 stablecoin-linked card issuing programs in over 40 countries. And in Q4, stablecoin-linked Visa card spend quadrupled versus a year ago. We expanded the number of stable coins and blockchains available for settlement and monthly volume has now passed a $2.5 billion annualized run rate.\nWe are starting to enable banks to mint and burn their own stablecoins with the Visa tokenized asset platform, and we are adding stablecoin capabilities to enhance cross-border money movement with Visa Direct. In September 2025, we announced a stablecoin prefunding Visa Direct pilot targeting banks, remitters and financial institutions seeking faster, more flexible ways to manage liquidity, and there is much more to come in this space.\nThe next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our solutions layer, a comprehensive portfolio of solutions where we have taken the componentized capabilities from the services layer and invested in and enhanced them to create new features and capabilities we deliver to a broader array of customers and partners. If we look across our growth levers in this layer, I would note progress in a number of areas.\nIn consumer payments, Visa Intelligent Commerce integrates Visa's token technology with authentication and predictive analytics empowering partners to deploy secure, personalized digital commerce experiences. And I'm pleased to announce that we are now powering live agentic transactions and recently released a merchant agent toolkit to make it easy for developers to embed our solutions into workflows and agentic processes.\nJust 2 weeks ago, we announced the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol, a framework that enables safer agent-driven checkout by helping merchants verify agents and avoid malicious bots. And since it's built on existing messaging standards, minimal integration is required for merchants.\nNext, our Visa Flex Credential continues to gain momentum enabling consumers to access many underlying funding sources with a single credential powered by Visa token technology. For example, the Klarna card launched in 15 European markets building on its success in the U.S. where it had over 1 million sign-ups in less than 3 months, and they will expand to even more markets soon. Our Visa Flex pipeline is strong, and we now have more than 20 signed clients in more than 20 countries across all regions, including our first Visa Flex announcement in LAC with [indiscernible].\nOur Visa Accept Solution enables even the smallest of sellers to accept card payments with just a Visa debit card and an NFC capable smartphone. Our first live launch of Visa Accept was in Srilanka, which represents an opportunity to bring an estimated 7 million sellers onto the Visa network most of which are informal sellers who primarily transact in cash today. And this is just our first launch. We are targeting 25 countries across several regions where we expect to launch Visa Accept soon with even more expansion to follow.\nOur Visa Pay Solution connects any participating wallet to any Visa-accepting seller worldwide, local or international, in-store or online. We are pleased to now be processing live Visa Pay transactions in 4 markets across AP and EMEA, including our recently announced market launch in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nIn addition, we have a pipeline with more than 70 clients to expand across more markets in 2026 and beyond. Rounding out consumer payments is tapped to everything. 79% of all face-to-face transactions are taps, up 8 percentage points this year with the U.S. at 66%. Our transit initiatives contributed to this expansion, and this year, we enabled more than 100 new transit systems to now total approximately 1,000 systems globally, delivering 19% year-over-year growth in transactions.\nIn Europe, BBVA recently launched BBVA Pay, enabling tapping from an iOS device for all Visa cards within their banking app. They also have enabled customers to use AI to create their own personalized Visa cards starting in Spain.\nTap to Phone which provides an easy, low-cost method for micro sellers to begin accepting card payments or large sellers to add additional mobile terminals, has now passed 20 million transacting devices more than doubling since last year with strong growth across all regions.\nAnd Tap to Add Card launched a little over a year ago, has strong adoption as consumers and our partners see the value of a simplified, more secure customer experience where a simple card tap to a mobile device can add a Visa credential to a digital wallet. Since Q3, we have doubled the count of issuers participating globally to more than 600 across all regions resulting in the service being live for more than 1.4 billion Visa credit and debit cards around the world.\nShifting to CMS and starting with Visa Commercial Solutions, our full year 2025 commercial payments volume grew 7% in constant dollars to $1.8 trillion. This was helped by targeting specific segments including business owners and online travel agencies. In the premium card segment, we supported Chase with the launch of Chase Sapphire Reserve for business on Visa Infinite, and expansion of the Sapphire Reserve product line. The Sapphire Reserve for Business Card is designed to meet the needs of business owners by elevating their travel experience and offering premium benefits and value towards business services to help fuel their growth.\nAnd also in the U.S., we are excited to have partnered with Truist to launch the Truist Business Premium Visa Infinite Card, a premium credit card designed for small businesses with meaningful annual spend. They are the first super regional to do so in this country. Our purpose-built travel solution offers virtual card credentials automated reconciliation and rich data.\nWe recently won Trip.com's global virtual travel card issuing business, which will be issued through their fintech TripLink, in our traditional carded business, our global network agnostic enhanced spend management capabilities have helped us to expand our partnership with BMO. We recently won new commercial issuance and BMO will offer our spend clarity for enterprise tool to their corporates in the U.S. and Canada. Our unique FX capabilities enabled us to win a de novo issuing relationship with ICICI Bank for India's first corporate ForEx prepaid card, targeting both SMBs and large corporates to meet foreign exchange payment needs for business travel.\nIn fact, in India, the Visa SMB cards have doubled since 2020 and now total more than 10 million helping us to grow total commercial cards to 340 million worldwide.\nMoving on to Visa Direct, which reached 12.6 billion transactions in full year 2025 and up 27% year-over-year. Our push to account and wallet funding capabilities continue to help us to expand cross-border payouts. We signed with KCB in East Africa, where they will use Visa Direct to account for 8 corridors across the more than 30 million individual and business customers.\nTouch 'n Go eWallet the largest wallet in Malaysia with more than 24 million users will leverage Visa Direct to enable tourists to fund their wallets across 8 corridors. And [indiscernible], a leading remitter with the largest branch network in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, expanded on its Visa Direct to card usage to now include Visa Direct to account.\nAnd our interoperability capabilities unlocked through our YellowPepper acquisition enabled us to renew with Yape and Plin, securing our position as the leader for interoperable transactions in Peru.\nNow moving to value-added services. where we have seen our innovations across issuing acceptance, risk and advisory continue to power our growth. We have achieved our goal to expand Pismo offerings to clients in more than 5 countries across 4 regions in 2025. In the fourth quarter, we signed our first Pismo deal for a stable coin linked card with notice pay in Europe.\nIn Acceptance Solutions, our Token Management Service, or TMS, provides a single network and payment service provider agnostic integration to simplify token adoption access and management for merchants and acquiring clients. This quarter, we signed with Booking.com for TMS and account updater across more than 65 markets deepening our presence in the online travel platform space. Many of our risk and security solutions are also network agnostic.\nLet me highlight a few points of progress. Visa Advanced Authorization evaluates more than 400 unique attributes in a few milliseconds, and this quarter, Banco diners in Ecuador deployed our network agnostic solution to score both Visa and non-Visa transactions, the first bank in LAC to do so.\nOur award-winning product, Visa Protect for A2A is delivering value with AI. Our pilot in Brazil scored nearly $500 billion of our bank partners [ PIKs ] volume over a 6-month period and identified over $90 million of fraud, which could have been prevented with a detection rate of more than 80%. We believe Visa Protect for A2A can play an important role in Brazil by providing real-time fraud monitoring on PIKs, helping to reduce fraud for our bank partners and ensure a safer payment experience for buyers and sellers.\nOur most recently acquired risk capabilities from Featurespace are being sought after by our clients with more than 100 closed client deals since January. And our advisory services continued to deliver revenue and deepen our client relationships across Visa. In Consulting, we estimate that we help clients realize over $6.5 billion of incremental revenue as a result of delivering almost 4,500 engagements during the year, including Gen AI and stable coin engagements.\nIn Marketing Services, our flagship sponsorships include the FIFA World Cup 2026 in the U.S., Canada and Mexico as well as the Olympic and Paralympic Winter games in Milano Cortina. We are already seeing significant interest from our clients as they seek to offer unique cardholder experiences and build their brand in addition to helping drive issuance, acceptance and engagement. One Olympic and Paralympic related marketing example was our first large-scale campaign created using generative AI tools for Intesa Sanpaolo which showcased a ski race down the streets of Italy's seaside villages. We already have over 35 clients engaged with us for marketing services for the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Games and more than 70 for the FIFA World Cup 2026 with more than 100 already in our pipeline.\nThe fourth and final layer of the Visa as a service stack on top of the foundation layer the services layer and the solutions layer is the access layer. The client entry point to access Visa solutions. We take an open partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our Visa as a Service stack through multiple integration methods, including custom integrations, programmatic access via APIs and structured data exchange through our Model Context Protocol or MCP server.\nWe remain the payments platform of choice in full year 2025 with more than 700 billion API calls across our more than 3,700 endpoints. And we recently launched our MCP server, providing access for AI systems to interface with our Visa Intelligent commerce APIs. Our open, flexible access layer enables anyone whether a small business, a tech partner or a global bank to build on top of the Visa as a Service stack and operate at scale instantly.\nIn conclusion, you can see our intense focus on innovation is delivering results for Visa and our clients. The Visa as a Service stack has positioned Visa to be a hyperscaler for the payments ecosystem. Our strong fiscal year 2025 performance is a result of our products resonating in the market and our commitment to our clients every day.\nI want to thank our more than 34,000 employees around the world who will continue to obsess about our clients and work tirelessly in 2026 and beyond to deliver value through the Visa as a Service stack to our clients and across our partner ecosystem. We live in remarkable times and payments as technologies are converging to reshape commerce. And at Visa, with our clients, partners, sellers and consumers we are keeping our focus on innovation and product development, positioning Visa to lead this transformation.\nNow to Chris, where he will discuss our financial performance and outlook for 2026.\n\nChristopher Suh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on the momentum we saw through the first 3 quarters, we had a very good Q4 to finish the year with continued strong and stable business drivers. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year-over-year, improving slightly from Q3. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, was up 11% and total processed transactions grew 10%, both relatively stable to Q3.\nFiscal fourth quarter net revenue was up 12% year-over-year, better than expected, primarily due to value-added services revenue commercial and money movement solutions revenue and a benefit from FX. Fourth quarter net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars. EPS was up 10% year-over-year in both nominal and constant dollars, better than expected, primarily due to better-than-expected net revenue.\nLet's go into the details. Total international payments volume was up 10% year-over-year in constant dollars in Q4, generally consistent with Q3. Of note, we saw acceleration in Asia Pacific of approximately 2.5 points on a constant dollar basis, driven by timing effects and a modest improvement in Mainland China.\nU.S. payments volume was up 8%, slightly above Q3 with eCommerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. Credit and debit were both up 8%, reflecting resilience in consumer spending.\nWhen we look at quarterly spend category data in the U.S., we saw a broad-based strength, including improvements in retail services and goods, travel and fuel. Both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend were up from Q3. And growth across consumer spend bands remained relatively consistent with Q3 with the highest spend band continuing to grow the fastest.\nNow to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions.\nQ4 total cross-border volume was up 11% year-over-year relatively stable to last quarter, with eCommerce up 13%, and travel improving sequentially to 10%. eCommerce remains strong as it has for the last 8 quarters now, and still represented about 40% of our total cross-border volume. Travel spend continued to grow above pre-COVID levels. The slight step-up from Q3 was led by a combination of factors, including increased commercial volumes, helped by our efforts in virtual card and some improvement in CEMEA outbound due to holiday timing.\nWith that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results. Starting with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 10% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q3 constant dollars payments volume, primarily due to card benefits and pricing. Data processing revenue grew 17% versus the 10% growth in process transactions, primarily due to pricing and higher cross-border transaction mix.\nInternational transaction revenue was up 10%, below the 11% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume growth, excluding intra-Europe, primarily due to mix, partially offset by exchange rates.\nOther revenue grew 21%, primarily driven by growth in advisory and other value-added services and pricing. Client incentives grew 17% in line with our expectations as we lapped onetime adjustments from Q4 of fiscal '24.\nNow to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume cross-border volume and process transaction growth. Commercial and money movement solutions revenue grew 14% year-over-year in constant dollars as we lap the onetime adjustment we saw in Q4 FY '24. CMS revenue was better than expected, driven primarily by our Commercial Solutions business.\nCommercial payments volume grew 10% in constant dollars, 3 points above Q3 growth and faster than Visa's overall payments volume growth primarily due to new portfolio wins and the lapping of certain portfolio losses with strong client performance, especially in cross-border.\nVisa Direct transactions grew 23% to 3.4 billion transactions with strength in both domestic and cross-border. Value-added services revenue grew 25% in constant dollars to $3 billion, driven by issuing solutions, advisory and other services and pricing. Value-added services revenue growth was better than expected, primarily due to issuing solutions, both in network products and card benefits.\nOperating expenses grew 13%, and above our expectations due to a larger-than-expected FX impact and higher-than-expected personnel expenses as a result of deferred compensation mark-to-market, which as a reminder, is EPS neutral. Excluding those two factors, adjusted operating expense growth would have been as expected.\nNon-operating income was $29 million higher than expected due to investment income from the deferred compensation mark-to-market benefit that offsets the expense I just mentioned and higher returns on our investments.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, in line with expectations. EPS was $2.98, up 10% year-over-year with minimal impacts from exchange rates and acquisitions. In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. We also funded the litigation escrow account by $500 million, which has the same effect on EPS as a stock buyback.\nAt the end of September, we had $24.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. With a strong finish to the fiscal year, our full year net revenue grew 11% to $40 billion, and EPS grew 14% to $11.47. Full year 2025 CMS revenue growth was 15%, and value-added services revenue growth was 23% on a constant dollar basis. In a year marked by a significant step-up in uncertainty around the globe, we delivered strong results above our expectations. As we think about 2026, our guidance philosophy holds. We give you our best perspective based on current information.\nSo let's get into the guidance details and a quick note when I reference 2025 and 2026, I am referring to our fiscal years.\nFirst, let's cover our underlying assumptions for net revenue growth. As we regularly say, we are not economic forecasters. So we're assuming the macroeconomic environment stays generally where it is today and consumer spending remains resilient. On key business drivers, we are assuming no material change from the Q4 2025 growth levels in 2026. On pricing for 2026, we expect the benefits of new pricing to be similar in magnitude and timing as in 2025, with the majority going into effect in the back half. When you combine that with the 2025 pricing timing, this implies a relatively uniform contribution each quarter with Q1 seeing the largest contribution.\nOn incentives, we expect around 20% of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals this year, which implies incentive growth generally similar to 2025, with Q3 having the toughest comparable to 2025. On volatility, we expect volatility throughout the year to be generally consistent to where we exited Q4, which implies a drag for the first 3 quarters, with Q3 having the toughest comparable to 2025.\nWe pull these assumptions together on an adjusted basis, defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail.\nIn 2026, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. On a nominal basis, we expect an approximately 0.5 benefit from FX, which implies nominal net revenue growth that is generally consistent with fiscal 2025, which was 11%.\nWe have an exciting year with the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Q2 and the FIFA World Cup in Q3 and Q4. I'll speak to expense in a moment, but as far as net revenue impacts, we expect the benefit from value-added services to be spread throughout the year as our clients will utilize our solutions in the buildup to and during the events.\nIn terms of quarterly variability of net revenue, two items I would call out. First, we expect Q1 to have the highest year-over-year net revenue growth rate, primarily due to the timing impact of our FY '25 pricing actions. Second, we expect Q3 to have the lowest year-over-year net revenue growth rate, primarily due to the lapping impacts of strong volatility and lower-than-expected incentives in Q3 of 2025.\nNow moving to expenses. We expect to continue our significant investments in our Visa as a Service stack across consumer payments, commercial and money movement solutions and value-added services in FY '26. Let me share a few examples.\nWithin consumer payments, we will enhance our cross-border and affluent offerings, scale recently launched products and expand our stablecoin capabilities, in addition to utilizing our marketing dollars for both the Olympics and FIFA to amplify the Visa brand. Within CMS, we'll focus our investments in specific commercial vertical opportunities and build out new Visa Direct product capabilities focused on cross-border money movement. And within VAS, we'll invest in our product development as well as our sales engineering teams to deepen customer engagement and shortened deal cycles.\nIn addition, we're also investing in our AI efforts, in fact, every leader at the company has AI targets to drive efficiencies that we intend to invest back in the business to further our differentiation, competitive advantage and drive long-term growth.\nWe currently expect to grow adjusted operating expense in the low double digits, consistent with our net revenue growth. As we think about the cadence of spend, we expect Q2 and Q3 to have the largest year-over-year growth rates as a result of marketing expense related to the Olympics and FIFA.\nNow moving to non-operating income. The nonoperating income we've had for the past 3 years has been a function of cash balances, interest rates and onetime items. In 2026, based on current interest rate forward curves, we now expect nonoperating expense of $125 million to $175 million.\nNow to our non-GAAP tax rate. You may recall that we've historically estimated our long-term tax rate to be between 19% and 20%, and this remains unchanged. In both fiscal 2024 and 2025, our actual tax rate was below 18%, helped primarily by our geographic mix of earnings and certain onetime benefits, such as the resolution of tax matters and positions taken on certain taxes. In 2026, we still expect to be below our long-term tax rate. When we incorporate our current tax planning strategies, we expect the tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%, up from 2024 and 2025, primarily due to the absence of onetime benefits.\nOn capital return, the Board has declared an increase to our quarterly dividend by 14%, and we intend to return excess free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. All of this results in our adjusted EPS growth to be in the low double digits.\nMoving to Q1. Through October 21, with volume growth in constant dollars, U.S. payments volume was up 7%, with credit and debit both up 7%. Process transactions grew 9% year-over-year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, total volume grew 12% year-over-year, with eCommerce up 14% and travel up 11%.\nNow on to our financial expectations. We expect Q1 adjusted net revenue growth in the high end of low double digits. We expect adjusted operating expense growth in the low double digits. Non-operating expense is expected to be about $15 million. And our tax rate in the first quarter is expected to be around 18%. As a result, we expect adjusted first quarter EPS growth to be in the low teens. When we look on a nominal basis for net revenue growth in Q1 we expect an approximately 0.5 point benefit from FX. And for our expense growth, we expect an approximately 0.5 point drag from FX and a 1 point impact from acquisitions, which taken together result in nominal net revenue and expense growth that are more matched at the high end of low double digits.\nAs always, if the environment changes, and there are events that impact our business, we will remain flexible and thoughtful on balancing short- and long-term considerations.\nVisa's underlying business continues to be healthy and the growth opportunities are significant, together giving us conviction as we make investment decisions to build the future payments to drive compelling net revenue and earnings per share growth.\nAnd now, Jennifer, I'll hand it back to you.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.",

McInerney\n\nPresident, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Jennifer. This quarter, our financial performance once again demonstrated the power of Visa's diverse business model, global scale, commitment to innovation and relentless focus on our clients. We delivered net revenue of $10.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year and EPS up 23% year-over-year. Our key business drivers were strong. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year. U.S. payment volume grew 7% and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 11% in constant dollars and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year.\nWe are obsessed about serving our clients and wake up every morning thinking about what we can do to help them be successful today and in the future. We recently completed our annual global client engagement survey where Visa again received a net promoter score of 76, a tangible sign of how our clients feel about Visa and our capabilities, services and products. And as I'm sure you all saw, we hosted our Product Drop on April 30. We shared how we are continuing to evolve the Visa-as-a-service stack to advance our product developments and lead in a number of areas including AI and stablecoins across consumer payments, commercial and money movement solutions and value-added services.\nNow let's look at some of the specific innovations and progress across our growth pillars this quarter. In consumer payments, we continued to grow through a focus on solutions to address both carded and non-carded volumes across the globe. Total credentials were up 7% year-over-year, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of at least 7% growth. We are nearing 15 billion tokens and now more than 50% of our e-commerce transactions are tokenized globally, getting closer to our ultimate goal of reaching 100% penetration.\nAs we continue to transform Visa cards for a more digital future, our Flex Credential is an important solution. We have seen interest across various use cases such as buy now pay later, small business, multicurrency and more. This quarter, we announced that Klarna will be launching a Klarna Card powered by our Flex Credential in both the U.S. and Europe. We also expanded Flex Credential geographically with inaugural clients in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Bangladesh, and we have a pipeline of more than 200 client opportunities.\nAnother way that we are advancing a more digital future is with Visa Intelligent Commerce, which enables consumers to shop and buy with AI agents. It combines a suite of integrated APIs, including AI-ready cards with tokenization and authentication together with a commercial partner program for AI platforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa's AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale. We are excited to announce that we have more than 30 partners testing in our live sandbox, and we will soon enter the live transaction pilot phase with general availability to follow later this year as we see agentic commerce becoming a reality.\nIn the face-to-face environment, we continue to drive cash digitization and habituation through our Tap to Everything use cases. Tap to Pay penetration is now at 78% of face-to-face transactions globally. As a result of our efforts to increase issuance and acceptance, especially transit which drives habituation, we now have 75 U.S. cities at 60% penetration or higher, up from 30 cities just last year. And New York City and San Francisco have now surpassed 85% and 80%, respectively. Tap to Phone added a record 3 million transacting devices this quarter, and Tap to Add Card continues to expand with more than 275 issuers participating globally, almost doubling from last quarter.\nFor affluent consumers, we are excited to launch Visa Infinite Privilege in Brazil, a new super premium offering with personalized exclusive experiences enabled by dedicated lifestyle managers for each affluent user. Itau, Unicred, and XP International are our inaugural issuer partners. In Canada, our Visa Infinite affluent offerings for fintech, Wealthsimple has been their most requested product with tens of thousands of cards issued in just 2 months and hundreds of thousands on the wait list.\nThroughout all these innovations, we have continued to deepen our relationships with our clients across the globe. We renewed our partnership with ABSA, a leading pan-African bank in consumer and commercial issuance consulting and CyberSource across 9 countries. And in India, we renewed our consumer credit agreements with HDFC and Axis Bank this quarter, 2 of the country's top 5 credit card issuers. Our consumer payment strategy is also focused on non-carded solutions like Visa A2A in the U.K. With this offering, we bring together Visa's brand, consumer protections, technology and risk management capabilities to enable simpler, safer and more secure account-to-account payments.\nWe released APIs on the Visa Developer Platform a few months ago, and we now have several partners on board and even more in our pipeline with a formal launch soon. Also in the A2A space, we're making a very deliberate effort to focus on open banking in the markets that have the greatest potential such as Europe and Latin America. As an example, in Brazil, we have developed Visa Conecta, a payment initiator that connects with Pix to facilitate open banking payments through Tink technology, both in the face-to-face environment but more specifically in e-commerce where conversion is a challenge due to the current customer experience.\nNow moving to commercial and money movement solutions, or CMS, where we continue to pursue new use cases and verticals, domestic and cross-border flows and develop unique products. This quarter, commercial payments volume was up 7% in constant dollars, Visa Direct transactions grew 25% and CMS revenue rose 13% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Visa Commercial Solutions, one of our key strategies is addressing the day-to-day challenges of small and large businesses through our vertical-specific solutions.\nIn the health care and benefits vertical, we are very active, including providing solutions for employee benefits to more than half of the top HSA providers in the U.S. A recent example of our activity in the benefit space is with Sunny, a health care fintech that will issue Visa prepaid disbursement cards to their millions of U.S. consumers to spend integrated health benefits and rewards. In the travel vertical, Checkout.com will begin using Visa virtual cards for online travel agencies or OTAs in the U.K. and Europe.\nIn addition, Pliant, already an important issuing partner across numerous verticals in Europe, will be expanding into the U.S., bringing their virtual card-as-a-service offerings with spend management capabilities to OTAs, travel management companies and others in the travel vertical. And in the fleet and fuel vertical, we continue to make progress with our Fleet 2.0 solution, providing key Visa enhancements such as EMV chips, digital wallet provisioning and contactless payments. In Europe, Octopus Energy is one of the region's largest energy suppliers, and they selected Visa as their partner as they start issuing cards to fleet managers seeking a single payment solution to manage mobility expenses.\nIn Visa Direct, we have made some important progress in facilitating cross-border flows to further our positioning as the largest money movement platform by transactions, volumes and endpoints. One of the biggest banks in the UAE with over 60 branches serving over 1 million customers, ADIB, will use Visa Direct to power remit their newly launched remittances program by offering access to cards, accounts and wallets across all corridors.\nIn Bangladesh, we have signed our first 4 partners to enable Visa Direct, Magna Bank, Postbank, Midland Bank, and Brock Bank, specifically for outbound cross-border payments. And in the U.S. and Canada, Paysend, who we have discussed before is an important Visa Direct remittance client with 10 million customers, is now expanding to add more cross-border use cases such as gig economy worker payouts, payroll disbursements and accounts payable flows as a reseller to third parties.\nBefore I go to value-added services, I think it is important to touch on a topic that has had a lot of interest lately, stablecoins. We are supportive of the GENIUS Act, and we believe that it marks a key milestone on the path to regulatory clarity for stablecoins. We have been active in this space for almost a decade and believe that stablecoins can solve important payments problems for certain use cases. We believe that Visa's role is to do what we always do, provide trust, standards, connectivity, billions of endpoints, scale and interoperability to the payments ecosystem.\nBeyond capital markets use cases, we see product market fit for stablecoins in 2 important areas: one, in emerging markets where the local fiat currency is volatile and/or where consumers do not have easy or affordable access to U.S. dollars; and two, in cross-border money movement, both B2B payments and consumer Our in-market solutions, partnerships, market activity and product road map reflect our commitment to this space. For example, we have deployed stablecoin-linked cards in many markets around the world with partners such as Bridge, Rain and banks.\nIn the emerging market use case I mentioned earlier, consumers and businesses are using stablecoins to save money in U.S. dollars. But they also want easy and safe ways to spend that money, and there's no better way to do that than using a Visa card. Stablecoin-linked Visa cards are an extension of what we have been doing in the crypto space for years. Since 2020, we have enabled crypto users to spend more than $25 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum and an array of other cryptocurrencies, and now stablecoins. We are also enabling cross-border money movement capabilities for P2P and B2B in certain emerging markets. And we are piloting and partnering with stablecoin payments companies who specialize in these markets as we build out our stablecoin treasury stack for settlement and money movement flows.\nA recent example is with Yellow Card in Sub-Saharan Africa. Together, we are working to streamline treasury operations, improve liquidity management, and enable quick and more cost-efficient cross-border transactions. Additionally, we are also helping banks issue their own stablecoins and realize the benefits of programmable money through our Visa Tokenized Asset Platform. And we offer multichain and multi-coin, stablecoin settlement on the Visa network. We recently expanded our capabilities by adding a euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, and through a partnership with Paxos, 2 additional regulated stablecoins, USDG and PYUSD.\nWe are also adding support for 2 additional blockchains, Stellar and Avalanche, enabling us to support 4 stablecoins running on 4 unique blockchains, representing 2 currencies that we can then accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currency across the world for our clients within our settlement infrastructure. There is so much more to come in this space, and we are excited about enabling commercial and money movement flows globally across networks, currencies and form factors.\nNow to value-added services, which had one of our strongest revenue growth quarters, up 26% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me walk through some of the highlights in our 4 portfolios. In Issuing Solutions, Pismo continues to expand, benefiting from Visa's deep client relationships and trusted partner status. We have now entered Europe with ABN Amro's neobank, Boot in the Netherlands and have also partnered with Lunar, who serves over 1 million consumers and business users for the first Pismo-powered Visa card across Denmark, Sweden and Norway.\nThis quarter, we signed with EML Payments in Australia to deploy Pismo for their global issuance strategy, enabling them to consolidate their multiple processing platforms to 1 across Australia, North America, the U.K., and Europe. In Acceptance Solutions, we continue to grow through both direct relationships with merchants as well as with acquirers. I'll give 2 examples of each. First, direct with merchants. We renewed our agreement with ShopeePay, a leading digital payments platform serving tens of millions of users and expanded geographically from Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam, to include the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, and also expanded with additional products such as tokenization.\nCareem Pay, part of super app Careem that serves over 50 million customers across Middle East and North Africa, will utilize several value-added services, including CyberSource and account verification. On the acquiring side, in Saudi Arabia, Arab National Bank has selected Visa as their new partner for our CyberSource and risk solutions to offer to their merchant clients. We also signed with the largest acquirer in Central America to provide CyberSource and tokenization to their merchant clients.\nIn Risk and Security Solutions, our feature-based capabilities continue to resonate with our clients. This quarter, TSYS, an existing and important partner of Featurespace, will begin transitioning their tens of billions of transactions to our next-gen SaaS platform so they can benefit from continued innovation in our advanced AI scoring models in a scale away.\nMoving on to advisory and other services, where our payments, consulting and marketing experience, data and analytics capabilities and sponsorships help us to deepen our relationships with our clients. For example, AEON Financial Service, one of our largest clients in Japan, renewed their credit relationship and will add consulting, managed services and marketing services to help them grow. I'll call out 2 other examples of our consulting and marketing services at work.\nIn Brazil, our consulting and technical teams are working with Caixa to help develop a super app for their over 40 million customers, enhancing digital engagement and loyalty. In the U.S., fintech Shine utilized our marketing services capabilities to support their brand campaign during the NBA playoffs this past quarter. With each of these 4 portfolios growing at strong levels, value-added services remains a powerful engine of revenue growth for our business.\nIn conclusion, our third quarter results were strong. In Q3 and through July 1, even with the continued uncertainty, consumer spending remains resilient. Within the U.S., while spending growth differed among consumer spend bands, all spend bands in Q3 remained resilient and consistent with past quarters. Within spend categories in the U.S., we saw relative stability to Q2 when adjusted for leap year impacts. Both U.S. discretionary and nondiscretionary spend growth remains strong, and we see no meaningful impact from tariffs.\nFor cross-border, total volume growth, excluding intra-Europe remained strong and above pre-COVID levels, even with continued impacts from currency weakness and travel to specific countries. While we're not immune to macroeconomic impacts, our business has proven to be diverse, resilient and well positioned to capture the significant opportunities ahead. We all know that as commerce evolves, so do buyer and seller preferences. We have proven our ability to anticipate these changes and deploy solutions that enable our expanding network of partners to meet and exceed the needs of their users.\nVisa has become a hyperscaler that enables anyone around the world to access the breadth, scale and resiliency of our network across more than 200 countries and territories, 150 currencies and nearly 5 billion credentials. Anybody that wants to be in the money movement business or the payments business can build on top of the Visa stack. And as we connect billions of buyers and sellers through seamless secure digital payments, we're very excited about how that will help us enable innovative commerce as we drive Visa's growth forward well into the future. Now I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Suh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Visa reached a record $10.2 billion in quarterly net revenue in our third quarter, up 14% year-over-year, better than expected driven by lower incentives, a lower FX headwind and higher value-added services revenue. Net revenue was also up 14% year-over-year in constant dollars. Underlying business drivers remain strong. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year, and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 11% year-over-year. Total processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. EPS was up 23% year-over-year in nominal and constant dollars, better than expected, primarily due to the strength in net revenue growth.\nLet's go into the details. Total international payments volume was up 10% year-over-year in constant dollars in Q3, relatively consistent with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. U.S. payments volume was up 7%, with e-commerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. Credit was up 6% and debit was up 7%. When we look at U.S. payments volume year-over-year growth on a monthly basis, April was stronger than March, primarily due to Easter timing and some portfolio loss lapping that continued throughout the quarter, May was relatively in line with April, and June was softer primarily due to the impact of both days mix and bill pay timing. Putting it all together, total Q3 U.S. payments volume growth was generally consistent with Q2, adjusted for leap year.\nNow to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. You may recall that we expected Q3 total cross-border volume growth to moderate from Q2 and be slightly below Q4 of FY '24, primarily due to the impacts of weaker currencies in certain countries and the Canada to U.S. travel corridor. In Q3, those impacts generally played out as we expected, with total cross-border volume year-over-year growth at 11%, e-commerce up 13% and travel up 9%, even with some monthly variability.\nApril benefited from Easter and Ramadan timing, and May moderated from April without this timing benefit. In June, we saw the growth step down from May, primarily due to further weakening of the U.S. dollar and a few smaller factors that largely reversed in July. As Ryan said, Visa's Q3 total cross-border volume growth was strong and remained above the pre-COVID trend.\nWith that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results, starting with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 9% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, helped by pricing and card benefits that more than offset the exchange rate drag. Data processing revenue grew 15% versus 10% in processed transaction growth primarily due to pricing. International transaction revenue was up 14%, above the 11% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, helped by elevated currency volatility and exchange rates, partially offset by hedging and mix. Other revenue grew 32%, primarily driven by advisory and other value-added services and pricing.\nClient incentives grew 13%, lower than expected, primarily due to 2 factors: first, deal timing as we saw some expected deals shift out of Q3; second, we expanded several client relationships, which led to updated incentive terms and onetime reductions in the associated accruals.\nNow to our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction growth. Commercial and money movement solutions revenue grew 13% year-over-year in constant dollars. Commercial payments volume grew 7% year-over-year in constant dollars, accelerating slightly from Q2 adjusted for leap year, primarily due to the lapping of certain portfolio losses.\nVisa Direct transactions grew 25% year-over-year to 3.3 billion transactions with strength in both domestic and cross-border P2P. Value-added services revenue was $2.8 billion with growth accelerating to 26% year-over-year in constant dollars. This was driven by strength across all portfolios and pricing. Operating expenses grew 13%, higher than expected, primarily due to a lower-than-expected FX benefit and higher-than-expected personnel expenses. Nonoperating income was $191 million, helped by investment income from higher cash balances.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, in line with expectations. EPS was $2.98, up 23% over last year with minimal impacts from both exchange rates and acquisitions. During the quarter, we issued EUR 3.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes with maturities ranging between 3 and 19 years and interest rates from 2.25% to 3.875%. In addition, we bought back approximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $29.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.\nNow let's move to what we've seen so far in Q4. Through July 21, U.S. payment volume was up 9% with debit up 10% and credit up 9% year-over-year. Even when adjusting for lapping the weather and technology outages impacts from last July, we saw strong growth, primarily due to the timing of July 4, the days mix impact I mentioned for June now helping July, and the timing of promotional shopping events. Processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year.\nFor constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, total volume grew more than 10% year-over-year with e-commerce up 13% and travel up 9%. July cross-border volume growth accelerated more than 1 point from June as we saw improvement in both e-commerce and travel, primarily due to strong retail spend in e-commerce, the dollar strengthening versus certain currencies and the reversal of a few smaller factors that impacted June.\nNow on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For Q4, when we take the latest trends for business drivers and volatility as well as our current view of deal timing, our adjusted net revenue expectations are unchanged in the high single digits to low double digits. On a nominal basis, this puts Q4 net revenue growth generally in line with first half of FY '25 nominal net revenue growth, which was about 10%.\nMoving to adjusted operating expenses, which we expect to grow in the high single digits to low double digits. Nonoperating income in the fourth quarter is expected to be minimal, and our tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be between 18.5% and 19%. As a result, we expect adjusted fourth quarter EPS growth to be in the high single digits. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal benefit to net revenue growth and approximately 1.5 point contribution to operating expense growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to EPS growth in the fourth quarter.\nPulling it all together, for the full year, we have no changes to our full year adjusted guidance except for nonoperating income, which we expect to be about $250 million as a result of the third quarter. However, it is important to note that when you incorporate our performance year-to-date with our Q4 guidance, even though the full year guidance ranges are unchanged, we now expect our net revenue growth and EPS growth to be stronger than previously anticipated. It's also a good reminder of the strength of Visa's diverse business model, where in the face of changing conditions throughout the year, we still expect to deliver strong growth and leading profitability.\nAs we look ahead and plan for 2026, while we're contemplating a variety of economic scenarios, the strength and diversity of our business model that I just mentioned, the resilience of the consumer and our clear and effective strategy, together give us the confidence as we make investment decisions to build the future of payments and drive long-term growth. And now, Jennifer, time for some Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.",

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Q2 2025 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website, and the Investor Relations section of our website. Our comments today regarding our financial results will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all of the results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted. The related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. With that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThanks, Jennifer. Visa is one of the world's best businesses, with strong growth and leading profitability powered by a world-class brand, innovative technology, and unparalleled network and global scale. This quarter, we saw the strength of our business model, with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 9% year-over-year, and EPS up 10%. Our key business drivers were strong, even with the lapping of leap day from last year, and consumer spending remained resilient in an uncertain and dynamic environment. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year. US payments volume grew 6%, and international payments volume grew 9%.\nCross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 13% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Our strategy across Consumer Payments, Commercial and Money Movement Solutions, and Value-Added Services continues to resonate with our clients, and we remain focused on serving our clients through our innovation and product development. I will start with quarterly highlights and then make a few comments on the current environment. In Consumer Payments, we continue to execute the fundamentals, expanding credentials and acceptance, and driving user engagement in order to grow both carded and non-carded volumes. Total credentials grew 7%, with generally consistent growth across our regions. We added 1 billion tokens since last quarter to total 13.7 billion, and now nearly 50% of our e-commerce transactions globally are tokenized.\nWe also crossed 1 billion tokens in Latin America and half a billion in CEMEA. We continue to make progress displacing cash in key markets. For example, India, Mexico, and Brazil each added more than 1 million merchant locations in the last year, as we have driven greater acceptance, including with smaller merchants. We recently signed an agreement with Efecty, one of the biggest cash networks in Colombia, with over 30 million users. Efecty will launch 4.5 million consumer debit cards and build acceptance with their cash agents. We also convert closed loop to open loop opportunities.\nFor example, I'll highlight two transit deals in Latin America, one in Argentina with Banco de la Nación, to launch an open-loop SUBE Visa card for use on public transportation, and two in Chile with MetroPago to also launch an open-loop Visa card and add acceptance locations at transit stops. As we mentioned at Investor Day, what gives us confidence in our ability to grow Consumer Payments are our products and our solutions. They are enabling us to succeed in important high-value Consumer Payments use cases, innovations such as Tap to Everything, tokens, multi-currency cards, Flex Credentials, Account-to-Account solutions, and our differentiated cardholder benefits platforms. I'll note some progress this quarter. Our efforts in Tap to Everything continued, driving cash digitization and habituation. Tap To Phone added nearly 2 million transacting device terminals since last quarter, with growth primarily driven by Latin America, the US, and Europe.\nTap to Pay penetration is now at 76% globally, with the US passing 60% for the first time. Penetration at US drugstores, retailers, and quick-service restaurants is now above 60% as well. Tap to Add Card continued to gain traction, and with the majority of fraud being eliminated as compared to manual entry, it's not surprising that we now have nearly 150 issuers participating globally in more than 35 countries and territories. Tap to P2P is a Visa product that leverages tokenization for enhanced security, Visa's Tap Kernel and SDK technology for seamless contactless data transmission between devices, and the convenience of Visa Direct's real-time money movement for funds transfers. We are soon launching our Tap to P2P products in the US with Samsung. Samsung Wallet will introduce this innovative P2P payments feature that will allow users to quickly send money to friends or family by just tapping a phone to a debit card or another phone, a strategy focused on enabling cross-platform functionality across mobile wallets.\nAnother development is in our stablecoin offerings. We believe two important capabilities are interoperability and programmability. We have continued to expand our interoperability, including with our first seven-day-a-week stablecoin settlement, recently surpassing $200 million in cumulative stablecoin settlement volume. On programmability, we also developed the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform to help enable banks to issue and leverage stablecoins for new types of programmable finance. Our first pilot partner, BBVA, plans to launch a stablecoin later this year on the Ethereum blockchain. In our focus to attract and retain the affluent and cross-border traveler, we continue to evolve our Infinite product and are excited about the launch of the Scotiabank Passport Visa Infinite Privilege Card, offering elite travel benefits for Canadians.\nThe card provides travel rewards, insurance, and exclusive perks. Moving to Commercial and Money Movement Solutions. As we drive further penetration of these opportunities, we have seen strong results in Q2, with commercial volume up 6% in constant dollars, Visa Direct transactions up 28%, and CMS revenue up 13% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Visa Commercial Solutions this quarter, we made progress on our strategy as we deepened our relationships with a number of existing clients. To capture the accounts receivable and accounts payable opportunity, we are utilizing product innovations such as embedded finance solutions to meet payers where they manage their business to drive adoption of cards. We are pleased that Lloyds has signed a deal with Taulia to issue and embed Visa Virtual Cards in the SAP ERP and Procure-To-Pay workflows of their customers. Our vertical-specific strategies serve the needs of small, middle-market, and large businesses.\nIn that light, we are supporting Itaú in their card-as-a-service platform, which offers credit and debit card issuance, product lifecycle management, and digital accounts to businesses across agribusiness, real estate, auto, and retailers. In the B2B travel vertical, we continue to see strong demand for innovative payment solutions to transact in multiple currencies while enhancing payment security, reconciliation, and operational efficiency. We expanded our agreement with LianLian Global to launch a B2B travel solution in Hong Kong. LianLian Global will also be utilizing Visa Direct's multi-currency capabilities to support end-to-end collections and payouts. Continuing with Visa Direct, this quarter, we signed an important deal with Jack Henry to offer Visa Direct through their digital applications to facilitate rapid transfers among bank accounts and enable their community and regional financial institution clients to offer Visa Direct to their consumer account holders and SMBs. In the cross-border space, Checkout.com is the first acquirer in the UAE to launch Visa Direct's push-to-card solution, enhancing real-time money transfer capabilities for both cross-border and domestic transactions.\nIn the US, we expanded our agreement with TabaPay, a money movement platform serving more than 6,500 fintechs and enterprises. Visa Direct will now be enabling push-to-account and wallet in addition to Push-to-Card. These are all examples of our strategic focus to grow our domestic and cross-border business and expand with our existing customers for Visa Direct, the largest money movement platform in the world by transactions, volumes, and endpoints. In Value-Added Services, we continued to deepen our relationships with our existing customers and also focused on attracting new customers with some of our recently acquired assets. Value-Added Services revenue grew 22% in constant dollars, powered by strong growth across all portfolios. I'll share a few areas of success in the execution of our strategy.\nIn issuing solutions, Pismo brings a holistic offering with credit, debit, prepaid, and commercial issuer processing, and core bank processing. We have a strong pipeline, and we are well on our way to enter five new countries across four regions this year. Some recent deals to note include, first, in Latin America with Nequi in Colombia, Banco de la Nación in Argentina, and in Asia-Pacific with T2P in Thailand and Zenith Forex in India. Also in issuing solutions, we continue to grow our card benefits business. In Europe, Raiffeisen Bank International in Austria recently launched the \"Travelcentive\" travel platform, leveraging our solutions as well as added Visa's Priority Pass benefits to customers. In Acceptance Solutions, we recently announced two new product offerings.\nThe first is a completely new version of Authorize.net, launching in the US next quarter and additional countries next year. It features a streamlined user interface, AI capabilities with an AI agent, ANet, improved dashboards for day-to-day management, and support for in-person card readers and Tap-to-Phone. It will help businesses analyze data, summarize insights, and adapt to rapidly changing customer trends. The second is the new Unified Checkout experience, available in the US and in pilot stage in additional markets in Q4. As new ways to pay continue to emerge, merchants want to integrate once to accept all payment types to decrease the likelihood of lost sales at the point of checkout. Unified Checkout can be launched in a few hours with a deploy-ready payment acceptance code.\nIt is designed to deliver strong e-commerce conversion rates with an intuitive checkout experience, orchestrating over 25 card and alternative payment options. Because Unified Checkout is part of the Visa Acceptance Solutions platform, customers also have access to fraud management, 3D Secure authentication, and tokenization management. We also continue to grow our client relationships in Acceptance Solutions this quarter. For example, we have now become the payment service provider of choice for sporting goods retailer Decathlon, who has more than 2,000 stores in nearly 80 countries. Decathlon will be using our gateway and decision manager capabilities for their e-commerce business. In Risk and Identity Solutions, since the closing of our acquisition of Featurespace, we have been actively pursuing deals and have signed over 20 clients globally.\nWe also now provide an enhanced holistic fraud protection solution from Featurespace called the Adaptive Real-Time Individual Change Identification, or ARIC Risk Hub. This solution utilizes machine learning and AI solutions to enable clients to build more accurate risk profiles and more confidently detect and block fraudulent transactions, ultimately helping to increase approvals and stop bad actors in real time. In advisory and other services, our Open Banking platform powered by Tink provides payment initiation and account information services to sellers and payment providers, or PSPs, across Europe and the United States. In Germany, Tink and Adyen are working with Recharge and Vodafone to provide their customers the option to pay by bank when checking out. Tink has reached a milestone of over 10,000 merchants choosing Tink's pay-by-bank capability via our more than 10 European PSP partnerships. Across our VAS portfolio, our innovations are designed to address specific challenges in the payments ecosystem and to provide secure, efficient, and scalable solutions for businesses of all sizes. At Investor Day, I spoke about the evolution of our Visa as a service stack.\nThe foundation of our stack is our global connectivity and the infrastructure that Visa is built on, our network, our network of networks, and access to our credentials and acceptance. Then we have our services architecture, which contains the specific capabilities that we think of as the building blocks for everything that we do, like risk, settlement, and more. Using these services, we create client solutions. We are taking these componentized capabilities and investing in and enhancing them to create new features and capabilities to offer them to a much broader array of customers and partners. And we strive to make it easier than ever for our partners and clients to access these solutions. I encourage all of you to tune in tomorrow to Visa's 2025 product drop, where we will share how we continue to evolve the Visa as a service stack to further our product development and lead in AI.\nYou can watch live on our website at 10:00AM Pacific time. Before I hand over to Chris, I'll share some thoughts on our business performance and the current environment. Throughout our history, we have evolved our network and strategy to deliver the best innovation, serve our clients, and pioneer the future of payments. We saw the result of these efforts this quarter with our strong financial performance. Halfway through our fiscal year, consumer spending has been resilient and strong, but there's much uncertainty. Focusing on the US, in Q2 and through 21 April, we have not seen any signs of overall consumer spending weakening.\nWhile spending growth differs among consumer spend bands, with the most affluent growing the fastest, all spend bands remain resilient and consistent with past quarters. Within spend categories, there are some select areas, such as in travel with airlines and lodging, where growth has decelerated, but overall discretionary and non-discretionary spend remains strong. Outside the US, we see similar stable trends. Within cross-border, volume growth was in line with Q4 2024 levels. We have seen some impacts from currency weakness and travel to specific countries, but the overall growth was above the pre-COVID trend. To wrap up, while we are certainly not immune to the macroeconomic impacts, our incredibly diverse business model has proven to be resilient in the face of a variety of environments, most recently in Q2.\nWe see this resilience playing out in our financial outlook, which Chris will cover in a moment. For the rest of the year and beyond, what I, our leadership team, and our more than 31,600 employees are focused on is serving our clients and capturing the enormous opportunities ahead. We focus on what we can control and stand ready to make thoughtful adjustments when necessary. I am confident that our business model, strategy, and employees will continue to keep Visa operating from a position of strength well into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to review the financial results, discuss what we have seen so far in April, and provide our expectations for the rest of the year.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q2 results reflected strength in our business. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year, and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 13% year-over-year. Total processed transactions grew 9%. Adjusting for the lapping of leap year, our trends were generally stable. Fiscal Q2 net revenue was up 9% year over year in nominal dollars and 11% in constant dollars, helped by resilient consumer spending, lower-than-expected incentives, and better-than-expected value-added services revenue.\nEPS was up 10% year-over-year and 11% in constant dollars, better-than-expected, primarily due to stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate than expected. Let's go into the details. Total international payments volume was up 9% year-over-year in constant dollars in Q2, relatively consistent with Q1 when adjusted for leap year. US payments volume was up 6%, with e-commerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. Credit was up 5%, and debit was up 7%.When we look on a monthly basis in the US, we had a strong January, a dip in February, primarily due to the lapping of leap year, and a relatively strong March, even with the fact that Easter was in March last year and in April this year, which resulted in Q2 year-over-year growth being below Q1, but better than Q3 and Q4 of 2024.\nWhen looking further at quarterly spend category data in the US, adjusted for leap year, we saw travel and entertainment growth decelerate, restaurant growth remain stable, and retail and fuel growth improve, with strong and stable total discretionary and non-discretionary spend growth, reflecting resilience in consumer spending. Now to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Before going into the detailed results, I wanted to spend a moment to discuss the makeup of our Cross-Border business. From a geographic mix perspective, our total cross-border volume is fairly well distributed, with no reported region comprising more than 25% of total cross-border issued volume. Both e-commerce and travel issued volume reflect a broad distribution as well. You may also recall that our total cross-border issued volume mix is about 40% e-commerce and 60% travel, so there is diversity by region and by spend type.\nKeep in mind that just as our cross-border volumes are distributed, so are the associated revenues. Now on to the results. Total cross-border volume was up 13%. E-commerce was up 14%, and travel was up 12%. There were several factors that contributed to the growth moderation from Q1 to Q2, including the lapping of leap year, the timing of Ramadan and Easter, weaker currencies in certain countries, and softer Canada to US travel. Some of these factors impacted our intra-quarter trends, which varied slightly for US payment volume trends.\nWhile we saw a strong January and a February impacted by leap year, we did see a somewhat softer March. Even with these factors, as Ryan mentioned, the total cross-border volume growth was in line with Q4 2024 levels and above the pre-COVID trend. With that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results, which were strong. Starting with the revenue components, service revenue grew 9% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q1 constant dollar payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 10% versus 9% processed transaction growth, primarily due to value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenue was up 10%, below the 13% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, but in line with nominal volume growth, reflecting the impact of FX.\nIn addition, while we had higher volatility in Q2, this was offset by a number of factors, including client mix and hedging. Other revenue grew 24%, primarily driven by growth in advisory and other Value-Added Services, and to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 15%, lower than expected, primarily due to factors related to deal timing. Now to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border volume, and process transaction growth. Commercial and money movement solutions revenue grew 13% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by commercial payment volume growth of 6% year-over-year in constant dollars, consistent with last quarter, and Visa Direct transaction growth of 28% year-over-year to 3 billion transactions, below Q1 growth, primarily due to the lapping of our initial ramp in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps and the lapping of leap year.\nCMS revenue growth in Q2 moderated from the Q1, primarily due to lower cross-border volume growth and the absence of the lapping benefit of one-time items. Value-Added services revenue growth accelerated to 22% in constant dollars to $2.6 billion, with strength across all portfolios led by issuing solutions and advisory and other, and inclusive of Featurespace. Operating expenses grew 7%, primarily driven by increases in personnel, marketing, and depreciation and amortization. This was lower than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable FX impact from balance sheet remeasurement and some marketing campaigns, and advisory services-related expenses being shifted to Q3. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.9%, lower than expected due to several items, including a change in our geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $2.76, up 10% over last year, with an approximately 1.5-point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5-point drag from acquisitions.\nIn Q2, we bought back approximately $4.5 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of March, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In April, the Board of Directors authorized a new $30 billion multi-year share repurchase program. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in Q3. Through 21 April, driver trends have been strong, with some benefit from Easter and Ramadan timing. US payment volume was up 8%, with debit up 9% and credit up 7% year-over-year.\nProcessed transactions grew 12% year-over-year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, total, travel, and e-commerce cross-border volume each grew 13% year-over-year. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. As we said many times, we are not economic forecasters.\nThe potential impacts from tariffs have led to higher levels of economic uncertainty. That being said, what we've seen thus far in our results is relative resilience in consumer spending. So with that as a backdrop, let me cover some of our key assumptions that are incorporated. For cross-border volume, our assumption is that Q3 and Q4 volumes are in line with the average of March and April, which normalizes for Easter and Ramadan timing, as well as accounts for other factors I referenced when describing Q2 results. This puts Q3 and Q4 cross-border volume growth slightly below Q4 2024 levels. For volatility, we have seen high FX volatility thus far in April, but assume this will moderate starting in May and remain level for the remainder of Q3 and Q4.\nThis puts Q3 just above Q2 and Q4 more in line with Q2. For incentives, as a result of some client performance adjustments and deal timing, we are assuming that the year-over-year growth in incentives in the back half will be higher than the first half, with sequential step-ups in Q3 and Q4. Pulling it all together, we expect Q3 adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, essentially in line with Q2. Moving to operating expenses. As we had some timing impacts of expenses in the Q2, we now expect those to occur in the Q3, with adjusted operating expense growth in the low double digits, relatively consistent with adjusted revenue growth. Non-operating income in the Q3 is expected to be approximately $150 million, which includes a benefit from the reversal of accrued interest expense due to the resolution of a tax matter. Our tax rate in the Q3 is expected to be between 17% and 17.5%.\nAs a result, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS growth to be in the high teens. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal benefit to net revenue growth, an approximately one-point contribution to operating expense growth, and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth in the Q3. Moving now to the full year. Our full-year guidance for adjusted revenue growth, adjusted operating expense growth, non-operating income, tax rate, and adjusted EPS growth remains unchanged. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, and our business remains steady. As Ryan said, throughout our history, we've managed through different economic cycles, and we're confident we'll manage through this period as well.\nNow, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Chris. With that, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star and one and clearly record your name. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questions are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, to ask a question, please press star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, hey, thanks a lot. Good results here. It looks like the consumer is pretty resilient. So beyond volumes, I wanted to ask if you've seen any noticeable change in tone on client decision-making, pipelines, backlog. I'm definitely curious about international clients and maybe if they're changing the speed with which they're working with Visa. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHi, Tien-Tsin.The bulk of the time we've been spending with clients over the last several months has been sharing our data, sharing our products and solutions, working with our advisory teams, really helping them to navigate this environment. That's been the bulk of what we've been doing. I mean, this is the time when we try to be at our best with our clients. I talk to our teams every week to make sure they're out in the offices of our clients leaning in to work with them. That's been the bulk of how we've been spending time with our clients, helping them make sure they have all the data, information, tools, and solutions they need to run their business most effectively, which many of them run very, very complicated businesses.\nOver time, there could be conversations about partnership arrangements, deals, and those types of things, but that's not been the bulk of how we've been spending our time today.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much. Wanted to ask about what you're seeing around bookings around international travel and travel generally. You highlighted there's been a little bit of slowing growth there, maybe domestically, but overall, it's still remained good and maybe impacted by FX, etc. But we've seen a lot of FX moves. So just wondering how you're feeling about the travel outlook on a go-forward basis and anything you can glean from early bookings, etc. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHi, James. Yeah, we covered a number of moving parts in our travel and Cross-Border business as it impacted Q2 and gave some assumptions about what we anticipated going into the back half of the year. I think I'll make two points. One is, obviously, the situation is quite fluid, and we're monitoring the data very closely, and we're really relying on facts and facts and the results as we see them. But the second point maybe is even more important is that when we look across our business, we talk about the diversity of our business across many dimensions. Regional is one of them, but certainly when we look at our cross-border business, whether that's issued or acquired, we also benefit from that diversity.\nAnd when it comes to inbound travel into the US, the US specifically actually is one of the smaller regions as measured by cross-border inbound travel volume, even though it does have strong yields. So we just keep that in mind. We'll have to watch how the data comes in, but we have great diversification in our Cross-Border business, and we anticipate that we'll be able to navigate this period.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director an Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. Chris, just to follow up on your point just now on the corridors and the US one specifically. Obviously, we're hearing a lot of travel information and how things are falling off coming into the US, especially from Canada. Maybe you could just talk about what kind of assumptions you've made for the remainder of this year because I know that has an impact on sort of the economic return from each of those corridors. So maybe you could just help us with that. And then, just curious, inside of the volumes that you saw intra-quarter and even early in April, did you see any evidence of a pull forward of spending?\nThanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nGot it. Hi, Sanjay. Two-part question. Let me address actually the second one first because that's a quicker one. There was some evidence of pull forward in certain categories. Electronics is one of them.\nAnd it was mostly in sort of the first part of April, and we shared with you the data through 21 April. Actually, while I'm speaking about April, I just saw the data through the 28th just this morning, and that's relatively unchanged as well. So there's no meaningful differences even as we get further into April. From a pull forward standpoint, we may have seen a little bit in the first part of April, but by and large, not a meaningful impact to our total growth. Then going back to cross-border assumptions. I shared a number of them, and I went through in my prepared comments a number of the items that impacted the cross-border numbers in the month of March and as it pertained also to the month of April.\nRamadan and Easter were two that had timing differences that impacted March and April. Then I spoke to two other factors. One, a broader category around currency weaknesses. Currency weaknesses have an impact on purchasing power, obviously, abroad. We had the US dollar weakening, but we also had currency weaknesses in LAC, in Mexico, in different countries throughout Asia. And so that's also impacting the results that we saw in March and April.\nAnd then the last one, of course, is Canada. And I referenced it on the call. I mean, we did see a meaningful slowdown in the Canada to US border. But again, keep in mind the diversification of our business. And so the fact that, as I just mentioned in the last question, the fact that the US is one of the smaller regions as measured by cross-border travel inbound volumes. And so when you add that up, it's really not a very small percentage of our global travel volume, and the revenue impact shouldn't be meaningful.\nSo what we did in terms of assumptions is we took the average of March and April, which we think accounts for all of those items, and we extended that through the remainder of the fiscal year. And that would put cross-border at just below what we finished FY 2024 at in Q4.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Andrew Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, Ryan. Hey, Chris. Thanks for taking the questions this evening. Maybe we could dig into Value-Add Services. It's good to see the robust growth there. Maybe you could just unpack that and just talk about your viewpoint and how that performs through the cycle.\nObviously, there's a range of revenue models in their transaction-based, project-based, and recurring/subscription. But if you could unpack that, it'd be great. And then any detail on how you're thinking about value-add services growth in the back half would also be helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Why don't I just talk a little bit about the business? And then, Chris, I'll let you talk about some of the financial aspects of the question, both in terms of what drove the strong performance in the quarter and also where things are headed. Yeah, we feel really good about the strategy, our execution, our products. I highlighted some really exciting new products in my prepared remarks. And I was just going to go back to some of the things we shared with you at Investor Day about our execution approach.\nYou asked a little bit about some of the business drivers of what happens there. We've said about 65% of our revenue is really about enhancing Visa payments. But we've been really making a lot of progress on the incremental opportunities to enable all different types of payments, not just Visa payments, and the services that then go beyond payments. If I kind of go back to an example in my prepared remarks, I talked about the Authorize.net platform that we've relaunched and we're relaunching. That's a great example of enabling all different types of payments. That's going to be, we think, a really positive impact in the market, specifically focused on growing our share in small business checkout.\nYou go back to what I mentioned in terms of our Unified Checkout experience that will impact all different sizes of sellers on our platforms. Those are two examples, obviously, in the acceptance business. But you go back to our issuing solutions business; we're having great progress with Pismo and a lot of our other solutions there as well. Our Risk and Security Solutions business, really excited about the progress in market we've made since we acquired Featurespace. And then in our advisory and other business, we've been having some really strong success as well. So thanks for that question.\nChris, you want to hit a couple of the financial parts of it?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nSure. I'll just add on top of that. I think, Andrew, I think the heart of your question is how, in addition, obviously, Ryan covered all the sort of the highlights of the business performance. I won't reiterate those. But I think part of your question was what could potentially happen to VAS in different sorts of cycles. The way that I would think about it, the way we think about it, is obviously a lot could happen.\nWe're monitoring sort of the macro situation. We're not economic forecasters. But the thing I'll say about our business, I made the point about diversity previously. What does that mean with a little bit more color? We have, for example, our business today, if I compare it to previous economic cycles, we have more exposure to everyday spending. We have a bigger debit business.\nWe have more e-commerce spend. We're more diverse geographically. And so you got to think about sort of how the business might get impacted today, and it might be different from previous cycles. And we do have greater diversification broadly. And then as it comes to VAS, specifically, as Ryan said, there's 65% of the business has a close correlation to Visa transactions. And so that part, depending on how the business would respond, could have a closer relationship.\nBut there's a great diversification there as well as we have a good portion of the VAS business that is independent of Visa transactions. And so when I think about that in total, I think there's good resilience and diversification there as well.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Chris, I was wondering if you could double-click again on some of the comments you shared around the incentives outlook. I think you've been talking about a pretty front-loaded renewal schedule. I thought I heard, but correct me if I'm wrong, the outlook is for modest increases in the growth rate over the next two quarters, but I may have misheard that. But if that was the case, could you just talk through cadence and some of the drivers kind of help square that with the front-loaded renewals?\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nSure will. Thanks, Chris. And you did hear correctly, and let me try to add a little bit of color and clarify. Q2 incentives grew 15%, came in lower than we had anticipated, primarily due to factors related to deal timing. I covered that on the call. In terms of what we expect for the full year and into the second half of the year, we've updated the expectation that in the back half of the year, our growth would be slightly higher than originally expected due to two factors that we called out.\nOne is client-related performance adjustments, and the second is deal timing, which means specifically anticipated early renewals. And so when we re-forecast the second half of the year, we do expect the second half to grow higher than the first half of the year. And we do expect that sequentially to be Q3 a little higher than Q2 and Q4 to be a little higher than Q3. And then maybe the final thing I'll say is when we look at the volume of payment volume that was impacted by renewals, we still believe that we have the same expectation that we started the year, which is 20% of the payment volume is being impacted.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris. I want to dig in a little bit more on the delta between nominal cross-border volumes and nominal international revenue. I think you did a great job going through the items. But to recap, there's the FX volatility, there's the quarter and client mix, there's a pricing aspect, and then, of course, there's the hedging, which impacts the revenue, but not the volumes. I think you touched on the FX volatility, meaning not assuming in the guide that the high levels will persist, which is a good conservative approach.\nYou talked around quarter mix and the yields being higher for US inbound. The one I was hoping you could drill in a little bit more is pricing because I know previously the guidance talked a little bit about pricing being a second half of the fiscal year event. So whether it be specific to cross-border or for the whole business, maybe you could just touch a little bit on that pricing topic.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nSure. Hi, Tim. Yeah, let me parse those apart a little bit. You covered my points on international transaction revenue. As you pointed out, we grew 10%, which was in line with the nominal volume growth, but below the 13% constant currency. That's the impact of FX.\nAnd I covered a number of items that impacted that in addition to FX, higher volatility, and some offsets there that you mentioned. Happy to give you more color on those. But let me get to your second point, which is our expectations on the full year on pricing. Just to remind everyone, at the start of the year, we said we would anticipate that the pricing contribution to growth in the full year would be similar to the previous year, but the timing would be a little bit different where we'd have more back-end-loaded pricing. That's still our expectation. We don't have a different view.\nWe do believe that pricing will benefit in the second half more than it did in the first half this year.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. If you don't mind just going a little deeper into the FX vol offset by what you just said, customer mix, and hedging, I guess it's just if you can explain it a little more. I know that corridor and mix on corridor could be a factor. As you said, US volume inbound could have a higher yield. But we haven't necessarily heard you call out hedging much before in the business and would assume that FX vol benefits would have been more of an offset.\nSo maybe just explain a little more of the hedging or the mix dynamic and what exactly happened. Then just a quick add-on would be de minimis and whether or not from an e-com standpoint, cross-border e-com is something that you're factoring in or thinking about having any way to think about how to factor that into the model going forward.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nOkay.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nGot it. I got both those questions down. So let me give a little bit more color. Again, just to dimensionalize again, the 10% growth in transaction revenue, which is in line with the nominal growth. And so that three-point delta, you could think the big portion of that is FX. And then to your point, higher volatility, which we said in April was higher in Q2 and throughout April.\nThe two items, which I could give a little bit more color on, I called out client mix and hedging. So client mix, we obviously have different clients throughout the portfolio there, and different clients have different pricing and different yield dynamics. And so it really depends on specific client performance and which clients are growing and where, and that can have an impact on our revenue yield. And in this case, it was a bit of a drag against relative to the 13% constant currency volume growth. And then on hedging, we hedge a portion of our cash flow exposures. This quarter, we did have a gain in Q2.\nWe had a year-over-year gain related to that hedging, but it was lower than the gain that we recognized a year ago in Q2. And so that became, even though there was a gain, it was a drag again. It was a reconciling item between the two, the 13% and the 10%. So those are the two items that primarily offset the higher volatility that we recognize in international transaction revenue. And then your second question, Darrin, on de minimis, if we look at sort of the whole situation with China, so far, we're not seeing a material impact from tariffs related to China and specifically spend associated with the de minimis exemption. It's just not a material portion of our volumes, and we wouldn't expect any material impact.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, guys. I wanted to ask about US volume growth. I know we went from 6% in the March quarter to 8% month to date. So I'm just curious if you normalize for effects of Easter, and I know, Chris, you mentioned a little bit of pull forward to spend ahead of the tariffs. Should we be just assuming some moderation off the April levels of 8% given those factors? Just want to make sure we've got the modeling square there so we don't overextrapolate from a few weeks of data.\nThanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Good question, Jason. The overall environment, I'll go back to some of the comments Ryan made. The overall environment remains stable, healthy, and steady. Whenever we give the month-to-date data, I always disclaim it by saying two or three weeks, or three weeks in this case, don't make a trend. We'll have to see how the rest of the quarter plays out.\nThe 8% in the month-to-date does reflect some benefits from the timing of Easter. I called that out earlier in the comments. We'll have to see how the quarter comes together. But I think the overall message that I would convey is that it's stable and consumer remains resilient, and I wouldn't read too much into the 6% versus 8% at this point.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to ask about the entertainment weakness, where you saw that exactly, and do you expect that to continue going forward? And was just thinking about the different affluent group maybe growing faster versus other bands and just the outlook there. Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. A couple of things I'd point to. One is sort of triangulating around the data. The most important thing I think to keep in mind is that when we talked about discretionary versus non-discretionary, they were both quite strong and healthy relative to the previous quarter. And so within that, we did have some puts and takes. I mentioned some travel and entertainment, but also offset by retail goods as an example.\nAnd so there are puts and takes. There are some moving parts within that, but overall, healthy, stable volumes, whether it's discretionary or non-discretionary. And as Ryan pointed out, even as we look across spend bands, the consistency of the performance in previous quarters, while obviously higher spend bands are growing faster and they have been for several quarters, the quarter-on-quarter performance remains stable and consistent.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nFinancial Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Just given the geopolitical backdrop, I'm just wondering, Ryan, if it changes in any way your views of how you're placing your investment bets. I mean, not the long-term ones, but maybe more near-term. So risk-on, your payback periods, specific geos that maybe you were thinking were kind of more short duration in nature, but now you want to throttle back, or even M&A opportunities that you might see that potentially could be created in this backdrop. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah, Dan, maybe I'll back up one step and just kind of talk about the macro environment a little bit and then kind of zone in what you're saying. I mean, there's obviously more uncertainty today among consumers and businesses than there was several months ago. You see that in the consumer confidence metrics. It's not surprising. But I think what you've heard from us in our prepared remarks today and from the many questions that Chris has answered. If you look at the facts in what we can add to the conversation in terms of spending, it remains strong and resilient.\nYou add to that, just looking in the US, employment remains strong, wage growth remains steady, inflation's moderated, consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy. We're kind of balancing the uncertainty that we all have with the facts. The facts show a lot of resiliency in what we're seeing. When we look at all of that, we remain very committed to our product roadmap, our investment roadmap. We are as confident today as we've ever been in the opportunities that we're going after across all three of our growth levers: Consumer Payments, Value-Added Services, and Commercial and Money Movement Solutions. But as I mentioned on the call, we're constantly looking at scenarios.\nWe are very kind of dialed into what could happen. And if and when we see facts that lead to changes, we'll be ready to make changes in our investment profile and our product pipeline. And then you mentioned M&A. I think if anything, from the position of strength that we operate, I'm optimistic that the current situation, as I described it, could create more opportunities for us around the world than might otherwise have happened. But we'll obviously have to just wait and see how that all plays out.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Adam Frisch from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Frisch\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, thanks for squeezing me in. My extrapolation of your guidance is if there's a little bit of weakness, kind of just more related to cyclicality as opposed to anything more crazy, you guys can absorb that. Correct me if I'm wrong on that assumption. But if macro conditions shift materially and much more quickly than expected, can you remind us where your key levers are in terms of revenue, like pricing or cost management in terms of marketing and stuff that would allow you to keep pace with the rate of change if it were to be faster and protect your margins? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa",
    "content2": "Hi, Adam. I touched on some of these points a little bit ago, but let me just expand on them because I think it's sort of an interesting way to think about it. Obviously, every recession is different. But over the course of time and over history, Visa has proven to be quite resilient even during these economic downturns. We don't know what's going to happen. We're not economic forecasters, but the management team here is ready to move decisively should the need arise.\nNow, our business is resilient. I talked about the diversification of the business, more exposure to everyday spend, more exposure to debit. Even our cross-border volume is more e-commerce today than travel, than it was if I think about pre-COVID levels. And so that diversification helps us. And so if there was a downturn, I think our performance during this potential economic slowdown. We would be resilient.\nAnd it could impact our business. If you think about it between volumes and revenue, volumes historically grown faster than PCE. Even if PCE slows, we're confident that we can continue to grow faster than that for all the reasons I spoke about. And then the one other thing I'd add is on the revenue front, remember that incentives are largely variable. And so to the extent that volume growth does get impacted, there could be an offset on incentives. On the expense side, I think we've also historically shown we could flex our expenses.\nWe obviously want to balance between short-, near-term, and long-term priorities. We don't want to overreact to anything. We want to be thoughtful about making sure that we're investing in the right areas to ensure Visa is successful over the long term. But we do have levers, and this is a management team that stands ready to act.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Stablecoins seem to be having their moment, maybe helped along by clear regulations. I know you called out your strategy there, including this reaching $200 million of settlement flows. What are your latest thoughts on the demand for those stablecoin settlements or other stablecoin payments? Are you seeing or expecting an inflection? What are your clients saying?\nThanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nIt's still early, but we do see real potential, which is why we've been investing in the crypto space broadly, in the stablecoin space specifically, for many years now. We've built up a team of real experts that I think are very well respected among the ecosystem. But it's early. On the one hand, $200 million is a great kind of milestone. On the other hand, it's still a relatively very small portion of our overall settlement volume. I guess I'd say a couple of things.\nOne is we are optimistic about kind of the US government passing more clear and pragmatic regulations. I think not just in the US, but hopefully other countries as well. We are continuing to push forward with the settlement work that you mentioned, but we're also exploring kind of a broader set of product opportunities and partnerships in the stablecoin space. I might use that as a little bit of a pitch to join our product drop tomorrow, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but our team will talk about some of those things as well. So as you said, there's a lot of activity and discussion about the stablecoin space right now. I think the tipping point will be more clear and pragmatic regulations. But I do think in the big scheme of things, certainly as it relates to our broader business, it's still very early in the development.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nLast question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our last question, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood afternoon. Ryan, Visa has managed government nationalism risk for decades as a company. How do you think about navigating that risk in the current environment, being a US-based company operating globally during trade disputes? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThanks. If I heard your question right around how are we navigating all of this, we regularly engage with governments and regulators in every country where we operate. We have a world-class government engagement team in all of our regions and all of our major countries, but it's also our country managers, day in and day out. They are deeply engaged with the governments of the countries in which we operate because we are an extraordinarily important partner and company in every country we operate around the world. And our engagement now, it's important. It's as important as it's ever been given the challenging and uncertain environment that you mentioned.\nWhat I would say is nationalism is nothing new. As long as we are permitted to operate in a country or territory, even if it's been more difficult for us to operate there than it has historically, we have a proven track record of being successful. We're used to operating in highly regulated markets and environments around the world. We've got tailored strategies, which we've tested in other markets with similar conditions. We tailor those to the unique needs of our clients and our partners in every one of these markets. We're working with our clients and partners to regularly educate the governments, the regulators, and the elected officials in those countries about not just what matters most kind of domestically in their market, but the complexities of the global payments market and what we need to be doing together to help them in their market.\nSo it is as complicated as I remember it, but we have the experience, the people, the products, the services to put to work in these countries around the world, and we feel good about our ability to navigate it.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSenior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWith that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our investor relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in Visa's Fiscal Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time and please enjoy the rest of your day."

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Q1 2025 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website, and the Investor Relations section of our website.\nOur comments today regarding our financial results will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all other results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted. The related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. With that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge last night's tragic air collision in Washington, DC. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this terrible event, particularly the families and friends of the victims. Turning now to our results, we had a strong start to our fiscal year with $9.5 billion in net revenue, up 10% year over year, and EPS up 14%. Our key business drivers improved from the Q4. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 9% year over year. U.S. payments volume grew 7%, and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 16% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 11% year over year. Our strategy across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services continues to resonate with our clients and is reflected in our business results.\nBack in February 2020, when we articulated our strategy, our total first-quarter volume on our network had just crossed $3 trillion. Just five years later, our total quarterly volume was above $4 trillion. At the same time, SEMEA and Latin America had more volume from people using their cards to get cash than to make payments. Five years later, as a result of double-digit constant dollar payments volume growth in both regions, the situation has flipped, and we now have more than 60% of our volume from digital payments. I'm looking forward to our Investor Day next month to discuss our strategy and our plans for future growth. For now, let's look at some of the quarterly highlights that have helped to deliver this impressive progress. In consumer payments, we now have 4.7 billion credentials, up 7% year over year, and 12.6 billion tokens, up 44% year over year.\nWe continue to grow our credentials in an increasingly digital world. Interest in our Visa Flexible Credential continues to grow. We have now launched with the Affirm Card in the US, expanded the funding options with SMCC in Japan by adding small business cards, and announced a multi-currency solution with Liv in the UAE. Tap to Add is now live in the US for nearly 60% of all Visa consumer credit and debit cards. Since the launch, millions have added their cards to their wallets by tapping, eliminating the overwhelming majority of provisioning fraud as compared to manual entry into a phone. 74% of all face-to-face transactions are now Tap to Pay. A few countries I would like to call out: Japan, where Tap to Pay penetration grew 20 percentage points since last year to 44%; Argentina, where Tap to Pay penetration was up 22 percentage points to 78%.\nThe US, where it was up 13 percentage points to 57%. Several key initiatives contributed to the growth in these countries, including targeted marketing campaigns, the launch of transit acceptance in certain cities, and increased issuance of tap-to-pay-enabled credentials. Finally, Tap to Phone is now live in 118 markets, and in the last year, the number of phones enabled has more than doubled, and the number of transactions has more than tripled. Now let me turn to a few deal highlights from across the globe. First, in mainland China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in mainland China in terms of number of cards.\nIn India, we renewed our longstanding credit agreements with ICICI Bank, SBI Card, and Kotak Mahindra Bank, three of our largest issuers in the country, with a focus on growing affluent and cross-border volume. We also renewed our debit agreement with Kotak Mahindra Bank. Also, in our Asia-Pacific region, we signed a long-term renewal with Bank of New Zealand, one of the largest banks in the country across consumer debit, consumer credit, and business credit. In Argentina and Uruguay, we renewed our portfolios with Santander for a long-term agreement with a focus on growing affluent. Also, in Latin America, we have deepened our partnership with BACC to grow acceptance with a goal to enable 300,000 nano and small merchants and to grow in new verticals. We also won the issuance of their largely cross-border credit portfolio, Millas Plus, offering our expertise and value-added services.\nSimilarly, in Brazil, we extended our partnership with digital bank Neon, which includes the launch of a new credit portfolio. We are also pleased to have renewed a pan-European agreement with BNP Paribas, which also includes the winning of additional portfolios in France and Belgium. You know, when we talk about the total addressable opportunity in consumer payments, we often talk about the opportunity to win share from domestic networks. We are continuing to have success converting credentials from domestic networks to Visa. In Bangladesh, we secured nearly six million credentials with Dutch-Bangla Bank from their closed-loop system. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, the largest issuer and acquirer in Puerto Rico, renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership with Visa that aims to expand digital penetration in the country through the launch of new products, including a COBAG card with the local network.\nWe've renewed our business with RBC Royal Bank in 10 countries across the Caribbean, and we also expanded our relationship to include the transfer of debit credentials in the Dutch Caribbean to Visa and are supporting the development of new credit and commercial products. Co-branded cards remain a key area of strength for us, and this quarter was no exception. In India, we launched two very important cards. First, the Times Black ICICI Bank Credit Card catering to high-net-worth individuals with travel and lifestyle benefits. Second, the HSBC Taj Credit Card, India's first premium co-branded hospitality credit card. In our SEMEA region, we signed with real estate developer, investor, and manager Aldar for a co-branded card for its DARNA Rewards by Aldar loyalty program in the UAE with issuing bank Emirates NBD.\nWe also launched a new co-brand card in Saudi Arabia with Al Rajhi Bank and Marriott Bonvoy, the global travel program by Marriott International. In the airline category, we won the portfolio for EgyptAir, Africa's second-largest airline. We also expanded our business in the Swisscard Miles & More program. And in the retail segment, we signed with Casas Bahia, one of the top retailers in Brazil for co-brand cards, and with Bolt, a leading ride-hailing and food delivery operator in Ukraine. So through traditional issuance, winning share from domestic networks, and leveraging our brand, products, and innovation to secure important co-brands, our consumer payments business is strong. Now to new flows, where revenue grew 19% year over year in constant dollars. Visa Direct has now crossed the 10 billion transaction mark over the last 12 months with nearly 3 billion transactions this quarter.\nWe continue to expand Visa Direct in several ways, one of which is building and deepening partnerships directly with issuers and fintechs. We are excited to partner with XMoney for their much-anticipated launch of the XMoney account, including P2P payment functionality set for later this year. Through the partnership, XMoney will utilize Visa Direct to enable secure and instant funding of their X Wallet with a user's debit card. Users will also have the option to instantly transfer funds back into their bank account via the same debit card. This quarter, we signed an agreement with OnePay, a fintech company with more than 3 million monthly active users, for Visa Direct as the engine for wallet loads. In Ecuador, Banco Pichincha, one of the country's largest issuers, will begin using Visa Direct for cross-border remittance payments. Our broad and deep cross-border capabilities continue to be important differentiators.\nThis quarter, Libra Internet Bank in Romania launched a real-time multi-currency FX service for their business customers, utilizing our Currencycloud solution. In Asia-Pacific, OCBC has launched a cross-border P2P solution on the OCBC app, allowing their customers in Singapore to send money to Chinese wallets using Visa Direct. All they need is the recipient's Chinese national ID, name, and mobile number. Now moving to commercial, where volumes were up 6% year over year this quarter in constant dollars, we had some notable progress in specific verticals. First, in the food and grocery delivery vertical, we had two recent wins. In the US, we are pleased that DoorDash's Shopper Card program will soon be using Visa virtual commercial credit cards to enable dashers to pay for customer orders at physical merchant outlets.\nThis is in addition to our Visa Direct relationship with DoorDash in the US, Australia, and Canada to enable dasher payouts. In Brazil, we signed a commercial business card deal for commercial customers of iFood Pago, the fintech for the largest food delivery platform in the country. In the healthcare vertical, we reached a virtual card agreement with an insurtech company in France, MySofie, offering medical policyholders an easy way to pay for their healthcare. In the T&E vertical, we recently renewed and deepened our partnership with Airwallex, a global financial platform enabling more than 150,000 businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders. Today, Visa and Airwallex have live card programs in Australia, Hong Kong, the UK, the United States, Canada, Netherlands, and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world.\nSoon, we will be expanding to new geographies across our use cases in expense cards and B2B travel. In both Visa Direct and commercial, we continued to develop innovative new solutions and use cases that helped us retain and secure business. Now to value-added services, where in the Q1, revenue grew 18% in constant dollars. Across our solutions, we continue to grow revenue as we enhance Visa payments, enable services for all types of payments, and go beyond payments. We often partner with acquirers who utilize Visa's acceptance platform to offer their merchant clients compelling solutions. When this happens, we generate revenue on both Visa and non-Visa transactions. Three examples this quarter are European acquirer eMerchantPay, Guatemalan acquirer NeoNet, and Paraguayan acquirer Bancard, who will all offer CyberSource to their merchants.\nWe are also partnering with Fiserv to include our CyberSource gateway as a solution for their acquirers and merchants in Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is in addition to Fiserv expanding their use of cardholder authentication from Cardinal Commerce to further extend our global partnership into additional Fiserv platforms. In our risk solutions, in 2024, we launched Visa Protect for A2A payments, with plans to expand to 10 new RTP networks in 2025. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We are now piloting this solution with five significant players in Brazil who represent more than 20% of PIX transactions.\nWe are also very pleased to have closed our acquisition of Featurespace, enabling us to provide an expanded set of fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real time across various payment methods. In advisory services, we continue to see strong demand. One example of a recent project is with Al Rajhi Bank, where we are expanding our advisory relationship into risk, digital enablement, and data analysis across their portfolios. So across our value-added services portfolio, we are innovating with new solutions and deepening our partnerships with clients to drive growth. To wrap it up, we began our fiscal year with strong performance, an ever-growing obsession for our clients, and a focus on continued innovation as we build the future of payments. I look forward to seeing you in February at our Investor Day. And now over to Chris.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 results reflected improving underlying drivers and effective execution of our business. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year over year, and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 16% year over year. Processed transactions grew 11% year over year. Fiscal Q1 net revenue was up 10%, higher than our expectations, primarily due to strong international transaction revenue and value-added services revenue. Net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars. EPS was up 14% year over year and 15% in constant dollars, higher than expected, primarily due to revenue outperformance and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Now let's go into the details. In the US, total payments volume grew 7% year over year, up 2 points from Q4. Credit grew 7%, and debit grew 8%. The US.\nbenefited from a strong holiday shopping season, which is the period from 1 November through 31 December, and the lapping of the impact of Reg II implementations, which had a modest drag in Q1 of last year. In the US, consumer holiday spending growth was in the upper-mid single digits on a year-over-year basis. The consumer categories with the strongest growth were discretionary categories, such as retail, travel, and entertainment. Focusing on retail, holiday spending growth was a couple of points higher than last year, and retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was several points higher. E-commerce was a higher share of retail holiday spending versus last year. In key countries around the globe, we saw similar trends, with consumer retail holiday spending growth improving from last year. Moving to international markets, total payments volume was up 11% in constant dollars, up from Q4.\nIn most of our regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant dollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 22%, SEMEA up 18%, and Europe up 13%. Asia-Pacific payments volume growth saw a slight improvement from Q4 in constant dollars to just above 1% year-over-year for the quarter, reflecting a still somewhat muted macroeconomic environment. Now to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year in Q1, three points above Q4. E-commerce, measured as card-not-present volume ex travel, and cross-border travel volume were both up 16% year-over-year for Q1. E-commerce volumes continued to benefit from the strength in retail, in part due to the strong holiday shopping season. Travel volumes performed well across our regional corridors due to broader strength in both consumer and commercial spending.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nOutbound Europe and Asia-Pacific travel volume growth also benefited from solid performance of client portfolios. For the US, both outbound e-commerce and travel volume growth were also helped by the strong dollar. Now let's review our Q1 financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q4 constant dollars payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 11% processed transaction growth, due largely to the back half-loaded 2025 pricing impact that was included in our initial guidance. Had pricing been more evenly spread across the year, as in the prior year, these two growth metrics would have been more in line for the Q1. International transaction revenue was better than expected, benefiting from higher cross-border volumes and higher currency volatility than we expected.\nYear-over-year growth was up 14%, below the 16% increase in constant-dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, due primarily to foreign exchange and lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Other revenue grew 32%, primarily driven by better-than-expected consulting and marketing services growth and select pricing modifications. Client incentives grew 13%, reflecting a strong renewal quarter. Now to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by improving payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 19% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by better-than-expected commercial cross-border performance across all regions and Visa Direct transaction growth. Commercial payments volume rose 6% year-over-year in constant dollars, mainly driven by favorable days mix impact, as well as strong cross-border volumes. Visa Direct transactions grew 34% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps.\nValue-added services revenue grew to $2.4 billion, a growth rate of 18% in constant dollars, led by strong growth in consulting and marketing services, issuing solutions, and risk and identity solutions. Operating expenses grew 11%, in line with our expectations, driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative expenses. In our GAAP results, we had $213 million in severance costs related to changes to our workforce, reflecting our efforts to focus investment on the highest growth opportunities for our business, as well as accelerating our innovation to better serve our clients. Our tax rate was 17.7%, better than expected due to various items, including a change in our geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $2.75, up 14% over last year, with an approximately one-point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half-point drag from acquisitions.\nIn Q1, we bought back approximately $3.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $9.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in Q2. Through 28 January, driver trends have remained strong. US payments volume was up 8%, with debit up 9% and credit up 7% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, we saw total volume grew 17% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume grew 17% year-over-year, and cross-border card-not-present ex travel volume grew 16%. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail.\nFor the Q2, we expect adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high single digits to low double digits. I would note that the primary difference between Q1 and Q2 adjusted net revenue growth is the lapping of leap year. We expect Q2 adjusted operating expense growth to be in the high single to low double digits. Non-operating income in the Q2 is expected to be negligible. Our tax rate in the Q2 is expected to be around 17.5%. As a result, we expect Q2 adjusted EPS growth to be in the high single digits. We have now closed the acquisition of Featurespace and lapped the impact of Pismo in January. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal impact to net revenue growth, an approximately one-and-a-half-point contribution to operating expense growth, and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth in the Q2.\nNow let's cover our full-year expectations. We now expect full-year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. There are no material changes to our adjusted operating expense growth and non-operating income expectations for the full year. Based on our lower-than-expected tax rate in Q1 and an updated view for the rest of the year, we're lowering our expected tax rate to be between 17.5% and 18%. Taking all of this together, we now expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the low teens. Featurespace and Pismo are expected to have a minimal impact on full-year net revenue growth and approximately one-point contribution to operating expense growth, and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth. In summary, we're off to a strong start to the year.\nWe remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2025 and look forward to Investor Day in a few weeks. Now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Chris. With that, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 and clearly record your name. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questioners are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Once again, to ask a question, please press Star 1. To withdraw your question, please press Star 2. Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW, please go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. I had a question on the improved outlook. Obviously, the volumes did better, and they accelerated. Does the improved outlook assume the growth rates sort of sustain themselves, or maybe you could just go through sort of what the drivers are? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Hi, Sanjay. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we feel great about the Q1 results, as I indicated. One quarter of the year, and we'll have more of an update on H2 as we get closer to it.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Will Nance with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. I also wanted to follow up on some of the stronger spending results that you've seen. You called out the strong results. That's been pretty evident in some of the prints so far this quarter.I just wanted to know if there's anything kind of when you peel back the onion in some of the data that you guys have, if there's anything obvious that you would attribute this acceleration over the past couple of months towards.\nI know you called out some things around holiday spending, and obviously, there's been a lot of days mix things going on. But we spent, I think, a year talking about ticket size being a headwind, so I'm wondering how much of this is sort of a new run rate and lapping kind of tougher comps over the last couple of years versus kind of an outright acceleration and kind of spending above trend. Curious if you have any thoughts on that. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Will. Well, let's try to break down, unpack a little bit. You had a few things in there. We talked about strength in the US and international markets, the strength in the US. We did have a strong holiday. I gave some of those numbers in the prepared comments that you heard about. It also helped discretionary categories: retail, travel, entertainment, and then the lapping of Reg II.\nThat was really the step-up that we saw in the US. We feel really good about that. And then, like we talked about as well, across the regions. And so from a payment volume standpoint, feel really good about that. Cross-border, maybe the added commentary on cross-border was, if you look at e-commerce, e-commerce was up a point from Q4, cross-border e-commerce benefiting from the stronger retail and holiday. And then travel, though, did step up by four points from Q4. And not just Q4, but maybe the last two quarters, which had been around that same level.\nWe're seeing strong travel results from across all the regions. And so again, we feel really good about that. But all that said, it's a quarter into the year, and we're going to obviously wait to see how Q2 plays out, but we feel pretty good about the outlook into the Q2.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research, please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys, thanks. Just a couple of two parts to a question. But first one is really to do with the underlying trends we're going to see through the year with regard to the moving parts on some of your easier lapping, given that there were some business, as you talked about, that had come off last year that laps. How does that impact your volume trajectory in the US as the year progresses? We can think about that.\nObviously, Reg II started to help already. Then maybe just a quick follow-up on rebates incentives. I know you talked about this being the higher quarter that we were going to start the year off at. Maybe just if you can help us, was this in line with your expectations in terms of the results that we saw, or is anything changing around timing on it, or did it really come in as expected? Thanks again, guys.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Okay. Let me try to tackle all three of those things, Darrin. In terms of the full-year guide, you are recalling correctly. When we started the year, we talked about sort of the dynamics in H1 and H2 and why we anticipated growth to be accelerating throughout the course of the year. Incentives was part of that story.\nWe are, as we said before, as expected, this is going to be a big year for renewals with more than 20% of our payment volume impacted, and starting really meaningfully with that renewal cycle in the first half of the year. That has occurred. You saw incentives grow 13% in Q1 versus the 6% we saw in Q4. That will continue. We anticipate Q2 incentives growth will continue to reflect that renewal cycle. You mentioned Reg II. I think we've covered that. We are lapping what was modest impact from a year ago. And then there are some lapping benefits from portfolio as well that are more centered toward the second half of the year as well. That all said, again, I just have said it before. So the last question when Will asked, it's a quarter into the year.\nWe've reflected the Q1 upside and adjusted our Q2 outlook to reflect that. And we'll certainly talk about half two as we get closer to it.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair. You may go ahead.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nAndrew, are you there? Operator, maybe we can go to the next caller and come back to Andrew in a bit.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment, please. And Andrew, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nEquity Analyst, William Blair\n\nHi. Thank you. Can you hear me now? Yes. Now we can. Oh, I apologize for that. I'm sorry. I wanted to ask on value-added services given the recent closure of Featurespace and I think some emphasis in Pismo. Can you talk, Ryan? Has there been a philosophical change or a change in emphasis, perhaps, in Visa's value-added services initiatives? And going forward, as we think about greater opportunities in that area, should we think about Visa maybe emphasizing some more security offerings versus processing and gateway? Just trying to frame that up.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. We continue to be very excited about the progress that we're making in value-added services across the board. There's no change in emphasis as it relates to the priority or the prioritization of kind of the areas where we've been building products and serving clients. So we continue to be very focused on delivering solutions to merchants and acquirers, very focused on delivering solutions to issuers, very focused on delivering fraud and risk solutions broadly across the ecosystem, as well as our advisory business. I talked about some examples in my prepared remarks. We have had some great acquisitions.\nThe way that we think about acquisitions is we're constantly kind of looking for companies around the world that we can bring into our ecosystem, accelerate their growth, accelerate our kind of products that we're bringing to our clients. Pismo and Featurespace are two great examples of those. In terms of Pismo, we're having real good success kind of with our sales pipeline all around the world. We're having conversations with clients that I don't think Pismo ever would have had, certainly not this early in their evolution. The reason we're able to do that is we're bringing kind of the amazing capabilities that Pismo offers together with the deep relationships and partnerships that we have, as well as kind of our long track record of delivering resilient solutions to our clients and partners. Featurespace is early, but we're already having a ton of success.\nI got a ton of great client and partner feedback once we closed that acquisition. We've known Featurespace for many, many years. We partnered with them. We also competed against them. We know their capabilities really, really well. One of the things that you're seeing from us is that we're continuing to take the amazing capabilities that we have at Visa, whether that's our fraud capabilities, our network capabilities, or our processing capabilities. We're unbundling those from the Visa stack. We're enhancing them, and then we're delivering them to a broader array of clients and partners, many times unrelated to Visa transactions or the Visa platform itself. So we continue to focus on all those areas in value-added service.\nWe continue to have good success, and you'll continue to see us kind of move down this kind of program of unbundling our capabilities, enhancing them, and delivering them to a much broader set of clients.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThank you. Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood afternoon. So Ryan, I want to follow up on your comments on kind of this unbundling of the capabilities and ask about Visa A2A. You talked about 10 new RTP network partnerships. What are you hearing from your issuer and merchant customers? Bill pay is probably an obvious use case. How should we think about the roadmap of use cases, monetization models, and also the dynamics with the debit in terms of cannibalization thinking?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. You're right. Kind of this notion of unbundling our capabilities is very relevant in the value-added services space for some of the reasons that I mentioned. It's also very relevant in the consumer payment space. Visa Account-to-Account is a great example. A great example where we've unbundled kind of our brand and acceptance, our rules in terms of chargebacks, disputes, and returns, and how things work, as well as kind of our risk management capabilities.\nWe've unbundled that from the Visa stack, and now we're delivering that to our partners, initially in the UK with Visa A2A, and then more broadly across Europe and other places over time. We still are on track to launch Visa A2A in early 2025. After we announced it, we've done what we always do, which is have a bunch of great conversations with clients, partners, and regulators in the UK.\nAs you mentioned, the initial use case is targeted at Bill Pay. What we found through those conversations is there's a real need. There's a real need to add the types of processes and rules and the trusted brand that we have to account to account payments, starting in Bill Pay, to give consumers more confidence to use it, merchants more reason and confidence to offer it. We're excited about it. I mean, obviously, Bill Pay in the UK is just the start, but we think the power of kind of taking some of these Visa capabilities into the account to account space is going to be a great benefit for our clients and our partners in the ecosystem. You mentioned Visa account to account.\nIt's a similar story kind of on what we've been doing in account-to-account protect, where we've taken our kind of decades of risk experience, our data, our scoring algorithms, and unbundled that from kind of the Visa stack. And we're delivering that to, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're targeting up to 10 RTP networks during the course of this year. I mentioned that the banks we're now working with in Brazil to reduce fraud on PIX transactions. We've had great success with Pay.UK in the UK reducing fraud on account-to-account transactions. And you're going to hear a lot more from other partners and other networks around the world. These two examples are both driven by client needs. I mean, that is what drives our innovation agenda. That's what drives our product delivery agenda.\nWe've been hearing from clients all around the world that they're looking for Visa to help them with these types of challenges, both driving safe and secure account to account payments around the world. So we're excited about it, and you'll continue to hear more from us on it.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next caller is Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you. I want to dig a little bit into the mix components of the cross-border business. So you said in the past that roughly about 60% of it is travel and the other roughly 40% is e-commerce. And I know that evolved a little bit throughout COVID and now into the recovery period. But when we think about the e-commerce component, I believe that some of the Visa Direct-related pieces are sitting there. So whether it be the remittances that are cross-border or the marketplace payouts, I was hoping you could dig into those two or that broader bucket if there's any rough growth rates or growth contribution or sizing. And if not, just any general comments around that aspect of the cross-border business.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThanks for the question, Tim. Yeah. Let's unpack that as well. We've been doing some unpacking here. In terms of e-commerce, the mix that you've shared is the mix that we've shared in terms of travel and e-commerce, with e-commerce having sustained slightly better over the last few quarters. Obviously, this quarter, the two growth rates converged. That was good to see. And within that, Visa Direct does have a cross-border component. Visa Direct cross-border, we talked about Visa Direct transactions growing 34%. The cross-border portion of that is growing much faster.\nIt's obviously a small portion of the total transactions. It's growing much faster than that. And so we continue to appreciate that. Visa Direct in total, the momentum is great and continues to be a really good opportunity. But yeah, when you add it all together, we're seeing great growth across e-commerce and cross-border. And as you know, the yields are accretive as well. Yeah. I mean, the only thing I'd add is in the very big scheme of things, with all the success we're having in cross-border Visa Direct, which is great, and we are having great success, it's still a very small portion of our cross-border transactions and payment volume around the world in the big scheme of things.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks. I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the cross-border question. How much benefit in the past we've seen different periods when cryptocurrencies have done well, but that's also helped the cross-border kind of e-commerce component. I'm wondering how much of an uplift you saw from that. And I guess tied in with that, as we've seen kind of growth rates decelerate a little bit here in January, what's your current visibility on particularly travel, and what are you seeing around bookings there? Any color you could provide on those two things would be great. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nSure. Hi, James. Crypto. So how and where does crypto impact our business? Well, there are a few ways that crypto can show up in our underlying drivers. But typically, when we see an impact, we do see it in our cross-border e-commerce volumes. I talked about some of the drivers of that this quarter relative to Q4. But obviously, given the recent demand and sort of activity around crypto, it is a modest benefit, I would say, to our cross-border e-commerce, but it's one of the smaller benefits I talked about, sort of the other things that impact that. And so that's where we do see it typically.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, guys. I want to touch on tokenization for a minute. I think you said number of tokens were up 44% in the quarter. Obviously, pretty robust number. So if you can just give us a general update on tokenization strategy and any potential timing or magnitude of actual monetization opportunity from tokenization, obviously understanding the benefits of it from a fraud and security perspective, but just wondering if there's any direct monetization we should be thinking about.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHappy to talk about tokens. You did get the number right, and we agree that it's significant. Let me just step back and maybe put the whole token kind of roadmap in perspective. Visa Network tokens have been and will be one of our most important investment priorities across the company. In many ways, we led the wave of token innovation and adoption. I think it's been about a decade since we issued the first Visa token.\nI remember. I think in 2020, we got to 1 billion tokens. And that was a big milestone. But in hindsight, we were really just approaching the beginning of the steep part of the S-curve. You go back to what you said about 44% growth. So we've now got more than 12.5 billion tokens across the ecosystem. We got 8,400 issuers around the world that are issuing them in 200+ markets around the world.\nAnd we've got 1/3 of all Visa transactions that are now tokenized. We did 21 to 22 billion token transactions in the last quarter. And as you alluded to, the adoption is proliferating because the performance improvement is meaningful. If you just look at e-commerce, on tokenized transactions, we have 6 percentage points higher approval rates. That is significantly higher sales for our merchant partners and 30% reduction in fraud rates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem. Tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation. For example, I think it was last quarter I talked about in Europe, we're using tokens to simplify the e-commerce checkout experience. We've embedded FIDO Passkeys via Visa tokens into Click to Pay, and we're making e-commerce checkout as easy as it is that you and I unlock our phone with our face or fingerprint.\nSo that's an example of tokens being a platform to drive innovation around the world. They're also a critical enabler of our value-added services, and those we deepen relationships with our partners, and we also grow revenue. To your question around monetization, what would be a couple of examples? We've got merchants that are using our token credential enrichment service. So we embed this in Visa tokens so that we continually update Visa credentials for merchants that subscribe to this service, and then they don't have to worry about consumers updating their credentials when their cards expire so they don't miss a subscription renewal or a sale. And we are revenue for that service. We also offer a service, if you think about it on the issuer side, that allows our issuers to create a heat map of all their consumers' tokens across the entire ecosystem.\nAnd they pay for this service from us so that they can enable their customers to add, view, and manage their Visa cards across merchants that they use in their daily lives. So we have a vast array of services that we've both shipped and that we're building and plan to ship built on our tokens. And the revenue that we generate from these token-enabled services is meaningful, and it'll be even more meaningful going forward.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, just want to ask about XMoney. How long does a project like that take for you guys to implement with X? Any kind of idea on how fast and how much volume that might ramp and any thoughts on economics? I assume it's just kind of Visa Direct-type transactions. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. I think the X partnership is a great example in what's been a kind of long list of fintech and big tech, crypto, digital wallets, social messaging apps, and the like that have looked around at their options and concluded that the Visa platform, the Visa Network, and the Visa Network of Networks is kind of the best, most reliable, biggest money movement platform that's really engineered to enable their developers to quickly implement the types of solutions that they're looking to implement.\nAnd it's another great step in that journey that we've been taking. As you said, the partnership is built on the Visa Direct platform. It's going to allow the 600 million or so active monthly users of X to fund their XMoney account, so to move money into it. They're going to be able to transfer funds back to their bank account instantly from their XMoney account.\nThere's going to be creators on the X platform that can now get paid much faster when they use Visa Direct to move money back into their bank accounts. So it's a great credit to the partnership between our team and the XMoney team, and I think building out those use cases. We're just excited to continue to expand the number of use cases on our platform.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Dominic Gabriel from Compass Point. You may go ahead, please.\n\nDominic Gabriel\n\nStock Analyst, Compass Point\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking my question. I was actually just curious if you heard through your partners on either the consumer or commercial side if the threat of tariffs pushed up any commercial spending or consumer spending, and if you've tracked that in the past. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. We haven't seen anything directly related to that. I think just, I guess, broadening the question a bit, I think on tariffs broadly, we're going to have to wait and see what happens. I think it's going to be very difficult to predict what's going to get implemented, where it's going to get implemented. As we see these things potentially get implemented, we'll have a better sense on what impact it has for our business, and we can let you know then.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on commercials. I think I caught 6% growth, so one-point improvement there in quarter on quarter. Can you talk more about the trends in commercial spend in Q1 and further improvement expected, or I guess sustainable here in the 2025 outlook relative to what you saw in 2024?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThanks for the question. You got the numbers right. Commercial volumes were up from Q4 a little over a point. That Q1 growth was aided by a couple of things: favorable days mix in the US and internationally, which was the inverse of what I talked about in Q4, where days mix was a little bit of a headwind. I also referenced stronger commercial cross-border volumes as well.\nAnd maybe the third one, it's small, but there was less of a drag from ATS as it continues to evolve. I also referenced strong results from client portfolios that helped cross-border volumes in Europe and AP that also benefited commercial. This all contributed nicely to our strong new flows revenue performance. That is a trend that we, in terms of commercial volumes, that is embedded into our expectations, are embedded into our Q2 guidance. We anticipate they remain steady, stable, and strong through the remainder of the year.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nDan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. I was wondering if you could just speak to the point around the strength of the dollar and really the purchasing power parity associated with that. So I guess it plays into cross-border, obviously, for outbound US, but it's higher for people to come into the United States, but also just in terms of just spending patterns. I mean, obviously, this is going to be a strong period for a little while, and I'm just wondering to what extent there's a proportional benefit to your business. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. I mean, clearly, the dollar has strengthened meaningfully and quickly. You got it right, which is all else equal. With a stronger dollar, you have stronger purchasing power for Americans outside of America. In kind of historical periods where we've had a stronger dollar, we have ultimately seen that lead to some travel patterns outbound from the US. The opposite of that is, obviously, it's more expensive for people to travel to the US.\nIn kind of, again, historical periods of relatively stronger dollars, we've seen some shift in travel patterns of people who might otherwise have traveled to the US going to other places around the world. Having said that, it's still early. This particular situation, we're going to have to monitor. Even though in past times, you have seen some changes in travel corridors as a result of a strengthening dollar, we typically have seen the travel spending overall remain consistent. People just plan their holidays in different places around the world, but that takes time. We're a pretty short period into this stronger dollar period so far.\nSo assuming we stay at this point, we'll be able to give you more insight next quarter and future quarters.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nAndrew Schmidt with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nLead Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, Ryan. Hey, Chris. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the regulatory environment in the US, obviously, a new regulatory regime here. Wondering just your view on that and just conversations maybe you've had with issuers or other parties, just trying to get a better sense. I know there's a few things going on in the US, obviously. Curious how you're feeling. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. We're optimistic. Our clients are optimistic. I think what we've heard so far is that the administration wants to move quickly to reduce and simplify regulations, and they're doing it kind of with a goal of spurring economic growth, efficiency, innovation, all very good things. So we're optimistic that these changes are going to reduce the regulatory burden for businesses in general in America, which is good for America and ultimately should be good for Visa.\nWe're optimistic, as our clients are, that they're going to reduce the regulatory burden specifically in the financial sector, which will in turn help our FI clients accelerate digital payments and, in general, run their businesses more efficiently and more effectively, which is very good for them, which is in turn good for us. So we're optimistic, but again, it's early, and we're just going to have to see what gets implemented, where it gets implemented, and how quickly it does.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nCraig Maurer with FT Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners",
    "content2": "Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to some of the big deal renewals you discussed early in the call and ask about the interplay of the different revenue lines in these renewals. What I'm trying to understand is you're obviously making pricing concessions when you enter into these large renewals or deal expansions. To what degree are you able to make up for that with other revenue or VAS being sold into these issuers? And I know this is complicated, but how much is that accounting for the expansion we're seeing in some of the other revenue? The other revenue. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. First, just reflecting on this quarter, the last quarter, as you've seen, we've just been having great, tremendous success with clients all over the world. And they continue to choose Visa because of our brand, because of our products, because of our innovation, because of our people, but increasingly because of our value-added services and because of our CMS or new flows capabilities.\nI guess I would answer your question this way. When we engage and our teams engage with partners on these types of renewal, extension, new business deals that you're talking about, it is vastly different than it was three or four years ago. The types of conversations that we're having with our clients are much more multifaceted. They're very rich conversations about a broad array of services that we can provide them, one of which is, of course, network services for their debit cards and credit cards.\nBut in a much more significant way, we're having conversations about processing, about services, about fraud and risk services, about ways that, as part of a multifaceted agreement, we can expand from historical relationships and consumer payments to small business cards, commercial cards, fleet-specific priorities. I'm sorry, specific priorities around fleet, for example, or around agricultural verticals, or different types of B2B verticals. It's a very different sales motion. It's a very different type of negotiation. But importantly, as you alluded to, it involves a lot of different revenue levers than we historically would have had. So it varies from client to client and market to market and what's important to them.\nBut our teams are increasingly having success building on deep relationships historically in consumer payments and taking the opportunity of these renewals to really expand our partnerships, especially into new flows opportunities, into VAS opportunities, deepening our relationship with those partners, and creating new revenue growth opportunities.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nJeff Cantwell with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Cantwell\n\nSenior Analyst, Seaport Research Partners\n\nGreat. Thank you. Does the news this week on DeepSeek influence how you're thinking about your business and strategy, possibly in terms of whether you're thinking about stepping up your usage of AI to help with managing internal costs, or maybe in terms of whether you're thinking about using AI as a tool to support your growth and unlock new revenue opportunities?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nBecause it does appear from an outsider's perspective, AI potentially could help improve operating efficiency and might even perhaps support some of your revenue areas like authorization or fraud prevention. So I wanted to ask you for your view on what DeepSeek and the rise of AI generally means for Visa as far as strategy and where you see opportunity going forward. Thanks.\nYeah. We agree with you. Everything that's happening in the world, whether it's DeepSeek or the many, many things that have happened before and will happen after it, all are examples of opportunities for us broadly across Visa. We were very early adopters of artificial intelligence, and we continue to drive hard at the adoption of generative AI as we have for the last couple of years. So we've been working to embed AI and AI tooling into our company's operations, I guess, broadly.\nWe've seen material gains in productivity, particularly in our engineering teams. We've deployed AI tooling in client services, sales, finance, marketing, really everywhere across the company. We were a very early adopter of applied AI in the analytics and modeling space. Very early, by decades, we've been using AI in that space. So our data science and risk management teams have, at this point, decades of applied experience with AI, and they're aggressively adopting the current generations of AI technology to enhance both our internal and our market-facing predictive and detective modeling capabilities. Our product teams are also aggressively adopting GAI to build and ship new products. I think I talked last quarter about data tokens. That's a great example.\nJust as the internet itself fundamentally changed the way that we all shop and buy, and the way commerce works itself, we deeply believe that AI is going to be a driving force that is going to change the way digital commerce works. And we have an amazing team of people that are working really hard to ensure that Visa plays a central and sustainable role in the next version of digital commerce. And I think we'll have more to say about that in future quarters.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nLast question, please.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThank you. Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks. I'll close it out with a question and a clarification, if you don't mind. Just on the question with AsiaPac, it looks like that's the only laggard again as a region. Otherwise, growth is really good. Any change in outlook for Asia-Pacific and the usual macro versus structural question there? Just curious if there's any change in taking the region. My clarification was just on the restructuring. Was that contemplated in your prior guide? And I presume that the savings that you get from that will be reinvested pretty quickly. Sorry if I missed that. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nGreat. Okay. Let me quickly get to it. Maybe the latter one first, just to clear it. Restructuring, it reflects we recorded a charge this quarter. It's reflected in the guide for the full year. It's really focusing our expenses. We don't expect another charge this year. And sorry, remind me your first question again. Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific. Yeah. Sorry. So AP growth, I think you characterized it right.\nIt is moderately up from Q4, about a point, a little bit more than a point, but it still reflects a somewhat muted environment. So it's growing at 1% in total, moving in the right direction, but still quite muted.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWith that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our investor relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in Visa's Fiscal Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference.

Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors.\nAdditional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.\nFor non-GAAP financial information disclosed on this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and the related materials available on our IR website. With that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong second-quarter results with $8.8 billion in net revenue, up 10%, GAAP EPS up 12%, and non-GAAP EPS up 20%. For our key business drivers, we saw relative stability. Overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. US payment volume grew 6% year-over-year, and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 16% year-over-year, and process transactions grew 11%. Visa's business performance demonstrates our strategy at work in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Furthermore, across all of these growth levers, tremendous opportunity remains. I'll spend a few moments on each growth lever. Let's start with consumer payments. The opportunity in consumer payments is enormous.\nBased on the latest public data from calendar year 2022 and our analysis, we estimate that the total global purchase personal consumption expenditure, or PPCE, excluding Russia and China, was approximately $40 trillion. Within that $40 trillion, our addressable opportunity is more than $20 trillion. This includes three components. One, cash and check, which is about half of the addressable opportunity. Tap-to-pay is a great example of how we are converting small-ticket cash transactions to Visa credentials.\nTwo, ACH and other electronic transactions. We have many examples in this space, including the work we are doing to extend Visa as a bill pay method in acceptance categories like rent, education, and loan repayments. And three, cards that run primarily on domestic networks. We have been focused on converting these domestic-based cards to Visa credentials in countries around the world, and I'll share a good example from Europe in a moment.\nThere is a very long runway ahead, and I remain excited about Visa's future growth opportunity in consumer payments. We continue to capture that growth by delivering innovative and secure payment solutions for buyers and sellers, including new credentials and issuance, tap-to-pay, and e-commerce. I'll briefly talk about each. First, we're making great progress in expanding the number of Visa credentials. We have added over 100 million credentials from September to December for a year-over-year growth rate of 6%. One area of focus is in Europe, with the UK growing credentials at its fastest rate since 2016, driven in part by strong growth from Fintech clients. In addition, from 2018 to 2023, we converted more than 20 million credentials in Europe that primarily ran on domestic networks to Visa debit credentials, with millions more in the process of being migrated.\nThis is a great example of the opportunity I mentioned a moment ago. We're particularly excited as we prepare for the Paris Olympics, which are less than 100 days away. We have close to 300 clients across 85 countries globally working with Visa to activate our Olympic sponsorship for marketing campaigns and cardholder engagements, such as credential issuance and on-site cardholder events. In Europe alone, we expect our clients to have issued over 5 million Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa credentials before the start of the Games. Also, this quarter in Europe, we renewed our relationship with Caixa Geral de Depósitos in Portugal across consumer credit, debit, and prepaid, and commercial credit and debit, as well as a suite of value-added services, including risk solutions and analytics. Another area of strength is our co-brand issuance.\nVisa is the primary network partner for eight of the top 10 co-brand partnerships in the US today, and we are pleased that Visa has finalized a multi-year extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a loyal customer base and high cross-border usage. We have also had significant co-brand momentum in CEMEA. First, we launched a new co-brand card in partnership with Qatar Airways, British Airways, and National Bank of Kuwait. Second, we expanded our strong global Marriott relationship to launch Qatar's first hospitality co-branded card with Qatar Islamic Bank. Across the United Arab Emirates, we now have exclusive agreements with all the leading airlines marked by a recent agreement with Emirates Skywards. We also signed an inaugural airline co-brand agreement in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc.\nNow, newer digital issuers are equally important to our future growth in consumer payments, and in Saudi Arabia, Fintech STC Pay, which has over 12 million customers, is transitioning from a digital wallet to a full digital bank and expanding its Visa prepaid business into Visa debit and credit. Digital bank Maya in the Philippines has chosen Visa to offer its millions of mobile wallet users and bank depositors access to consumer credit cards with new issuance of affluent products. In the US, we signed a newly expanded credit deal with brokerage platform Robinhood, including the launch of a new Robinhood Gold Card, which offers 3% cashback for all purchases. In Europe, broker and savings platform Trade Republic has launched a new Visa card that combines spending and savings for their 4 million customers across 17 markets.\nOver 1 million people joined the waitlist for the card in just a few weeks. As I've mentioned in the past, we feel great about our products, our value-added services, our New Flows capabilities, our brand, and our people, all coming together to deepen and expand our partnerships with our clients around the world. As we think about Visa's growth, tap-to-pay and e-commerce are key drivers in the digitization of payments. This quarter, tap-to-pay grew 5 percentage points from last year to 79% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. Of note, Japan nearly doubled its penetration since last year to almost 30%.\nIn the US, in the Q2, we're nearing 50% penetration, with New York City at over 75%, the first US city to reach this milestone, up from 50% two years ago, demonstrating the impact that transit and our focused issuance and acceptance have on accelerating growth.\nOn the e-commerce front, we continued to see Visa's US e-commerce payments volume grow several points faster year-over-year than face-to-face spend, and the same is true in many key countries around the world, including Canada, Brazil, Australia, and India. This matters to Visa's growth because in the e-commerce space, cash is not usually an option, and although e-commerce payments are a highly competitive environment, we believe our capabilities and our focus on safety, security, reliability, and user experience position us very well.\nAdding to the potential for growth is tokenization, which brings several benefits to the ecosystem, especially in e-commerce, including reducing fraud, improving authorization rates, and therefore making it easier for a customer to purchase a good or service. As of Q2, we have over 9.5 billion tokens globally and have surpassed a milestone of 1 billion tokens in Asia-Pacific, joining the ranks of the US.\nand Europe. We continue to be focused across all of these efforts in addition to seeking new areas of acceptance and spending. Now moving to new flows. We mentioned last quarter that we see $200 trillion of opportunity, excluding Russia and China, and we are delivering Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows. This quarter, new flows revenue growth improved to 14% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis, with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 31% for the quarter to 2.3 billion, and commercial volumes up 8% year-over-year in constant dollars.\nThroughout the quarter, we remained focused on our Visa Direct strategy across several areas of growth, including through new use cases, expansion to new geographies, and enablers. One recent example is our expanded agreement with Thunes, which increased the number of countries in which Visa Direct can enable push-to-wallet from 78 to 108.\nIn addition, Thunes is implementing Visa Direct's push-to-card capability to enable payouts made to eligible Visa cards and accounts. We have also expanded Earned Wage Access in Canada through an agreement with Payfare and have brought our first Visa Direct cross-border capability into Taiwan with Taishin Bank. On the enabler front, we are pleased that our longtime partner, JPMorgan Payments, will be seamlessly integrating Visa Direct into their acquiring operations to offer their business clients faster push payments capabilities.\nIn addition, we continued to deepen our relationship with Chase in the small business market with investment and enhancements in products and services. In Accounts Receivable and Payable, we renewed and expanded our multi-year agreement with Bill on their accounts payable, spend, and expense management platforms. We have also reached a global partnership with Taulia, an SAP company and a leading provider of working capital management solutions.\nThe collaboration will incorporate Visa's digital payments technology into Taulia's virtual cards, a solution that integrates with SAP ERP solutions and business applications to make embedded finance accessible for businesses through a seamless and streamlined payments experience for buyers and suppliers. One vertical in new flows that has immense potential is government payments, representing over $15 trillion in annual payments volume opportunity, where we are in a strong position to combine many of our new flows offerings.\nA recent example is in Kenya, where we signed an agreement with Pesaflow, a technology partner for the government of Kenya, to expand card payments on eCitizen, the government's electronic platform with over 12 million users. We achieved this by bringing together Visa virtual credentials and Visa Direct into the platform. Now let me move on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the Q2 in constant dollars.\nThe growth and opportunity in value-added services continue to be significant and broad-based. In acceptance solutions, we signed an agreement with Millicom International Cellular in Latin America for CyberSource Gateway, Decision Manager, and Token Management solutions. As it relates to open banking, just about two years ago, we acquired Tink as we saw the opportunity in open banking to enable the movement of data and money and to provide consumers with control over their financial data.\nOver those two years, we have been expanding our presence in Europe, winning deals with such as Adyen and Revolut. We're now expanding open banking solutions through Tink into the United States, having signed several data access agreements, including with Capital One, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, so that their customers may share data with Tink. We've also signed partnerships on the Fintech and merchant side, including Dwolla and MaxRewards.\nAnd across our risk offerings, we continue to bolster them through our technology, innovation, and AI expertise, and are expanding their utility beyond the Visa network. Recently, we announced three such capabilities in our Visa Protect offering. The first is the expansion of our signature solutions, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, for non-Visa card payments, making them network agnostic. This allows issuers to simplify their fraud operations into a single fraud detection solution. The second is the release of Visa Protect for account-to-account payments, our first fraud prevention solution built specifically for real-time payments, including P2P digital wallets, account-to-account transactions, and central bank's instant payment systems. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments.\nWe've been piloting both of these in a number of countries, and our strong results thus far have informed our decision to roll these out globally. The third solution is Visa Deep Authorization. It is a new transaction risk scoring solution tailored specifically to the US market to better manage e-commerce payments powered by a world-class deep learning recurrent neural network model and petabytes of contextual data. We also continue to make our offerings available through third-party platforms.\nWe mentioned ServiceNow last quarter, and we are excited to have recently joined the AWS Partner Network to help seamlessly provide our clients running systems in the cloud access to Visa's solutions, initially starting with Currencycloud, now known as Visa Cross-Border Solutions, and Pismo. We also signed an agreement with Stripe for them to distribute Verifi solutions through a self-service dispute management platform for their merchants.\nAll of these efforts are part of our strategy to build and offer our solutions for both Visa and our network of networks. Before I hand it to Chris, I wanted to note that we have commenced the exchange offer for Visa's Class B1 Common Stock that is set to expire at the end of next week. I also wanted to highlight that this quarter, after nearly 20 years of litigation, we have agreed to a landmark settlement with US merchants, more than 90% of which are small businesses, lowering credit interchange rates and capping those rates into 2030 once approved by the court. The injunctive relief class settlement also provides updates to several key network rules, giving merchants more choice in how they accept digital payments. Last, let me share a few closing thoughts on the quarter and beyond.\nFirst, our Q2 was marked by stable results and strengthened relationships with clients across the globe. Second, as we head into the back half of our fiscal year and beyond, new flows and value-added services remain key areas of focus. We also see significant opportunity in consumer payments by digitizing cash and check, enhancing our capabilities in e-commerce, and building new solutions for our network of networks. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead. Finally, all of this is possible because of the 30,000 Visa employees who come to work every day in service of our clients and partners. I am grateful for everything that you do. Thank you, and now over to Chris.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q2 was a strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, processed transactions, and cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year, and processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth, excluding intra-Europe, was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal Q2 net revenue was up 10% in nominal and constant dollars, which was slightly above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and better-than-expected value-added services revenue that collectively more than offset lower-than-expected currency volatility. GAAP EPS was up 12%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 20% in nominal and 21% in constant dollars.\nSo let's go into the details, starting with total payments volume. Global payments volume growth in Q2 was 8%, consistent with Q1 growth. There are a couple of things I'd like to highlight when comparing Q2 to Q1.\nFirst, the extra day for leap year was a benefit to the quarter. This was offset primarily by slowing payments volume growth in Asia-Pacific, mostly due to macroeconomic weakness in mainland China. When we adjust for Asia and some other smaller factors, we see Q2 global payments volume growth generally in line with the Q1. Now on to the US. US payments volume grew 6% year-over-year, credit grew 6%, and debit grew 6%. Card present spend grew 4%, and card-not-present volume grew 8%.\nReg II had a similar modest impact in Q2, as we saw in Q1. When we normalize for leap year, we see relatively stable US payments volume growth. Consumer spend across all segments, from low to high spend, has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments.\nMoving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe, ex-UK, each growing more than 19% in constant dollars. Normalized for leap year and weakness in mainland China, total international payments volume growth was relatively stable to the Q1. As a reminder, domestic volumes in mainland China drive a very small amount of revenue, and therefore the impact to our financial statements is not significant. Now to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volumes were up a healthy 16% in Q2, generally in line with our expectations. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, was in the mid-teens, stronger than expected.\nCross-border travel volume was up 17%, or 152% indexed to 2019. Consistent with our expectations for the year, we continue to see strong travel volume growth in and out of LAC, Europe, and SEMEA, and out of the US, ranging from 158% to 192% of 2019 levels. The US inbound travel volume has continued to recover within our expectations, up several points from Q1 versus 2019 levels. Asia-Pacific travel volume continues to recover, but the pace has been slower than we anticipated. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 142% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up 8 points from Q1, while travel volume out of Asia was up 2 points to 124% of 2019.\nWe see the primary drivers being: one, macroeconomic weakness in key markets like Australia and mainland China. Two, weakness in some Asia-Pacific currencies, which is impacting consumer purchasing power, particularly for Japan. And three, airline capacity that is still below 2019 levels, particularly the mainland China and North American corridor. Altogether, we're pleased with our total cross-border volume growth, with e-commerce growth generally offsetting the travel weakness in Asia, and this is a great testament to the strength and diversification of our model. Now let's review our Q2 financial results, starting with the revenue components. Both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with their underlying drivers, which resulted in their respective revenue yields remaining relatively consistent to the Q1. Service revenue grew 7% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q1 constant dollar payments volume.\nData processing revenue grew 12% versus the 11% processed transaction growth. International Transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 16% increase in constant-dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. As volatility reached lows that we haven't seen in about four years, the revenue growth was lower than we expected. Other revenue grew 37%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue growth, and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 12%, lower than we expected due to client performance and deal timing.\nAcross our three growth engines, Consumer Payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, processed transactions, and cross-border volume. New Flows revenue improved as expected to 14% year-over-year growth in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions improved to 31% year-over-year growth, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps.\nCommercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q2, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion, primarily driven by issuing and acceptance solutions, and advisory services. GAAP operating expenses increased 29%, driven by increases in the litigation provision, and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 11%, primarily due to increases in G&A, and personnel expenses. FX and Pismo each represented an approximately half-point headwind. Excluding net losses from our equity investments of $30 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $189 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 15.4%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 16% due to the resolution of some non-US tax matters. GAAP EPS was $2.29, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.51, up 20% over last year, inclusive of an almost one-point drag from exchange rates, and an approximately half-point drag from Pismo.\nIn Q2, we bought back approximately $2.7 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of 31 March, we had $23.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in April through 21 April. US payments volume was up 4%, with debit up 4% and credit up 5% year-over-year, down from March primarily due to Easter timing. Processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 15% year-over-year.\nTravel-related cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 15% year-over-year in constant dollars, or 151% indexed to 2019. Cross-border card-not-present ex-travel grew 15% in constant dollars. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail.\nLet's start with the full year. We are reaffirming our prior year guidance for the full year for adjusted net revenue and operating expense growth in the low double digits and EPS growth in the low teens. As for drivers, things are progressing generally as we expected, except for the trends in Asia that we discussed. Accordingly, we are making a small adjustment to our outlook for total payments volume growth to the high single digits from the low double digits. Total cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, is expected to continue to grow strongly in the mid-teens, with the strength in e-commerce generally offsetting weakness in Asia travel. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or no further increase in Reg II impacts.\nCurrency volatility remains low, and we are assuming volatility in Q3 continues at a similar rate to Q2 and adjusts up slightly in Q4. Now on to the Q3 expectations. We expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, generally in line to the adjusted Q2 growth rate. Adjusted operating expenses in Q3 are expected to grow in the low teens, driven primarily by Olympic-related marketing expense due to the strong client engagement that Ryan referenced. Non-operating income is expected to be between $50 million and $60 million, and the tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q3, with the full year unchanged. This puts Q3 adjusted EPS growth in the high end of low double digits.\nFor the Q3, Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to net revenue growth and an approximately one-point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense, and an approximately half-point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. FX for the Q3 is expected to have an approximately one-point drag to net revenue growth, an approximately one and a half-point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth, and an approximately half-point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. In summary, we had another solid quarter in Q2 with relatively stable underlying drivers and strong financial results. We feel good about the momentum in our business as we head into the second half across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.\nWe remain thoughtful with our spending plans as we continue to balance between short and long-term considerations in the context of a changing environment. So now, Jennifer, let's do some Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Chris. With that, we're ready to take questions, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one and clearly record your name. It will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questioners are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to just one question. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. And to withdraw your question, please press star two. Our first caller is Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. Chris, a clarification question. You mentioned Easter was mainly affecting the quarter-to-date trends. Is it fair to assume that the growth rate would be commensurate with the last quarter if you adjusted for that? And then just on a related matter, did the tax refund timings have any impact later in the quarter or in the quarter or into the quarter-to-date trends? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. So April volumes, as I said on the call, through the first three weeks were lower than March, the month of March. This was due to the timing of Easter, which again was in March this year and April of last year. So once you factor that into March and April growth rates, the change between the months, the change in growth rate is not meaningful. As far as tax payments at this point, I don't really have an update. Largely, they've been consistent at this point year-to-date.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Timothy Chiodo with UBS. You may go ahead.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. There were some helpful comments around the e-commerce strength within cross-border offsetting some of the travel weakness.\nWhen we think about the components of overall cross-border, clearly there's the traditional travel, so Card Present and card-not-present. And then there's the traditional e-commerce, right? So retail e-commerce. But there are other faster-growing but smaller portions, whether it be the remittances or marketplace payouts or you gave the Thunes example earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe size them in the aggregate how large some of those other maybe faster-growing portions of cross-border have become as a part of the overall mix.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah, sure. Why don't I start? Yeah. We don't have specifics to break out. As we talked about, the e-commerce business has been strong. It continues to grow above what we expected. The yields across our entire cross-border business are positive and accretive to Visa overall.\nAnd so we're happy with all flavors of cross-border, but I don't have a further breakout for you in terms of the pieces that you were asking about.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Craig Maurer with FT Partners. You may go ahead.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nDirector of Research and Managing Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on US debit trends. April continued the trend of weakening that we've seen that we saw also in March and basically since February. Wanted to know to what degree your guidance for both Q3 and the year embeds continued weakening in US debit. It seemed if we look at the restaurant data released by the likes of Darden that the lower-income portion of the US is significantly reducing spend in certain areas. So curious about commentary there. Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. As we talked about on the call, we see quite stable, relatively stable volumes in the US across credit and debit, normalizing for the things that I talked about. So in addition, as I talked about Reg II, the impact remains stable as well. From our perspective, our data indicates stable volume growth in the US.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on new flows. So a nice recovery there in growth. Can you give a comment on what areas were most pronounced in the underlying growth recovery relative to what you saw last quarter?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Let me talk about Q2 growth.\nThe two pieces of information that we gave you in terms of Q2 growth, we saw commercial volume growth globally, 8%, stable to Q1, and in fact, stable over the last several quarters. We saw very strong growth in Visa Direct transactions, growing 31% for the quarter. New Flows revenue in total growing 14%, which was in line with our expectations that we shared with you at the start of the year. I think the recovery that you're referencing to was because Q1 growth was lower, and that was really due to some lapping issues that were one-time and non-recurring, which we've passed at this point.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Appreciate you taking the question.\nBit of a dual-part question on just some of the prior guidance commentary you made around H1 versus H2 dynamics and some of the drivers of acceleration over the course of the year. I guess specifically, I guess incentives, you talked about a step down in the growth rate from H1 to H2. Is that still your expectation despite that coming in a lot lower in the most recent quarter? Then sort of similar question on the volume growth trends. I guess I hear you on the Asia trends, but I guess overall you had some kind of upbeat commentary on ticket sizes over the course of the year and kind of easing inflation comps since the gas prices might help that as well.\nSo just any commentary on ticket sizes and specifically the negative ticket sizes you've seen in the US, any commentary on kind of what's structural versus kind of more environmental there? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYep. Okay. Let me start first with incentives, the first part of your question. So as you all have seen from quarter-to-quarter, incentive growth can vary based on a number of factors: client performance, deal timing, which is what caused H1 to come in lower than anticipated. For our outlook for the H2 of the year, our expectations remain largely unchanged. We still expect year-over-year growth to be lower in the H2 than in the H1 as we lap the higher incentives that we saw starting in the H2 of last year. And we do expect the Q4 incentive growth rate will be the lowest growth quarter of the year.\nExpectations for H2 unchanged. To your second question on ATS, there's a lot of moving parts in here, and so maybe I'm just going to kind of go through it in detail and unpack bit by bit. Globally, Q2 ATS year-over-year growth was down slightly, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in Q1. Breaking that apart between the US and International, in the US, ticket size growth actually continued to improve from Q1 to Q2, still slightly negative, but the trend improved from Q1 to Q2. Looking ahead in the US, this is something that we've spoken to previously. We do continue to expect ATS will turn positive in the H2 of this year as we lap the lower ticket sizes in the H2 of last year.\nInternationally, outside of Asia-Pacific, let's set that aside for a second, we saw improvement in several regions, including the impact from higher inflation in several markets. So overall, excluding Asia, we still expect ATS to turn positive in the second half based on the expected improvements in the US. With the impact of Asia factored in, Global ATS will be slightly negative, and that was factored into the revised payment volume outlook that I gave for the full year.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. You may go ahead.\n\nMoshe Katri\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. It seems that there was a pretty significant uptick sequentially in growth for Value-Added Services. Is there anything to call out there? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nI mean, I'll talk about the business just for a minute. Moshe, thanks for the question.\nAnd then, Chris, you can add any specific callouts. As I think I said in my prepared remarks, the business is really hitting its strides in a lot of different areas in terms of the product we're bringing to market, the success our sales teams are having around the world. We're really focused on three big areas of trying to drive growth. One is just deepening the penetration of products we have with existing clients.\nThat's, if you think about it, the most near-term opportunity that we have. And we've got metrics client by client all around the world. What are they using? What are they not using? We're arming our sales teams with that. We're building case studies on how we can help them. And we're driving progress in terms of deepening the relationship we have with our existing clients.\nAnd then we're building new products that we're bringing to market. I mentioned a few of those in my prepared remarks today, both in the risk and fraud space as well as in the open banking space. And then driving geographic expansion. I mentioned, I think, just one CyberSource deal in my prepared remarks, but CyberSource has been a great example of a platform where we've been having success growing in markets where we hadn't traditionally been as deep. AP is actually a positive example of that in the CyberSource space. So I don't know. Those are a couple of callouts, Moshe, in terms of kind of how we're just seeing the broader business.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Cris Kennedy with William Blair. You may go ahead.\n\nCris Kennedy\n\nResearch Analyst of Financial Services and Technology, William Blair\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about bringing Tink into the US.\nCan you talk about the open banking opportunity in the US relative to Europe? Thank you.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. So I think Europe is the most developed open banking market in the world. We bought Tink two years ago, believing that it was the best platform in Europe. And I think that's proven true over the couple of years that we've had a chance to own it. On the client side in Europe, we've been making great progress. I think I mentioned a couple of my prepared remarks. We've been winning business and winning share with both Fintechs as well as more traditional banks, merchants, and others, both in the payment side of things and in the account information side of things. I would describe the US market as less developed as Europe.\nAnd so I think it's an opportunity for us to take the learnings that we've had in the much more developed Europe market as well as the success we've had with our clients, the products, the services, the wins, and the losses, and bring all of that to the US market. So we're excited to do that. As I mentioned, I think the US market is still at the very early stages of its development. So I think it's a good time for us to be a competitor in the market. And we're hopeful that over the coming quarters and years, we'll have a chance to share with you a lot of the success that we have in the US market.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nFinancial Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Ryan, I just wanted to ask you a question on the Visa Deep Authorization commentary and kind of that market there. I just want to make sure I understand. Are you viewing this as a means with which to equalize kind of e-commerce across the market for authorization rates so that acquirers need to be partnered with you more specifically, and therefore they're not competing maybe individually on kind of author rates within e-commerce? Or is there something different within this platform? Thank you.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nHey, Dan. Let me back up. I think this is a little different than what you were describing. What we found in the US e-commerce market is that, on the one hand, it's the most developed e-commerce market on the planet. On the other hand, it's become the place of the most sophisticated fraud and attack vectors that we see anywhere in the world.\nAnd so what we are bringing to market with Visa Deep Authorization is an e-commerce transaction risk scoring platform and capability that is specifically tailored and built for the unique sets of attack vectors that we're seeing in the US. So as I was mentioning in my prepared remarks, it's built on deep learning technology that's specifically tuned to some of the sequential and contextual view of accounts that we've had in the US market. And the whole goal is what we do with a lot of our fraud and authorization products. We want to make it a better buyer and seller experience. We want to reduce fraud rates, increase authorization rates, increase shopping conversion for our merchant partners. And we think Visa Deep Authorization is going to be yet another tool that'll help do that.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks so much. It sounded like the Middle East deal activity is in a good place here. I believe Emirates is a takeaway for you. I'm just curious if there's something new going on there from a pipeline perspective. Sounds like maybe some investing. Is this a growth market we should be paying more attention to maybe? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Tien-Tsin. I think what you're seeing is good execution from our sales team, doing what we do when we do it best, which is in with our clients, listening, learning, obsessing about what's important to them, and then bringing them products and value propositions that are helping meet their needs and drive their strategies. And really just kudos to our team on the ground there and the great work that they're doing.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Trevor Williams with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. This one's for Ryan. Just wanted to go back to the merchant settlement in the US. Clearly, you guys aren't directly impacted by lower interchange, but I'm just curious kind of what you're expecting the downstream impact to be on Visa, the relationships between you and your issuing banks, and if you think it in any way kind of changes the competitive dynamics at all within the US credit market. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThanks, Trevor. I think the good news on this front is it brings clarity and stability to the market. This is litigation that's been out there for the better part of 20 years or so. I think there's been a lot of great work that's been done to bring this to a resolution. Just to remind everyone what the main planks of the resolution are, it really is two different sets of things.\nOne is it will reduce interchange for credit cards in the US market for both Visa and Mastercard, and it will have no increases in interchange for the five years of the agreement. Then the second set of things are tools that give merchants more flexibility to how they manage payments, specifically as it relates to surcharging and things like that. I think overall, it's what I said, Trevor, which is clarity and stability that lets everybody who operates in the US market move on and move on continuing to grow the digitization of this great payments ecosystem that we've all collectively built in the United States.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood afternoon. So Ryan, I want to follow up on value-added services, such an important part of your growth story.\nI know you've talked about the five types of services you offer and how your top 250 clients use almost 2x the number of services versus the rest of your client base. Can you give us some sense on how these penetration numbers have evolved over time? And finally, as you kind of think about pricing for these services, to what extent it's a bundle pricing along with core versus kind of a separately priced service? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYou have a great memory. As we've said, our top 265 clients or so use on average about 22 of our Value-Added Services. We don't talk about how that's moved quarter-to-quarter, but the opportunity is enormous just when you think about the number of clients we have around the planet.\nSo as I was mentioning earlier, kind of what we've done is we've armed our frontline teams with kind of client by client, what are they using, what are they not using, what are the opportunities to create value for the client by putting value-added services A, B, C, or D to work for them.\nWe're having great success, and you see that in the numbers. In terms of the pricing, it's different pricing models for different products and different suites of solutions in different places around the world. We're always trying to come up with the right product pricing mix that's going to work best for our products in the market. We have a portfolio of value-added services that span from issuing to acceptance to risk and identity to advisory into open banking. The competitive sets are deep and different in all of those markets.\nSo we're bringing different pricing approaches to each and every market around the world to help meet the best that we can for our clients.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may go ahead.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about one of the consumer payment opportunities that Ryan called out, namely taking share from domestic card networks. How do you drive that? Is it just a question of getting banks to issue more of your cards, or is it more on the acceptance or consumer side? What are the levers that you have to basically speed that up?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. It's really the first of the things that you mentioned. Now, of course, we need to have great acceptance.\nWe need to have great capabilities and all those types of things, which we do in every market we operate around the planet. So then it becomes sitting down with clients, helping them understand the value of, for example, a Visa Debit card versus a card that runs primarily on domestic schemes. And then you get into e-commerce capabilities that Visa Debit is able to provide their clients that maybe they don't get the same type of capabilities from the domestic scheme. You get to cross-border travel opportunities that their customers would have if they were using a Visa card versus one of those domestic schemes that I mentioned. You also get into the risk and fraud prevention capabilities that I mentioned earlier and the ability to have more transactions approved and lower fraud rates, tokenization.\nI mean, all these kind of benefits that you've heard us talk about over and over again, those are what our teams can sit down with the clients and explain to them. Often the clients will do some pilots and some tests. They'll see the results. They'll see higher spend. They'll see higher client satisfaction. And then ultimately, the decision to issue Visa cards to their clients becomes a very clear decision for them.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next caller is Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. You may go ahead.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior Financial Technology and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nHi. I was wondering if you could share some color on how Prosa is doing so far and how you view the opportunity in Mexico as you start to press and productize into the Mexican market. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jamie. We view the Mexican opportunity as a very significant one.\nCoincidentally, I was just down there a couple of weeks ago meeting with clients and meeting with the Prosa team as well. So as I think I explained on one of these calls, today, because we don't process transactions domestically in Mexico, we're not able to deliver a lot of the value-added services that I've mentioned over the course of this call to our clients. And so first and foremost, our clients are very excited about us having the opportunity to have a majority ownership stake in Prosa and then bring these world-class capabilities that we've built to the Mexican market, the things I mentioned earlier, tokenization or the risk scoring algorithms that I mentioned or the e-commerce capabilities that I mentioned, those types of things.\nNow, Prosa itself is a great asset. It's been operating for 50 years in Mexico. It has deep processing experience. It has scale.\nThey do more than 10 billion transactions annually. They have a great base of clients. So it's really the combination of Prosa's experience and deep footprint in the Mexican market combined with our experience, our technology, our track record in bringing a lot of these services to market. The combination of those two things gives us a lot of confidence and our clients a lot of confidence that we can digitize a significant amount of cash, check, and electronic payments that exist today in Mexico.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Schmidt with Citi. You may go ahead.\n\nAndrew Schmidt\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, Ryan. Hey, Chris. Thanks for having me on the call here. I wanted to go back to cross-border for a second. Obviously, a part of the back half growth is the narrowing of the spread between cross-border revs and volumes.\nMaybe you could talk a little bit about how or whether those assumptions have changed at all with FX vols coming down or if there's other puts and takes we should consider there. Thanks a lot.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Sure. Yeah. I spoke at length about volatility. So in Q2, we saw currency volatility at multi-year lows. This one's hard to predict. In Q3, our assumption, what's embedded in the guidance for Q3 is that the currency volatility levels remain at this low level. We do have, again, embedded in our forecast, we do anticipate that Q4 improves slightly. That's generally in line with market expectations. But yeah, that is our view of currency volatility. That said, the underlying health of our business as we enter the second half of the year, we feel really good about across consumer payments, across new flows, across value-added services.\nAnd so volatility is sort of the variable, and we'll have to see how it comes in.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, guys. Can you talk about your H2 expectations for new flows and VAS revenue growth as well as cross-border travel volume growth? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa",
    "content2": "Sure. Let me unpack that a little bit. As you've heard us, we reaffirmed our prior year guide for the full year, adjusted net revenue growth, OpEx, EPS. And within that, I spoke about the fact that volatility is going to cause our currency volatility, treasury revenues in international to be lower than we anticipated in Q3. But again, full year unchanged within that.\nOur expectations for new flows and VAS are consistent with the ones that we shared at the beginning of the year, which we anticipated for the full year. New flows will grow faster than consumer payments with weighted toward faster growth in the second half of the year. We're seeing that with the 14% growth in Q2. We anticipate continuing to see good growth in the second half of the year. Value-added services have grown over 20% in each of the first two quarters. The momentum there is pretty evident.\nThe second part of your question was, I think, around cross-border travel volumes in total. So we did make a little bit of adjustment you heard me talk about based on H1 trends. And so again, this is one with a couple of parts, so let's just go through it in detail.\nFirst of all, we feel really good, feel great about our first half total cross-border performance, 16% growth in Q2 in line with our expectations. Within that, travel was 17 and e-commerce growth mid-teens better than expected. Unpacking travel a bit, we've seen most of our travel volume expectations play out actually as we planned at the beginning of the year, which continues to be strong and healthy in most regions: LAC, Europe, CEMEA, all the ones that I talked about on the call, with Asia being the exception to that, which again continues to improve at the pace of recovery being slower than expected, offset again by strength in the e-commerce cross-border business, which is performing better than we expected.\nSo we expect these trends to continue into the second half, and thus we've moderated our outlook for travel due to AP and upped our expectations on e-commerce. So putting that all together, overall, our view is that total cross-border volumes remain strong, growing in the mid-teens in the second half, which is frankly the better measure in relation to our financial performance given the strong yields across both travel and e-com.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of my questions have been asked. I just wanted to ask about the service yields, though, because they came in a little bit lighter than we were expecting. So can you just talk about what drove that?\nIt looks like the service yield declined year-over-year, but maybe there's some offset with client incentives also coming a little bit lower in the quarter. So any detail there would be helpful. Any thoughts on how to think about the year-over-year change in that yield going forward? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nAs we talked about, both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with the underlying drivers. Service revenue at 7% versus the 8% in constant dollar PV, Q1 constant dollar PV. That's impacted by a number of smaller things, none of which I would call out as a single thing. Data processing revenue grew a little bit above process transactions, 1.12 versus 11, and that was helped aided a little bit by pricing.\nFrom a yield perspective, I think the thing that's important is that our Q2 yields remained consistent, consistent with Q1 and consistent with the average over the last several quarters. And so we're seeing very stable yields across the business, and we're pleased to see that. And even more broadly, our net revenue yield across the whole company remained quite stable.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nGreat. And last question, please, Holly.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital. You may go ahead.\n\nPaul Golding\n\nUS Senior Payments and Lifestyle Analyst, Macquarie Capital\n\nThanks so much. Ryan, you were talking about the addressable opportunity of $20 trillion, of which cash and check was half. I was wondering if you had given any thought to quantifying the ACH versus the domestic network conversion and where you think you are in that opportunity capture for each of those. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks. We're having great success in all three. I give examples.\nSome of our teams are ahead of others in different parts of the world, and domestic schemes are more prevalent in some parts of the world than others. Like I mentioned, Europe is an example. But the opportunity is enormous in all three of these areas, and we've been having really good success in all three of the areas.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWith that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our investor relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day."

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Q1 2024 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements.\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from the results of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q, and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.\nFor non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. With that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHi, everyone. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We are off to a solid start in 2024. Consumer spending remained resilient, with Q1 year-over-year payments volume growth at 8%. US payments volume grew 5% year-over-year. International payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 16% year-over-year in constant dollars, with cross-border travel at 142% of 2019 levels, up from 139% in Q4. Processed transactions rose 9%. Our net revenues increased 9%, with GAAP EPS up 20% and non-GAAP EPS up 11%.\nAs I reflect on the execution of our strategy this quarter across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services, I wanted to highlight a few key themes. One, we remain obsessed about serving our customers, including traditional bank partners, neobanks, fintechs, wallets, sellers, acquirers, and everyone else.\nOur focus on clients has enabled us to deepen our relationships with partners across all three pillars of our strategy. Two, we continue to seek new partnerships, new use cases, and new verticals to drive our business forward, with a particular emphasis on cross-border. Three, we have gone to market with innovative solutions across our network of networks, seeking to add value for all transactions, no matter the network. And four, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to amplify our brand in service of our partners. With those themes in mind, let me provide some more details on the quarter.\nLet's start with consumer payments. We saw continued growth in credentials, acceptance, and engagement. Credentials grew 6%, and we now have more than 8.7 billion network tokens, up 55%. Acceptance locations grew 17%. And let me highlight two recent examples of where we have expanded acceptance.\nThe first was in Brazil with Caixa for cash conversion at their over 10,000 lottery branches. They are now accepting Visa credit and debit cards to pay for utilities, tax collection, lotteries, and voucher payments, which are called boletos. Another example was in Asia Pacific, where we signed an agreement with bKash, the largest mobile financial services player in Bangladesh. Already a client with Visa Direct, they now have enabled Visa's 15 million-plus cardholders in the country to use their in-app QR code to pay at more than 550,000 bKash merchants.\nThese examples demonstrate our local approach to expanding our global acceptance footprint. Tap-to-pay grew 5 percentage points from last year to 77% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. In the US, we reached 45% penetration. One highlight from Q1 is that Lowe's has enabled tap-to-pay acceptance.\nWe believe that tapping provides the best buyer and seller experience in the face-to-face environment, and we have seen that play out in the results. In a recent Visa study in the US, we saw, on average, two more transactions a month and spend lift of $70 a month for those who tap with a Visa debit card versus those who don't tap. Now on to some noteworthy updates from the quarter, which demonstrate our ability to deepen and expand partnerships as well as create new ones. In Europe, we renewed our agreement with Isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 33 million cards for its consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios.\nAs part of that renewal, they will be issuing the first Olympic and Paralympic Games credit card in Europe outside of France, leveraging our sponsorship.\nIn Poland, we signed a new issuing agreement with PKO Bank Polski, the largest issuer and acquirer in Poland and Central/Eastern Europe for consumer and commercial debit. In Greece, we expanded our partnership with Piraeus Bank, the largest bank in the country, to become their exclusive payment network across their consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. These are all fantastic examples of the attractive position and strong pipeline in continental Europe I spoke about last quarter.\nIn Japan, we expanded our credit issuance partnership with Epos, one of the fastest-growing issuers in the country, affiliated with department store Marui. They will use Visa-managed services, which is a part of our advisory solutions where we embed Visa employees within a client's organization to help execute against key initiatives.\nIn Korea, we renewed and expanded our partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in the country, for consumer and commercial credit and debit. Shinhan has also committed to utilizing a suite of Visa's value-added services, including consulting and marketing, to advance their business. In Mexico, we renewed our agreement with BBVA across consumer and commercial credit and debit, along with value-added services, including risk, advisory, and data tools.\nAnd last, in the US, we extended our agreement with Bank of America for multiple value-added services, including Visa's loyalty platform service, CardinalCommerce 3D Secure service, Verify Order Insight digital service, and DPS debit processing. We also continue to be a partner of choice for fintechs around the world. First, in the US, we renewed with leading fintech Chime for their debit and credit builder secured card portfolios, as well as for Visa Direct.\nIn Latin America, we renewed our debit and credit contracts with Rappi, one of the largest fintech and merchant clients in the region, with more than 30 million customers. They will also utilize numerous value-added services, including CyberSource and Decision Manager. And finally, we are excited about a new global partnership with HSBC for their fintech initiative Zing. Starting with the UK, we are supporting the ambition to launch this multi-currency proposition in more than 30 markets.\nVisa's capabilities through Tink, CurrencyCloud, and our consumer payment solutions offer a powerful customer proposition and rapid deployment for Zing and HSBC. Through these renewals and new partnerships, you can see how we are focused on building a deep relationship across all the capabilities Visa offers. Now moving to new flows, we have updated our sizing of the new flows opportunity using the latest market data available.\nExcluding Russia and China, we see $200 trillion of opportunity annually across B2B, B2C, P2P, and G2C, certainly an enormous number. We are working with our clients to deliver Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows on our network of networks. Starting with Visa Direct, total transactions this quarter grew 20% to 2.2 billion, and on the P2P cross-border front, transactions grew more than 65% year-over-year. In terms of client highlights for this quarter, we have been developing partnerships for new use cases and verticals, and we are continuing to drive cross-border volumes.\nFirst, in new use cases, in addition to our existing P2P partnership in the US, we have expanded our Visa Direct relationship with Meta, launching the ability for content creators on Meta's family of apps to cash out their earnings to a debit card.\nThis launch, now live in the US, UK, France, and Italy, allows for creators to receive their payouts quickly and safely. Second, on cross-border volumes, we have continued to make progress in enabling global money movement across our 8.5 billion endpoints in nearly 200 countries and territories. Western Union is a great example. We just signed a long-term global partnership agreement with Western Union covering issuance, Visa Direct, and other services across 40 countries and five regions.\nThis long-term collaboration will bring product innovations and digital-first customer experiences to enhance cross-border money movement. We also expanded our relationship with Remitly to enable customers from 30 countries to send cross-border payments to eligible debit cards and bank accounts in over 100 countries globally.\nIn Canada, we recently announced our agreement with CIBC and Simplii to provide millions of clients the ability to send money to digital wallets in key remittance destinations, including the Philippines, China, and Bangladesh. On to the commercial side, total payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars, and throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on new verticals. Let me highlight a few specific areas. First, in the cross-border travel vertical, we recently expanded our agreement with Singapore-based B2B platform Nium.\nTheir virtual card B2B travel program will expand from the US and Europe into Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Also, in B2B travel, we signed a new virtual card agreement with Worldline, a leading global payments provider for travel intermediaries to pay their suppliers more quickly. In the contractor vertical, we recently signed an agreement with United Overseas Bank and Doxa, a Singapore fintech for contractors.\nIn partnership with Visa, the Doxa platform has further been enhanced to provide embedded financing capabilities. Subcontractors will be given the option to be paid for their services through UOB virtual cards. And also with UOB, we renewed and expanded our commercial relationship across commercial debit and credit, including the enablement of payment flows for the Singapore government. Let me move on to value-added services. Our network of network strategy is also playing a key role in value-added services.\nAs a reminder, this has three components: one, moving money to all endpoints and to all form factors; two, using all available networks and being a single connection point for our partners; and three, providing our value-added services on all transactions, no matter the network. We have continued to develop and expand our value-added services as part of this strategy.\nLet me cover three recent examples: processing capabilities for RTP Networks, Pismo, and Prosa. Last quarter, I noted that Visa is becoming a certified service provider for FedNow, enabling financial institutions to receive funds through the FedNow service. We have now enabled the ability to also send funds. The second example is Pismo, which we just closed last week. As I talk to clients around the world, particularly issuing clients, there are two priorities that are increasingly on the minds of CEOs.\nThe first is, for many of our issuing clients, they've either recently embarked on or are considering embarking on a transformation of their tech stack from their legacy infrastructure to cloud-native API-based tech stacks. The second is that many clients, whether they be traditional issuers or fintechs, are increasingly looking to rapidly expand their issuance to new regions and countries, especially to more developing markets around the world.\nOur clients are looking to Visa to help them with both of these priorities. With Pismo, we will be able to deliver to our clients the best cloud-native issuer processor and core banking platform in the world. Pismo offers global core banking and multi-product issuer processing, covering credit, debit, and commercial, with connectivity to local payment networks such as PIX. Our goal is for Pismo to be the platform of choice for our issuing partners around the world, enabling them to accelerate their global expansion and transition to cloud-native platforms.\nThe third example of our network of networks is our announcement to acquire a majority interest in Prosa, a payments processor in Mexico. A couple of things about the Mexican market: one, cash and check represent more than 50% of personal consumption expenditures. And two, today, Visa has limited ability to process domestically.\nWe believe we can bring enhanced technology infrastructure and lay the groundwork to develop new innovative ways for consumers, small businesses, and local issuers and acquirers in Mexico to pay and be paid. This includes improving safety, security, and reliability, and providing better experiences through our value-added services such as tokenization, risk products, and more. We can also bring our innovation and commitment to continued investment for both face-to-face and online transactions.\nTogether, these efforts will help further digitize payments in the country. The investment is subject to regulatory review, and we hope to close in the second half of calendar year 2024. Finally, I want to highlight the opportunities to drive further growth in value-added services via the development of new partnerships. These enable us to enhance our overall offering and distribution reach.\nYesterday, we announced an agreement with digital workflow leader ServiceNow to build solutions and distribute Visa's products and solutions to joint customers. To start, ServiceNow will launch an end-to-end disputes management solution for issuers, with plans to expand to additional segments and products over time. This partnership showcases the demand for our value-added services and provides a compelling distribution channel to reach more customers around the globe.\nSo, across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services, you can see the enormous opportunity, as well as Visa's strong relationships, commitments to our clients, and innovation in new ways to pay and be paid. What helps to amplify all of these efforts is our brand.\nWe recently renewed our long-standing partnership with FIFA, creating a powerful opportunity to drive business for both Visa and our clients, improve brand lift, and maximize global reach, not to mention providing an opportunity to showcase and implement Visa's innovative payment technology. We are also launching our first new global sports sponsorship in more than 15 years with the Red Bull Formula One Teams. The partnership aligns our brand with two teams within Formula One, which is one of the fastest-growing sports on the planet, providing another opportunity to drive business for our clients.\nAs we look ahead this year, we're excited to be activating our brand with our clients across all of these partnerships, as well as the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris. Before I hand it over to Chris, I wanted to mention that we held our annual meeting on Tuesday.\nAll of the proposals that the board recommended passed, including the exchange offer program proposal. As such, we will be moving promptly to file an S4 with the SEC relating to the initial exchange offer. I also wanted to give a special thanks to my colleague, partner, and friend, Al Kelly, as Tuesday he officially retired as executive chairman. Al, on behalf of the entire Visa family, thank you for your exceptional leadership.\nYou led this business to incredible heights while also driving innovation, deepening our client relationships, and strengthening our culture in so many ways. Your impact on Visa will be visible for generations. In closing, in Q1, Visa once again demonstrated the effective execution of our strategy across the globe.\nWhile uncertainty seems to be the norm, Visa has the experience and discipline to manage through the challenging environments, and I remain optimistic and confident about our future. Now, over to Chris.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q1 was a solid quarter with relatively stable growth in overall payments volume and processed transactions and strong growth in cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year, and processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth, excluding intra-Europe, was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars.\nFiscal Q1 net revenues were up 9% in nominal and constant dollars, which was on the high end of our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and less FX drag. GAAP EPS was up 20%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in nominal and 10% in constant dollars. Now, on to the details, starting with the US. US payment volumes grew 5% year-over-year, credit grew 6%, and debit grew 5%. Card present spend grew 3%, and card not present volume grew 7%.\nAs we look at the monthly total US payments volume growth rates throughout the quarter, we saw a low in October and a peak in November with December in between. Putting it all together, the step down of about 80 basis points in total US payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays compared to last year and a combination of a few small items, including a softer October and modest impact from Reg II. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable.\nOur data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments. Moving to holiday spend, which is the period from 1 November to 31 December, in the US, consumer holiday spend growth was in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis.\nConsumer retail spending growth was similar to last year. However, retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was much stronger. E-commerce increased its share of retail spending versus last year. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars, stable to Q4. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex-UK each growing about 20% in constant dollars.\nNow, on to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel, grew slightly faster than expected in the low teens, adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 19% year-over-year. The cross-border travel volume indexed to 2019 increased from 139% in Q4 to 142% in Q1.\nTravel volume into Asia indexed at 132% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up 3 points from Q4, while travel volume out of Asia was up 4 points to 118%. This was lower than last quarter's expansion, primarily due to relative weakness in Australia and Japan. Travel in and out of mainland China continued to improve, but both remained below 2019 levels. US travel inbound continued to improve several points from Q4 versus 2019 levels.\nWe continued to see healthy travel volumes in and out of LAC, Europe, and CEMEA, and out of the US ranging from 145% to 170% of 2019 levels. Now, let's review our Q1 financial results, starting with the revenue components.\nFirst, as any new pricing usually goes into effect in April and October, this quarter, each of our revenue components benefited as a result, and the growth rates were either further enhanced or offset by the additional factors as follows. Service revenues grew 11% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q4 constant dollar payments volume with some additional help from card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 14% versus 9% processed transaction growth, helped by business mix, and value-added services.\nInternational transaction revenues were up 8% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. Other revenues grew 18% with strong consulting revenue growth, but impacted by lapping 31% growth from 2023, primarily from FIFA-related value-added services revenue. Client incentives grew 20%, but ended up lower than expected due to client performance, and deal timing.\nAcross our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relative stability in payments volume growth and processed transactions, as well as strong growth in cross-border volume. This quarter, in new flows, the underlying drivers remained relatively stable. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars, and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. Total new flows revenue grew in the low single digits year-over-year in constant dollars due to several one-time items, and business mix impact.\nAs you know, for any given period, there can be puts and takes, but most importantly, drivers were stable, and we continue to expect full year 2024 new flows revenue to grow faster than consumer payments revenue. In Q1, value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion, with strength in issuing and acceptance solutions. GAAP operating expenses declined 6%.\nThe decrease in expenses was driven by a decrease in the litigation provision, somewhat offset by an increase in personnel expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 7%, primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $4 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $84 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 19.1%, and our non-GAAP was 19%, helped by larger-than-expected tax benefits. GAAP EPS was $2.39. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, up 11% over last year, inclusive of an approximately half-point benefit from exchange rates.\nIn Q1, we bought back approximately $3.4 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $26.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in through 21 January.\nUS Payments volume was up 4%, with debit up 3%, and credit up 4% year-over-year, down from December, largely due to severe weather conditions in parts of the US. Processed transactions grew 8% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 16% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 16% year-over-year, or 146% indexed to 2019. Cross-border card not present ex-travel grew 16%. Now, on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollar and excluding acquisition impacts.\nYou can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the full year, we have no material changes to our prior outlook for drivers, adjusted net revenues, or EPS growth. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or a further increase in Reg II impacts.\nPismo is expected to have minimal benefit to full year net revenues growth and an approximately half-point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense, and EPS growth. FX is expected to have an approximately half-point drag to net revenues growth, an approximately one-point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth, and a minimal drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. GAAP and non-GAAP non-operating income is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, with nearly half in Q2 due to the resolution of some non-US tax matters. Putting it all together, adjusted net revenues growth is unchanged at low double digits.\nAdjusted operating expense growth is updated to low double digits, and adjusted EPS growth is unchanged at low teens. For the Q2, similar to the full year, Pismo is expected to have a minimal benefit to net revenues growth and an approximately half-point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense, and EPS growth.\nFX is expected to have minimal drag to net revenues growth and an approximately half-point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and minimal benefit to non-GAAP EPS growth. We expect adjusted net revenues growth in the upper mid to high single digits and adjusted operating expense growth in the low double digits north of 10%. Non-operating income is expected to be highest in Q2 due to the resolution of some tax matters, as I noted earlier. As such, the tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 16.5% in Q2, with the full year unchanged. This puts Q2 adjusted EPS growth in the high teens.\nIn summary, we're off to a solid start in the Q1 The fundamental drivers remain relatively stable, and with no material changes to our full year guidance, we remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2024.\nAs always, if the environment changes and there's an event that impacts our business, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans. We remain thoughtful on balancing between short and long-term considerations. And now, Jennifer, let's go to Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Chris. With that, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star one and clearly record your name. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questioners are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks so much. Just want a clarification on a bigger question here. Just on the clarifications, the new flows up low single digits versus mid-teens last quarter, did that, how did that come in versus plan? Were there some one-time issues? Because it sounds like the other metrics were in line. And then my question was just on US volume running in the mid-single digits here. It's pretty tight to PCE. I know there are a lot of factors like gas and e-com and Reg II, but just can you clarify your view on US volume here in relation to PCE growth in the short to midterm? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHey, Tien-tsin. It's Ryan. Why don't I start on the second part of your question, and then Chris can answer the first part and add a correction to the second part. I think it's, back way up for a second, in the US. US remains a significant opportunity for us in consumer payments. I mean, there's still a lot of cash, a lot of checks, a lot of ACH. We're having great work with fintechs and banks to bring more people in on the carded front. We're doing work to expand acceptance.\nThe service industry, whether it's plumbers or contractors, charities, vending, parking, tap-to-pay. I mean, we continue to be very, very excited about the US market. I think, as you said, and Chris can add some detail, in the quarter, there's some Visa-specific factors on the growth rate in the US.\nAs it relates to PCE, like you were talking about. But as we look forward, it continues to be a big opportunity for us. We continue to be excited about it. Chris, you want to take the first part of Tien-tsin's question and add anything on the second?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nSure. Yeah. In new flows, so the underlying fundamentals of our commercial business remain sound. Commercial payment volumes grew 8%, and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. And importantly, the new flows business continues to be a growth engine for Visa. We do expect the full year revenue growth to exceed consumer revenue growth. Now, specific to your question around Q1, it was impacted by a couple of factors. First, the mix of business, with cross-border volume growth slowing in Q1 as travel continued to normalize.\nAnd second, the growth was also impacted by a few one-time items that happened to be larger than we might typically see in any given quarter. But all in all, we feel great about the business and the long-term growth trajectory ahead.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nCool. No, that's helpful. Thank you both.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Hey, I just wanted to ask a question around the new partnerships within value-added services. Ryan, it sounds like as part of the priorities, you want to get value-added services on all the networks. I think you were alluding to the fact that this is going to be maybe a bigger shared responsibility with this partnership growth. ServiceNow is obviously a great example. But I'm just trying to reconcile kind of how we should be thinking about Visa maybe opening up those opportunities with all these new partnerships and what that may do at some point to the financial picture of the company. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Again, if I back up before I answer the specific question about ServiceNow and partners, we're very excited about the progress that we've made on our value-added services strategy. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing kind of in the market. We're excited to see our sales efforts really driving success and performance across issuing, acceptance, risk and identity, advisory, and open banking. And it's exactly as you were saying with partners like ServiceNow.\nWhat we're finding is we can have great efforts selling to our partners directly around the world, but we're also getting a lot of demand from various different platforms that already have relationships with thousands or tens of thousands or, in some cases, more customers in any one country or region.\nThey're very excited to sell through our value-added services as a way of differentiating their platform and deepening relationships with their users and their customers. So in the example of ServiceNow, they had been talking to their bank clients, and their bank clients had asked for and been interested in some of the dispute services that we provide. So we're going to market first, as I said in my prepared remarks, with our dispute services via ServiceNow.\nWe've got a pipeline of other products and services that we're working with them on. We're deep in discussions with other platforms around the world about bringing our money movement solutions and our value-added services solutions as a way to differentiate their platform and add value to their users.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Your line is open.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nCraig, are you there?\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nYes. Sorry. Can you hear me?\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWe sure can.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nOkay. Great. I wanted to ask if you can be a little bit more detailed in the comments around Reg II and how you're seeing volume move, perhaps off your network. And second, if you can just add some detail around the one-time items that impacted Visa in the US in the quarter, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nLet me talk a little bit about the business aspect of Reg II. Then, Chris, you can hit both of those specific questions, the Reg II and the one-time items. I think it's important at this point to just observe we're six months in now since Reg II in the US. We've had a chance to really engage with our clients and partners on the merchant side of what we do. We're having really good discussions, really good dialogues.\nIt's been a great opportunity for us to highlight our products, our services, and especially the various different things that differentiate a Visa debit transaction from other alternatives. To be honest, we're getting a chance to have conversations at more senior levels in the organization about the details of our products than we've ever had before, which is great.\nAnd so far, we're having great success. The sales conversations have been positive. The results, client by client that we're finding, as we're able to talk to them about the features and benefits of Visa Direct, are great so far and feel really good about our results six months into this so far. So, Chris, you want to hit the two pieces specifically?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Will do. Yes, on Reg II. As we indicated, we did see some modest impact in the US payment volume growth in the US was down about 80 basis points from Q4 to Q1. That slowdown was primarily due to a couple of things. One is the mix of spend days. But also, there were a few smaller things, a softer October, and the modest impact from Reg II that we're talking about. A couple of things. It's important to note we've actually not seen any meaningful changes to volumes being routed away since October.\nAll in all, the impact is modest, really hasn't changed over the past quarter. That's actually what we have assumed in the outlook that we shared for the rest of the year.\nNow, to your second part of your question about one-time items, I talked a little bit about the things in the US, Reg II, and the slow October. The other place where I talked about one-time items was in the new flows business. As I said, the revenue growth was impacted by a couple of things. One, I talked about the cross-border normalization on travel. And then secondly, there were these one-time items. And I'll give you an example of one. In the normal course of our business, we regularly true up or true down our incentive and rebates with our clients based on their reported metrics.\nAnd in Q1, the net impact of these adjustments ended up being larger than we might typically see in a quarter. But all in all, it's not something that gives us concern. The underlying business fundamentals remain healthy.\nIt doesn't change our expectations for the full year growth. For new flows revenue, which will continue to outpace consumer revenue.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThanks. Good evening. I guess just a question on the slower volumes year-to-date on the severe weather. I'm just curious if there's been any softness beyond that. And then maybe, do you expect that spending to sort of re-accelerate because the weather's gotten better? Or maybe you can just speak about that a little bit. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, we did see that growth slow down the first week of January. We've looked really closely at it. It's directly correlated to the extreme cold weather that's hit many parts of the US. I'll give you a few examples. For anyone in Kansas City, they know this. We went from 45 degrees Fahrenheit in the last week of December to negative 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the first few weeks of January. So no one was out and about. We saw growth in Kansas City go from mid-single digits growing to declining mid-single digits.\nTo take another example, in San Diego, those that are lucky enough to be there, 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and we've seen stable mid-single digit volume growth into January. Maybe a third example that highlights the swings that we saw.\nIn Dallas, it was nearly 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the first two weeks of January and then dropped to below 20 degrees Fahrenheit in the third week. We saw the exact same pattern following with our card-present volumes in that third week. So to the second part of your question, the good news is we've seen these type of weather-related patterns before. They tend to be short blips. Over the course of the quarter, tend to get smoothed back out.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the EPS growth outlook. It looks like you're guiding to high teens EPS growth in fiscal Q2, which I think implies a mid-single digit decline in the share count quarter over quarter. But I'm just trying to figure out why that doesn't flow through to the full year EPS growth figure where you're guiding into low teens growth. So if you can help us reconcile that, that'd be great. Maybe there's some tax and OPEX impacts in the back half of the year that we're not accounting for. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Yeah. It is specific to Q2. I think I mentioned on the call, there were some tax matters that were resolved outside of the US that brought our tax rate down in Q2 into the 16% range. That same matter also had some benefit that hit the NOI line, which also then helps the high teens growth rate on EPS in Q2 specifically. For the full year, it doesn't change the tax rate. It doesn't change our prior outlook for EPS growth.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood afternoon. I want to follow up on services. Given how increasingly important these are to your revenue growth, can you give us some insights, quantification on the composition of your value-added services and DPS, CyberSource, risk, et cetera.? And maybe also expand upon the growth drivers here with regards to attach rates, processing penetration, geo-expansion. They're growing almost 2x faster than your card volumes, overall services. So we are trying to understand the growth drivers here. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thank you. It is, as I was saying earlier, I think the strategy is really firing on all cylinders. Our execution is firing on all cylinders. The client demand remains strong. The TAMs are large, as you were saying. Last year, we generated about $7 billion in revenue in the value-added services business. I think we said in the quarter it was a little more than $2 billion and up 20% in constant dollars.\nThose are great results. To get in a little bit into the details of your question, I mean, we run these businesses segment by segment. In issuing solutions, we're having great success with our network products around the world. DPS continues to have great success with clients in the US. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had renewed with Bank of America.\nThat's one of our, as you might expect, largest clients in DPS, a fantastic partner, as well as a number of the other value-added services I mentioned. In the acceptance solutions business, CyberSource continues to have great success around the world, both with their omnichannel services as well as some of the value-added services they have, like token management service and the like. Our disputes business, beyond just what I mentioned earlier around ServiceNow, is having great success. Verify is really firing on all cylinders, especially as it expands outside the US.\nOur risk and identity solutions business is really proving to be very resilient and high growth, both our Advanced Authorization platform, Visa Risk Manager, Visa Secure, all the various different products that we've been bringing to market. And then our advisory services continue to do well.\nI mentioned in a few of the client wins in my prepared remarks the success we've had with our managed services platforms where we're embedding teams of Visa employees in our clients, working shoulder to shoulder with our client partners day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, helping them drive their business forward. I mean, that drives revenue growth, that diversifies our revenue.\nBut more importantly than any of that, that embeds us in the building with our clients, helping them grow their businesses, makes our core business even more sticky. So yeah, it's execution, it's product pipeline, it's delivery. We feel really good about the results. Thanks for the question.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Just wanted to get a couple of clarifications. I think last quarter, Chris, you talked about growth would be at a low point in Q1. Then you would see it kind of you'd see that trough accelerate going forward. Just the nuance of the guide is mid- to high-single digits. So just trying to make sure if there was anything else new to report on Q2 versus Q1 being the trough. And then secondly, just a slightly higher operating expense and constant currency from, I think it was high single to low double, just said low double now. Was there anything to factor in for that? Thank you.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYep. Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. So just backing up to your point, going into Q1, you outlined the guidance that I gave. We set an expectation at that time, similar language, high to mid-single digits to high, sorry, mid-high to high single digits. And we did come in at the high end of that range, which was, again, largely benefiting from timing of incentive performance. We have a similar expectation in terms of the range of growth in Q2.\nBut many of the variables that I talked about in terms of H1 versus H2 a quarter ago, which was lapping high volatility, lapping high cross-border performance from a year ago, and lapping lower incentive growth from a year ago. Those we continue to believe hold true. And we do anticipate that growth will accelerate into the second half of the year.\nIn terms of your question on OpEx, yeah, the changes that you picked up on in terms of the full year guide primarily have to do with two things. One is we're now including the impact of the acquisition of Pismo into the guide for OpEx. There's been some slight updates based on the current FX rate.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nManaging Director, Truist Securities\n\nThanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Ryan, I wanted to dig in a little bit on impressive 17% merchant acceptance growth. It sounds like that really highlights the possibility or the opportunity for continued volume growth, even in markets maybe where the secular growth rate is slowing a little bit. Is that sustainable? Should we continue to think about that kind of mid-teens acceptance growth as being a key driver of overall volume expansion?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nListen, when I'm talking to our sales teams around the world, I'm pushing them for as much as possible and more. I mean, if you travel around the world, there are still hundreds of millions of small businesses that aren't on our network. And then you add to that, Andrew, you add to that kind of the creator economy and what's happening there, you literally can think about the acceptance opportunity in billions.\nSo our sales teams around the world are out there working hard, getting creative, figuring out different ways around the world that we can serve those 100-plus million small and micro businesses and ultimately one, two, three-plus billion individuals around the world that all ultimately could become acceptors of our products as you think about things like Tap to Phone rolling out at scale.\nI mean, you can imagine a world where every handheld device becomes a Tap acceptor and every device is a Tap to Pay opportunity where we can not only penetrate further into the C2B space, but the P2P space, and others. So we felt really good, as you were alluding to, for the last, I think it's the last several quarters, we've been 17%, 18%, 19% growth in acceptance locations.\nI tried to, in my prepared remarks, just to give you a little bit of color, the types of things that we're out there doing with players like bKash and Caixa. And we'll be pushing hard to continue to light up all those other opportunities in emerging markets and developed markets around the world.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I wanted to touch on the cross-border travel volume growth. Looks like it slowed from roughly 25% to maybe 16% to 17% in January. Back when you were kind of outlining your assumptions for fiscal 2024, you thought it would be in the low 20%. We see 4 to 5 percentage points improvement compared to 2019. Just wondering how we should think about that as an assumption going forward.\nDo you think we'll bounce back to that low 20s%, or do you think something closer to where you've seen in January makes more sense? I know this is an area that sometimes you have at least some forward visibility. So trying to get a sense of where we should be thinking about that component.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYep. Great. Thanks, James. We had a really good quarter in Q1 to start the year on our cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you said, was up 16%. We feel great about that. And as you click into those, e-com growth in the low teens and 19% growth on travel with the index going from 139 to 142. And I'll just clarify one thing you said in terms of the guidance that we had provided into the low 20s, that was related to the travel portion of that, which came in at 19% or almost 20%.\nI do think when understanding the composition by region of our performance, and some of this is a little repetitious, but I think important to go through, looking at it region by region is helpful. In LAC, CEMEA, Europe, and US outbound, strong results, indexing between 145 to 170 relative to the 2019 levels.\nSecond, US inbound, which up until Q4 had lagged 2019, also continued to improve in Q1 and in line with our expectations. In AP, we did see continued expansion in and out of AP, but a little bit slower than we saw in Q4. That was specific to Australia and Japan. It's probably also worth mentioning, well, not necessarily a large number. The war in the Middle East did have some impact on the cross-border numbers as well.\nBut again, stepping back, we feel really good about our cross-border business in total. The Q1 results were strong, 16% growth, healthy growth for both travel and e-com. We feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, Ryan. Chris, Jen, how are you? Yeah. Just want to drill down into sort of expectations or implied expectations for second half of fiscal 2024, given Q1 results upper single digits, Q2 expectations, rev growth mid to high single digits. So there's an acceleration that's implied. And the question is, what drives it?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks. I'm going to break that down into two questions because one, you said, how do we feel about the revenue guide? And then I think the second question implied there was on drivers. And so let me talk to those because they are a little bit different. And maybe I'll even start with the second part first, which is with drivers. We're one quarter into the fiscal year. It was a solid quarter, stable trends from Q4. And importantly, the consumer has remained resilient.\nAs we look into the rest of the year, we do anticipate drivers to continue to tick up slightly in the second half of the year for two reasons. One, average ticket sizes should improve, in particular as we lap lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year in the US and we see continued inflation in certain international regions.\nAnd second, we're continuing to execute against our growth initiatives in our global markets, for example, the processing wins that we've seen in LAC that we've shared progress about previously. So that's sort of the underlying drivers. And then your first question actually was on revenue. We had a solid start to the year, a really good Q1, stable Q4 trends. Today, we've reaffirmed our full year guide on net revenue in constant dollars. And that includes the modest impact of Reg II that we talked about. So we feel good about Q1. We feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year. And we'll continue to focus on execution.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nManaging Director and Lead Analyst, UBS",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into Pismo a little bit. The website talks about large banks, marketplaces, and fintechs. And you mentioned earlier the movement away from the legacy systems into more modern cores. I wanted to talk a little bit about the ambitions and the potential in terms of the bank sizing. And also, if these core conversions, are they for new product and sort of sidecar cores, if you will, or are we talking about the potential for your core kind of issuing clients in the US, mid-sized banks, to be moving their legacy core potentially over to something offered by Pismo in the future?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nSo let me step back and talk a bit about how we found Pismo and then answer your question directly, Timothy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks these narratives and these priorities that we've been hearing from CEOs of banks all over the world, in the US, all over the world, medium-sized, big-sized banks, which is, one, they're trying to make this transition from their legacy tech stacks to the cloud. And the second is they want to expand, especially in emerging markets where they don't have enough options of issuer processors to help them.\nThat led us, hearing that over and over and over again, led us to go search the world for what we thought was the best cloud-based processor and core bank provider that we could find. And that led us to Pismo. And so while Pismo is based down in Brazil, their platform is global.\nTheir clients today are a mix of some of the biggest and most sophisticated banks in the world, as well as medium-sized banks and fintechs. So they already today have a mix of different client types. And our ambitions are what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we want this to be the preferred provider of banks around the world. You asked specifically about mid-sized banks in the US for their core banking platform. The short answer is absolutely.\nAs you think about large banks and their issuer processing capabilities, not just for debit, which we have today in the US, but for debit, credit, prepaid, commercial, not just in the US, but globally, we think Pismo is absolutely a solution that our issuers could be using around the world. So yeah, it is a global platform. We have global ambitions.\nGiven the relationships that we have, the privileged relationships that we have with banks big and small in the US and around the world, we feel good about our ability to distribute the product to them.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nLast question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Just wanted to ask if we're still comfortable with low double-digit processed volume and transaction growth for this year. I know both of those started off kind of in the high single-digit range, ticked down a little bit in January. Also, any change in your thoughts around fiscal 2024 incentive guidance? I think we were looking for modestly less dollar growth than in fiscal 2023, but you did a little better than expected in Q1. Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jason. I think I answered some of the driver questions, but I'll just recap very quickly at a summary level. We're reaffirming the outlook for the full year on drivers, second half benefiting from average ticket sizes in the US and inflation in certain international regions, and continuing to execute against a number of our growth initiatives in global markets. Processing wins in LAC is the example that I used a minute ago. And so yes to your first question about reaffirming the guide on drivers. And then, sorry, repeat your second question for me?\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nJust on the incentive guide.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYes. Yes, yes, yes. On incentive, yes. Also, no change in outlook for the full year. As you know, we manage the business and the net revenue growth. That's where we're focused. We've updated our guidance for the full year and Q2 on that. And we'll continue to, like I said, focus on execution.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nAnd with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our investor relations team. Thanks again and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Q4 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors.\nAdditional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. With that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic loss of life and suffering in Israel and Gaza. We are in constant contact with our teams in Israel and throughout the region, and I have the deepest admiration for their commitment to each other and their clients during this exceptionally challenging time. We continue to monitor the situation, prioritize the safety of our people, and stay close to our clients to ensure the continuity of business operations. Turning now to our results. At the beginning of 2023, there was a lot of uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment with fears of a recession. There were many unknowns around FX, volatility, interest rates, and inflation.\nThere was also some noise in our growth rates in early 2023 due to the effects of Omicron and the suspension of operations in Russia. Against that backdrop, Visa delivered. Total full fiscal year net revenues grew 11%, with GAAP EPS up 18% and non-GAAP EPS up 17%. Credentials grew 7%. We also surpassed 7.5 billion tokens. Total transactions, including cash and payment transactions, were 276 billion, which means that Visa credentials were used on average 757 million times a day during the fiscal year. We signed over 500 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally, from early-stage companies to growing and mature players, up 25% versus last year. Merchant locations were up 17%, helped by strong growth in Latin America and CEMEA. Global tap-to-pay penetration, excluding the US, grew 5 points from last year to 76% of total face-to-face transactions.\nIn the US, penetration expanded 13 points to surpass 40%. Global tap-to-ride transactions were 1.6 billion for the full year 2023, up over 30%, and we added nearly 150 new transit systems throughout the year, such as in Philadelphia and Bangkok, bringing the footprint to more than 750 systems. More than 40% of our transit system launches this year also included our value-added services acceptance solutions. On the new flow side, total revenue grew 17% in constant dollars for the full year. I'll note a few highlights. Total commercial volume was $1.57 trillion, up 12% in constant dollars. We have increased the number of banks that have signed on to Visa B2B Connect by more than 70% this year, and activation continues to happen, with the number of transacting banks more than doubling.\nVisa Direct had 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% year over year and nearly 30%, excluding Russia, across 65+ use cases and over 2,800 programs, helped by more than 500 enablers. Cross-border P2P transactions grew 65% year-over-year and reached a new record for payments volume in Q4. Value-added services revenue grew 18% for the full year in constant dollars. Across our hundreds of products, our top 265 largest clients used 22 products on average, up 8% from last year, versus our overall clients who used 11 products on average. With all of this strong momentum and performance, we finished Q4 with net revenue growth of 11% and GAAP EPS growth of 22%.\nOther highlights from Q4 include the following in constant dollars: global payments volume grew 9%, US payments volume grew 6%, international payments volume grew 11%, cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 18%, with cross-border travel up 26% year-over-year, and processed transactions were up 10%. Across all our growth levers, we continued to drive progress and innovation and money movement. As I mentioned last quarter, when asked why Visa, our clients tell us they are choosing to deepen and expand their partnerships with us for a number of reasons, including our people, our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities, and our brand. We continued to see that play out in our Q1.\nI'll walk through each one and highlight some examples. First, our people. We have the best team in the business, and our clients tell us that they deeply value the advice, local support, and partnership from our outstanding teams who are laser focused on helping our clients grow their businesses. Our clients also appreciate our thoughtful leadership on important and complex industry issues across the ecosystem. An example this quarter was with US Bank, one of the largest issuers in the United States. They have renewed our long-term agreement for their consumer and commercial portfolios. In addition, we are engaging on consulting services and co-marketing projects that include leveraging our NFL sponsorship. Also in the US, we are very pleased to have renewed our long-standing relationship with top 20 US issuer FNBO across consumer, commercial, and value-added services.\nIn Brazil, credit unions or cooperatives are fast growing, and we recently reached an expanded relationship with Sicoob, whose system spans nearly 340 cooperatives and 7.5 million members. In addition to our people, our payment products and innovations consistently help us win. We are constantly driving innovation and delivering next-generation payment solutions and experiences that enable our clients to better serve their customers and grow their businesses. In terms of our capabilities to serve fintechs, in Colombia, we expanded our partnership with Nequi, the first digital wallet in the country, to enable their 17 million-plus account holders for tap-to-pay with digital credentials. We also provide targeted offerings for certain customers. In India, we are focused on delivering market-leading offerings for affluent customers. With that in mind, we have signed with fintech epiFi, for a consumer credit offering for high-net-worth and mass affluent customers.\nWe also recently expanded our acceptance with fintech, Razorpay to enable Visa debit cards to purchase mutual funds and securities, offering greater convenience to customers with higher payment success rates versus traditional methods. In the e-commerce seller space, we renewed our agreement with Shopify for the Balance card, allowing Shopify's US sellers to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cash back on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing. We also signed a new issuing agreement for small business credit. Next, our value-added services are helping us win. They help our clients innovate and grow, provide risk management solutions, and drive better outcomes for them and in turn for Visa.\nOur acceptance solutions, including CyberSource, have really resonated with clients this year. We sold more than 2,600 new acceptance services in over 100 countries. In North America, Costco has chosen Visa acceptance solutions, including CyberSource, for all of their US and Canadian e-commerce transactions. Alaska Airlines has selected CyberSource to process their kiosk payments in support of their initiative to transform the airport lobby experience.\nIn Asia Pacific, China Merchants Bank, the largest issuer in mainland China, has renewed its consumer and small business portfolios. In addition to our flagship risk management services, Visa Advanced Authorization, and Visa Risk Manager, they will also expand their use of consulting services. Bank of China and AEON Financial Service in Japan have also signed on to use VAA and VRM. In Latin America, we have been focused on expanding our processing penetration as it allows us to offer more value-added services to our customers. In Colombia, we have recently expanded our processing penetration through the addition of four more banks under our strategic agreement with Credibanco, the market's largest acquirer and issuer processor. This positions us to reach nearly 80% of domestic transactions by the end of FY24, from essentially zero in 2019.\nAs part of these agreements, banks have added anywhere from four to 11 value-added services, including risk and acceptance services. As part of our network of network strategy, we continue to both collaborate with and offer our solutions in the real-time payment space, most recently with FedNow. In Q4, Visa became a certified service provider for FedNow. Using our service, Visa Financial Institution clients can receive funds in real time through the FedNow service, with origination capabilities to follow. This means that Visa is now processing FedNow payments with The Clearing House RTP to follow in the next few months. Now on to our new flows capabilities, which are increasingly an important differentiator to our clients.\nOn the B2B side, we are pleased to have reached an expanded long-term global agreement across more than 60 countries with Citibank for their commercial card business, which also encompasses over 20 value-added services. We also recently won the IBM commercial card business, spanning T&E meeting and purchasing card programs in over 60 countries, also with Citibank as the issuer. In Singapore, we renewed our long-standing partnership with DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, to continue offering commercial debit and credit services for consumers, and expanded into new commercial products for small businesses. On the Visa Direct side, we continue to expand Visa Direct's reach, especially to wallet endpoints. Most recently, we signed an agreement with Tencent for the Visa Direct cross-border remittance business. This will bring the total wallet reach for Visa Direct to over 2.5 billion.\nWe have expanded our partnership with Paysend from US and UK payments to enable all of Paysend's customers across the globe to send money in real time to eligible Visa cards across 170 countries and territories. PaySend is also a Currencycloud customer offering compelling cross-border solutions. We also recently renewed with the largest issuer in Korea, Shinhan Card, for consumer and business credit, which also incorporates the provision of our data capabilities in value-added services and the enablement of Visa Direct for cross-border remittances.\nWe have also continued to add new Visa Direct use cases with our partners, such as with small ticket B2B payments and bill pay. In Brazil, Banco Arbi will enable Visa Direct for low-value, high-velocity cross-border payments as part of their corporate banking business. In the US, payment platform Everyware will be enabling bill payments with Visa Direct. And last, but certainly not least, our brand. Visa's brand strength helps deliver added value to our clients and their customers, financial institutions, merchants, and partners through a wide range of products and services, as well as innovative brand and marketing efforts.\nWe are pleased to have signed an agreement with Universal Destinations & Experiences to be the exclusive payment network for their new co-branded credit card that will be issued by FNBO. In addition, Visa is now the official way to pay at Universal Destinations & Experiences, and together, we will provide compelling benefits to Visa cardholders across their Orlando and Hollywood properties. Also in the US, we have recently renewed the Fidelity Investments co-brand credit portfolio issued by US Bank. We signed with Coupang, a large retailer with 20 million customers in Korea, for their inaugural co-brand card. In CEMEA, we have signed a Saudia Airlines co-brand with Riyadh Bank, and we renewed our co-brand partnership with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airways.\nAs we look ahead, we're excited to be activating our brand with clients and partners at the Paris 2024 and Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Since 1986, Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic movement, which provides an unparalleled opportunity to promote the Visa brand at a regional and global level while also facilitating partnerships and joint business initiatives with clients. The games provide a unique platform for showcasing product innovation and engaging consumers and clients with exclusive experiences. We are looking forward to the upcoming games, and we have been building momentum in the business across Europe with a particular focus on the continent. I'll share a few recent highlights for our European business.\nOn the people front, payments is a local business, and we have expanded into seven new locations over the past five years and have more than doubled our workforce in the market. On innovative products, we have well over 100 fintech relationships and have expanded our capabilities through the acquisitions of Tink and Currencycloud. In new flows, Visa Direct has more than 100 enablers and over 1,000 programs, with transactions more than doubling over the past two years. In value-added services, we have increased our client penetration. In VAA alone, the number of clients enrolled in the service has more than doubled since three years ago, and we will be introducing nearly 20 additional products in 2024. We have been steadily building an attractive position on the continent and have built a strong pipeline of signed deals for the future by competing uniquely in each market.\nActive cards across continental Europe have grown nearly 50% since 2019. Over the next few years, we expect to migrate more than 40 million cards across nearly 40 clients. The nature of the portfolios we are winning in continental Europe tend to include more cross-border volume, resulting in higher yields. Our brand, our capabilities, our people, all of these make a difference for Visa's clients. 2023 had many milestones and solid financial performance. As we are now three weeks into our new fiscal year, I would like to make a few general points, and then Chris will go into more detail. One, there is still macro uncertainty, but just like in fiscal year 2023, I am confident that we can manage through it. Our strategy and focus remain the same, propelling growth across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.\nTwo, we are focused on delivering for our stockholders. In that light, I am sure that you saw that we released an 8-K back in September regarding our potential exchange offer program. We appreciate the dialogue we've had with Class A, B, and C stockholders, and the board is evaluating next steps as we continue to engage with investors. Finally, you may have seen today that we announced a $25 billion multi-year share repurchase program, which reflects our board's confidence in our strategy and future potential. I continue to see tremendous opportunity ahead. Visa has the brand, the capabilities, the strategy, and most importantly, the people to propel our growth for years to come. With that, let me hand it over to Chris.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q4 was another good quarter, closing out a strong fiscal 2023 driven by healthy growth in payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions, and continued solid execution of our strategy with new flows and value-added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. I'll first start with a high-level summary of our Q4 performance and then click into more details. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year-over-year, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year, both stable to Q3. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe growth, was strong, up 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal Q4 net revenues were up 11% and 10% in constant dollars, with minimal impact from FX in line with our expectations.\nGAAP EPS was up 22%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 21% in both nominal and constant dollars. Now on to the details, starting with the US, payments volume was up 6% year-over-year, stable to Q3. Credit volume grew 6% year-over-year, and debit volume grew 7%. Card present spend grew 3%, and US card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%. US processed transactions growth was stable at 8%. Over the course of the quarter, we saw payments volume growth tick up from July to September, primarily driven by sequential improvement in ticket size growth that was mostly led by fuel, with higher gas prices and easier year-over-year comparisons, as well as a positive days mix impact. Consumer spend across all segments, from high to low spend, has remained stable since March.\nOur data did not indicate any behavior change across consumer segments. In international markets, total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong through the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex-UK growing about 20% or more in constant dollars. Now to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars, excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 18% and up 152% versus 2019. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and 173% versus 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, cross-border e-commerce spending grew year-over-year in the low double digits, in line with pre-COVID growth rates and consistent with the trends we have seen for most of the fiscal year. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 26% year-over-year.\nThe cross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in June to 143% in September, totaling 141% for the quarter, a 5-point improvement from Q3. We continued to see healthy travel volume levels in and out of LAC, Europe, and CEMEA, ranging from 145% to 165% of 2019 levels. Travel volume into Asia continued to improve, indexing at 128% to 2019 levels for the quarter, up 10 points from Q3, while travel volume out of Asia was up 7 points to 114%. Looking at mainland China specifically, cross-border travel volume continued to improve but remained below 2019 levels. Travel volume outbound from the US to all geographies continued to be strong, in the mid-150s, indexed to 2019. US inbound travel recovery accelerated this quarter, pushing the index above 2019 levels for the first time, even as the dollar continued to remain strong relative to pre-COVID levels.\nNow let's review our Q4 financial results. Service revenues grew 12% year over-year-versus the 9% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume, primarily due to business mix, pricing, and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 13% versus 10% process transaction growth, led by value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenues were up 10% versus the 18% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth lagged volume growth, primarily due to declining currency volatility. Other revenues grew 35%, led by pricing, consulting, and marketing services, and client incentives grew 20%. Now let me dive into revenues growth across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by stability in domestic volume growth and process transactions, as well as strong growth in cross-border volumes. New flows revenue grew 14% in constant dollars.\nCommercial volumes are up 9% in constant dollars and up 156% versus 2019. Remember that revenue is recorded based on last quarter's payment volumes growth, which was 9% in constant dollars in Q3. Visa Direct transactions grew 19%, and as we mentioned last quarter were impacted by a client that transitioned its domestic P2P transactions to an internal ledger system and that was not meaningful to revenue. Value-added services grew 19% in constant dollars, driven primarily by strong advisory services, select pricing actions, and higher volume. GAAP operating expenses increased 13%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 9%, primarily due to personnel expenses from growth in headcount, and FX had a nearly 2-point drag. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $7 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $79 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates.\nOur GAAP tax rate was 16.9%, and non-GAAP was 17% due to a tax benefit related to the extension of the US foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in an indirect tax expense in the operating expense line and a much larger tax benefit in the income tax provision. GAAP EPS was $2.27. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.33, up 21% over last year, inclusive of a little more than 0.5 point of drag from exchange rates. In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.1 billion in stock and distributed $928 million in dividends to our stockholders. We also added $150 million to the litigation escrow account, which has the same effect as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, net revenues increased 11%. GAAP EPS of $8.28 was up 18%, and non-GAAP EPS of $8.77 was up 17%, inclusive of an over 2-point drag from exchange rates. Now let's move to fiscal year 2024. Before we share our perspectives on the year, I want to make a few brief comments. In many ways, FY 2024 will be as close to a normal year as we've had in a while. We have fully lapped the Russia and Omicron impacts, and overall inflation continues to moderate in many of our markets. As such, we're pleased to resume our pre-COVID guidance practices and will provide our outlook for FY 2024, which we will update each quarter. At the same time, we will no longer be providing the intra-quarter 8-Ks associated with interim driver updates.\nNow let's look at what we've seen through the first three weeks of October. US payment volume was up 5%, with debit and credit both up 5%. The sequential step down for September was primarily driven by the days-mix impact in September and declining fuel prices in October. Excluding those two items, payments volume growth was relatively stable from September to October. Reg II has not meaningfully impacted volume so far. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 19%, and travel-related cross-border volumes were 144% indexed to 2019. Turning now to our key assumptions. As we've said consistently, we're not economic forecasters, and so at a macro level, we are assuming no recession in our outlook.\nWe are also not factoring in any impacts from Reg II and student loan repayments because, as I mentioned before, we've yet to see any meaningful impact. As the year progresses and we gather more information with regard to these assumptions, we will continue to provide updates. For key drivers, we're assuming that the trends we saw in Q4 generally continue throughout the year. Overall payments volume growth and processed transaction growth are expected to be in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis. Cross-border card-not-present, ex-travel, and ex-crypto volume growth will continue to be in the low double digits year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. Cross-border travel volume, excluding intra-Europe year-over-year growth, will moderate to the low 20s in constant dollars, and when compared to 2019, would equate to a 4- to 5-point improvement each quarter. This assumption is driven primarily by improving AP cross-border travel volume, mostly from China, and to a lesser extent, improving US inbound travel volume.\nIn terms of what this means for the financials, I'll speak to the numbers on an adjusted basis, which we define as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts, which you can review in the footnotes in our earnings release and earnings presentation for more detail. Okay, first, let's discuss net revenues. For the full year, we expect low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth. Based on current currency forward curves, FX will be approximately a 1-point drag for the year. We're assuming that currency volatility moderates slightly from Q4 levels but remains relatively stable throughout the year. On a year-over-year basis, incentives are expected to grow slightly less than what we saw in FY 2023. For new flows and value-added services, we continue to expect those to grow faster than consumer payments in FY 2024.\nNow moving to expenses. Our current plans are to grow adjusted operating expense in the high single-digit to low double digits with approximately 1.5 points of FX benefit to nominal non-GAAP growth. Non-operating income is expected to be between $250 and 300 million. The tax rate is expected to be slightly favorable to our typical rate of 19% to 19.5% due to some offsetting factors. On the one hand, we have the impact of tax rate increases in certain countries, which puts our new run rate closer to 19.5% to 20%. However, we also anticipate some one-time tax benefits in the second half related to the resolution of certain tax matters. In total, this will put us between 18.5% and 19% for the full fiscal year.\nPutting all this together, we expect full-year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens with about 0.5 point of FX drag to nominal non-GAAP growth. Also, FY 2024 will likely be a tale of two halves, with variability in our growth rate from the first half to the second half. A few aspects to keep in mind. First, cross-border volume ex-intra-Europe grew 31% year-over-year in the first half of FY 2023 and 20% in the second half. Second, recall that we had relatively high currency volatility in the first half of FY 2023, and it moderated considerably in the second half. Third, incentives were 16% higher in the second half of FY 2023 versus the first half due primarily to deal timing and client performance.\nAs a result, we expect overall adjusted net revenue growth to be lower in the first half than in the second half of FY 2024. This will also be the case on a nominal basis, even with a slightly larger FX headwind in the second half of FY 2024 than the first half. On the expense side, as Ryan mentioned, this is an Olympics year, and we expect Q2 and Q3 expense to have the largest percentage increases as we ramp. But adjusted operating expense growth and the FX impact will roughly be the same in both halves.\nThe tax rate is expected to be lower in the second half than the first due to the anticipated one-time tax benefits I mentioned. So for Q1 specifically, given the variables I just described, Q1 is expected to have the lowest adjusted year-over-year net revenues growth rate with an improving trend throughout the year, and Q4 is expected to be at the highest adjusted growth rate. We expect Q1 net revenues growth in the upper, mid-to-high single digits on an adjusted basis.\nA few factors to keep in mind. Again, one, currency volatility was the highest in Q1 of 2023. Two, cross-border volume grew 31% in Q1 of 2023. And three, Q1 2023 other revenue was strong due to FIFA World Cup-related value-added services revenue, and incentives were lower than expected due to client performance and other items. Adjusted operating expense growth is expected to be in the high single digits, driven by headcount growth and salary increases. We anticipate approximately 0.5 point FX headwind to nominal net revenues growth and approximately 1.5 point benefit to nominal non-GAAP expense growth.\nThe tax rate is expected to be closer to our new run rate of between 19.5% and 20% in Q1. This puts Q1 adjusted EPS growth in the upper, mid-single digits with minimal impact from FX. Keep in mind that the adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results presented in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. And non-GAAP expenses and EPS exclude acquisition-related items and the litigation provision for Q1 of 2023.\nFor FY 2024, the estimated results exclude approximately $20 million or 1 cent of acquisition-related costs and approximately $40 million or 2 cents from the amortization of acquired intangibles. Finally, moving to capital return. As Ryan said, the board has authorized the $25 billion multi-year share repurchase program and increased our quarterly dividend by 16%. In summary, Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy and stable, and the growth opportunities are significant. While there continue to be macro uncertainties, we feel confident in our ability to manage the business through a changing environment and deliver value for our stockholders. Now, Jennifer, let's move to Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Chris. With that, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star one and clearly record your name. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questioners are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Our first question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the time and congrats on the quarter. Just when thinking about your guidance for the fiscal year ahead, it's good to see the constant currency double-digit growth rate. So I just want to make sure we understand the inputs and how you think about structural growth as far as some of the inputs like value-added services, new flows. So number one, I mean, maybe you can give us a little more color on what you're assuming for some of the VAS and new flows growth potential. And then more importantly, do you believe that's the right algorithm medium term? Is the structural growth of this company sustainably at the same 10% to 12% rate it's been, or has anything changed? Thanks guys.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nHi, Darrin. Yes, let me address that. This is Chris. So yeah, a couple of things I'll say about the FY 2024 guide. First, the underlying drivers, as we shared, both payments volume and processed transactions will be growing in the low double digits, which is very consistent and reflects the stable business trends that we see in the underlying drivers. I also said on the call commentary that we do expect value-added services and new flows to continue to be our growth engines, growing faster than the consumer payments part of the business. And so I think that structure, which you described, is consistent in many ways to 2023, and that's what we certainly expect to see in 2024.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director of Research, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks so much. Good job. I guess two quick ones. Asia Pacific constant currency volume growth was 4%, a little lower than normal. Maybe you could dive into that. Then tax rate longer term, basically in the out years, 19.5% to 20%. That's how we should think about it. Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHey Dave. I'll talk about Asia, maybe put it in the context of what we're seeing around the world and then Chris, you can take the tax rate. Just to answer your question specifically on Asia, as you said, growth ex-China slowed four points from Q3. There's a couple of things going on there.\nOne is, we're lapping some strong COVID ramp in Q4 of 2022, but we're also seeing a little softness in a couple of places, notably Australia is what I'd point you to. Again, just kind of back up and look at that in kind of the bigger picture, what are we seeing around the world? Outside of Asia, as it sounds like you've looked at the numbers and you would have seen, we're seeing resiliency. Outside of North America and Asia, if you look at Europe ex-UK, Latin America, CEMEA, most of these regions are growing at around 20% or more. So we feel good about what's happening there. On the tax rate, Chris, I'll turn over to you the long-term tax rate.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah, sure. Hi, Dave. Yeah, I do think that's the right way to think about it, at least based on what we know now. The new run rate we would put at about 19.5% to 20%. It is related to how the mix of our tax jurisdictions around the world, and certain tax increases in certain parts of those worlds. As we talked about, in the next fiscal year, we'll be below that due to some of the benefits that we anticipate in the second half of the year. But based on what we know today, the new run rate is as you estimated.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Togut\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good to see the 19% growth in Visa Direct transactions and, in particular, the 65% growth in cross-border P2P transactions year-over-year. As we look to FY 2024, what are some of the biggest, most promising new use cases you're working on for Visa Direct?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Hey, David. Cross-border remittances is a big one. Since you called that out, I'll highlight it. I mentioned, I think on this call and some others, the work we're doing with Paysend and Shinhan and things we're doing around the world. We've mentioned in previous calls with some of the both kind of traditional and fintech remittance players. You know, 65% year-over-year growth is strong and continue to invest behind that with new partners and try to drive further growth going forward. We're focused on bill payments. We're focused on earned wage access. We're focused on insurance disbursements. We continue to focus on P2P more broadly in new geographies around the world, both domestic and cross-border. If you just back up, I've said this, I think, on previous calls.\nI believe at this point in time, Visa Direct is the largest at-scale money movement network on the planet. We have made investments consistently year-over-year to get to a point where we now have 8.5 billion endpoints, 3 billion cards, 3 billion accounts, with some of the news I announced in my prepared remarks, 2.5 billion digital wallets. We'll continue to invest in expanding the network even further, but now we've got the ability to work with enablers around the world, sell new use cases in and put this network to work. We're going to continue to do that and look forward to hopefully talking to you about more of the good results to come.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ramsey El-Assar with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRamsey El-Assal\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. You guys had a lot of great commentary on commercial and B2B progress and deal wins in the quarter. Can you just give us a broader update on your commercial strategy? Where do you see the bigger opportunities there going forward?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah, thanks. We did have some really good commercial wins in the quarter. I put it in a couple of different buckets. One is we're looking to expand our partnerships, right? So I mentioned Citi and IBM this quarter. I mentioned SAP last quarter. And we're just having good success building and expanding those partnerships around the world. Second thing we're focused on is expanding verticals. You've heard us talk about government, travel, fleet, and fuel. I talked about agro, I think, last quarter, working and selling into marketplaces, like I mentioned, healthcare. So taking these products, innovating, creating new use cases, and delivering them into new verticals. And then just making the products easier to use.\nYesterday, we announced that actually we had a new product to make, it easier to accept virtual cards. We call it Virtual Card Acceptance Platform. Virtual cards are preferred acceptance of many suppliers, but they're not as easy to accept as sometimes we'd like them to be. So putting new platforms out to make the core products like virtual cards easier to use, and then continuing to invest in the partnerships that we've announced over the last couple of years. WEX is a great example of a partner that we announced a couple of years ago that we've invested in and growing in and really getting to see some of the benefits of that around the world. So I guess the last thing I would say, Ramsey, is just also taking these products more broadly around the world.\nIn so many different countries outside of the most developed markets that we work in, there's opportunity to get some of the basic products into the hands of small businesses, for example. In a lot of countries we're doing business, there's still a lot of small businesses that are actually using consumer products instead of the more sophisticated, advanced small business products, let alone the large and middle market products that we can get out there. So more partners, more use cases, more verticals, more countries, we'll continue to invest in that business.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP in Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. You had some interesting commentary around processing market share gains. Wondering if you could just give us kind of a state of the union of where you stand with that and if there's any geographies that are kind of top of mind as opportunities to increase processing share? What would those be? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah, sure. I mean, we're very focused on processing share for a couple of reasons, but the one I noted in my prepared remarks is a very important one, which is we can deliver more of our value-added services when we're actually processing the transaction. Obviously, we earn more yield when we process the transaction as well just on the core processing of it. But the ability to serve our clients more effectively, deliver them our risk capabilities, our issuing capabilities, our loyalty capabilities, and those types of things are enhanced when we actually process the transaction. So we spent a lot of time on it.\nI think we've made very good progress over the last many years. I mentioned Colombia in my prepared remarks. Colombia is a good use case. In a lot of these markets, to really unlock the processing, we have to work with the local processor, which we did in Colombia, and then work with the clients to get them on that processor. They will then test out the transaction, see how they're working, and then ultimately move those transactions to VisaNet, which we like. We've been very focused in Latin America. We've made some good strides in several different countries in Latin America, and I think we continue to have opportunity in Latin America.\nWe're making strides in Europe, and we'll continue to focus on processing opportunities in several of the different countries that have local schemes in Europe, as well as some places in Asia Pacific. So those are some of the opportunities we have, Will. Thanks.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nResearch Analyst in Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Morgan Stanley\n\nVery good afternoon, everybody. Just want to circle back on the travel component of cross-border and how you're thinking about that in the coming year. I can appreciate, as you guys have often said, you're not necessarily economic forecasters, but can you just repeat for us what your underlying assumption is for the coming year, and then maybe give a little bit of color on inputs of how you're arriving at that expectation and target for the year? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nLet me give some context on how we think about just cross-border travel in general, and then Chris, you can add and/or fill in the blanks on the assumptions that we've made for the year. Here's how I would think about it. In and out of Asia, we still have yet to normalize. So as Chris alluded to or said in his prepared remarks, we have opportunity to continue to catch up to pre-COVID travel levels in and out of Asia. There's also the opportunity to still catch up into the United States. But more broadly around the world, I would say we've kind of normalized in terms of cross-border travel, but I think what's interesting is we've normalized at a growth rate higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nPeople are traveling international at this new normal at a faster rate than they would have been all else equal before the pre-COVID levels. So in a couple of corridors, we still have an opportunity to catch up to what would be normalized levels. Around the rest of the corridors around the world, I think we've normalized, but at higher growth rates than we saw pre-COVID. Do you want to mention any of the numbers for the year?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nSure. The only thing I'd really add, and I covered a lot of the assumptions in the call commentary, the thing that I might just emphasize is that it is pretty healthy growth. If you look at what we've shared in terms of what we expect the index to grow at 4 to 5 points a quarter, I think that does reflect what Ryan said, which is normalized in many cases, and continuing to be elevated growth.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, in your prepared remarks, you called out CyberSource. I know it's a very important asset for you and always has been, but why am I inferring that there's an increased cadence in the business, and if so, why would that be? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. As I said, Jamie, in my prepared remarks, we're seeing great, strong client demand around the world for CyberSource. Why? I think as a result of a lot of the investments we've made in the platform over the last several years. We've been very purposeful about investing in our omnicommerce capabilities for CyberSource. We've been very purposeful in investing in our tokenization capabilities, our risk management and fraud prevention capabilities. And a lot of that has been driven by sitting down with our clients and partners, understanding the roadmaps, understanding what they needed us to deliver, making those investments, and then having success growing with our partners.\nAnd in any given market around the world, when clients start adopting the CyberSource platform and others look around at the success they're having with authorization rates or transaction success or others, that leads to new opportunities, and we've had the ability to sell into those. So thanks for the question.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThanks. I have a question on Reg II. Chris, you mentioned no impact yet and also sort of caveated the outlook. I'm just wondering, is there anything that gives you pause there? And then, Ryan, anything you guys are doing proactively to get in front of any adverse impacts? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nWhy don't I talk just contextually about Reg II, and then you can answer anything else on Sanjay's question. So two things going on, obviously, with Reg II. Let's just talk about them both. One is the change that was made last summer that went into effect with regards to routing in the e-com space. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks there, we haven't seen any meaningful impact. Having said that, there's a lot of work happening around the ecosystem, and we're out there talking to clients and partners about our products and our value propositions, making sure they understand the benefits of a Visa transaction, especially in the e-commerce space where often the merchant holds the fraud liability.\nSo our sales teams are in with merchant clients and acquire clients day in and day out, explaining the value of our products, showing them the value of our products. And going forward, we feel good about our ability to compete. The second thing that's going on with Reg II that I'm sure people would have seen is the Fed has announced that they're going to, I think it's tomorrow, announce some changes potentially to the debit interchange rate in the US. We don't know what they're going to say. We'll obviously follow it very closely, and when they do publish something, we'll take a look and see if it merits a response on our behalf.\nAnd just as a reminder, interchange is an exchange of value between the merchant and the issuer. And I think what's notable about our business model is we've proven that we can be resilient and have a strong business in regulated interchange markets, not in regulated interchange markets, in markets that have higher regulated interchange and lower regulated interchange. So as you alluded to, a lot going on in the US with Reg II, but we're all over it, and we feel good about our ability to compete.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. And I'll just add on from a guidance perspective. Hopefully, we're very clear on the call. We have not seen any meaningful impact thus far and therefore haven't included any impact of that in our FY 2024 guidance. But it is early days, and there's a lot going on, as Ryan described at length. And so we'll keep you posted as things evolve in the coming months.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nFinancial Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. I just wanted to ask a question around tokenization and the implications for just broader-based authorization rate improvements. And this is not just domestic, but international. It just feels like a lot of your partners are able to drive higher authorization rates as a result of the token. So I'm just wondering how you're viewing that in the context of being able to drive incremental transactions back to Visa. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Just for a reminder for everyone, tokenization is technology that we use that essentially helps protect issuers, merchants, and consumers. And to your question, ultimately drives higher authorizations and lower fraud. I think I said in my prepared remarks, we crossed 7.5 billion tokens as of the end of September. We're in 198 markets. I think we have 14 billion token transactions in Q4, which is growing at like 60%. So this is another example of a platform and a service that we invested in over many years, and we're now scaling broadly around the world.\nTo your question, we are. We're seeing on average somewhere between 4% and 5% higher approval rates across our partners, and we also see it with a reduction in fraud, a 30% reduction in fraud. So you say why do we have 7.5 billion tokens that are now out there in the ecosystem? Well, if you're one of our partners, as you said, and you can reduce your fraud rates 30% and drive your auth rates 4 or 5 percentage points, that is a great opportunity. That's higher sales, that's lower fraud, that's better customer experience. And we continue to invest in that platform as well. We see a lot of benefits to our issuers, to our consumers who ultimately use the products.\nYou'll see more from us enhancing the platform in terms of using the FIDO biometrics and enabling merchants to be able to authorize and authenticate customers across multiple devices and those types of things. So yeah, higher auth, lower fraud. We love the platform, continue to invest in it.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nTrevor Williams\n\nSVP of Payments/FinTech Equity Research, Jefferies",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks a lot. Chris, I wanted to clarify on incentives within the guide. I think you said you're assuming slightly slower growth than in fiscal 2023. Just want to make sure, is that year-over-year growth in dollars or as a percentage of gross revenue? And then just the second part to that, you're framing this as a more normal year. Should we be interpreting that as meaning all else equal, a normal year incentive should be going up kind of ±100 basis points as a percentage of gross revenue? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Hi, Jeff. Yeah. Let me try to clarify a bit. As I said, 2024 is in many ways a normal year. It's still normalizing in some aspects, but in many ways, it is normalizing. As a result, we've made some changes. We've returned to pre-COVID practices on a number of fronts. We've provided formal guidance as we went through in detail, and we've talked about it on this call for the full year and next quarter, and we'll continue that practice. That guidance is on net revenue guide specifically and directional commentary about the growth and incentives, which, to your specific question, it is a dollar year-over-year growth rate that we said will grow slower in 2024 relative to 2023. Importantly, this is very, very consistent, and it's aligned with how we think about the business, how we manage the business going forward.\nWe haven't guided on the percentage, which is the other part of your question, because again, this is consistent with how we manage the business. The thing that we do track very importantly is that we look at the yield across our net revenue yield specifically, and that's remained very stable, and that's very consistent again with how we think about deal economics.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks. I'm actually at Money20/20. It's really good energy here. I'm curious, Ryan, if you'd characterize the deal pipeline as being any different than what it was a year ago. How does that feel to you? And if you don't mind me asking, just on the credential side, I think you said up 7%. I'm curious, same thing. Is pipeline there to support that same kind of high signature growth in fiscal 2024 credentials? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHey, Tien-Tsin. Glad there's great energy in Money20/20, and I hope my Visa team members that are there are serving clients, finding sales opportunities, growing our business. Yeah. We see a great pipeline. We really do with clients issuing fintechs, co-brands, with opportunities to grow credentials. I mentioned some of the new things on my prepared remarks, and we're having good success. I think just some of the wins on the call, whether it's Citi or US Bank, FNBO, Fidelity, Shinhan, China Merchants Bank, Shopify. I mean, the list goes on, right? IBM, DBS, Etihad, Saudi. We feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about the way our teams are out there serving clients around the world. We feel good about the wins that we have and feel good about the growth that it's generating.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nUS IT Services Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, Ryan. Hi, Chris. Congratulations on the quarter. Questions on open banking. CFPB obviously proposed the rule to sort of jumpstart competition, shift to open banking a few days back. You guys have dealt with open banking frameworks outside the US in many different geographies. I'm just kind of curious how that translates in terms of products, in terms of acquisitions you've made like Tink, Pismo, and so on, to bring that over to the US.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nThanks for the question. I think the CFPB rule that they put out is good for Americans. I think it's great for clarifying the structure and the regulatory framework here in America. I think it's likely to be a catalyst for growth of open banking in the United States as it gives clarity to all the various different players in the ecosystem. You think about it, it's a great opportunity for Americans to be able to put their own data to work in different types of digital tools that'll help their own personal financial management, help manage their financial lives better, get a better view of their finances across multiple different providers.\nThen to your point, we've seen different regulatory frameworks in different markets around the world. Our Tink business continues to perform very well in Europe, which obviously was one of the leaders in terms of establishing a regulatory framework for open banking. We look forward to the opportunity to bring Tink outside of Europe. So when we look at the proposed rules here in the US, we welcome that because we want to understand what the regulatory expectations are so that we can build a business that'll thrive, and serve our clients, and serve consumers effectively. So thanks for the question.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nLast question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood afternoon. As you're looking into the next fiscal year and beyond, I want to ask about the cash digitization opportunity in your consumer business. As you know, this is always a persistent question for Visa investors and folks who are thinking about it again given the pandemic pulled forward, and slowing inflation tailwinds. So how are you thinking about the runway, especially segmenting it between developed markets and also EMs that have a little bit more competition? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. We continue to be excited about the cash check digitization opportunity around the world. We continue to digitize cash and check around the world, and economies continue to grow around the world. So I think it continues to surprise many people when they look at developed markets like the United States, how much cash and check still exists. And certainly, when you look to the developing world, how much cash and check still exists.\nSo we continue to be excited about the runway. We think it offers us tremendous growth opportunity, and we're going to continue to work with our partners across the ecosystem to get more credentials into consumers' hands, get more acceptance out there in the ecosystem, especially among micro and nano merchants, and work with our partners to drive more activation and usage among the credentials and feel good about that entire algorithm.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWith that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."

With that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong Q3 results with $8.9 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up 12%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable as compared to Q2 adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 7% year-over-year, US payments volume grew 5%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year.\nWe recently received the results from our annual Global Client Engagement Survey, where Visa achieved a Global Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 76, up three points from last year. We saw NPS increases across all of our client types: merchants, issuers, fintechs, and processors. And across our regions, the results remained strong, with a notable 6-point NPS improvement in North America. I want to thank all of our 30,000 employees who helped deliver these fantastic results.\nAnd as I review some highlights from the quarter, you'll see how this focus on serving our clients by meeting their needs, innovating, and helping them grow is fueling our success across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let's start with consumer payments, where we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity to capture cash, check, ACH, domestic schemes, and other forms of electronic payment. In our client engagement survey, our clients ranked our strategic partnership and our brand as two of the most important factors to our successful relationships.\nI'll share some examples of how each of these played out this quarter. In strategic partnerships, we are constantly seeking ways to add more value and grow together with our clients. We are pleased to have been named the preferred network partner by Lloyds Banking Group, renewing our debit relationship and significantly expanding our relationship in credit, winning 10 million additional credit credentials across the group's consumer and commercial business.\nAlso in the UK, NatWest has launched a new Visa Travel Reward credit card following the signing of our partnership last year. They will also be utilizing many value-added services, including transaction controls and card benefits. On the European continent, we work with Raiffeisen Bank International AG, a leading bank in several markets.\nRecently, in the Czech Republic and Romania, we renewed our commercial business and expanded our consumer debit and credit business, totaling over 2 million potential new credentials. In Korea, we deepened our partnership with leading issuer KB Kookmin Card, already a user of Visa Direct cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer. They will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use value-added services, including consulting and marketing services.\nIn Peru, we extended our partnership with leading issuer Banco de Crédito del Perú across consumer and commercial portfolios, with plans to launch additional new flows offerings, and value-added services. In the US, we extended our agreement with Wells Fargo. This will allow us to continue to support Wells Fargo's strategy to reinvent their credit business and provide additional growth by leveraging key Visa assets like consulting and Visa sponsorships, such as FIFA and the Olympic, and Paralympic Games.\nOn the brand front, with the Olympic Games opening ceremony later this week, it is exciting to see the engagement with the Visa brand and activation across the world in marketing campaigns, cardholder experiences, and Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa issuance, which I am happy to report in Europe is at nearly 6 million cards compared to the 5 million number I quoted just last quarter. We have also added nearly 100,000 new merchant locations in France in advance of the event. Our brand also plays an important role in winning co-brand partnerships. In India, growing credit issuance and reaching affluent and cross-border consumers remain areas of focus.\nWe are excited about the launch of a co-brand card with Adani One and ICICI Bank as India's first co-branded credit card with rich airport-linked benefits for their target base of 400 million customers through the Adani One platform. We also signed an agreement to launch a new co-brand card with Tata Digital, along with an Indian banking partner, building on the success of our existing credit co-brand relationship. This new co-brand offering consists of a multi-currency prepaid foreign exchange card that will target travelers from India, also benefiting from the rewards of the Tata Digital Super app, Tata Neu.\nAcross seven countries in Latin America, we will work with Unicomer, a major retailer and financial services provider with numerous brands, to deliver a co-brand credit card in addition to using CyberSource. In CEMEA, we reached a de novo co-brand arrangement with BinDawood, a leading grocer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 88 outlets and over 5 million loyalty program members. On the travel side, we extended our relationship with Malaysia Airlines from a prepaid co-brand card targeting millennials and Gen Z customers to also launch a new co-brand credit card for the travel-minded affluent.\nIn the US, Turkish Airlines has chosen Visa to be their exclusive network partner for their new Miles and Smiles co-brand credit card. Our consumer payment strategy is focused on growing credentials, as we are doing across all the partnerships I just mentioned, and increasing acceptance locations. Wallets are a great example of where this comes together, where Visa can be a funding source, an embedded credential, and an accepted form of payment by wallet merchants. This increases the value proposition for wallet providers and their users. Two wallet highlights this quarter are in Peru and Vietnam.\nYape is a Peruvian super app with more than 15 million users who already have a Visa credential that enables them to send money across P2P apps via Visa Direct. Just recently, they launched tap-to-phone functionality for their more than 2 million merchants to accept Visa. In Vietnam, a country with approximately 50 million wallet users, the three leading digital wallets, MoMo, VNPay, and ZaloPay, are now enabling their users to utilize Visa cards as a funding source for transactions at over 500,000 QR acceptance points managed by these wallets. One additional area that we are very focused on is delivering simple, easy, and secure checkout experiences.\nLet me share a few recent examples. First, we are integrating Click to Pay and the Visa Payment Passkey Service, enabling a customer to authenticate themselves using biometrics. Already, we have hundreds of issuers enabled for passkeys in Europe and a number of issuers who represent more than 50% of our e-commerce payments volume in Europe piloting the solution. Second, we crossed 10 billion tokens this quarter, a significant milestone. In 2023 alone, Visa tokens helped generate more than an estimated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue for businesses globally and saved more than $600 million in fraud.\nThird is the ability to tap for more use cases on a mobile device. With tapping as one of the best in-person commerce experiences, we want to provide Visa users with more ways to tap, including tap-to-pay, tap-to-authenticate an identity, tap-to-add a card, or tap-to-send money to family or friends. Finally, this quarter, tap-to-pay grew 4 percentage points from last year to 80% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. In the US, we surpassed 50% and have 30 US cities above 60% penetration. Now, moving on to new flows.\nThis quarter, new flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars, with Visa Direct overall transactions growing 41% for the quarter to 2.6 billion and commercial volumes up 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me provide some updates, starting with B2B, where we have focused on penetrating new verticals and delivering innovative products and solutions. In healthcare, we will work with AXA and Paysure to launch a commercial virtual card solution to simplify the claims processes for their customers worldwide. We have also expanded our virtual card acceptance with a key business services provider, Cintas, who offers uniform, safety, and fire protection services to over 1 million customers.\nTogether with our partner, Billtrust, we will help Cintas streamline their payments, automate processes, and manage costs on Billtrust's Business Payments Network, or BPN. We also just recently extended our longstanding BPN collaboration with Billtrust that connects suppliers and buyers to facilitate straight-through processing of virtual card payments with rich data that optimizes acceptance costs. Our products and solutions in B2B remain very important in winning and growing our business. One such solution is the enhanced B2B data that we can provide.\nIn Brazil, together with Celero, a leading business financial management solution, we will provide issuers with enhanced visibility into small business spend by aggregating data across cards, bank accounts, boletos, and more, enabling them to better manage their client relationships and offer compelling products. Another solution is SpendClarity, which provides expense program management, including card issuance, controls, and reporting.\nWells Fargo has white-labeled our solution called Wells One Expense Manager, which has now onboarded 6,000 corporate clients representing over 1 million users, providing access to their spend data. Now, moving on to Visa Direct. We continue to grow our transactions through expanded and new relationships. Over the past year, total Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions have nearly doubled, with Europe and CEMEA being the largest regions. In CEMEA, we are very excited to have renewed our Visa Direct relationship with fintech Monobank, in addition to renewing their consumer and commercial credit, debit, and prepaid portfolios.\nIn Asia Pacific, we are partnering with China Minsheng Bank on cross-border capabilities, including Visa Direct and CurrencyCloud, allowing the bank to support cross-border payments for their merchant clients. Canadian fintech Nuvei has extended its agreement with us for Visa Direct across all cross-border use cases in more than 30 countries for their merchant clients and recently became the first Visa Direct enabler in Colombia. We also executed our first global agreement with WorldRemit and Sendwave, enabling their customers to eventually send Visa Direct cross-border remittances from 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries.\nQuickly, a leading South Asian marketplace, has enabled Visa Direct cross-border remittance solutions for US customers to send money to relatives and friends in India and the rest of South Asia. In earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weavr, a UK-based embedded finance provider. In addition to card issuance, they will be utilizing Visa Direct to enable Weavr's business clients to offer employee expense reimbursement, reward and recognition, and earned wage access.\nEarned wage access provider PayActiv, who serves 4,000 businesses, has renewed its agreement with us and will enable Visa Plus for payouts. Similarly, we expanded our relationship with enabler Astra. In addition to domestic disbursements, Astra will now offer cross-border remittances, implement Visa Plus to reach domestic wallets in the US, and expand to additional use cases, including payroll, earned wage access, and marketplaces. Visa Plus is still in the early stages but is fully rolled out and live for PayPal and Venmo users, and more providers continue to join the platform.\nWrapping up new flows, we also renewed an agreement with FIS, an important issuer processing partner, to enable a suite of value-added services and new flows capabilities for their clients, including Visa Direct. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in Q3 in constant dollars. Let me highlight some of the progress we have made in driving adoption and growth among our value-added services portfolio. First, in issuing solutions. One area of strong revenue growth this quarter was in card benefits, where we enable our clients to offer unique value propositions tailored to their customer base in travel, entertainment, restaurants, insurance, and more.\nStrong issuance in premium cards across most of our regions has fueled this growth in Q3. For example, in Latin America, travel benefits have grown with over 370,000 unique visits to our Visa Infinite Airport Lounge in Brazil, representing customers from a number of leading issuers. In addition, since its launch in 2022, our Visa Infinite FastPass in Brazil, which allows cardholders to get through airport security more quickly, has screened over 1 million travelers. These are among the top five card benefits in Brazil and deliver value to customers, issuers, and Visa.\nWe continue to add more benefits, like the recently launched partnership with OpenTable, to offer eligible Visa cardholders access to coveted restaurant reservations and experiences in the US, with plans to expand into Canada and Mexico. In acceptance solutions, Q3 growth was driven by increasing utilization across both token and e-commerce-related services. In e-commerce, one such example is with iFood, the largest food delivery platform in Brazil, who is utilizing our Verify solution to help prevent disputes before they become chargebacks. In addition, they will be using our authentication solutions.\nIn risk and identity solutions, we continue to see strong adoption by new and existing clients, driven in part by growth in card-not-present transactions. In North America, acquirer Worldpay will be expanding their use of our authentication solutions from CardinalCommerce, fostering collaboration and real-time enhanced data exchange between Worldpay merchants and issuers during card-not-present transactions, reducing fraud and allowing more transactions to be properly authenticated and authorized securely.\nWe are also pleased that the pilot of our account-to-account risk scoring solution, Visa Protect, with Pay.UK, has had great results, showing an average 40% uplift in fraud detection over the three-month pilot period. In addition, we are now launching Visa Protect in Argentina with a core payments technology company, COELSA, after successfully piloting the solution there as well. The last two value-added services are open banking and advisory services. We continue to sign new partners with Tink in Europe and the US.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in client demand for our consulting and marketing services, particularly around marquee events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our value-added services portfolio of solutions is strong and is driving meaningful growth for our clients and for Visa. Before I close, I wanted to speak to the fact that the settlement reached for the injunctive relief class was rejected by the court. We are, of course, disappointed with this decision. We believe that the prior settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants, and we will continue to work towards another settlement.\nTo close, so far this fiscal year, we have seen strong revenue and EPS growth as a result of relatively stable volume and transaction growth. I remain very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us. At Visa, we come to work in service of our clients and partners and are focused on building and deploying the best solutions possible across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Now, over to Chris.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we had another strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions when compared to Q2 adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year, and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 14% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 net revenue was up 10% in both GAAP and constant dollars, in line with our expectations. EPS was up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant dollars. Now, let's go into the details.\nIn the US, payment volume's growth numbers were generally in line with Q2 adjusted for leap year, with total Q3 payments volume growing 5% year-over-year, with credit and debit also growing 5%. Card-present volume grew 2%, and card-not-present volume grew 7%. In the US, while growth in the high-spend consumer segment remained stable compared to prior quarters, we saw a slight moderation in the lower-spend consumer segment. Moving to international markets, total payments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, relatively stable with Q2 when adjusted for leap year.\nPayments volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex UK each growing more than 16% in constant dollars. Asia-Pacific payments volume slowed to less than half a point of year-over-year growth in constant dollars for the quarter, driven primarily by the macroeconomic environment, most notably in mainland China. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 14% in Q3, relatively stable to Q2 adjusted for leap year.\nCross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases, was in the mid-teens, helped by continued strength in retail. Cross-border travel volume growth was also up in the mid-teens, or 157% indexed to 2019. This quarter, we saw the inbound Asia-Pacific index improve 9 points at a similar pace to Q2, to 151% of 2019. The improvement in Asia-Pacific outbound travel, however, slowed from Q2, with the index increasing by less than a point, to 125% of 2019. We continue to see the same primary drivers as last quarter, with some additional pressure from macroeconomic conditions.\nNow, let's review our Q3 financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, with revenue yield improving sequentially and versus last year due to improving utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 10% processed transaction growth, with the revenue yield generally in line sequentially and versus last year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 14% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year.\nVolatility levels remained consistent on average to last quarter. Other revenue grew 31%, primarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue related to the Olympics and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 11%. Now, on to our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. New flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars.\nVisa Direct transactions grew 41% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q3, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by issuing and acceptance solutions, and advisory services. Operating expenses grew 14%, primarily due to increases in general and administrative, personnel, and marketing expenses, including spend related to the Olympics. FX was a half-point drag versus the one-and-a-half-point benefit we expected.\nPismo represented an approximately one-point drag. Non-operating income was $73 million. Our tax rate was 18.8%, and EPS was $2.42, up 12% over last year, inclusive of an approximately one-and-a-half-point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half-point drag from Pismo. In Q3, we bought back approximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $18.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in July through the 21st, with volume growth in constant dollars.\nCross-border is excluding intra-Europe. US payments volume was up 4%, with debit up 4% and credit up 3% year-over-year. This slight deceleration from Q3 does not appear to be from any one factor, but likely a number of smaller factors, such as weather, timing of promotional shopping events, and the technology outage, among others. Cross-border volume grew 13% year-over-year, below Q3 levels, with travel-related volume growing slightly less, which continued to be impacted by Asia-Pacific and card-not-present ex travel volume growing at similar levels to Q3. Processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year.\nNow, on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excludes acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. Let's start with the Q4. We expect payments volume and processed transactions to grow at a similar rate to Q3. For total cross-border volume growth, we are expecting to end up slightly below Q3. Currency volatility continues to average around four-year lows through 21 July, and as such, we are making an adjustment to currency volatility expectations for Q4, now assuming volatility will stay in line with Q3 levels.\nIncentives are expected to be at their lowest growth rate all year. Pulling it all together, we expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, which equates to a slight improvement from the 10% adjusted revenue growth rate in the Q3. We expect our Q4 adjusted operating expenses to grow in the high single digit. Non-operating income is expected to be between $40 and 50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 19 and 19.5% in Q4, which puts Q4 adjusted EPS growth rate in the high end of low double digits.\nMoving to the full year, with three quarters now complete, our expectations for full-year adjusted net revenue growth remain unchanged from what we shared at the start of the year. While absorbing the impact of lower currency volatility and the macroeconomic challenges in Asia, which have affected volumes, we still expect to reach low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the full year. Full-year adjusted operating expense growth will be in the high single digit to low double digits, reflecting the less favorable impact of FX. This keeps full-year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens.\nIn closing, we delivered strong results this quarter, with new flows and value-added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. We extended our existing relationships, won new clients, and invested to develop innovative products and solutions, all positioning us for continued growth into the future. But now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nThanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press * 1 and clearly record your name. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questioners are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Once again, to ask a question, please press * 1. To withdraw your question, press * 2. Our first question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Look, let me just start. The US volume growth rate obviously is a bit softer. And if you could help us distill what you consider structural versus cyclical, I think that'd be a good place to start. But adding on to it really is just the ability for you to grow double-digit revenue with only four, five, six, mid-single-digit US volume growth. It's coming from value-added services. It's coming from cross-border. Can you help us understand if that kind of trend, you believe the company has that capability to grow those rates on revenues, even in this context of US volume trends? Thanks, guys.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Hi, Darrin. So let me start with the US. Let me start with the first part of your question, and then we'll maybe get into zoom out and talk about maybe the longer question. So in the US, in Q3, we did see stable drivers relative to Q2 once you adjust for leap year. That's 5% payments volume growth in the Q3. In the 21 days in July, that number did tick down to 4%. And maybe I'll just sort of give you the full arc of what we're seeing. So 4%, let's just level set on those numbers, 4% in the 21 days versus 5% in Q3. And so for that, we did stare at a lot of the drivers, the factors that impacted those three weeks.\nAnd there was a lot going on, and I referenced a few of them on the call, and maybe I'll expand on those a bit. First, we had a major hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, and impacted Texas and other parts of the US nearby. The second, I referenced the timing of promotional e-commerce events. Maybe I can expand on that a little bit. The timing this year was later, and in e-commerce, customers are billed when the goods are shipped. And so some of that shipping period fell out of that 21-day period. And so we had a little bit of difference in the 21-day period to the comparable a year ago.\nAnd third, obviously, the major tech outage that happened at the end of last week, that also had some impact. So when we look at that, no single factor drove that one point of change from Q3 to the first part of July. But all things considered, we actually feel pretty good about the three-week results. Now, the second part of your question really was around sort of the low double digits in the context of cross-border VAS and CMS. I'll sort of back into the question.\nWe've had consistent strong performance in VAS over $2 billion of revenue, over 20% growth for many quarters consecutively. We're seeing st\nrength across the business in issuing solutions, acceptance, and advisory. That's a business that we feel great about the momentum in. With our new flows business, 18% growth, as Ryan talked about, in the quarter, that's the Q2 in a row where we're seeing growth in the teens, great execution, stable volumes, and Visa Direct transactions growing at a high level. As you know, that business also, quarter to quarter, can vary a little bit in the growth rates that we saw in the first half of the year.\nBut all in all, I feel really good about the continued strength in that business. Then cross-border, well, cross-border, maybe I'll just zoom out a little bit and talk about cross-border and what we've seen over the course of time. If you recall, pre-pandemic, cross-border grew, travel grew sort of in the high single digits to low double digits, and e-commerce, which was about 1/3 of the business, grew into the teens, sometimes into the mid-teens. Obviously, the pandemic happened, travel really contracted, e-commerce grew faster. Since then, now post-pandemic, what we're seeing now is that e-commerce is roughly 40% of the business.\nThe growth rate has normalized. It's stabilized back to pre-pandemic levels. So let's say teens growth on e-commerce on 40% of the cross-border business. Travel after the post-pandemic run-up has normalized. It's a little hard to tell exactly where it's going to stabilize at, but we've seen high growth. We've seen it continue to normalize. But what we do know structurally is that with e-commerce being a bigger portion of the business, that's a tailwind to the total cross-border growth. And so we are confident that that will continue to be healthy relative to the domestic spend. I'll pause there. And certainly, if there's anything else to add, Ryan or others, please jump in.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nNope, nothing to add for me, Chris. Thanks, Darrin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey from William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey\n\nResearch Analyst of Financial Services and Technology, William Blair\n\nHi, good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Very impressive value-added services growth this quarter at 23%. And I think, as you mentioned, Chris, it's approaching 25% of total revenue, so perhaps driving more than half your consolidated revenue growth. Can you talk a little bit about at what point we might expect value-added services to sort of bend up the growth curve of Visa Consolidated?\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nIt's Ryan, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And yeah, we're very excited about not only what we delivered in terms of value-added services growth for the quarter, what we've been delivering consistently for several years now since we shared with you all the strategy and kind of became very purposeful about our go-to-market approach. I mean, go back to, I think it was 2021, we did about $5 billion in revenue, 2022, $6 billion. Last year was $7 billion. Like you said, we did $2.2 billion this quarter, up 23%.\nSo I think what we've shown is that we have delivered consistent growth quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year in these businesses, and we're super optimistic about where we go from here. I mean, we think about the opportunities really in three different segments. The first is we have a series of value-added services, some of which Chris outlined in his previous answer, that are very focused on enhancing value for Visa transactions, risk products like Visa Secure, dispute tools like Visa Resolve Online, card benefits, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. That has historically been the largest part of our value-added services business.\nWe've shown that we can drive great growth in that area. Increasingly, we're building out a set of services that add value for non-Visa transactions. We've done some things in this space before, some of our platforms like CyberSource, Authorize.net, and Verify. But then you've heard me talk in the last couple of quarters about expanding our risk capabilities, for example, to not just other card networks, but also to RTP and account-to-account services. And I mentioned the great results we've had in both the UK and in Argentina on that front. And then the third area of opportunity for us is expanding our value-added services beyond payments.\nHistorically, we've had things like Visa Consulting and Analytics, our marketing services, and some of the open banking services delivered by Tink. But we're continuing to build out a portfolio of value-added services for our clients and partners beyond payments, things like the cyber protection capabilities that we've been bringing to market. So we've demonstrated consistent growth. We believe we'll be able to continue to demonstrate consistent growth. We've got a product pipeline and a go-to-market approach all over the world with a diverse set of clients, and we feel good about the opportunity.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nDirector of Senior Equity Analyst for Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Good afternoon. Chris, just want to ask about incentives being the lowest expectation will be for the Q4. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of that is volume-driven versus the amount of renewals you're seeing? And just trying to think about, as we head into next fiscal year, just what kind of growth or sustainable growth should we think about for incentives? Thanks.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nThanks for the question. I'll even take us back a little bit about the expectations that we had for incentives coming into the fiscal year. As we ended fiscal 2023, that was a high year for us in terms of volume of renewals, a little higher than our typical sort of normal cadence. That didn't impact how we thought about the incentive volumes in FY 2024. Even last year, we had sort of a different growth rate in the first half and the second half of the year. So as we looked across this year, we had a slightly lower volume of renewals this year. Obviously, year-to-date, incentives have played out slightly differently, largely due to client performance, deal timing, things like that.\nOverall, it's been better than it's been lower, I guess, than what we anticipated. When we go into Q4, sort of the same trend applies. We still expect Q4 to benefit from the lapping of the high incentives that we saw in the second half of last year, which informs, again, the growth rate that we anticipate in Q4. We don't have a lot to share about FY25 at this point, but we'll share plenty in the next earnings call.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Suchoski\n\nEquity Research Analyst for Payments and FinTech, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about VAS, and I think the team has talked about how some of the VAS revenue is correlated with transaction growth, but you also have parts of that business that are more recurring or less recurring in nature. So can you just help us understand how you think about the cyclicality of VAS and how that business might perform in a lower volume growth environment? And I also think the team has talked about pricing for value in VAS. So how much more room is left to go there, and how does that help with the resiliency of the business? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah, hey, Ken, it's Ryan. On the second part of your question, our ability to price for value is a function of the value that we bring to the market. And we feel great about the value that we're bringing to the market. And I think you see it in our results. Across the various different areas of issuing solutions, acceptance solutions, risk and identity solutions, advisory, I mean, we just continue to bring products and services that are ultimately helping our clients grow their business, helping our clients reduce fraud, grow authorizations, those types of things.\nWe believe we'll continue to do that, and we believe we'll be able to continue to price for value. As I think I was saying earlier, there is the biggest portion of our value-added services are a function of Visa transactions. And so obviously, Visa transactions, as they go up or down, have an impact on that. But so does our ability to sell more services. In previous calls, I've talked about the fact that we still have the majority of our clients that have yet to have the type of penetration and depth that we've been able to achieve with others.\nSo as we continue to penetrate our clients all around the world and in the various markets that we deliver, as I was saying earlier to the earlier question, I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow this business as we have.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just curious if you've updated your US outlook here in the second half. Are you still expecting transaction sizes to accelerate in the US, especially here in the Q4?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nHi, Tenzin. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we had forecasted ATS, as you know, growth to improve throughout the pace of this year from quarter to quarter. And we did see that. We saw ATS improve in the Q3. Specifically in the US, ATS was slightly better in Q3 than in Q2. It got to basically flat year-over-year in Q3. We saw improvement in a number of categories sequentially: restaurant, QSR fuel, telecom, utilities, insurance, to name a few. And we do anticipate in Q4 that we'll continue to see slight improvement sequentially again.\nThe one watch-out I'll call out is fuel prices could impact that trajectory, and so we'll watch that closely. So yeah, it is playing out as we anticipated. The pace is slightly varied from what we anticipated, but it is continuing to improve, and I think that's the important thing.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Gus Gala from Monness, Crespi, and Hardt. Please go ahead.\n\nGus Gala\n\nResearch Analyst, Monness, Crespi, and Hardt\n\nHi, guys. Thank you. Can we talk a little bit about the contactless payments penetration? Can you maybe highlight maybe what the gap is in penetration rates across maybe some of your older cardholders or young cardholders, just trying to get around to what a terminal level of penetration could look like? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYou're asking just so I heard you asking about tap-to-pay?\n\nGus Gala\n\nResearch Analyst, Monness, Crespi, and Hardt\n\nYes.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nI mean, yeah, I mean, just back up first in the big picture of things. The fact that outside of the United States, eight out of 10 of all the Visa face-to-face transactions around the entire planet are tap-to-pay now, I mean, that just tells you right there that it's all segments, all demographics, all use cases, all product types. I mean, we're at 80% overall around the world. We've got, I think, more than 55 countries that are now more than 90% contactless penetration. So increasingly, in most countries, for most customers, for most products all around the world, that's just the default way that people are paying.\nIn the US, the curve is maturing exactly how we'd expected based on what we've seen in 100-plus countries all around the world. As I said in my prepared remarks, now one out of every two transactions in the US are taps. In a place like New York City, where many of you on the call spend time, we're above 75% now. So in New York City, which was one of the early adopters of transit, we're above, I think, 75% plus of all face-to-face transactions. That's up from just 50% two years ago.\nSo again, at that level of penetration in a market the size of New York City, it's across the board in terms of products, issuers, segments, and the like. So I think as we continue to see this growth happen, buyers, sellers, they love tapping as a way to pay. And we're going to continue to see that growth accelerate in a place like the US.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nWill Nance\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. We've been getting a lot of questions around the litigation updates, and I totally understand the level of uncertainty is a lot higher now. But I guess the most common investor question that we're getting is around the potential impacts to the overall ecosystem if we see a much greater reduction in interchange rates than what was proposed. And I guess specifically how the reduction in interchange rates could reverberate through renewal negotiations with issuers and then longer term how this may impact the trajectory of incentives and net yield.\nSo just wondering if we could hear kind of your perspective about the potential reduction or a larger reduction in the overall size of sort of ecosystem revenue and if that changes the direction of any of the key indicators that we're focused on over time. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nHey, well, thanks for the question. And you're asking about the MDL litigation. I guess I'll just back up. The first thing I would say is we strongly disagree with the judge's decision. We believe the settlement was fair. We believe the settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants. The second thing I would say is the decision failed to take into consideration a number of things, especially the complex multi-sided ecosystem that we operate in, the complicated role that many different players in the ecosystem deliver. But having said that, we're pursuing a revised settlement.\nIt's too early to speculate on what that settlement is, so I won't do that today. But I would ask everybody to keep in mind a settlement can occur at any point before, during, or even after the trial. So just keep that in mind as the process plays out.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nDirector and Lead Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I want to hit one that at the same time tackles both incentives and value-added services revenue. So it's the concept of value-in-kind incentives. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether or not these are becoming more prominent, meaning you're using them a little bit more in discussions with issuers. And then if you could just briefly recap some of the mechanics around the revenue recognition, the contra revenue, the addition to deferred revenue, and then eventually the value-added services revenue. Thanks a lot.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah, I'll just give you the high level on this. The value-in-kind is a great way for us, as it says, to deliver value to our clients. And increasingly, our clients, as you see in our performance, are preferring to buy our value-added services versus just take incentives that might drop to the bottom line. So that is absolutely something that our clients are asking for more of. It's something that is helping our clients grow their businesses. And I talked earlier about just the last several years about our product pipeline, how we've gone to market, how we've built new products and solutions and services for our clients.\nAnd that's what's driving the demand. So that's kind of become a more important part of our client renewals and our client renewal discussions. And increasingly, value-added services are becoming a way for us to differentiate ourselves with our clients and grow our consumer payments business.\n\nTimothy Chiodo\n\nDirector and Lead Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, you want to talk about the mechanics?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nTim, to the second part of your question, maybe I'll just give you a high-level summary. I think you have sort of the pieces you called out. At a high level, when value-in-kind is offered in lieu of a cash incentive, it would be recognized as contra revenue at the time that it's granted or earned, depending on the nature of the contract. Then on the other side, when the client is able to utilize that value-in-kind for services from Visa, commonly in our value-added services business, that's then recognized as revenue, and the associated costs are also recognized in our P&L.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of James Fawcett from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette Morgan Stanley\n\nTechnology, Media, and Telecommunications Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I wanted to just ask a follow-up question on near-term trends. We've seen a little bit of or further slowing in credit than in debit over the last couple of months. In the past, there's been a little bit of an indication of consumer stress. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that. It seems like you're looking for the rest of the September quarter that there's a little bit of a re-acceleration as we get past some of the issues that you identified in July. Just want to make sure that I'm understanding that correctly and kind of how we should interpret a little bit of the divergence in credit and debit growth right now. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nLet me just give a little context on it, and then Chris, feel free to add or correct. Like Chris said, we're three weeks into the quarter. We had a hurricane. We had a tech outage across the country. We had a number of things happen. So we're not kind of taking three weeks as a trend. We'll see kind of how things progress from here, in just terms of kind of what happens for the rest of the quarter. I don't know if you want to talk about the credit-debit divergence.\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Well, I think I'll refer back to a little bit of the comment that we made. We're seeing the July results. I also commented on the call that we are seeing a little bit of moderation in what I would call the lower spend-band cohorts. I think that's a little bit correlated to some of the volume numbers that we're seeing in the quarter related to credit versus debit. But all in all, when we look at it relative to, again, Q2 and Q3, we see it to be relatively stable once you factor in sort of the days mix with the leap year.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on new flows here. So you had a nice acceleration in growth really over the last two quarters on consistent comps. Can you add more color on the particular areas of strength that have picked up? I know Visa Direct was one of those. I'm just curious if you think you could sustain that level of expansion or may that moderate a bit?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Yeah, 18% growth. As I mentioned, feel really good about the execution and the momentum in the business. It is an enormous opportunity that we have in front of us across both our commercial business and money movement with Visa Direct. I think you're familiar with the numbers: 41% growth in the transactions and stable commercial volumes as well. I think what this acceleration that you're referring to, we had a unique situation in Q1 where we had some one-time items that really kind of depressed the growth, the reported growth in Q1.\nIf you look at the last couple of quarters, it's more reflective, I think, of the underlying health in the business. That said, as we saw in Q1, that growth rate can vary from quarter to quarter based on deal timing, terms, and one-time items like the one that impacted Q1. So overall, I'd say at the macro level, good momentum, the underlying business is healthy, and we're continuing to see that level of growth. The growth rate should be healthier and should continue to grow faster than consumer payments with some normal expected variability quarter to quarter.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nJust to build on Chris's points, I just think we're in the very early stages of Visa Direct growth. We spent many, many years investing in building the platform, the infrastructure, the connectivity, domestic, cross-border, working with issuers, acquirers, and processors. Now we're able to be out there selling all around the world, finding new use cases, some of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks. You go back to 2019. We did 2 billion Visa Direct transactions. We did 2.6 billion transactions this quarter.\nSo I think this is just another great example of when we go and we systematically identify the need in the market, we spend the time, we build the infrastructure, we build 8.5 billion endpoints, the connectivity, the reliability, the security, the fraud capabilities. I just think we're in the very early stages of what we're going to see in terms of the growth of this business and the number of use cases and partners, many of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks that are going to want to build their use cases on this platform.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.",
    "content2": "Sanjay Sakhrani\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. I guess most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just on that last point, Ryan, you were making, I'm just wondering, where are we in the evolution of yields there? Can those go higher as you continue to expand in some of those categories with Visa Direct? And then just in terms of Reg II, is the full impact of Reg II now in the run rate, or should we expect there to be any uncertainties related to that? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah, I'll take both of them. On the first one, we're still in the early evolution of the use cases. I mean, we weren't even talking about earned wage access a couple of years ago, Sanjay. And so I think we've got 65 or so use cases now on the platform. Our teams are finding new use cases all the time. So I think we're continuing to see the evolution of all that, and the economics of all that will play out.\nWhat I would point you back to is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the tremendous success we're having in cross-border. We've had great success in selling new use cases and driving cross-border transaction growth in Visa Direct. As you know, the yields are higher in cross-border given the value that we add. So again, feel good about all of that. Listen, I want to just emphasize in terms of Reg II, the e-commerce debit market is a very competitive market and is going to be competitive for as far as we can see. So while Chris noted, I think noted that the impact has remained the same.\nWe haven't seen any change in impact, and we're not expecting any change in impact for Q4. It is a competitive business. We are out there with clients day in and day out, helping them understand the benefits of processing transactions on Visa. And there are a lot of them, which is why we feel good so far in the evolution of Reg II about how we've been able to grow that business. We feel great about the capabilities that a Visa debit transaction offers, many of which I've talked about on these calls in the past. So we're out there. We're competing. We're selling. We're delivering our products. And we feel good about our win rate.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks, guys. So just a clarification on revenue and then a question on volumes for this fiscal year. So it sounds like for Q4, you're looking for revenue growth of, call it, 11% to 12%. I think that would put you at the low end of the low double-digit guide you're maintaining for the year. So that's what I wanted to clarify. And then just a question on volumes. I think you said Q4 should be in line with Q3, which I think would bring the full year to around 7% versus the high single-digit updated guide last quarter. So just as we start to tune our models for next year, what are some of the potential accelerants off that 7% level we should be considering?\n\nChris Suh\n\nCFO, Visa\n\nYeah. Hi, Jason. Let's unpack that. You had a couple of things in there, and I just want to, I think this is important, so we'll just be super clear. For Q4, our guidance for Q4 adjusted net revenue would be low double digits. And sort of the directional guidance I also gave is it'd be slightly above the Q3 level that we reported, which was the 10% growth in the quarter. And so sort of take those two points, and I would triangulate around that. And that would still get you sort of to the math of the low end of low double digits, as you called it, for the full year. The second point was on drivers from Q3 to Q4.\nI did say that payment volume, payment transactions, we anticipate Q4 to be consistent with Q3. The one exception to that is in cross-border, where I did say it'd be slightly below the Q3 levels. And that really is based on the travel circumstances and situation in Asia that we've talked about extensively, with outbound travel in Asia in particular being impacted and recovering slower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nAnd so those are the two variables in terms of to get the Q4 guidance consistent with the intended intent that I communicated. And then as far as FY25 goes, we're at the beginning end of planning. And as we always do, we'll share our expectations on '25 at the end of Q4.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Perlin\n\nFinancial Technology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. I guess more of a big picture question here, Ryan. So your AI and GenAI investments, you've talked about, I think, at conferences, your desire to kind of build out your own large language model. So I'm wondering, one, where do those investments stand today? I guess, two, what would be your expectation for early use cases of those investments and kind of the payback period? And then, three, is there an opportunity to drive true incremental sales or better outcomes for your merchant constituents as opposed to just the banks? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nYeah. Hey, Dan, thanks for the question on AI. First of all, I'd frame it as we are all in on GenAI at Visa as we've been all in on predictive AI for more than a decade. We're applying it in two broad-based different ways. One is kind of adopting across the company to drive productivity. And we're seeing real results there. We're seeing great results, great adoption, great productivity increases from technology to accounting to sales all across the company. The second is applying generative AI to enhance the entire payment ecosystem.\nTo the latter part of your question, absolutely. I guess I'd give you one set of examples or some of the risk tools and capabilities that we've been deploying in the market. I mentioned the risk products that we're using on RTP and account-to-account payments. That is an opportunity to reduce fraud both for merchants and for issuers. I think I mentioned on a previous call, we have our Visa Provisioning Intelligence service, which is using artificial intelligence to help predict token provisioning fraud before it happens. That also is a benefit to both issuers and merchants.\nThe list goes on. We are very optimistic about the positive impact that generative AI can have, not just on our own productivity, but on our ability to help drive increased sales, and lower fraud across the ecosystem.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWe'll do one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our final question, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nHarshita Rawat\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGood afternoon. Ryan, Chris, US card volume growth of 5% and on the surface kind of suggests a little bit more for mature market. Now, I understand there are category differences between card volume growth and VC growth, which influence the delta here. Ryan, you discussed your global DAM estimate of $20 trillion in consumer payments for Visa. How should we think about the circular digitization opportunity and the growth algorithm for the US, which is your biggest market? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nCEO, Visa\n\nOkay. It was a little hard for us to hear you, Harshita, but I think I got the gist of your question around the growth algorithm for consumer payments, especially in mature markets. So as I've said before, we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity around the world. About 1/4 of that is in the US, by the way. That's cash, that's check, that's ACH, that's electronic transactions, that's cards that run on domestic networks and the like. We're capturing that opportunity through a few different ways. One is continuing to expand acceptance and expand the places where people can use cards. In the US, rent would be a great example.\nWe've been having some really good success penetrating the rent vertical. The second is making it easier to drive e-commerce growth and e-commerce transactions, which has an outsize impact on our ability to drive growth on Visa for those types of things. Third is just continuing to innovate with new products and services that make our issuers want to issue Visa and consumers want to use them.\nWe announced a full slate of new product innovations at our Visa Payments Forum this year. Those are the types of products that we believe are going to help us win in the marketplace and help us capture and digitize a big chunk of that opportunity on the Visa network.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nSVP and Global Head of Investor Relations, Visa\n\nWith that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or email our investor relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for participating in the Visa Fiscal Q3 2024 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time, and please enjoy the rest of your day."

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.\nFor non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney\n\nPresident, Visa, Inc.\n\nHi, everyone. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Our financial performance in the second quarter of 2023 was very strong with net revenues up 11% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17%. Overall, our global quarterly payments volume was up 13% year-over-year, excluding Russia and China.\nIn the U.S., quarterly payments volume was up 10%. Outside the U.S., excluding China and Russia, payments volume was up 17.5%. Excluding intra-Europe, total cross-border volume remained strong, up 32%, with cross-border travel volume at 130% of 2019.\nProcess transactions grew 12% year-over-year. We remain confident that our strategy is focused on the right opportunities. In the second quarter, this strategy continued to deliver, driving strong growth through consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. I'll talk briefly about our progress in each area.\nLet's start with consumer payments. Consumer payments remains a massive opportunity for Visa. Even with all the digitization over the last several decades, there is still a tremendous amount of cash and check spent globally. There is a very long runway for growth in this business.\nIn consumer payments, the flywheel has 3 parts: grow credentials, more buyers on the network; grow acceptance, more sellers on the network; and drive engagement, more transactions. We continue to grow credentials, up 7% year-over-year through December and 11% excluding Russia. And we now have more than 6 billion tokenized credentials, up nearly 90% from last year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow acceptance with over 100 million merchant locations worldwide. And tap to pay continues to be a powerful driver of engagement.\nGlobally, 74% of all face-to-face transactions outside the U.S. are now taps. In the U.S., we're at 34%, up 7x from 3 years ago and up more than 10 percentage points from last year.\nA couple of highlights in the second quarter include U.S. quick service restaurants, where penetration surpassed 40%. And in key metro areas across the United States, we continue to see great traction beyond the success in New York and San Francisco, L.A., Detroit, Seattle, San Diego and Oakland to Miami are all now over 40%.\nMass transit continues to be one of the best ways to get people used to tapping, and we've set records. In the first half of 2023, we processed more than 745 million Visa tap to ride transactions globally, up 35% over the first half of last year. We've enabled 55 new transit systems, bringing our footprint to over 650.\nWe also had some significant client wins in the quarter. Starting in North America, we are pleased to have renewed a multiyear agreement with TD, a top 10 North American bank for continued Visa credit and debit issuance in both Canada and the U.S.\nIn Canada, we renewed our relationship with CIBC with a new multiyear agreement for Visa credit issuance. We renewed our partnership with Marqeta, a leading fintech issuer processor and MoneyGram who is utilizing Visa Direct for cross-border money movement and just recently signed a consumer debit agreement.\nIn Asia Pacific, UOB, one of the leading banks in Asia, has renewed and expanded its relationship with us in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam for both credit and debit cards. OCBC Bank, the second largest bank in Singapore by market cap, renewed its flagship product and portfolio with us, the OCBC 365 credit card.\nMUFG Bank, the banking arm of Japan's largest financial group, renewed its long-term debit partnership. Chunghwa Post, Taiwan's post office and the largest debit issuer in Taiwan, has renewed its long-term exclusive partnership with Visa. And in India, we're very excited about a long-term consumer credit contract with Axis Bank, targeting new affluent customer segments.\nAdditionally, I want to highlight an exciting new product innovation that we launched in Japan with our long-time partner, SMBC. It is a single, flexible credential that a consumer can choose to use as a debit, credit or prepaid card. SMBC calls the product, Olive, and we think it could meaningfully enhance the buying experience for SMBC customers and users in many other countries around the world.\nNow to Europe. In Germany, we've signed a co-brand deal with Solaris and ADAC, which is Germany's largest automobile association with 21 million members. Visa is excited to be the new network of choice for one of the country's largest co-brand portfolios.\nIn Israel, we renewed and expanded our relationship with our largest issuer, Bank Leumi. In Belgium, we recently reached agreements with 6 issuers to migrate over 2.6 million debit cards to Visa in the next few years, bringing our country total since 2021 to 6.5 million new Visa debit cards.\nAnd finally, in Latin America, from December 2019 to 2022, we have grown our credentials by 1.5x and our merchant locations by almost 2.5x. Over that time period, the percentage of our total volume that is point-of-sale payments versus getting cash out of an ATM has grown from 46% to 59%, demonstrating the cash digitization happening in the region.\nIn Colombia, we're pleased to partner on a co-brand with LATAM Airlines, the largest airline in Latin America. We continue to strengthen our position in Brazil, renewing our partnership with Itau, the largest private bank in the country. We also announced a new strategic deal with Banco de Brasilia that expands upon our existing agreement, including a popular credit program issued in partnership with one of Brazil's leading football teams with over 40 million fans.\nAlso in Brazil, WhatsApp had already launched peer-to-peer service to facilitate money transfer using Visa Direct. And recently, they announced they will be offering payments from consumers to small businesses as well.\nAnd more and more, we see clients work with Visa on multiple levels across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Natura, the world's fourth largest beauty group with 4-point -- I'm sorry, 4 million beauty consultants in Latin America is a recent example. In 2020, we announced a deal with them, and we just renewed our agreement, which includes digital issuance of a Visa business credential and adds acceptance innovations as well as CyberSource risk management solutions.\nThus far in Brazil, we've issued card to almost 50% of the Natura consultants and we love working with clients that take advantage of our full range of solutions. It's Visa at our best, serving clients in multiple ways across our growth levers.\nNow let me turn to new flows. The potential payment volume opportunity in new flows is enormous, 10x that of consumer payments. New flows revenue in our second quarter grew more than 20% in constant dollars, excluding Russia. Commercial volume was up 15% in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions were up 32%, excluding Russia.\nWe've been winning in new flows by executing our network of network strategy. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new network called Visa Plus that further extends our network of networks. This new network allows users to send and receive payments among different P2P apps through a personalized payment address, a Visa Plus pay name. This enables P2P payments from 1 app directly to another app as well as gig, creator and marketplace payouts. This can be done through an app, a neobank or a wallet. We're connecting end points and form factors and enabling interoperability, our network of network strategy at work. We're launching pilots with several partners, including Venmo, PayPal, TabaPay and Western Union with more to come soon.\nLet me now turn to Visa Direct. Visa Direct is also a great example of our network of networks. Visa Direct utilizes 66 ACH networks, 11 RTP networks, 16 card-based networks and 5 gateways with the potential to reach nearly 7 billion endpoints globally.\nWe continue to grow Visa Direct with new use cases and partners. For example, in Peru, Banco de Credito del Peru, BBVA, Interbank and Scotiabank chose Visa Direct as their preferred network and YellowPepper is their technology enabler for the interoperability among their wallets and payment apps.\nLast year, we announced our agreement with the payments infrastructure platform Thunes to add send to wallet capabilities to Visa Direct. Similarly, this quarter, our cross-border reach continued to grow, expanding coverage to 32 new wallet providers across 22 countries by connecting to TerraPay, a leading cross-border payments infrastructure company. Together, Visa Direct and TerraPay can enable P2P remittances for individuals as well as business payouts through accounts, wallets and cards.\nEnablers remain an important part of our strategy, and we're partnering with Fiserv to expand on their U.S. domestic Visa Direct business by commercially launching cross-border capabilities for their clients starting with outbound payouts.\nI'll mention 2 other recent cross-border agreements. We signed a deal with Brightwell, a global payments technology company to leverage Visa Direct to expand cross-border remittances and payout capabilities for their customers in over 175 countries across a variety of industries such as travel and financial services. And earlier this quarter, PayPal's Zoom announced that customers in the United States can send money directly to an eligible Visa debit card in 25 countries utilizing Visa Direct. In the second quarter, Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions, excluding Russia, grew nearly 50%.\nWhile Visa Direct is growing fast, B2B is the largest component of new flows. And traditional issuance is the core of what we do today in B2B, comprising the majority of the over $760 billion in commercial payments volume year-to-date.\nI'll highlight 3 important issuance deals. In Colombia, we renewed with Grupo Bancolombia, the largest issuer and acquirer in the country for commercial credit and prepaid as well as consumer credit. Financial Technology platform, Adyen, has expanded its offerings with a Visa commercial card initially targeted to its global merchant customers. Visa and Stripe's issuing partnership offers card issuance to enterprise and start-up consumers in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe.\nAnd for cross-border B2B money movement, which you all know is about Visa B2B Connect a solution that seeks to deliver predictability, speed, reliability, efficiency, data and flexibility to our clients.\nWe're building an entirely new network, and we're making progress. Over the last 6 months, we've signed nearly 30 banks in more than 20 countries and payments have been routed to 90 countries globally. And there are several areas for additional expansion in B2B such as new capabilities, new geographies and new verticals.\nToday, I'll talk about 2 verticals, fleet and fuel, and agriculture. In fleet and fuel, we're seeing a big shift in this vertical where the historically closed loop systems are opening up and receiving the benefits of our investment and innovation. For example, the Standard Bank in South Africa will issue Visa fleet cards in South Africa with plans to roll out across 4 additional priority markets across Africa in 2024. Over the past 2 years, Visa has signed or launched fleet-focused solutions for over a dozen providers with more to come.\nIn Latin America, we're bringing our innovative capabilities to an untapped vertical, the agriculture industry. Agriculture represents nearly 15% of the workforce and nearly 25% of the exports in the region, which supplies nearly 15% of the world's food production. Visa has developed a solution called Visa Agro. It provides credit access to farmers in advance of their harvest so that they can buy inputs using Visa credentials with payment periods aligned with their production cycle. Visa Agro is live in 6 countries through partnerships with banks, fintechs, processors and marketplaces.\nNow we'll touch on value-added services. Value-added services are equally important to Visa's accelerated growth. By offering compelling value-added services, we help to grow our clients' businesses and deepen our relationships with these clients, increase the yields on our own network volumes and expand beyond our own network by adding value to non-Visa transactions.\nOur existing suite of value-added services is impressive. In the second quarter, we had about $1.7 billion in value-added services revenue, up 20% in constant dollars. And our clients continue to add value-added services. An example is Wells Fargo. As they modernize their acquiring solutions, they're working with CyberSource to offer enhanced product features and functionality for their merchant services customers. Or in Europe, fiscal year-to-date, we've signed on nearly 80% more clients than last year across 11 countries in our popular risk products, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, which together delivered increased transactions through higher authorization rates while also lowering fraud.\nOur network products, which includes services such as account and address verification, stop payments and smarter stand-in processing continued to grow at a rapid pace with nearly 500 clients added year-to-date globally.\nWe also have enhanced and developed new value-added services, which are helping to drive growth and innovation. I'll briefly share 3 examples: Visa Acceptance Cloud, managed services and risk as a service. We spoke about Visa Acceptance Cloud last year, which moves embedded payment processing from individual devices to the cloud. It eliminates the need for expensive terminals as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. I'm pleased to share that First National Bank in South Africa has launched this solution and Visa expects more pilots to follow soon globally.\nNext is managed services, part of our advisory solutions, which is when we embed Visa employees with subject matter expertise within a client's organization to execute on a specific actionable project such as an ongoing management of risk and fraud parameters, product implementations or execution of customer engagement strategies.\nFor example, one issuer for whom we provided end-to-end campaign execution enjoyed a 15% lift in spend and a 40% increase in activation. Managed services are bringing strong results for our clients and growing revenue twice as fast as our core advisory business through the second quarter.\nFinally, our risk as a service offerings also continue to be utilized, powered by network level data, AI capabilities and our risk experts. For example, our AI and machine learning-enabled monitoring service identify suspicious decline activity. For 1 client, we were able to identify a scheme where fraudsters were testing for valid accounts, and then using the accounts to make fraudulent purchases.\nVisa blocked over $7 million in attempted fraud in just 1 month on behalf of this client. This is just 1 example, but you can see how these risk services enable us to both help our clients and generate revenue for Visa. Since launching 6 months ago, we've added nearly a dozen direct clients across 3 regions with a very active pipeline.\nIn closing, as you all know, I've been at Visa for nearly a decade. And I can say I've never been more excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling strategy, a world-class team, fantastic clients and an incredible set of capabilities that I believe are second to none. While the current environment still feels uncertain, we have contingency plans ready and are prepared to take action as needed. We're constantly seeking the right balance between the realities of the short term with the enormous opportunities ahead.\nSo with that, now Vasant will lead us through the financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the rest of the year.\n\nVasant Prabhu\n\nEVP & CFO, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In our fiscal second quarter, net revenues were up 11% and GAAP EPS up 20%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. In constant dollars, net revenues grew 13% and non-GAAP EPS grew 20%.\nAdjusted for the discontinuation of operations in Russia, net revenue growth was around 18% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations due to strong value-added services and new flows growth, high currency volatility and lower-than-anticipated client incentives.\nA few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10%. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 13%. As a reminder, January and the early part of February lapped Omicron impacts last year.\nIndex to 2019, excluding China and Russia, Global Payments volume was up 61%, which is a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12.5% over the pandemic years. U.S. payments volume was up 10% year-over-year, again helped by lapping the Omicron impact last year. Relative to 2019, U.S. payments volume was up 58%, compounding at 12% over the pandemic years.\nThe cross-border travel recovery continues at the pace we expected, indexing at 130 versus 4 years ago, a 5-point improvement from Q1. As expected, the rebound in Asia is now the primary driver. Travel in and out of Asia reached 2019 levels in the quarter and travel into the U.S. was very close.\nWe believe there is more recovery to come. Travel from Mainland China has mostly benefited other parts of Asia so far, but early bookings suggest strong interest in Europe as the summer approaches.\nOur new flows and value-added services businesses continue to power ahead. Excluding Russia and in constant dollars, both businesses grew revenues at or about 20%. In the second quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $2.2 billion in stock at an average cost of $222.09 and distributed $941 million in dividends.\nNow onto the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10.5% year-over-year, slightly faster than first quarter. U.S. debit grew 9.6%, up more than 1 point from Q1. U.S. card-present spend grew 8%, U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9%.\nAs we look at the monthly cadence in the U.S. through the quarter, January and the early part of February benefited from lapping Omicron to varying degrees. In March, payments volume growth ticked down and has remained at similar growth levels through the first 3 weeks of April. The primary driver of the tick down in the growth rate has been U.S. ticket size, while transaction growth remains in line with Q1 levels at around 8%.\nTicket size was up over 1% year-over-year in the first quarter and is down about 2% in March through April 21. Ticket sizes are declining as inflation moderates.\nMost notably, starting in March and through the summer, we will be lapping the peaks in fuel prices last year. For example, in March 2023, fuel prices were nearly 20% lower than last year. In 2022, fuel prices continue to rise through spring and peaked in June.\nAlso contributing is discounting in particular retail goods channels. You have heard various U.S. retailers comment publicly about price cuts they are implementing to clear out inventory or pass on reductions in costs. Across other categories of spend in the U.S., payments volume growth remained strong in services, in particular, travel and entertainment. Nondiscretionary spend growth in categories like food and drug is also holding up well.\nAnother factor that is a potential drag on U.S. payments volume growth starting in March and through April is the impact of lapping higher tax refunds. Refunds are largely spent in the few weeks post receipt. Based on IRS reported data through April 14, tax refunds are 11% lower this year. We expect this headwind to abate as we get into May.\nMoving on to international markets. In constant dollars, international payments volume growth rate was strong through the quarter in the major markets. Latin America was up 27% due to improved growth in Mexico and the South Cone. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 29%. Europe was up 13%. Excluding the U.K., Europe volumes grew 31%, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding portfolio conversion, volume trends in the U.K. improved.\nAsia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 17%. Global process transactions are up 12%. Constant dollar cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior periods were up 32% year-over-year and up 46% versus 4 years ago.\nExcluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 3 points and the index 4 years ago was higher by 5 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 6% year-over-year and was 77% above 2019.\nAdjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card not present, excluding travel and intra-Europe, represented over 40% of total cross-border volumes in the second quarter. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 59% year-over-year. The cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe, indexed to 4 years ago, went from 129 in December to 134 in March, or up 5 points.\nTravel into Asia now exceeds 2019 levels, while travel out of Asia is around 2019 levels, improving 13 and 11 points, respectively, from the first quarter versus 4 years ago. Travel out of Mainland China is a key driver to watch. With airline capacity coming back fast and streamlined visa issuance, Southeast Asia has been the biggest beneficiary of travel from Mainland China.\nThis is beginning to change as airline capacity is added in other corridors, especially Europe, and COVID-related requirements are eased. We expect the recovery of Asian and, in particular, Chinese travel to be a key driver of the final leg of the cross-border recovery.\nTravel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the low 150s indexed to 2019. Travel inbound to the U.S. is still hovering just under 2019 levels. A strong U.S. dollar, travel Visa backlog and COVID restrictions have been dragged from the recovery but all are beginning to ease.\nEurope, excluding intra-Europe, inbound and outbound, remained strong with the travel index to 2019 in the low 130s for outbound and high 140s for inbound. Traveling to Latin America and the Caribbean also remained very strong, indexing in the low 160s to 2019 levels.\nTravels in and out of CEMEA index in the high 140s versus 4 years ago with outbound up more than 5 points from the first quarter and inbound up by about 10 points.\nMoving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Service revenue grew 7% versus the 7% growth in first quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix and pricing. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% processed transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transaction growth is not. Adjusting for Russia, data processing revenues were up 14%, helped by value-added services strength.\nInternational transaction revenues were up 24% versus the 32% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the first quarter and pricing actions, offset by exchange rate shifts and business mix.\nOther revenues grew 16%, led by marketing and consulting services as well as benefiting from acquisitions. Client incentives were 26.7% of gross revenues below expectations due to some deal timing, client performance and other items.\nRevenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the strength in domestic volume, transactions and cross-border volume as well as high currency volatility. New flows revenue grew over 20%, excluding Russia in constant dollars. Commercial volumes were up 15% in constant dollars and 60% over 4 years ago. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 32%. Value-added services revenue grew 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 13%, led primarily by personnel expenses from headcount additions over the past year.\nExcluding losses from our equity investments of around $90 million, non-GAAP nonoperating income was $32 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and a few other items.\nOur GAAP tax rate was 19.3% and non-GAAP was 19.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.03, non-GAAP EPS was $2.09, up 17% over last year, inclusive of a 3-point drag from the stronger dollar.\nThrough the first 3 weeks of April, U.S. payments volume was up 6%, with debit up 6% and credit also up 6%. Compared to 4 years ago, they are up 54%, 63% and 45%, respectively.\nIn key markets around the world, we saw continued strength. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year and up 50% above 4 years ago.\nConstant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 28% and was 47% above 4 years ago. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 77% above 4 years ago, travel-related cross-border volumes were 31% over 4 years ago.\nMoving now to our outlook for the third quarter. Growth in domestic payments volumes remained stable around the globe. As we said last quarter, the recovery from COVID is behind us now for domestic volumes. Post the Omicron impact from last year in January and February, U.S. domestic volume growth rates have ticked down in March driven by the factors we discussed earlier. We believe that some of these factors will persist through the third quarter. As such, we are assuming March and April trends will continue in the U.S. for the rest of the quarter.\nIn aggregate, we expect the international growth trajectory remains largely unchanged from the second quarter. On the cross-border front, the travel recovery trend has been steady and generally in line with our expectations so far in fiscal year '23. The cross-border travel index to 2019, excluding intra-Europe, has been improving at a rate of 5 to 6 points each quarter. We're assuming this trend is sustained through the third quarter.\nThe big driver is recovery in Asia continuing, especially driven by Mainland China. We expect Chinese travel to extend beyond Asia to Europe as we enter the summer.\nOn the cross-border e-commerce front, we're also assuming recent trends continue adjusted for crypto-related volatility. It is important to note that even as the cross-border business continues to recover relative to 2019, the year-over-year growth rate will continue to slow down as it has over the past few quarters. Also, currency volatility is moderating, and we are now lapping very high currency volatilities from the third quarter of last year.\nOur value-added services and new flows businesses have grown much faster than our consumer payments business. Sustaining faster growth rates for these businesses remains a critical priority.\nClient incentives growth is expected to be higher in the second half than it was in the first. This was driven by some delays in renewals that were expected in the first half as well as some significant renewals that were anticipated in fiscal year '24, but are now happening in the second half fiscal year '23.\nIn the first half, client incentives as a percent of gross revenue was below our outlook range of 26.5% to 27.5%. In the second half, this percentage is likely to run above the high end of the range. We expect to finish the year in the upper half of the 26.5% to 27.5% range.\nWhen you put all this together, third quarter net revenue growth is expected to be in the low double digits inclusive of an approximately 1 point drag from exchange rates. As we indicated previously, non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to moderate through the year. Our expectations remain unchanged.\nQ3 non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be 2 to 3 points lower than the second quarter, inclusive of an exchange rate impact, which may add 0.5 point to growth. And Q4 non-GAAP operating expense growth will likely be another 2 to 3 points lower than Q3.\nNon-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. Nonoperating income will continue to benefit from the attractive rates we are earning on our cash balances. As you know, short-term rates have been high lately, which is very helpful, given that we always have very low durations on our cash balances.\nInterest income from cash will likely offset interest expense from debt by $5 million to $10 million in the third quarter. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in the third quarter.\nAs we've said previously, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business slowing revenue growth below our assumptions, we will, of course, adjust our spending plan by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories.\nIn summary, as Ryan said, Visa today has 3 robust growth engines: consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Our results in the second quarter attest that growth remains healthy across all 3 businesses. The opportunity is vast and the runway for growth remains long.\nWith that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nThanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations.

Visa's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects stable domestic volumes and transactions and a continued recovery of cross-border travel. Total Q1 payments volume was up 7% year-over-year or 135% versus 3 years ago, flat with Q4. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 12% or 146% of 2019. U.S. Q1 payments volume was up 9% year-over-year or 144% of 2019, down 1 point from Q4.\nInternational volume, excluding Russia and China, was up 15% or 147% of 2019, up 1 point from Q4. Q1 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, grew 31% year-over-year and 132% versus 3 years ago, up 5 points from Q4. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by 4 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 6 points from 112% of 2019 in Q4 to 118% in Q1, driven by Asia Pacific, helped by China lifting restrictions, continued modest improvements inbound into the United States and CEMEA benefiting from the FIFA World Cup.\nProcessed transactions were up 10% year-over-year or 139% versus 2019, and we processed 571 million transactions a day during the quarter. Although first quarter net revenues grew -- altogether, I should say, first quarter net revenues grew 12% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21%. In each of our growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, we saw strong revenue growth. In our consumer payments business, we made significant progress this quarter through large deals with traditional issuers and co-brands. And with the pandemic largely behind us, we saw many businesses focused on payments through Visa's new flows capabilities. In addition, we continued to develop and expand our global value-added services globally.\nNow let me explore each of these growth areas. In consumer payments, credentials grew 8% overall, 11% excluding Russia, with strong double-digit growth in the United States, India and Brazil. Tap-to-pay penetration of face-to-face transactions globally was 72%, excluding Russia and the United States. In the United States, we surpassed a notable 30%, with San Jose, San Francisco and New York City all above 50%. U.S. drugstores went above 40% for the first time in the United States, and nearly 65% of Costco's face-to-face credit transactions were made with a tap.\nIn the United States, we had several important renewals. First, we renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States, maintaining our current debit and credit business, including their Cash Rewards, Travel Rewards, Premium Rewards and newly launched Premium Rewards Elite consumer credit cards. We're excited to continue to invest together in the growth of our joint business and to innovate with Bank of America to deliver enhanced capabilities and improved experiences for their customers.\nSecond, we renewed with Commerce Bank, a top 25 Visa U.S. issuer across their consumer and commercial portfolios. Finally, we also renewed our agreement with Capital One. In Australia, we renewed our agreement with the country's largest independent payment solutions provider, Costco, with over 4 million cardholders for debit and prepaid and also signed a new agreement for credit issuance. Also in the region, we extended our exclusive relationship with Kiwibank, the largest New Zealand-owned bank.\nIn Latin America, we renewed with ICBC Argentina, one of the largest issuers in the country, and with Banco do Brasil, one of the largest Visa issuers in the region. In addition, we entered into a new agreement with one of the largest banks in Panama, Banco Nacional de Panamá. Also in Latin America, we reached a new strategic deal with fintech platform, Tigo Money, and parent company, Millicom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the region. Visa and Millicom expect to offer Tigo Money's more than 5 million wallet users the ability to digitize their cash in an easy and secure way, making purchases wherever Visa is accepted with the Visa Tigo Money access card.\nAnother strategic fintech deal was with NEO in India, a fast-growing cross-border-focused neobank with 5 million customers. We've extended our relationship from debit into credit to grow cross-border spending with affluent as well as corporate customers. We're also happy to share that we renewed and extended our global partnership with HSBC. Our agreement covers consumer and commercial and it will foster growth and digital acceleration. This deal also cuts across all of Visa's 5 regions.\nAs you know, Visa is the leader in travel co-brands globally, and I'm happy to report that we recently reached agreements with 3 important travel relationships. First, Qatar Airways' Privilege Club, which today has a split portfolio across networks around the world, has signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with Visa to enhance and expand its portfolio of co-branded payment initiatives with key financial partners across key markets worldwide. This expanded partnership creates a new world of opportunities for our Visa customers and Privilege Club members to collect and spend Avios, the rewards currency of Privilege Club.\nSecond, with Southwest Airlines in the United States, Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for their co-brand credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. It represents one of the largest co-brand partnerships in the world. Third, with Star Alliance and HSBC in Australia, this is the world's first credit card created with an airline alliance and is issued exclusively on Visa Credit. At the time of the launch, it brought together 7 Star Alliance carriers in a single credit card platform.\nAlso, we recently advanced our co-brand partnership with Flipkart, one of India's leading digital commerce entities with a registered customer base of 450 million. So whether it's with traditional issuers or co-brand partners, we are continuing to position Visa well for the future.\nOn to new flows, where this past quarter, new flows continued to grow with revenue up more than 20% in constant dollars led by strong growth in B2B payments volume and Visa Direct transactions. First, on the Visa Direct side, Visa Direct had 1.9 billion transactions in Q1, up 39% year-over-year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow globally. Non-U.S. Visa Direct transactions as a percentage of total transactions expanded nearly 20 points, excluding Russia, from Q1 '21 to Q1 '23. Building on the success of our remittance program with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, we recently launched Malaysia as an additional origination market spanning across 6 currency payers with more currencies to come.\nWe also continue to bring existing use cases to new markets. First, in Australia, Visa Direct is now enabling driver payouts with DoorDash. Second, we launched our inaugural P2P program in South Africa with FNB, one of the country's largest banks, to enable their 10 million active customers to move money within their mobile app using Visa Direct rails. Third, we launched our wallet cash payout program in Bangladesh with bKash. With this launch, the nearly 65 million bKash users can make wallet to money bank transfers, 24/7 in near real time using Visa Direct.\nWe are enabling several use cases, including seller payouts in the United States on Poshmark, a social media marketplace where more than 80 million registered users, and card top-offs with fintech GoHenry. As a follow-on to the issuance deal we announced last quarter with them, GoHenry is enabling its members to top up their child's prepaid Visa card with Visa Direct first in the U.K., with plans to expand this service across Europe in the future.\nIn addition to Visa Direct, we had noteworthy developments in the B2B space this past quarter, where commercial payments volume grew 15% in constant dollars. In traditional issuance, we signed an agreement with Raiffeisen Bank for a new commercial credit partnership in addition to renewing customer -- consumer credit across their 3 million clients in Austria. And in the United States, we renewed with UBS for consumer credit and debit as well as several business credit portfolios and Visa Spend Clarity for Business. Another issuing partnership was with Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil focused on small businesses. Stone has recently become a Visa debit and credit issuer of cards that could be embedded digitally in its wallet.\nOn the virtual card front, for accounts receivable and payable, we completed several agreements. First, Divvy, an expense management platform owned by Bill, has renewed its agreement to offer Visa virtual cards for small and midsized businesses in the United States as part of its expense and vendor payment solutions. Second, Viewpost converts U.S.-based B2B check payments to Visa virtual cards. And together, we are expanding card opportunities for issuers and corporates by offering a solution that can be deployed easily to every commercial business that still produces checks.\nThird, we've reached an agreement with Plate IQ, a leading end-to-end accounts payable automation provider in the United States with direct integrations to accounting systems. Plate IQ will be offering a Visa virtual card solution to commercial partners across multiple industries including restaurants and hospitality, retail and accounting and bookkeeping among others. Fourth, in our Asia Pacific region, SUNRATE, a global payment and treasury management platform has launched Visa virtual cards as part of its solution for more than 1,000 B2B clients, including global online travel agencies and small business customers.\nFleet issuance continues to grow as well. This quarter, we issued -- we signed with Zemo, a European fleet and mobility solutions provider to issue Visa open loop fleet and fuel commercial cards as they expand from 3 European markets to 10. In the United States, Highnote, a cloud-native card issuance and embedded finance platform, expanded its relationship with Visa with a 5-year card issuance agreement across credit, debit, virtual solutions and fleet. In addition, Highnote became certified as a Visa fleet card processor, which provides businesses with more specific product category level controls and more detailed and faster data for real-time decisions on new fleet and fuel card programs.\nB2B is an active space for fintechs, and Visa continues to partner with new players to drive innovation for businesses. A recent example is Konfio, a fintech in Mexico that has already issued approximately 50,000 Visa small business cards and recently expanded its agreement to issue Visa Business Infinite cards. In addition, they are positioned to grow acceptance in the market with their newly established acquiring business, Sr. Pago.\nNow moving to value-added services, which had about $1.7 billion in revenue this first quarter, up more than 20% in constant dollars. Remember that our focus for value-added services is threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build and launch new solutions; and three, to expand geographically. CyberSource is a great example on all 3 areas of focus. First, on deepening client penetration of existing products. CyberSource's Decision Manager offering provides broad capabilities to existing CyberSource clients and has experienced strong growth throughout the pandemic, more than doubling transactions in the last 3 years. In Q1, transactions utilizing Decision Manager grew in the low teens year-over-year, demonstrating the continued demand for this solution even as we enter a post-pandemic environment.\nAnother area of growth we have mentioned is with acquirers who utilize CyberSource's capabilities to offer them to their merchant clients. In Q1, we signed agreements with several acquirers for gateway services, including Elavon in North America. In Saudi Arabia, Saudi British Bank has announced its strategic partnership with our CyberSource payment gateway and risk platform to enhance the overall capabilities of SABB's payment gateway with the aim of fostering the bank's growth in an evolving and dynamic e-commerce space.\nOn extended geographically, we've continued our efforts to strengthen our global presence. Our non-U.S. CyberSource transactions have nearly quadrupled since the first quarter of 2019, and they now comprise the majority of our transactions led in particular by the Asia Pacific region. CyberSource has also created new offerings. While historically CyberSource has been an e-commerce capability, over the past few years, we have accelerated the product development of our card-present and omnichannel offerings, including with the acquisition of Payworks back in 2019. In the past quarter, we saw nearly 50% of year-over-year increase in card-present authorized CyberSource transactions.\nOther value-added services highlights this quarter include our innovative dispute capability through Verifi, which saw nearly 40% growth in cases processed this quarter as we expanded globally with more than 1/3 of our cases from outside North America. This rapid dispute resolution solution automatically resolves disputes between merchants and issuers through the acquirer of rails, reduced the average time to resolve a dispute from 24 days to typically seconds.\nAnd Tink, our open banking platform continue to deepen and develop relationships across Europe. Tink recently signed a master agreement with BNP Paribas to be their main open banking and money movement services provider for millions of customers across Europe. Tink is already live with several businesses in the group. 3 million customers use Tink's money management, data enrichment and transactions products at BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and BNL in Italy. Tink has also renewed and expanded its commitment with ABN AMRO to integrate Tink's money manager and data enrichment products into the bank's app for more than 3 million customers.\nIn conclusion, in the first quarter, Visa delivered very strong results and continued to effectively execute our growth strategy. Vasant will go into detail on our thoughts for the rest of the year, but I'd like to make a few other brief closing comments.\nWe will continue to manage our business for the medium to long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth, all while being very mindful of the current environment. I continue to see a bright future for Visa as we look ahead to the rest of this year and beyond, and I believe we have the right strategy to continue to deliver great results. As we announced in November, effective February 1, 2023, I'll be stepping down as CEO and assuming the full-time role as Executive Chairman. I'm exceedingly grateful to the Board and leadership of Visa in addition to all of our passionate 26,500 employee colleagues who help make this job so rewarding. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished together since I started in 2016.\nRyan McInerney will become Visa's CEO, and I cannot think of a finer leader to continue to position Visa at the center of money movement in increasingly innovative ways. I worked side by side with Ryan for almost 6.5 years. He knows our business, our clients, and he is deeply respected by our employees. He and his team will do a great job, and I expect this transition to be totally seamless.\nWith that in mind and as Jennifer alluded to, I've asked Ryan to join the Q&A portion of our call today. But before that, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the second quarter and beyond.\n\nVasant M. Prabhu\n\nVice Chair & CFO, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect sustained growth in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 12%, GAAP EPS up 8%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 21%. The strong dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 3.5 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 4.5 points. Adjusted for Russia, net revenues were up almost 20% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations as value-added services and new flows growth were very strong, currency volatility stayed high and client incentives were lower than anticipated.\nA few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 46% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and 44% over 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 15% year-over-year and 47% above 2019. U.S. holiday spending growth was in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and up more than 41% versus 2019.\nE-commerce maintained its share of retail spending versus last year, up over 5 points since 2019. Spending continues to smooth out over the holiday season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday still significant shopping days but less important post pandemic. Holiday spending around the globe was generally consistent with U.S. trends.\nThe cross-border travel recovery continues. However, as expected, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, including Japan in October and now China in January. As a reminder, we saw a very sharp cross-border travel recovery in October and November of 2021, which we are lapping. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 6 points in the first quarter versus a 20-point gain in the third quarter of fiscal year '22 and 10 points in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22.\nNew plans and -- new flows and value-added services revenue sustained robust growth in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In the first quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $3.1 billion in stock at an average price of $198.74. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $350 million. We also distributed $945 million in dividends.\nNow on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10% year-over-year and 35% over 2019, lapping the credit recovery from last year and as compared sequentially to last quarter, impacted by retail spending and fuel prices. U.S. debit grew 8%, up sequentially over last quarter. Level with 2019, debit grew 55%, so standing significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. card-present spend grew 8% year-over-year, impacted by fuel prices and retail spend as compared sequentially to last quarter. U.S. card-present spend was 26% above 2019. U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and was 65% higher than 2019. E-commerce spend remains well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spending has recovered.\nOn the international front in constant dollars, Latin America was up 25% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 25% year-over-year and was 108% higher than 2019 as we saw all through FY '22 growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 10% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion that is now nearly complete in the U.K. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 28% year-over-year and was 71% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Ex portfolio conversions, volume trends in the U.K. remained stable.\nAsia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 16% year-over-year and 34% above 2019. Global processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe but including Russia in prior periods, were up 31% year-over-year and 32% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 4 points.\nCross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 3% year-over-year and was 55% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the first quarter. Cross-border travel spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 63% year-over-year and is now 18% above 2019. Cross-border travel, excluding Europe, index to 2019 went from 114 in September to 121 in December.\nTravel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter by more than 12 points from the mid-70s index to 2019 to 85 for outbound and more than 90 for inbound helped by Japan. Japan alone improved by about 50 points since opening its borders in October. With China lifting restrictions on January 8, we expect more recovery to come. Europe inbound and outbound remained strong, with the travel index to 2019 in the 120s for outbound and 130s for inbound, both up slightly from the fourth quarter.\nTravel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the low 140s index to 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter. Travel inbound to the U.S. approached 2019 levels and improved 4 points in the quarter, likely due to the weakening dollar. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the 130s and mid-120s, respectively, relative to 2019, with outbound up more than 10 points in the quarter and inbound by more than 15, helped by the FIFA World Cup.\nFinally, some color on Mainland China post the removal of COVID-zero policies. The 40-day Spring Festival season is underway in Mainland China, the world's largest travel event. Domestic travel is rising sharply. From a revenue standpoint, this will not contribute much. In terms of outbound mainland Chinese travel, this will pick up steam as more flight capacity is available, ticket prices moderate, new passports and visas are obtained, and restrictions are lifted in some corridors. The initial destinations for mainland Chinese visitors look to be Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, in particular, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Inbound travel to Mainland China has not increased much and may not until the COVID situation settles down.\nMoving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 10% versus the 10% growth in fourth quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 6% versus the 10% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 10%.\nInternational transaction revenues were up 29% versus the 31% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the fourth quarter and pricing actions, which were offset by exchange rate shifts.\nOther revenues grew 31%, led by marketing and consulting services, pricing actions and acquisitions. Client incentives were 26% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some adjustments based on client performance and other items. For the year, we expect to renew about 20% of our payments volume with a good amount already completed in the first quarter.\nRevenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility, and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows revenue growth was over 20% in constant dollars. Commercial card volumes grew 15% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 39%. Value-added services revenue was also up over 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. Non-GAAP operating expense growth was higher than expected primarily due to a smaller exchange rate benefit. The primary drivers of expense growth were personnel costs from hiring activity in the second half of last year and into the first quarter as well as G&A expenses driven by lower exchange rate benefits, higher travel and expenses from new acquisitions. Marketing increased 18%, primarily driven by the FIFA World Cup spend and client marketing.\nWe recorded losses from our equity investments of $106 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $7 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and some other items. Our tax rate was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax initiative coming in at 16% GAAP and 16.5% non-GAAP. GAAP EPS was $1.99. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar.\nThrough the first 3 weeks of February, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 14% with debit up 13% and credit up 14%. Lapping of Omicron-related weakness from last year has contributed to strong January month-to-date growth. The Omicron-related uptick will fade as we get into February. These trends are generally consistent with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 36% year-over-year and was 42% over 2019 and 32% over 2020. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 75% above 2019 and 52% above 2020. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 25% above 2019 and 20% above 2020.\nWe are now past the pandemic recovery stage on domestic volumes and transactions. As such, starting next quarter, we will no longer provide comparisons to 2019 for payments volumes and processed transactions. Since the cross-border recovery is still ongoing, we will continue to provide comparisons to 2019 for cross-border volumes through this calendar year.\nMoving now to our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are assuming that trends in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are sustained with some benefit from lapping Omicron in January last year. As a reminder, discontinuation of operations in Russia will impact reported payments volume growth rates in the second quarter. Russia will not impact reported processed transactions growth.\nCross-border e-commerce trends have been stable, too, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're assuming cross-border e-commerce growth rates sustained through the second quarter ex Russia and crypto. The cross-border travel recovery continued generally in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We are assuming recent trends to sustain into the second quarter. We expect most of the Mainland China travel recovery in the second half and beyond for reasons I outlined earlier. We expect outbound travel from Mainland China to recover first. The pace of inbound travel recovery will depend on the COVID situation.\nDiscontinuation of operations in Russia will reduce second quarter net revenue growth by almost 5 points since we recorded nearly 2 quarters' worth of service fees in the second quarter of fiscal year '22. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in the second quarter by about 2 points. When you put all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth in the second quarter on a run rate basis, i.e. adjusted for Russia. With an almost 5-point Russia impact and a 2-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar Q2 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits.\nClient incentives were below our 26.5% to 27.5% range of gross revenues in the first quarter. Second quarter client incentives are expected to run higher at the upper end of the range, finishing the first half in the middle of the range. As we indicated in October, operating expenses growth rates will moderate through the year as we reduce the rate of increase as well as lap higher levels from last year.\nIn the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be 2 to 3 points lower than the first quarter expense growth. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expense growth rate is expected to decline an additional 2 to 3 points, with a further 2 to 3-point reduction in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. We currently expect non-GAAP nonoperating expense to be in the $40 million to $50 million range in the second quarter, driven largely by higher interest income from our cash balances.\nOur tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range for the rest of the year. With a non-GAAP 16.5% rate in the first quarter, the full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 18.5% to 19%.\nAs we said last quarter, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions in the second half, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. We have contingency plans in place and will activate them should we need to.\nOur business has been resilient so far this year. Our first quarter performance has demonstrated strong consumer payments growth from cash digitization and client wins. New flows and value-added services momentum remains very strong. There is still much uncertainty from an economic standpoint in the months ahead. We will remain vigilant and ready to act. As we look past fiscal year '23, we remain as optimistic as we've ever been about the long-term growth potential of our business.\nBefore I finish, this is a sad day for me personally. It's Al's last week as CEO. Al has been the best CEO I've worked for, and I've worked for many in my career. Al is a wonderful human being, an exceptional leader with extraordinary business judgment. It has been an eventful 6 years. Despite a 3-year global pandemic, revenues have almost doubled, non-GAAP EPS is up over 2.5x, and our stock price has tripled during Al's tenure. I will miss you as CEO, Al, along with 26,500 or so others at Visa.\nWith that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordin.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlfred Francis Kelly\n\nChairman & CEO, Visa Inc.\n\nJennifer, thank you. And good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us.\nVisa's performance in 2022 was very strong even with the uncertainty created by inflation, the war in Ukraine, COVID, the timing of cross-border travel recovery and a potential recession. On a full year basis, credentials increased 9% year-over-year and are up 13%, excluding Russia. We crossed 4.8 billion tokens, surpassing the number of card credentials and almost doubling from last year. Merchant locations, including locations from payment facilitators, grew 11%. Global tap to pay penetration grew 10% -- 10 points to 54% of face-to-face transactions, excluding Russia, and this was helped by 20 additional countries crossing over the 50% penetration mark. Excluding the U.S. and Russia, global tap to pay penetration was 71%. Visa's network processed 70% more tap to ride transactions on global transit systems in FY '22, surpassing 1 billion transactions for the first time ever.\nIn FY '22, we signed over 400 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally from early-stage companies to growing and mature players. Visa Direct had 5.9 billion transactions, excluding Russia, across 60-plus use cases and over 2,000 programs, helped by more than 500 enablers. Over half of our clients utilized 5 or more value-added services in 2022, and 1/3 use 10 or more. All of this helped to drive fiscal full year net revenues up 22% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50, up 27%.\nNow let me transition to our fourth quarter performance and key highlights and then make a few comments about 2023. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19%. Total Q4 payments volume was up 10% year-over-year or 135% versus 3 years ago, down 1 point from Q3. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 16% or 145% of 2019. U.S. Q4 payments volume was up 12% year-over-year or 145% of 2019, down 1 point. International volume was up 9% year-over-year or 126% of 2019, down 1 point versus Q3. Excluding Russia and China, international volume was up 20% or 146% of 2019, flat to Q3.\nQ4 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were up 49% year-over-year and 130% versus 3 years ago, up 7 points from Q3. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by about 5 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 12 points from 104% of 2019 in Q3 to 116% in Q4 as travel continued to recover. Processed transactions were up 12% year-over-year or 140% versus 2019, and we processed 553 million transactions a day during the quarter.\nNow I'll provide an update on the drivers that propel this growth in consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Our consumer payment strategy has 3 components to it: growing credentials, increasing acceptance and deepening engagement. Total consumer payments revenue for the fourth quarter and the year were both up more than 20% in constant dollars.\nOn the credentials side, we signed several significant deals with financial institution clients, co-brands and fintechs in the fourth quarter. Starting with financial institution clients in our Asia Pacific region. We signed with China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, leading banks in China. Throughout fiscal year 2022, we have renewed with 8 of our top China issuers.\nIn our CEMEA region, we signed with National Bank of Kuwait, the largest bank in Kuwait; and ADIB, the largest Islamic issuer in the UAE. In Latin America, we renewed and expanded our partnership relationship with the second largest bank in Colombia, Banco Davivienda, including credit, debit, commercial and Visa Direct. Another key renewal in Latin America this quarter was with Dock, one of the reasons -- a few full-stack enablers providing BIN Sponsorship, issuer processing, acquiring as a service and program management via a single connection. Already servicing more than 100 fintechs in Brazil, Dock will expand across new markets, including Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador.\nIn Europe, we renewed and expanded our relationship with UBS, the largest issuer in Switzerland. We made excellent progress in Germany with our share growing significantly since 2018, adding more than 12 million debit credentials in the market. Visa Debit is now offered by 3 of the most significant banks in the market, ING, DKB and comdirect. And we're also pleased to announce that Santander Germany will begin issuance in 2023, making Visa the single scheme of choice for Santander in that country across debit and credit. Altogether, across the European continent, our quarterly active credentials were up 18% year-over-year.\nIn the co-brand space, we continued to expand our position in several countries with 2 recent wins and an extension. First, in India with the Samsung co-brand card, targeting existing and prospective Samsung users. Second, in the U.S., Visa and Kohl's with Capital One as the issuer recently entered into an agreement to launch a Kohl's co-branded Visa credit card. And also in the U.S., we're excited to share that Visa signed a multiyear co-brand agreement extension with Disney for cards issued by JPMorgan Chase.\nNow moving to fintech and wallet clients. In Egypt, mobile network operator Etisalat Egypt, with more than 28 million customers, has signed a deal for virtual and physical card issuance. The first digital bank in Iraq, these are Iraq Islamic banks seeking to digitize payments and drive a cashless society through Visa credit, debit and prepaid card issuance across their 400,000 customers.\nAnd large cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, with over 5 million registered users, has signed on to expand issuance of Visa credentials beyond the U.S. to over 40 countries, bringing our total number of issuing partnerships with crypto platforms to more than 70. Finally, GoHenry Group is a U.S., U.K. and Europe-based fintech that provides prepaid cards and a financial education app for children aged 6 to 18 to over 2 million members. They will be expanding their U.K. Visa issuance to Continental Europe and the U.S.\nOn the acceptance front, we signed an agreement with Flywire, a global payments enabler and software company that supports the higher education industry to grow card acceptance in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Korea. In Mexico, we renewed our relationship with Clip, an important payment facilitator, which will aid in the expansion of acceptance to micro, small and medium merchants. In Mexico, we have more than doubled acceptance since 2019 to nearly 3 million merchant locations.\nOur efforts across Latin America to grow acceptance and win processing share has paid off. Outside of Brazil, we have expanded our processing penetration by more than 20 points since 2019 with the migrations of domestic transactions in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and most recently, Uruguay.\nCustomer engagement is very important, and tap to pay is one of the best ways to pay in the face-to-face environment. In Q4, the U.S. reached 28% penetration and saw more than 1 billion tap monthly transactions for the first time ever in July, surpassing the U.K. as the largest country for tap to pay transactions. And this is nearly double the number of transactions from last year and more than 5x the number of transactions from 2 years ago.\nNow moving on to new flows, which grew fourth quarter and full year revenue over 20% in constant dollars. Our B2B business had nearly $1.5 trillion in payments volume for the full year, growing 30% in constant dollars. In the fourth quarter, B2B payments volume was almost $400 billion, growing 21% year-over-year in constant dollars. Within B2B, our strategy is focused on card-based payments, cross-border payments and accounts receivable and accounts payable payments. And we've made progress across all 3 this quarter.\nVisa has signed a long-term agreement with European payments-as-a-service provider, Modulr, to issue Visa virtual cards to support B2B travel clients issuing out of Europe. Also in Europe, Visa won the credit card portfolio, Crédit du Nord, encompassing Societe Generale in addition to renewing customer credit -- consumer credit and debit portfolios in both industries. We also recently reached a new fleet products partnership agreement with Edenred, I'm sorry, which is making their Edenred Essentials product available to commercial and public sector organizations with vehicles in the United States.\nIn cross-border flows, we signed an agreement with Visa B2B Connect with TD Bank, our first bank in Canada. We also signed banks for the first time in Switzerland and Korea. And recently, our CEMEA region signed 5 banks across Kazakhstan, (inaudible) and Azerbaijan.\nIn the accounts receivable and payable space, MineralTree, a U.S. automated invoice-to-payment solution provider for the middle market and enterprise businesses, recently enhanced their relationship with Visa to support cards for their payables customers.\nFor other new flows, Visa Direct grew transactions 36% this year, excluding Russia, reaching 5.9 billion transactions. In the fourth quarter, Visa Direct had 1.7 billion transactions and grew 42%, up 7 points from Q3.\nIn addition to growing the existing Visa Direct business, our strategy for growth includes, one, scaling new use cases with a particular focus on cross-border; two, expanding existing use cases to new geographies; and three, accelerating through enablers.\nIn terms of scaling new use cases, I'm pleased that eBay, one of the largest third-party marketplaces in the world, has enabled faster payouts for its sellers via Visa Direct in the U.S. We recently signed a deal in the U.S. with Gopuff, a consumer goods and food delivery service with millions of customers across hundreds of U.S. cities, to provide their delivery partners the ability to cash out their earnings balance in real time.\nIn terms of bringing existing use cases to new geographies, in addition to some of the issuing deals I mentioned earlier, we have also signed Visa Direct deals with China Construction Bank and Etisalat Egypt. Other new geographies also include Norway. Norwegian mobile payment application, Vipps, will offer users access to Visa Direct for all domestic payments. This will improve the card-based experience for Vipps, roughly 4.3 million users, covering over 80% of Norway's population.\nOn the enabler strategy, Square has expanded their instant transfers to Canada, offering their business as a way to have faster merchant settlement opportunities. U.S. money movement automation platform, Astra, is using Visa Direct to let developers add real-time transfer functionality to their applications. So millions of its end users can fund cards, wallets and demand deposit accounts with their eligible debit cards.\nVisa Direct has extensive reach, including more than 3 billion cards and over 2 billion accounts. Recently, Visa Direct has signed with Singapore-based payments infrastructure platform, Thunes, with a network of mobile wallets across 44 countries and territories. Our partnership will add a send-to-wallet capability with Visa Direct through Thunes' B2B payment platform and provide access to 78 already integrated digital wallet providers, representing over 1.5 billion digital wallets globally. So with this partnership, we'll expand our total reach to nearly 7 billion endpoints, covering cards, accounts and wallets.\nAs part of new flows, aligned with our global network of network strategy, we're focused on building the infrastructure that enables our clients to deliver cross-border products and services for their customers. One of our newest capabilities in this space, Currencycloud, signed 35 new partnerships this quarter, including Paysend, a global end-to-end payment platform with over 7 million customers and 17,000 SMEs. Paysend intends to expand capabilities of its Paysend business platform for clients to collect and hold up to 34 currencies and seamlessly convert funds back to the required currency at competitive FX rates.\nNow moving to value-added services, which had $6 billion in revenue for 2022, up 20% in constant dollars. For the fourth quarter, revenues were up $1.7 billion and grew 20% in constant dollars as well. Our strategy here is also threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build new products and launch new solutions; and three, to extend geographically.\nOn the first, deepen client penetration of existing products, let's explore 2 of our largest value-added services businesses, DPS, debit processing services, and CyberSource. DPS, our issuer processing business, hit a major milestone, exceeding $2 trillion in annual authorization volume in FY '22. DPS has also renewed with nearly 30 clients, representing over $600 billion in annual DPS processed authorization volume.\nCyberSource remains a compelling gateway solution for merchants and most recently signed McDonald's, Little Caesars and JetBlue. We also continued to expand CyberSource relationships with acquirers, first with the Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand's largest acquirer.\nTogether with Japanese-acquired SMCC, CyberSource continues to provide payment processing solutions for more than 100,000 terminals in both card-present and card-not-present environments. SMCC is also leveraging CyberSource's capabilities for value-added services such as fraud management. Most recently, CyberSource is powering SMCC's expansion of the EMV transit acceptance and supporting commercial and pilot launches with 24 different transit operators across Japan. Deutsche Bank will offer CyberSource's Decision Manager to its merchants so that they can receive a risk value for each eCommerce transaction using rules and AI to help prevent online retail fraud.\nOn the second strategy, build new products and launch great new solutions, our recently acquired capability, Tink, is a real example. Tink recently signed Adyen to offer a white-label, pay-by-bank open banking solution on its single platform. Adyen will utilize Tink's payment initiation technology, so businesses can enable account-to-account payments. Adyen's open banking integration will launch first in the U.K. with plans to expand to multiple markets during 2023.\nLast quarter, I mentioned our newly developed risk-as-a-service capabilities powered by our network level data, AI capabilities and our risk experts. Recently, Navy Federal in the U.S. and several banks in CEMEA signed engagements for the service, which aims to deliver enhanced fraud prevention and management.\nOn our third strategy is to extend geographically, in many cases, through tailored solutions. Since our acquisition of Visa Europe, we have made significant effort to bring value-added services to our clients. Across Europe, clients enrolling onto Visa advance through authentication and Visa risk management products tripled between October 2019 and September 2022. And these clients span across 14 different European countries.\nIn CEMEA, Visa Risk Manager launched a network-agnostic pilot with Emirates NBD, a leading issuer in the UAE. As part of Visa's network of network strategy, network-agnostic VRM will allow clients to manage card payment risk across their entire portfolio.\nWe recently brought our buy now, pay later solution to Canada and have continued to make progress, adding some of Canada's largest merchants, including Simons and Canada Computers. And RBC and Visa have entered into an agreement to launch the Visa installment solution on eligible RBC consumer credit cards.\nIn conclusion, our 2022 performance was very strong and demonstrated that our strategy for each of our growth levers are delivering. We see new flows as a way to drive additional volumes and transactions and value-added services as a way to drive additional yield on existing volumes and transactions.\nVasant is going to go into a lot more detail, but let me make 4 points about 2023. One, in the year ahead, I see significant opportunity for the business across all 3 of our growth areas, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Two, we faced some headwinds, in particular, lapping Visa and a challenging FX environment. Three, we did not factor a steep economic downturn or a recession into our numbers. To the one -- to the extent one occurs, it will have some impact. Four, we will continue to manage our business for the medium and long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth. That said, we recognize that some economies around the world could face increased pressure, so we will be monitoring things very closely. We will, as we have in past periods, be flexible and prudent in the management of our expenses.\nAs a leadership team, we've demonstrated Visa's ability to manage through many different environments. And I remain confident that our strategy will continue to position Visa at the center of money movement for years to come.\nWith that, over to Vasant.\n\nVasant M. Prabhu\n\nVice Chair & CFO, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone.\nOur fiscal fourth quarter results reflect sustained strength in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 19%, and GAAP EPS was up 13%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 19%.\nThe strong dollar was a stiff headwind, dragging down reported net revenue growth by 4 points and non-GAAP EPS growth also by 4 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 5 points.\nA few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 10% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 16% year-over-year and 45% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 45% above 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 20% year-over-year and 46% above 2019.\nThe cross-border travel recovery continues. However, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, except China. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 12 points in the fourth quarter versus a 22-point gain in the third quarter. Our 3 growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues in excess of 20% in constant dollars.\nIn fiscal year '22, we bought back $11.6 billion of stock at an average price of $205.97. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $850 million. We also paid out $3.2 billion in dividends.\nAt the end of September, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In October, our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program and increased our dividend by 20%.\nNow on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 17% year-over-year to 36% over 2019, helped by travel and entertainment spending. U.S. debit grew 7%. Relative to 2019, debit was up 54%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered.\nU.S. card-present spend grew 11% year-over-year and was 27% above 2019. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 10% year-over-year and was 68% higher than 2019. eCommerce spending remained well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spend continued to recover.\nOn the international front, Latin America was up 33% year-over-year and 109% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 32% year-over-year and was 105% higher than 2019. Growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion.\nEurope was up 12% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019 impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the U.K. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 30% year-over-year and was 67% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Asia Pacific, excluding China, continues to recover, up 26% year-over-year and 32% above 2019.\nGlobal process transactions were up 12% year-over-year and 40% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, but including Russia in prior periods, were up 49% year-over-year and 30% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by approximately 5 points.\nCross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 12% year-over-year and was 60% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 101% year-over-year and is now 16% above 2019. The cross-border travel index to 2019 went from 112 in June, 115 in July to 118 in September. While the recovery continues, the rate of improvement from month-to-month has slowed as borders ex China are now open.\nTravel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter, up 16 points from the high 15 to the mid-70s index to 2019. There is more recovery to come in Asia, especially when China starts to lift restrictions.\nSummer travel in and out of Europe was also very strong, with a travel index to 2019 in the 130s, up 13 points from the third quarter. European travel appears to have benefited most from the strong dollar.\nTravel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to pick up steam, rising to the mid-130s index to 2019, up 10 points from the third quarter. However, the inbound travel recovery was sluggish, still indexing in the low 90s and up only 4 points. The strong dollar and delays in Visa issuance from some countries appear to be impacting travel into the U.S.\nTravel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Finally, travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the mid-120s relative to 2019, up 10 points in the quarter.\nMoving now to a quick review of fourth quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 11% versus the 12% growth in Q3 constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag more than offset growth from utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 10% versus the 12% process transaction growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia, however, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 15%.\nInternational transaction revenues were up 52% versus the 49% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and pricing actions more than offsetting the impact of the strong dollar. Other revenues grew 13% led by travel-related programs and pricing actions.\nClient incentives were 26.9% of gross revenues, in line with expectations. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines, each growing more than 20% on a constant dollar basis. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial card volumes grew 21% year-over-year and are up 43% versus 2019. And excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 42%. Value-added services growth was driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 20%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 18%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 4.5 point benefit.\nWe stepped up investment in our business in the second half of the year as the recovery trajectory accelerated. Personnel costs were also higher due to annual salary increases granted a quarter earlier than our normal cycle and higher incentive compensation accruals.\nWe recorded losses from our equity investments of $122 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $99 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates.\nGAAP EPS was $1.86. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, up 19% over last year, inclusive of a 4-point drag from the strong dollar. For the full year, net revenues increased 22%, and non-GAAP EPS of $7.50 was up 27%, with exchange rates reducing reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth by over 2 points each.\nWe are now in fiscal year 2023, and through the first 3 weeks of October, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 11%, with debit up 9% and credit up 14%. U.S. spend growth versus 2019 was up 47%, with debit up 57% and credit up 39%. These trends are consistent with the fourth quarter and with performance in major markets around the world.\nProcessed transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 42% year-over-year and was 33% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 61% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 18% above 2019.\nMoving now to our perspectives for the coming year. Forecasting 4 quarters ahead has been difficult through the COVID years. While COVID impact is now largely behind us, as you all know, we are in a very uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\nAs we've said before, we are not economic forecasters. Clearly, there's a high risk of a global recession, but we do not have a specific point of view on if, when or the kind of recession we might have.\nFor internal planning purposes, we are assuming no recession. Of course, we will stay very vigilant, closely monitoring our trends day by day. We will stay very flexible. We will have contingency plans in place should we have an economic or geopolitical shock that impacts our business. And we will be prepared to act fast should we need to. So that is the context for our planning assumptions, which I will walk through now.\nStarting with revenue drivers. Payments volume and processed transaction indexed to 2019 have been very stable in the U.S. and globally for the past 3 quarters. In other words, we believe the recovery from COVID is behind us when it comes to domestic spending. We're assuming this stability sustains through fiscal year '23 with normal year-over-year growth rates in the low double digits for both business drivers.\nOn payments volumes, Russia will impact growth rates in the first half. Russia will not impact reported processed transactions growth. Cross-border eCommerce trends have also been stable, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're assuming cross-border eCommerce growth rate sustain in the mid-teens, excluding Russia and crypto, and in the low double digits with Russia and crypto impact included. Cross-border travel, excluding intra-Europe, has continued to recover but at a slower pace, up 6 points from 112 to 118 index to 2019 between June and September.\nFor planning purposes, we are assuming that this recent month-to-month pace of recovery sustains through fiscal year 2023. As was the case last year, there will be periods of deceleration and acceleration. Hopefully, China starts easing restrictions as we enter calendar year 2023.\nTwo variables will have a significant impact on our reported revenue growth in fiscal year '23, Russia and the dollar, which has strengthened to extraordinary levels through fiscal year '22. Since we discontinued operations in late March, Russia will reduce first half fiscal year '23 revenue growth by over 4 points, with 4 points in the first quarter and as much as 5 points in the second quarter. But as you might recall, we recorded 2 quarters worth of service fees in fiscal year '22. Russia will obviously have no impact in the second half. Russia will reduce full year net revenue growth by 5 points.\nWe faced very stiff exchange rate headwinds as we enter fiscal year '23. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in fiscal year '23 by around 4 points. Since the dollar strengthened through fiscal year '22, the impact is greater in the first quarter at around 5 points, around 4.5 points in the second quarter and moderate through the year.\nWhen you pull all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth on a run rate basis, i.e., adjusted for Russia. With a 2-point Russia impact and a 4-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar fiscal year 2023 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits. Client incentives are expected to be in the 26.5% to 27.5% range as a percent of gross revenues.\nWith a 4-point Russia drag and a stiffer exchange rate headwind, first half reported nominal dollar net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the second half. Lowest growth in the second quarter, which has the largest Russia impact and stepping up in the third and fourth quarters with no Russia drag and hopefully a moderating exchange rate headwind.\nMoving on to operating expenses. We are managing expense growth in line with our revenue growth expectations, rigorously prioritizing investment plans. As you know, this is a long cycle business. Investments we make today will have revenue growth 2 to 3 years out. It is important for us to continue to fund key growth initiatives across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. As Al said, we have extraordinary growth opportunities and need to ensure we are investing to realize their potential.\nOur current plans are for low double-digit non-GAAP operating expense growth in constant dollars, high single digits in nominal dollars Tink and Currencycloud, which closed during fiscal year '22 at about 1 point to expense growth, offset by the discontinuation of Russia operations and exchange rate changes, which are expected to be about a 1.5 point benefit each. Non-GAAP operating expense growth will be higher in the first half for 2 reasons. First, Tink and Currencycloud add 2 points to expense growth in the first half. Also in the first half, we lapped a lower expense base last year since we stepped up investment spending through the year as the cross-border recovery accelerated.\nAs such, non-GAAP expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be in the low double digits in the first half and at the high end of mid-single digits in the second half. Highest in the first quarter, which is also impacted by the FIFA World Cup and moderating through the year.\nShould there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations.\nAs interest rates have risen, nonoperating expense will benefit from higher interest income from our cash balances. We currently expect nonoperating expense to be in the $200 million, $250 million range for fiscal year '23. We will provide quarterly updates through the year. Our tax rate is expected to remain in the 19% to 19.5% range in FY '23.\nHoning in on the first quarter, based on everything I just walked through, we expect reported nominal dollar net revenue growth in the high single-digit range, with client incentives on par with the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. Nominal dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth is expected to be in the low teens. The tax rate could be lower than the 19% to 19.5% range in the first quarter, depending on the resolution of some items.\nSecond quarter net revenue growth is expected to be lower than the first quarter because of the Russia impact, which is higher. Second quarter operating expense growth is also expected to moderate to the low end of double digits.\nIn summary, we'll assume stable conditions through fiscal year '23 but are prepared to act fast should circumstances change. Regardless of near-term uncertainties, we remain as certain as we've ever been about our extraordinary long-term growth opportunity. There is still plenty of cash to digitize in core consumer payments. We are accelerating volume growth by vastly expanding the use cases we can serve through our new flows business while enhancing the yield on transactions in our network by layering on value-added services.\nWith that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Vasant.\nAnd with that, we're ready to take questions, Holly.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlfred Francis Kelly\n\nChairman & CEO, Visa Inc.\n\nJennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Before I talk about the quarter, I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Dee Hock, Visa's Founder and Chief Executive Officer Emeritus. The whole Visa family deeply mourns the loss of a true visionary and a great man.\nEven with several global and macro events from the war in Ukraine to inflation to concerns over a broader recession, Visa's business model has proven to be very resilient with strong financial performance. Net revenues grew 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33%. Total Q3 payment volume was 136% versus 3 years ago, up 1 point from Q2. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 146% in the quarter. U.S. debit volumes were 155% and credit 138% of 2019, both up modestly from Q2. Card-not-present, excluding travel volumes in the U.S., remained significantly ahead of pre-pandemic levels at 170% of 2019, consistent with Q2.\nInternational volume was 120% of 2019, down 1 point from Q2. Excluding China and Russia, it was 146% of 2019, up 6 points. Q3 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were 123% versus 3 years ago, up 11 points from Q2, and this includes Russia in prior period numbers. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 22 points from 82% of 2019 in Q2 to 104% in Q3 as we continue to see strong recovery in consumer and commercial travel. Process transactions were 139% versus 2019, 1 point above Q2. Credentials increased 8% year-over-year and are up 11%, excluding Russia.\nBefore I dive into the client wins and progress towards our strategy, I wanted to take a moment to discuss 2 topics: recession and inflation. On the first, we're not economic forecasters, so I'm not going to predict the future or a potential likelihood of a recession. Instead, let's focus on the facts. From the numbers I just reviewed relative to 2019 levels, growth has been stable or improving in overall domestic payment volume, credit, debit, card-present and card-not-present volumes. And this has been the case for most of 2022 with no indication of any slowdown, including in more recent weeks.\nIn cross-border, of course, the recovery has continued to strengthen. While growth has been stable in aggregate, there have been shifts under the surface that continue to demonstrate the momentum of the recovery, first, from goods to services. Early in the pandemic, goods surpassed services, reversing the historic trend. Even as services have rebounded in the last 6 months, the percentage spending on goods in our payments volume still remains high, higher than the pre-pandemic levels. For example, while U.S. home improvement and retail goods spending during the third quarter grew only low single digits year-over-year, it remains well ahead of the pre-pandemic trend line.\nSecond, many discretionary segments have further strengthened. If you look at U.S. travel spend, it is now back -- it is not back to the pre-COVID trend line, but grew more than 40% versus last year. Third, the affluent spender continued to recover, particularly in the areas of restaurants, travel and entertainment. At the same time, nonaffluent spend remained relatively resilient. We mentioned the affluent spend returning to restaurants last quarter. That trend continued this quarter with affluent restaurant spend indexing in the 160% to 180% range versus 2019.\nSimilarly, in Europe in the last 6 months, luxury hotel payments volume and average ticket size outpaced growth in the overall hotel category versus 2019. At the same time, budget and mid-priced hotels saw modest improvements. Based on our numbers, we haven't seen any evidence of consumer pulling back spending in our markets.\nNow a few words on inflation. It's just too early to draw any definitive conclusions. A few observations, though, on inflation. One, keep in mind that the headline CPI inflation number does not necessarily apply to Visa as our basket of goods isn't the same. Consumers just don't buy homes or use cards with their Visa cards, for example. So we see a several point gap between headline inflation and inflation in card-related spend categories. Two, thus far, U.S. transaction growth relative to 2019 is strong and stable. Ticket sizes remain around 15 points above 2019 levels, as they had for much of the pandemic due to several factors. Three, historically, in the U.S., we have seen PCE growth, which is the most important metric that drives our growth, remains strong even during inflationary periods. That said, lastly, excessive and long-term inflation is not good for consumers or the overall economy. Looking ahead, we'll continue to monitor the potential impact of inflation to ticket sizes, transaction counts as well as volumes across spend categories.\nWith all of that as backdrop, I'll now provide an update on progress with clients. Traditional issuers remain a key component of our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we had several important partnership renewals globally. First, in China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in China in terms of the number of cards. In Japan, we renewed one of the country's largest credit issuers, Credit Saison, and expanded our issuing relationship with Toyota Finance. In Australia, we extended our credit and debit issuing agreements with NAB and CBA, 2 of the largest banks in the country. And in the U.S., we recently renewed our relationship with Green Dot, a top 20 issuer in debit and a top 10 issuer in prepaid.\nFintechs are also key to our consumer payments growth. In Europe alone, we have more than 100 fintech programs that continue to deepen our relationship with these partners. Revolut is a great example. They already utilized a number of our capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, and we just renewed our global issuing partnership. They also recently selected Tink for payment initiation services, which will allow users across Europe to seamlessly move money into their Revolut accounts.\nIn many countries, the mobile operators are particularly important partners. We previously mentioned our partnerships with M-Pesa Africa and Safaricom, and I'm happy to report that we have begun issuance with these partners who are part of the Vodacom Group that cover 130 million customers in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn a similar light, we also recently signed partnerships to issue Visa credentials, and in some cases, also enable Visa Direct with other mobile operators around the world: Mobily in Saudi Arabia with 10 million customers; Ooredoo in Qatar with around 2 million customers; Azercell in Azerbaijan with 5 million customers; and Orange Egypt with 27 million customers.\nI now want to dive a little deeper on 2 important markets: Brazil and India. Starting in Brazil, over the past 2 years, we have grown our business through issuing agreements with Itau, Mercado Pago, [PicPay] and Caixa, with a 70% increase in credentials. In addition to traditional credit card issuers, partners like Banco do Brasil have been growing their credit base by utilizing Visa's digital acquisition platform that allows them to instantly issue cards in a digital environment. Further, our fintech partners in Brazil, including Banco XP and Neo Pagamentos, have issued more than 20 million credentials over the past 2 years. On the acceptance side, we've doubled acceptance points since 2020, reaching more than 10 million merchant locations in Brazil. The results of our efforts over the past 8 to 10 quarters is evident in Brazil's payment volume, which in the third quarter was more than 200% of 2019 with e-commerce nearing 300%.\nIn India, our efforts over the last few years are paying off and Q3 payments volume was 184% of 2019 with e-commerce above 300%. Building on that momentum, we had co-brand wins with 2 of the largest multibillion-dollar revenue Indian conglomerates that collectively represent millions of potential credentials: one, with Tata Neu, a super app for e-commerce financial services and loyalty programs across the Tata Group; two, with Aditya Birla Finance and SBI Cards, provide rewards for spending across all of their group companies. We also signed a co-brand with IndiGo, India's largest airline by number of passengers.\nAnd let me briefly touch on the U.S. where there's still great opportunity for cash digitization. We're excited about tap to pay, which has written now reached 24% of face-to-face transactions in Q3. We're seeing positive trends in terms of additional spend and transaction lift in the U.S. In 2021, the average contactless active debit cardholder had 2 more transactions and $65 in additional spend each month. We expect this trend to continue driving incremental payment volumes and transactions for contactless card issuers through faster, simpler POS experiences.\nNow moving to new flows, which in Q3 had over 20% revenue growth. In B2B, our Q3 commercial payments volume was 145% of 2019, up 6 points from Q2, driven by the return of travel. Q3 was the first quarter in which spend on business travel surpassed 2019 levels. This quarter, we're excited to have reached a significant multiyear agreement with WEX to enable their travel, health and corporate clients to make payments using Visa virtual card capabilities. WEX is a global leader in financial technology solutions for commercial payments, and we are proud to partner with them.\nIn the fleet space, we reached an agreement with M-Pesa, a fintech based out of Kenya. Their fleet and expense management digital platform will address the problem of paying cash in the African trucking business through Visa prepaid reloadable credentials.\nVisa Direct is a powerful capability for many of our new flows. In this quarter, transactions grew 35%, excluding Russia. On the remittance side, Western Union has enabled Visa Direct for their U.S. customers to send money to select countries globally, expanding upon their initial rollout across Europe in 2021.\nWe also expanded our agreement with Remitly, one of the world's premier digital service remittance companies to offer Visa Direct cross-border payments originating from Canada to bank accounts globally. Another Visa Direct P2P expansion is with LINE Pay in Japan. Already a large wallet issuer, 6 million Visa credentials, LINE Pay is now enabling Visa Direct for cross-border and domestic use cases such as remittances and cash outs.\nOn wage disbursement, Grubhub, a leading food ordering and delivery marketplace available in over 4,000 U.S. cities, will enable drivers to quickly send their earnings to their eligible debit cards using Visa Direct. We are excited for them to join our other food delivery platforms, including DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. We also reached an agreement with the U.S. tip enabler, Kickfin, to enable millions of tips disbursements to be pushed to employees' accounts through eligible debit cards at thousands of restaurant locations they serve. Per Kickfin, 90% of tips in the United States are still dispersed with cash today.\nIn Canada, we reached an agreement with a large fintech, Wealthsimple, for accounts funds in and funds out for their over 2 million clients. Finally, enablers are key to our success in Visa Direct, and we recently signed a deal with Finastra, one of the world's largest financial services software companies and open banking platforms with 8,600 customers and serving 90 of the world's top 100 banks. Together, we will offer Finastra's clients access to cross-border business, the small business at B2C payouts, to eligible accounts in multiple currencies and countries.\nWhile the U.S. was one of our first markets to achieve scale for Visa Direct, we have many other countries and regions that are growing and scaling. For example, in Latin America, third quarter transactions quadrupled versus last year. We have over 20 domestic and cross-border P2P programs commercially launched or in pilot, such as PLIN and Yape in Peru, WhatsApp in Brazil and Cash across Central America, in addition to many other programs for other use cases.\nNow let me move to value-added services, which had Q3 revenue growth of almost 20%. Our value-added services grow through new and existing clients, existing services, expanding geographically and adding new services both organically and through acquisitions. Today, I'll provide an update on recent wins with some of our acquired entities. First, one of our earlier acquisitions, CyberSource, recently added NCR and Global Payments as partners, both intend to offer CyberSource capabilities to their merchant clients. This is an important strategy as our merchant base utilizing CyberSource through acquirers is growing payments volume twice as fast as the rest of our CyberSource business.\nCardinalCommerce, our network-agnostic authentication capability, has grown transactions 30% globally year-to-date, with more than double that in Europe, where the secure customer authentication requirement has driven faster adoption of 3D Secure.\nVerifi, our network-agnostic dispute resolution solution, recently extended its agreement with PNC for Verifi's cardholder dispute resolution network product.\nYellowPepper, the network-agnostic connectivity platform, just signed BES, the Brazilian bank, that offers its 50 million corporate and individual clients worldwide trade, e-commerce, staff solutions, and most recently, an FX API platform. That will use YellowPepper's payment initiation services to enable cross-border money movement starting with Visa Direct to send payouts to eligible cards.\nI mentioned Tink's recent win earlier. Our other acquisition from this fiscal year, Currencycloud, has signed more than 100 fintech clients since December to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments.\nAnd finally, the tokenization capabilities we acquired now called Token ID have been selected by several partners. First, Global Payments will use Visa's Token ID as their strategic go-forward solution for multiple EMV network tokenization services to reduce card-not-present fraud and realize operational efficiencies for their clients. Second, the Clearinghouse, the first U.S. real-time payment network, and one of 2 U.S. ACH networks, chose Visa's Token ID solution to power the Secure Token Exchange. This industry-first account tokenization solution in the United States is utilizing Visa's Token ID payment account tokenization technology to replace sensitive customer account data with unique tokens and reduce the amount of exposed payment data.\nOur internally developed value-added services are just as important. One very compelling solution is from Visa Consulting & Analytics. Together with FIS, we recently launched a risk-as-a-service solution powered by data and risk experts. Key components of progress over the past 12 months include our real-time monitoring through our AI-enabled platform has blocked over $2 billion in fraudulent payments volume. Our analysis of potential fraud for a proactive testing identified a $15 million exposure to clients. Our capabilities to proactively detect and mitigate cyber criminals attempts to inject payment skimming malware onto online merchant checkout pages has prevented over $10 million in e-commerce-related losses. And our ability to detect terminal cloning has successfully blocked $3 million in fraud from attempted downloads.\nIn sum, we had a very strong quarter, and our results showed it. We made progress continuing to build relationships and solutions across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services that will fuel future growth around the globe. We remain vigilant in monitoring the trends in our business and the economy and confident on our strategy as we enable the movement of money globally.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\n\nVasant M. Prabhu\n\nVice Chair & CFO, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter results reflected continued strength in domestic spend and a robust recovery in travel with net revenues up 19% and GAAP EPS up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 33%.\nThe ever strengthening dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by nearly 3.5 points. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was over 21% and non-GAAP EPS growth was 36%. Adjusting for Russia, constant dollar net revenue growth was 26%.\nA few key highlights. Global payments volumes growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the U.S. index was 2 points higher than the second quarter, up 46% versus 2019. The international index, ex China and Russia, was up 6 points from the second quarter, also 46% above 2019.\nThe robust cross-border travel recovery continued. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from 94 in March to 112 in June. This was helped by much of Asia opening up at the beginning of the quarter, the U.S. inbound corridor picking up steam as well as strong growth in and out of Europe as we head into the peak summer travel season.\nOur 3 growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues around 20%. During the quarter, we bought back almost $2.5 billion in stock at an average price of $202.16. We also added $600 million to the MDL litigation escrow account. This had the same effect as a stock buyback at $200.25.\nWe issued EUR 3 billion in debt, with maturities ranging from 4 to 12 years. We obtained attractive coupons on our inaugural eurobond issuance ranging from 1.5% to 2.375%, well below rates achievable on equivalent dollar-denominated debt. We have now prefunded debt maturities coming up in September and December.\nFinally, as a reminder, we suspended operations in Russia late in the second quarter. As such, there are no volumes, transactions or revenues from Russia in our third quarter numbers. Any comparisons to prior periods include Russia unless otherwise noted.\nNow on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 36% of our 2019. Excluding China and Russia, total payments volume growth was 17% and 46% higher than 2019. In the U.S., credit grew 21% and improved 3 points to 38% over 2019, helped by travel and fuel spend. Debit grew 4% year-over-year, lapping the big spike from the stimulus last year. Relative to 2019, debit was up 55%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. Debit has benefited from accelerated cash digitization through the pandemic. U.S. card-present spend grew 13% and was 27% above 2019, up 6 points. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 7% and was 70% higher than 2019. Relative to 3 years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volumes, excluding China and Russia, grew 24% and was 46% above 2019.\nA few regional highlights. Latin America was up 40% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019 with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 34% year-over-year and 102% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitalization. Europe was up 17% year-over-year and 37% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the U.K.\nEx U.K., Europe volumes grew 37% year-over-year and was 66% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding migrations, U.K. payment volumes have been stable in the third quarter, while Germany improved more than 15 points from the second quarter. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region but has improved significantly from the second quarter, up 24% year-over-year and 30% above 2019, up 5 points in the second quarter. Across Asia, most borders are open and domestic restrictions lifted. Only China remains mostly closed off, and Japan is gradually normalizing.\nGlobal processed transactions were up 16% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Since we did not processed domestic transactions in Russia, our reported processed transactions are not materially impacted by the suspension of Russia operations.\nNow on to cross-border. Constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 48% year-over-year and 23% over 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 4% year-over-year and 62% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 129% year-over-year and exceeded pre-COVID levels for the first time, indexing at 104 of 2019. The cross-border travel index went from the low 90s in March and April to 108% in May and 112% in June.\nWe continue to see a rapid ramp-up in travel as soon as borders reopen or restrictions are lifted. A few highlights. Canada removed testing requirements for vaccinated travelers in April. Travel inbound to the U.S. jumped 16 points in the third quarter to 86% of 2019 levels, helped by Canada, Europe and Asia. The lifting of testing requirements in June will hopefully help sustain the recovery of travel into the U.S.\nTravel into Latin America and the Caribbean has been very strong through the COVID years, especially to Mexico. With more countries, including Costa Rica and Jamaica, lifting COVID protocols in April, inbound travel to the region climbed nearly 20 points in the third quarter to 50% of our 2019 levels.\nEuropean Union member states removed previous testing and vaccination requirements for non-European citizens in April and May, resulting in travel to Europe recovering a sizable 30 points in the third quarter with more than half of that from North America. Inbound travel to Europe was 21% above 2019. Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, CEMEA region, outbound travel increased 6 points in the third quarter despite the loss of Russia, driven by Ukraine and travel for religious holidays from the Middle East, and was 13% above 2019.\nIn Asia, borders continue to open and travel restrictions eased for international travelers, resulting in inbound travel recovering 22 points in the third quarter to 58% of 2019 levels. Japan opened to tourists and increased the entry limit from 10,000 to 20,000 people per day. Australia dropped prearrival testing requirements in April. Several countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, dropped testing requirements in May. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory of cross-border travel. Most Asian borders are now open, except for Mainland China and some restrictions in Taiwan and Japan. In the third quarter, travel into China indexed below 25% of 2019 and outbound from China below 40%.\nMoving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 13%, slower than the 14% nominal growth in Q2 payments volume. Reported Q2 payments volumes include Russia, whereas revenues in Q3 do not since we recognized second quarter service revenues for Russia before we suspended operations last year -- last quarter.\nData processing revenues grew 8%, below the 16% processed transaction growth. Revenue growth lags transaction growth, primarily due to the suspension of Russia operations. As I mentioned earlier, Russia domestic transactions were not included in our reported processed transactions, and as such, the loss of Russia does not materially impact transactions growth. However, we did have data processing revenue from Russia transactions in prior periods, which we do not anymore. This negatively impacted data processing revenue growth by over 4 points. There was also about a 2-plus point exchange rate drag.\nInternational transaction revenues were up 51% versus the 38% increase in nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing actions. Other revenues grew 26%, led by consulting services and travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines, each growing around 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions.\nNew flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 27% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Growth was driven, in part, by increased travel and was broad-based globally across small and large businesses. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 35% due to strong growth outside the U.S. Value-added services growth was led by consulting services as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include higher volumes from existing clients, greater client penetration and select pricing actions.\nClient incentives were 26.1% of gross revenues below our expectations. This was primarily driven by the faster-than-expected recovery of higher-yielding cross-border volumes, which improved revenue mix. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. Exchange rates were an approximately 3-point drag on reported revenue growth. The suspension of Russia operations reduced revenues by approximately 5 points.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 51%, inclusive of a $716 million provision associated with the interchange multi-restrict litigation. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. The suspension of Russia operations reduced expenses by about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 2-point benefit.\nWe recorded losses from our equity investments of $246 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $73 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3%. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates benefited by 6 points from the resolution of certain U.S. state and foreign tax matters related primarily through prior years. Our recurring tax rate remains in the 19% to 19.5% range. GAAP EPS was $1.60. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33% over last year, inclusive of nearly 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar. With a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter.\nThrough the first 3 weeks of July, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 12% with debit up 6% and credit up 18%. U.S. spend growth versus 2019 was up 46%, with debit up 55% and credit up 38%. These trends are consistent with the third quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 60% year-over-year and 29% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 57% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 16% above 2019.\nMoving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Al indicated, we're seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending. U.S. payments volumes have indexed in the mid-140 range versus 2019 since January through July 21. Excluding Russia and China, international payments volumes have also indexed about 140 since January. Processed transactions have been stable at around 140 versus 2019. As such, we are assuming that the trends we have seen in payments volumes and processed transactions will continue through the fourth quarter. We will, of course, stay vigilant and on the lookout for any changes caused by rising interest rates, high inflation and declining consumer confidence.\nThrough July, the cross-border recovery has progressed faster and further than we had expected last October. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming stable growth versus 2019 in cross-border e-commerce and some improvement from travel in and out of Europe and into the U.S., especially from Asia. The next and perhaps the last leg of the cross-border travel recovery will have to await a full reopening in China, which we do not expect in the near future.\nWith these assumptions, fourth quarter net revenues could grow at the high teens to 20% range in constant dollars. This includes Tink and Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues, and the suspension of operations in Russia, which subtracts approximately 5 points. The dollar has continued to strengthen, significantly increasing the exchange rate drag, which we expect will reduce reported net revenue growth by 4 to 5 points.\nQ4 client incentives are expected to range between 26% and 27% of gross revenues, driven primarily by anticipated strong volume performance across all regions. For the year, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the middle of the 25.5% to 26.5% range.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow at the low end or high teens. This includes 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink, offset by 3 points from reduced costs due to Russia. Personnel costs will be higher since we are granting annual salary increases a quarter earlier than normal to all employees below the SVP level. This will add 3 points to Q4 operating expense growth. Exchange rates could reduce reported operating expense growth by about 2 points. Our tax rate is expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range.\nWhile there's uncertainty, consumer spending remains strong. Growth has been stable across payments volumes, cross-border volumes and processed transactions globally. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to different environments and are prepared to do so again if warranted. We will stay vigilant, flexible and agile. We are fortunate to have a resilient business with great momentum and extraordinary longer-term growth opportunities.\nWith that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nNow I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.\nFor non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlfred Francis Kelly\n\nChairman & CEO, Visa Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining. Before jumping in, I want to acknowledge that this is Jennifer Como's first earnings call in her new position. About 2 months ago, Jennifer was promoted to Head of Investor Relations, which was a very well-deserved recognition of her work over the last 3 years with us.\nI want to start by briefly addressing the situation in Russia and Ukraine. I have seen firsthand the pain brought about by Russia's attack on Ukraine and its people, including our colleagues in both Ukraine and Russia. We are very focused on supporting them. The bravery, strength and resilience of our colleagues is incredibly inspiring, as is the grit of the Ukrainian military.\nEven with the invasion of Ukraine and lingering impacts of Omicron, volumes, transactions and credentials drove strong second quarter performance. Overall, PV was up 135% versus 3 years ago. Cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were 112% versus 3 years ago. And it's important to note that travel-related cross-border rose to 82% versus 3 years ago, up 5 points from Q1. Processed transactions were 138% versus 3 years ago.\nIn terms of the big picture, after the short 4- to 5-week impact of Omicron in December and January in the United States and many other parts of the world, the recovery continues to be robust. At this stage, in terms of volumes, we have seen no noticeable impact due to inflation, supply chain issues or the war in Ukraine.\nIn the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 144 in the quarter. Volume growth relative to 3 years ago has been stable and strong now for 4 quarters in a row. When looking at specific spend categories for credit cards, we saw greater than a 10 percentage point improvement in the 3-year index from Q1 to 2Q -- Q2 in travel, retail goods, food and drug, restaurant, QSR and fuel.\nAs a reminder, debit is growing over a quarter in fiscal '21, where there were 2 stimulus distributions. Even as credit continues to recover, debit remains 20% above the prepandemic trend line. Across all products, spend categories representing 88% of PV are over 120% indexed -- over 120 indexed to 3 years ago, and nearly 2/3 are between 140 and 160. Against this backdrop, Visa's performance was very strong. Net revenues grew 25% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.79, up 30%.\nAs we look ahead, our business will have a reset due to Russia, but we still expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years. This is because there's still ample opportunity around the world across our 3 growth levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, and our strategy is yielding excellent results.\nFirst, in consumer payments, we continue to displace cash at a strong rate. In Q2, we saw debit cash volumes at Visa grow 2%, while debit payments volumes grew 12%. Cash displacement continued around the world. Year-over-year, across debit and credit, there were 7.9 billion more payments transactions and 16 million less cash transactions. Last quarter, I highlighted the shift from cash to payments volume in Latin America, and that trend continued in this quarter. Additionally, CEMEA is experiencing a similar shift. In full year 2019, cash was 59% of total volume. Last year in Q2, it was 50%. And this quarter, it was 46%.\nGrowth in consumer payments is driven by adding credentials and acceptance and deepening engagement. Our card credentials recently increased to over 3.9 billion, up 9% in 1 year, including 10% growth in the United States. On the acceptance side, we have 80 million merchant locations, including small businesses behind players like Stripe and Square, the number is actually over 100 million. We have seen very strong performance location growth recently in our Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, up 30% and 20%, respectively.\nLet me just highlight a few regional examples of progress in consumer payments. In Europe, overall credentials grew 6%, which is nearly double the historic rate for each of the past 8 quarters, helped by previously announced deals, with BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium contributing more than 4 million credentials since their announcement to issue with Visa.\nAcross Europe, we continue to strengthen our debit business. We recently announced the win with Rabobank, representing a multimillion credential opportunity. We also renewed our business with one of the largest banks in the Nordics, Nordea.\nOn the acceptance front, we continue to pioneer new areas of acceptance even in mature digital markets. One recent example in Europe is with electronic -- electric vehicle charging. We were the first payments and financial services company to joined the charging interface initiative and are working with manufacturers to open up what is estimated to represent 3 million potential acceptance points in Europe by 2030.\nIn Latin America, we saw strong credential growth, up 21% year-over-year. Two renewals to highlight this quarter: Porto Sakura, Brazil's third largest issuer for credit portfolio; and digital bank Neo Pagamentos, one of Brazil's fastest-growing fintechs with over 15 million clients for their credit and prepaid portfolios.\nIn Africa, Visa has signed a partnership with Vodacom South Africa. This deal, together with previously announced partnerships with M-PESA Africa and Safaricom, covers 130 million customers in the entire Vodacom Group in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through this partnership, Vodacom will exclusively issue Visa payment credentials, deploy new payment flows through Visa Direct and utilize CyberSource.\nIn the United States, we renewed and won several partnerships this quarter. First, Visa and USAA have recently renewed our long-standing issuing partnership. Second, we extended our existing relationship agreement with M&T Bank as their issuance partner, including migrating the business resulting from their recently completed acquisition of People's United. Over the past 2 years, merger activity of regional banks has increased, and this is another example of Visa successfully partnering to grow with our clients.\nFinally, supporting the U.S. government is an important priority for us, and we retained our business with the financial agent that manages the U.S. debit card program. This Visa-branded program is a key component of Treasury's goal to deliver 99% of federal payments digitally by 2030.\nA key vector of growth in consumer payments are co-brand cards, which are particularly attractive to the affluent customer. In Q2, affluent credit card spending was well above 2019 levels in several markets, including the U.S. and the U.K. Our U.S. co-brand active cards were up nearly 30% from 2019 to 2022. And we have 7 of the top 10 co-brands in the United States and 8 of the top 10 co-brands globally.\nThis past quarter, we renewed our co-brand relationship with AAA, Visa's longest-standing co-brand partner, an over 40-year relationship. In India, we're pleased to have signed a long-term co-brand agreement with Airtel, one of the largest mobile operators in the world with nearly 356 million subscribers. In CEMEA, Emirates NBD, a leading banking group, has expanded its long-standing partnership with Visa by introducing the premium co-brand program with Etihad Guest, the loyalty program of Etihad Airlines with 8 million members.\nIn Uganda, we partnered with the Uganda National Social Security Fund to issue co-brand cards to 2 million beneficiaries. And just a few weeks ago, it was announced that the U.S. Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card has been renewed with Chase and Visa. Visa is also pleased to have reached a broad global agreement with Amazon. This agreement includes the acceptance of Visa at all Amazon stores and sites today, as well as a joint commitment to collaboration on new product and technology initiatives to ensure innovative payment experiences for our customers into the future.\nIn Q2, we also continued to enable new ways to pay from installments to crypto. In the installment space, we previously announced a global deal with Klarna. They have now issued their co-branded card in Europe and recently opened a wait list in the United States, where they have 25 million customers.\nIn the crypto space, we continue to work with governments globally on potential CBDCs. This quarter, we were selected as the finalist in Brazil's CBDC LIFT Challenge. The concept is a B2B solution that seeks to leverage CBDC to help small businesses access global investors and drive financial inclusion.\nOn the engagement front, tap to pay continues to accelerate growth. In the United States, we are over 20% tap to pay penetration, marking the second largest market by number of taps. And Target has become the first U.S. retail merchant to surpass 50% tap to pay penetration of face-to-face payments.\nTransit is one of the best ways to habituate tapping, and the first half of fiscal '22 has set records. We enabled 50 cities around the world, including Thailand, Japan, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Canada, bringing our tap to ride footprint to over 500 travel transit authorities. We processed over 500 million Visa tap to ride transactions globally versus 700 million for all of last year.\nTo summarize, there is significant opportunity in consumer payments, Visa continues to grow credentials and acceptance while deepening engagement and Visa enables innovation and scale for players across the ecosystem from installments to crypto to merchants.\nNow moving to new flows, which in Q2 had over 20% revenue growth. In Q2, our commercial payments volume was 138% of 2019. What's more, this recovery is relatively broad-based across segments and spend types. On the B2B carded front, in the U.S., Umpqua Bank announced 2 commercial solutions for middle market businesses. One, Visa Commercial Preferred, a commercial rewards card designed to help manage daily business spend; and two, Visa Commercial Pay, which will help improve cash flow management, reconciliation and reporting.\nIn Latin America, we saw a carded progress with B2B fintech, Tribal, which has chosen Visa for card issuance, including virtual cards, on its modern corporate card and spend management platform tailored for startups in 9 countries.\nAirwallex, a global platform enabling digital businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders, previously launched programs with Visa in Australia, Hong Kong and the U.K. Recently, they introduced virtual Visa cards in the United States, Netherlands and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world.\nIn our cross-border B2B business, Visa B2B Connect continues to expand its global footprint. And in the first half of 2022, we added banks for the first time in Tanzania, Uganda, Angola, Thailand and Poland.\nNow turning to Visa Direct. Transactions in the second quarter grew 20%. Vasant will speak more about this, but Russia was our second largest market for Visa Direct and represented about 17% of our transactions in fiscal 2021. So in short, Visa Direct will be impacted by the suspension of Russian operations.\nBut even with the Russia business -- without the Russia business, we will see growth ahead driven by many use cases and countries. For example, domestic P2P, which accounted for the majority of our Russian business, is still a large opportunity, and we continue to expand to new markets. We will soon launch our inaugural Visa Direct use case in Israel for P2P in partnership with BIT, the largest P2P app in the market.\nI'll focus on 2 other use cases today, payouts and remittances. First, with payouts, we see -- we're seeing momentum in a number of industries, and transactions are up 35% year-over-year.\nIn travel, we launched Visa Direct with Booking.com to enable customer refunds and loyalty payouts. In the gig economy, Payfare, a leading fintech that has partners such as Uber, Lyft and Doordash, has added Visa Direct to its platform to help facilitate real-time payment experiences for over 0.5 million gig workers they serve. And digital commerce partner, Payoneer, will use Visa Direct to enable cross-border payments for their 5 million customers, including marketplaces and gig economy players.\nSecond, cross-border P2P or global remittances, which are higher yielding Visa Direct transactions, represent a significant opportunity. While we are just getting started this quarter, transactions grew nearly 50% year-over-year.\nAfter announcing our relationship in fiscal fourth quarter with Paysend, an international card-to-card payments platform, which serves over 6 million customers and 17,000 SMEs, they have now launched their cross-border service with Visa Direct from the U.K. and U.S. to over 100 corridors.\nWhile the U.S. is the top source for remittances, the UAE is the second largest source for country remittances followed by Saudi Arabia according to the World Bank. Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council countries account for more than $100 billion in outbound remittances. This past quarter, we added several partnerships to help digitize remittances in the region.\nFirst, Al Muzaini Exchange, the largest exchange house in Kuwait. Second, Enjaz, the remittance and payment arm of Bank Albilad and market leader for ongoing remittances in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And third, in the UAE with LuLu Money powered by Lulu International Exchange and Network International to enable the 5 million users of Lulu app to send money to cross-border.\nAdyen and Strike, key Visa Direct enablement partners, have both signed agreements to deepen relationships in existing geographies and to expand to net new markets globally across numerous use cases.\nIn sum, we've made excellent early progress against the $185 trillion new flows opportunity, but there is tremendous room for accelerated growth ahead.\nNow let me move to value-added services, which had Q2 revenue growth of over 20% as well. First, we recently closed our acquisition of Tink. Tink is the European open banking platform that connects to more than 3,400 banks that reach over 250 million bank customers across Europe. Through a single API, Tink enables its customers to move money, access aggregated financial data and use smart financial services such as risk insights and account verification. Visa brings proven infrastructure and sustained investment and resilience, cybersecurity and fraud, which will help accelerate the adoption of open banking and create a secure, reliable platform for innovation.\nLet me highlight some other progress in value-added services. First, Visa Consulting & Analytics. Last quarter, I announced the launch of our specialized global crypto advisory practice. We have seen interest from hundreds of clients globally and have committed engagements with 30 already covering their digital currency strategy, product development and their go-to-market plans.\nSecond, risk identity and authentication. In tokenization, we have now crossed the 3.5 billion token mark across more than 8,600 issuers in over 150 markets at 1.2 million merchants. Tokens have led to a 2.5 point increase in approval rates and a 28% reduction in fraud rates this past quarter in card-not-present payments.\nOur key risk solutions, Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager, screened about 30% more transactions in the first half of 2022 versus 2021. Third, CyberSource, our gateway capability, has seen considerable progress, just crossing the milestone of the 1 millionth merchant account onboarded.\nI spoke about transit before in CyberSource, which could play a key role in transit acceptance, added nearly 15 projects in the first half in Thailand, Italy and Japan, among others.\nSo to summarize, our value-added services represent a compelling way to diversify our revenue streams while helping our clients in bringing innovation to the payments ecosystem. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our brand is strong. Our network of networks is expanding. Our business is performing well and our people are motivated and passionate. We expect all our efforts will help power accelerated growth in the years to come.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\n\nVasant M. Prabhu\n\nVice Chair & CFO, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Despite Omicron, Russia and Ukraine, our fiscal second quarter results were very strong, with net revenues up 25% and GAAP EPS up 23%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 30%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 27% and non-GAAP EPS growth was 30%.\nA few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the U.S. index was 2 points higher than the first quarter at 1.44 versus 3 years ago. The international index, ex China, was down 2 points at 140 versus 2019 due to the impact of Omicron in early January.\nOmicron impact on most domestic volumes was short-lived as we hoped it would be. The robust cross-border travel recovery that started in the fall as borders reopened, resumed in February as Omicron impact faded. Border restrictions were lifted quickly and pent-up demand for travel remains very high.\nIndex to 2019, cross-border travel, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from a low of 71 in January to 94 in March. The first 2 weeks of March saw a spike in cross-border volumes from Russia and Ukraine due to displacement caused by the invasion. After we suspended operations in Russia in mid-March, there were no more cross-border transactions in or out of Russia. Adjusted for Russia and the spike from Ukraine, the March cross-border travel index relative to 2019 was around 90.\nSo far, we are not seeing any material impact on cross-border travel in other corridors as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our 3 growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues well over 20%. During the quarter, we bought back $2.9 billion in stock at an average price of around $2.10 -- $210. On March 10, we closed on the Tink acquisition.\nFinally, our second quarter P&L and balance sheet reflect our best estimates for the impact of suspending operations in Russia. This includes revenues and expenses from terminating all client and supplier contracts, resolution of settlement balances and the deconsolidation of our Russian business. We have adjusted 2 items from our GAAP earnings, expenses to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine and a charge related to net assets in our Russian legal entity.\nNow on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 17% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Debit spend remained resilient as credit spend continued to improve. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 18% or 42% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume grew 16%, up 44% versus 2019, which was 2 points better than the first quarter. Credit grew 27% and improved 4 points to 35% over 2019, helped by the affluent consumer.\nDebit grew only 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of stimulus last year, but growth remained very strong versus 2019 at 53%. As Al indicated, debit is indexing well above the pre-COVID trend line, benefiting from accelerated cash digitization.\nU.S. card presence spend grew 17% and was 21% above 2019 at its highest quarterly level since the pandemic. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 10% and was 70% above 2019. Relative to 3 years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spend continues to recover.\nInternational constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 40% above 2019.\nA few regional highlights. Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 99% higher than 2019, with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins.\nOur CEMEA region grew 18% year-over-year and 76% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitization. Excluding Russia, the CEMEA region was up 100% over 2019.\nEurope was up 21% year-over-year and 31% higher than 2019. Following an Omicron dip in January, we saw a rapid recovery in most European markets. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 36% year-over-year and were 54% above 2019. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Due to COVID restrictions, recovery across most of Asia has stalled while Hong Kong declined relative to 2019.\nIndia recovered strongly, up almost 20 points from December. India has been our fastest-growing market in Asia, up almost 80% since 2019, fueled by a tripling of e-commerce volumes.\nGlobal processed transactions were up 19% year-over-year and 38% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, were up 47% year-over-year and 12% over 2019. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, remained strong, up 16% year-over-year and well above the pre-COVID trend line at 67% above 2019.\nCross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 111% year-over-year and indexed at 82% of 2019 levels. As I mentioned earlier, after an Omicron-driven dip to 71 in January, the cross-border travel index to 2019 rose sharply to 94 in March. Many corridors are now indexing above 90 relative to 2019. Inbound travel to Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of the Middle East has been above 2019 levels for some time now.\nThere's plenty of recovery to come in one important corridor inbound to the U.S., which indexed only at 70 in Q2. Asia indexed in the high 30s, both inbound and outbound in Q2. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory. Most Asian borders are now open, except for China, and restrictions remain in place in Japan, Korea and Taiwan.\nMoving now to a quick review of second quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 24%, faster than the 20% nominal growth in Q1 payments volume. We were able to bill and collect service revenues in Russia through early March. As such, in the second quarter, we recorded almost 2 quarters of service revenues related to Russia.\nService revenues were also helped by increasing utilization of card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 16%, below the 19% processed transactions growth, mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 48% versus the 42% increase in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix.\nOther revenues grew 21%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines, each growing well over 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by Visa Direct and carded B2B recovery.\nVisa Direct transactions grew 20%, impacted by lapping a strong quarter in the U.S. last year and a suspension of Russian operations. As Al indicated, Russia was the second largest market for Visa Direct, accounting for 17% of transactions. This is an unfortunate setback but the Visa Direct business is ramping fast in other international markets as well as in use cases such as cross-border remittances, earned wage access and other B2C payouts.\nCommercial, or B2B volumes, grew 29% year-over-year, and up 38% versus 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength of small business and the recovery of large businesses across the portfolio of diverse spend categories.\nValue-added service growth was led by consulting and marketing services, card benefits as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include the acceleration of e-commerce, client growth in international markets and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 25.8% of gross revenues, at the lower end of expectations. This was driven by better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business and by deal timing, with some Q2 deals being pushed into Q3.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $127 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $133 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.70, non-GAAP EPS of $1.79, up 30% from last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter.\nA few comments on our trends through the first 3 weeks of April. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 12%, with debit up 2% and credit up 26%. Debit volumes are lapping the impact of stimulus payments in 2021. U.S. Airtel spend growth versus 3 years ago was up 45%, with debit up a robust 54% and credit up 37%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in major markets around the world with the exception of CEMEA where we now have no payments volume from Russia. Processed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 36% versus 2019.\nConstant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 47% year-over-year, and were 15% over 2019. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 62% about 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were at a 92 index to 2019. The small decline in this index relative to March is mostly due to the loss of Russia. Total cross-border volume was up 28% over 2019.\nMoving now to our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2022. Just as 2021 was a year of 2 distinct halves due to the recovery, 2022 will be a year of 2 halves due to Russia. The suspension of our business in Russia will reduce second half revenues by about 4%. Russia will also negatively impact the payments volume and cross-border volume index to 2019, each by 4 points. The impact on processed transactions index to 2019 will be under 1 point since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia. Ex Russia and Ukraine, our domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past 4 quarters relative to 2019.\nOur outlook for the second half assumes that these trends are sustained. While there are uncertainties created by high inflation, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and the invasion of Ukraine, there is no evident impact on our global payments volumes. E-commerce spend, both domestic and cross-border, has remained strong and stable relative to 2019 at well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as pandemic effects fade, and we are assuming this will continue.\nIn line with payments volumes, we expect processed transactions growth relative to 2019 to remain strong and stable, with the variability largely driven by the extent to which small ticket card-present everyday spend comes back. It is important to note that year-over-year growth rates will moderate as we lap the strong second half recovery in fiscal year '21.\nEx Russia and Ukraine we're assuming no spillover effects on other corridors in our cross-border business. Given where we ended the second quarter, we now expect cross-border travel, ex intra-Europe, to fully recover to 2019 levels by the end of our fiscal year, despite the loss of Russian business. Including intra-Europe, that would put cross-border travel above 2019 levels.\nWith these assumptions, third quarter net revenues are expected to grow at the upper end of the mid-teens range in constant dollars. This includes Tink & Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues. The dollar has strengthened and the exchange rate drag will likely reduce nominal net revenue growth by around 2.5 points.\nDue to some deals moving into the third quarter from the first half and the expectation that certain milestones will be achieved on some key contracts, incentives will run higher in the third quarter, between 26.5% to 27.5% of gross revenues. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow in the mid-teens, including expense savings from Russia and almost 3 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink. Exchange rates will likely reduce nominal operating expense growth by about 1.5 points. Our tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range.\nAt this point, we expect fourth quarter trends to be generally in line with the third quarter. As always, we will update our fourth quarter outlook in July. Based on results to date and our outlook for the second half, we expect full year net revenue growth in constant dollars in the high teens to 20% range, including approximately 0.5 point of contribution from Tink and Currencycloud.\nExchange rates will likely drag nominal growth rates down by around 2 points. There is no change in our expectation for full year incentives. Incentives as a percent of gross revenues are expected to range between 25.5% to 26.5%. We expect constant dollar non-GAAP operating expense growth at the upper end of mid-teens. This includes savings from the suspension of Russian operations and almost 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink.\nNominal operating expense growth will be around 1.5 points lower due to the stronger dollar. Our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 19% to 19.5% range.\nDespite the uncertainties caused by inflation, interest rates, the invasion of Ukraine and our exit from Russia, we expect fiscal year '22 will be a very strong year of above-trend top and bottom line growth.\nAs we enter the post-COVID era, we remain confident we can sustain a rate of growth above pre-COVID levels for all the reasons outlined, which I will summarize again. First, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments, both domestic and cross-border, as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally. Second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets.\nThird, sustainable high-teens growth across value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us.\nWith that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nHead of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host from Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Como and Mr. Mike Milotich. Ms. Como, you may begin.\n\nJennifer Como\n\nVP of IR, The Charles Schwab Corporation\n\nThanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as the result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\n\nAlfred Francis Kelly\n\nChairman & CEO, Visa Inc.\n\nJennifer, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining us. Amidst much uncertainty this quarter resulting from the ongoing COVID pandemic. Visa's financial performance was very strong.\nOur net revenues grew 24% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27%. And our financial performance was driven by record volumes, transactions and credentials. In Q1, we crossed the $60 billion payment transaction mark for the first time in history, up 26% from 2 years ago. Visa cards were used 28 million times per hour in the last quarter. And we also increased our card credentials to over $3.8 billion, up 10% in 1 year. I'm going to leave the rest of the details to Vasant as I want to focus on the future.\nAs we look ahead, we expect accelerated revenue growth versus pre-COVID over the coming years, driven by our 3 strategic levers of consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. Many current trends in payments, including ADA, RTP, Buy Now, Pay Later, Crypto and wallets are enabling new ways to pay. These represent opportunities for Visa, where we are extraordinarily well positioned to utilize our unique strength and global network to help them grow and scale.\nLet me start by talking about consumer payments. The opportunity to displace cash and check is enormous. At our last Investor Day, we said it was $18 trillion. In Q1, we saw our debit cash volumes at Visa growth 6% while debit payment volumes grew 19%. While cash displacement is certainly a reality, global personal consumption expenditure of cash and check grew at a CAGR of 2% over the 10 years ending in 2019.\nWhen we look at the opportunity ahead, if you assume global cash grows at 1% annually, industry-wide digital penetration of personal consumption expenditure when it reached 90% for several decades. For example, in Latin America, until a few quarters ago, there was more cash volume than payments volume on Visa credentials. In fact, in the past year, there has been a nearly 6.5 point shift and payments volume is now 55% of the total volume, even with cash in Latin America growing 10% this past quarter. We have expanded acceptance locations in Latin America by almost 30% in the past year to 18.5 million locations, and we've grown credentials over 20%. This quarter, we signed an 8-year agreement with Santander Chile, one of the largest issuers in the country. And in Brazil, we recently signed a deal with Banco XP, one of the country's largest digital banks with over 3 million customers. Brazil remains a growth market with payments volume growth up more than 1.5x historic levels in recent quarters.\nThe key to digitizing cash is that the on-ramps to our network have never been easier to access. Wallet providers have been rapidly issuing Visa credentials as they see value in an open-loop ecosystem. Naranja X is a rapidly growing Argentinian wallet using Visa cards with 2 million credentials issued between prepaid and debit over the last 2 years.\nThis quarter, we renewed our partnership with PayPay Bank, which enables accounts to PayPay wallet users. PayPay is one of the fastest-growing digital wallets in Japan with 42 million users and the bank already has 4 million Visa debit users.\nWe recently extended our partnership with Safaricom, the operator of M-PESA to cover African markets outside of Kenya, where M-PESA has 50 million customers.\nWe're also providing on-ramps for crypto players creating connectivity with fiat economies. There are over 65 crypto platforms and exchanges that have partnered to issue Visa credentials. This quarter, Visa credentials in crypto wallets had more than $2.5 billion in payments volume, which is already 70% of the payments volume for all of fiscal 2021.\nIn addition to embedding credentials and crypto platforms, we continue to innovate around our settlement and crypto API capabilities, which have been key differentiators for us for fintechs and financial institutions that are looking to extend crypto capabilities to their customers. We will continue to lean into the crypto space. And our strategy is to be a key partner to provide the connectivity, scale, consumer value propositions, reliability and security that is needed for crypto offerings to grow.\nEarlier this month, we previewed CBDC payment APIs currently in development, which would enable central banks to connect their therium-based CBDCs with Visa rails through a wallet with digital issuance capabilities, enabling consumers to spend with CBDCs at any Visa merchant. We partnered with Consensus to develop this concept, which was selected as one of the winning entries out of 300 ideas from 50 countries at the global CBDC challenge as part of the Singapore Fintech Festival judged by representatives from the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of International Settlements and the central banks of Brazil, India, Kenya and Indonesia.\nIn the face-to-face world, tap to pay continues to accelerate growth. Let me highlight progress in a few larger markets. In Brazil, the tap to pay penetration has increased from 5% to 24% in the past year. In India, where we have increased merchant locations 30% since fiscal year 2019 to $6 million at the end of fiscal year '21, the tap to pay penetration has nearly doubled to 16% in the same period. And all of these efforts have helped to fuel our 40%-plus year-over-year growth rate in payments volume in India this past quarter.\nIn the United States, we're nearing 20% tap to pay penetration with key metro cities showing even stronger growth. L.A., Seattle, Detroit, Orange County, Miami and Salt Lake City have all surpassed 25%. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland are up over 30%, and New York has reached 45%.\nE-commerce is also key to digitizing payments and e-commerce merchants are certainly growing as our relationships with them. We successfully closed a U.S. co-brand deal with Shopify, a key e-commerce platform with millions of global merchants and entrepreneurs. The Shopify Balance Card will allow Shopify's U.S. merchants to access funds from sales by the next business day and receive cash back on everyday business expenses like shipping and marketing.\nBuy Now Pay Later, our BNPL continues to grow, and we're seeing more and more BNPL fintechs issuing Visa credentials. Visa is enabling their shift to open loop so that their value proposition to consumers can scale through Visa's broad acceptance.\nLast quarter, I mentioned Corner. And this quarter, I'm pleased to announce that a firm has chosen Visa as their network partner for the Affirm debit card as well as renewing the virtual card business. We look forward to supporting Affirm's continued growth through Visa's wide acceptance and reach.\nBNPL fintechs are increasingly using Visa virtual cards to settle with merchants, driving triple-digit payments volume growth year-over-year in the United States. BNPL fintech consumers also continue to use their cards to pay off their installments with active cards growing 50% in the same period.\nFor traditional issuers, we have a network installment solution called, Visa Installments, which enables our financial institution clients to seamlessly offer BNPL capabilities through an existing credit credential on any Visa transaction. In Canada, one of the countries where we are launching the capability, we now have commitments from issuers and acquirers representing the majority of payments volume.\nCredentials on our network of networks through BNPL, crypto, other fintechs and our traditional issuers bring compelling value propositions like identity protection, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, security, loyalty and more to consumers. This tremendous value motivates consumers to use their Visa credential online or in face-to-face versus cash, A2A RTP or even blockchains.\nSo to summarize, the opportunity in consumer payments is huge and has an incredible long-term runway. On ramp to our network of networks have ever been easier. We provide a compelling consumer value proposition and the advances in new ways to pay are good for Visa and these payment providers. Visa is enabling utility and scale for BNPL, crypto and wallets and all other nuance entrants.\nNow let me move to progress with use cases and new flows, which represents a $185 trillion opportunity, 10x that of consumer payments. We are seeing a large appetite from our partners and experiencing significant growth. A key driver is Visa Direct, which targets a $65 trillion opportunity across P2P, small B, B2C and G2C. These are all use cases that Visa didn't really serve just 5 years ago. By aggressively pursuing these flows with our more compelling solution, Visa is seemingly displacing alternatives that rely on fragmented and dated technology, not the other way around.\nVisa transaction growth was 35% this quarter. In the U.S., domestic P2P is currently our largest use case and also our lowest yielding one. As we scale and grow other geographies and use cases, especially those that are cross border, we expect the revenue yield to increase. Regardless of the yield, Visa Direct is accretive given it mostly leverages our existing platforms and capabilities.\nUsage is growing with banks signing on for global remittances using cards or accounts among them, the Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the largest banks in Qatar, and CIBC and Simply Financial in Canada. Visa Direct is also enabling Fintech, Chime and neobank Barra in the U.S. for account-to-account money movement.\nUsage has also expanded across several other use cases this quarter, such as payouts to DoorDashers in Canada. We also recently signed an agreement with Toast to leverage Visa Direct on several fronts. First, near instant cash flow access to daily sales and loan disbursements for their 48,000-plus restaurant customers. And second, for fast tip payoff and earned wage access for their restaurant client employees.\nVisa Direct is a compelling capability because we offer incredible reach to more than 5 billion cards and accounts, global scale, a leading technology stack, world-class security and 24/7/365 reliability. All of which is easy to access through hundreds of partners across our global network of networks, reaching bank accounts through a combination of card, ACH and RTP systems in more than 175 countries.\nIn the B2B new flows opportunity, we expect future growth to have several vectors. Let me just highlight a couple. First, B2B carded issuance in both physical and virtual cards where we have a leading share. This quarter in India, after partnering with leading B2B neobank Open for several years, we signed a deal for credit and debit issuance as well as the implementation of Visa Direct.\nIn virtual card, we're expanding to new verticals. One recent example is health care. And this quarter, we signed an agreement with a direct health care company NoMe Health, a health care provider that serves 30,000 people per day across 10 U.S. states for its claims payment solution.\nA second vector of B2B growth is large ticket account based cross-border payments through Visa B2B Connect, which links our global payments infrastructure with best-in-class capabilities to address the primary pain points of existing solutions. In Latin America, Visa B2B Connect is available in nearly 30 countries, and we've enrolled partners in more than 1/3 of those countries already. One partner is Banco, a leading bank in Mexico since enabling the solution in March of 2021, the bank has grown Visa B2B Connect volumes double digits every quarter and has processed thousands of payments and hundreds of millions of payments volume. We also recently added Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia, Eastern and Central Europe, which will be live and processing transactions later this year.\nSo to summarize new flows, the opportunity is 10x consumer payments. Our capabilities and value proposition are strong versus the competition, and we expect revenue yield to continue to improve as we scale and grow Visa Direct, especially in cross-border use cases.\nNow let's move to value-added services. In Q1, revenue grew over 20%, and we expect strong growth to continue. One example is with Visa Consulting and Analytics. In addition to our crypto offerings that I mentioned earlier, we recently launched a specialized global crypto advisory practice to help financial institutions eager to offer customers a crypto solution, retailers who are looking to delve into NFPs or central banks exploring digital currencies.\nAnother example is with the authentication. In Europe, we have tripled the use of Visa's new authentication technology, EMV 3DS since the start of 2021, and this is coincided with a reduction in card-present fraud by 28%, and it has also positively impacted the transaction authorization rates.\nAnd we are launching new capabilities to build for the future. Visa Acceptance Cloud enables clients to move embedded payment processing software from individual devices to the cloud, eliminating the need for expensive terminals as well as the cost and time to certify the processing software. In addition, clients can access value-added services from fraud management to BNPL.\nWe also recently closed our acquisition of Currencycloud. We believe the combination of Currencycloud's APIs on the front end, which provide real-time foreign exchange capabilities and our settlement capabilities across our network of networks, we will have a very compelling value proposition. Together, we can enable new use cases and payment flows particularly as we expand the cross-border use cases, we provide our clients, including B2B Connect and Visa Direct. We can extend our FX platform for easy connect easier connectivity for fintechs and nonfinancial institution partners, and we can offer real-time FX rates and improve transparency for our partner customers.\nSo to summarize value-added services, we will continue to bring Visa innovation to the payments ecosystem. We are diversifying our revenue mix, and this will help us retain and win business and grow revenue well into the future.\nIn conclusion, as I think about Visa's future, I'm extremely optimistic and energized. While much has been written about new payment types being potentially disruptive to Visa, we see a lot more opportunity than disruption. Our global infrastructure is providing connectivity through our network of networks to power more traditional payment types and newer ways to pay and move money. Our interconnectivity, security, reliability, consumer and fraud protections, risk management and other value-added services offer a superior experience. We expect to attract more and more transactions, which will continue to fuel our growth at an accelerated rate.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\n\nVasant M. Prabhu\n\nVice Chair & CFO, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2022 is off to an excellent start with net revenues up 24% and GAAP EPS up 29%. Non-GAAP EPS adjusted for items, including investment gains and the litigation accrual was up 27%. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was approximately 1 point higher at 25% and non-GAAP EPS approximately 1.5 points higher at over 28%.\nA few key highlights. We had a very sharp recovery in cross-border travel in October and November as much of the globe ex-China moved to reopen borders or announced timetables to open borders and listed restrictions such as quarantines. As a result, card-present and card-not-present travel, which exited September at an index of 61 to 2019 rose steeply to hit an index of 72 for the first quarter. Border reopenings came sooner than we had anticipated. And as we've seen throughout 2021, consumers were very quick to act.\nAs Omicron hit, some borders shut and some restrictions were reinstated. However, as we speak, borders are being reopened and restrictions lifted, and we expect the travel recovery to resume as we head into February.\nPayments volumes remained robust through the quarter globally with index to 2019 stepping up relative to the prior quarter by 2 points in the U.S. and 6 points internationally. The credit recovery continued and debit growth remained strong and stable.\nU.S. holiday retail spending was especially strong, more than 40% over 2019. E-commerce continued to gain share of retail spending, up 5 points since 2019. The impact of Omicron on domestic volume has been modest. As the Omicron wave crest globally, we expect the impact to ease as it has in markets such as South Africa and the U.K., which were among the first to be hit.\nRevenue growth was very strong across our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments and new flows net revenues grew in the mid-20% range, and value-added services revenues grew over 20%. We significantly stepped up the pace of our stock buybacks during the quarter. We acquired 19.4 million shares for $4.1 billion at an average price of $210, and our Board authorized a new $12 billion stock buyback program in December. Also in late December, we closed the Currencycloud transaction.\nNow on to the details. In constant dollars, Global Payments volume was up 20% year-over-year and 26% versus 2019, each accelerating 3 to 5 points versus the last quarter, led by continued strength in debit as well as improving credit spending. Excluding China, total payments volume growth was 22% or 31% higher than 2019 and a 4 to 5-point acceleration from the fourth quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 22%, up 32% over 2019, both higher than Q4. Credit grew 27% and improved 6 points to 23% above 2019, helped by affluent consumer and small business spending. Debit grew 18% year-over-year and remained very strong at 43% above 2019 similar to the last quarter. As you can see, debit spend has remained resilient even as credit recovered.\nU.S. card presence spend grew 25% and was 17% above 2019, improving 2 points at its highest level yet in the pandemic, driven by fuel, retail and entertainment spending. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 16% and above 2019, similar to last quarter. E-commerce growth remains robust even as card presence spend continues to recover. U.S. retail spending during the holiday season grew double digits and more than 40% of our 2019 levels, both of which are very strong by historical standards. The share of holiday card present retail spending improved a few points from last year, but was still 5 points lower than 2019 as the shift towards e-commerce over the past decade continues.\nRetail shopping is happening earlier in the holiday season than it used to, which is a trend that started last year. As a result, relative to 2019, November volumes were stronger than December. U.S. holiday spending trends are fairly consistent with other major markets around the world.\nInternational constant dollar payments volume, excluding China, grew 22% and was 29% about 2019, improving 7 points from the fourth quarter. A few regional highlights: Latin America was up 44% year-over-year and 66% above 2019, accelerating 8 points from the fourth quarter with robust performance across the region, fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region remained strong, up 31% and 58% from 2019 levels, accelerating 10 points from the fourth quarter, also fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Europe was up 17% and 23% from 2019, improving 3 points from the last quarter due to strong performance across Continental Europe. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region, up 16% both year-over-year and versus 2019, but the recovery is finally underway with an 11-point improvement from Q4, mostly due to relaxed restrictions. The largest improvements were in Australia, India, Southeast Asia and Japan.\nGlobal process transactions were up 21% year-over-year and 26% over 2019, 2 points better than the fourth quarter, accelerating less than overall volume growth due to higher ticket sizes. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, was up 51% year-over-year and was 1% above 2019 volumes, a 15-point improvement from the fourth quarter. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, continued to strengthen, up 26% year-over-year and 50% above 2019, 7 points higher than the fourth quarter as consumer engagement continues to grow.\nCross-border travel-related spending, excluding intra-Europe, grew 102% year-over-year and was 72% of 2019 levels, improving an extraordinary 14 points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The recovery in the first 2 months of the quarter versus 2019 was very fast and broad-based with outbound travel from each of our regions improving more than 10 points relative to 2019 from September to November.\nInbound travel to the U.S., Canada, EMEA and Europe, all improved about 20 points during that time, while Latin America and Asia each improved at least 5 points. This recovery was driven by a combination of border openings, the relaxing restrictions and pent-up demand. Countries such as the U.S., Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Chile, Argentina and many more reduced friction for inbound travelers. The U.S. to Europe corridor remained open. This deep travel recovery started to lose momentum in the last week of December as Omicron spread around the globe. We expect this to be short-lived.\nMoving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 19%, slightly better than the 18% nominal growth in Q4 payments volume, helped by increased utilization of card benefits and small pricing modifications. Data processing revenues grew 19%, slightly below the 21% processed transaction growth, mostly due to exchange rate changes. International transaction revenues were up 50% consistent with nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Other revenues grew 17%, led by consulting, data and marketing services as well as travel-related benefits.\nRevenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines. Consumer Payments grew in the mid-20s led by improving cross-border volumes and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows also grew in the mid-20s driven by Visa Direct and the carded B2B recovery. Visa Direct transactions grew 35%. We're lapping very strong quarters from last year, which is moderating U.S. growth rates. Meanwhile, the international business is ramping fast as is growth from use cases such as cross-border remittances earned wage access and marketplace payouts.\nCommercial or B2B volumes grew 28% year-over-year and up 26% over 2019, a 5-point improvement from the prior quarter, mostly in credit. The growth is helped by share gains and a portfolio of diverse spend categories that is not overly dependent on T&E. Value-added services revenue grew over 20%, led by risk and identity as well as consulting and data services. Growth was driven by new client adoption, increased usage among existing clients and international expansion.\nClient incentives were 25.1% of gross revenues, about 1 point below our expectations. This was a result of a significantly better revenue mix due to the faster-than-expected recovery of our cross-border business. As our revenue mix continues to normalize with the cross-border recovery, it will help this ratio.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 24% inclusive of $145 million litigation provision associated with U.S. interchange multi-district litigation case. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 16%, in line with our expectations. We recorded gains from our equity investments of $231 million. Excluding investment gains, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $110 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 19.3% was in line with expectations. Our first quarter tax rate is typically a little lower than the full year rate.\nGAAP EPS was $1.83. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, up 27% over last year. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buyback, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter.\nA few comments on our trends through the first 3 weeks of January. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 13%, with debit up 4% and credit up 25%. As you assess these numbers, it is important to remember that there was a government stimulus disbursement, which caused the surge in debit spending in early January 2021. January spend growth versus 2019 was up 40% with debit up a robust 52% and credit up 29%. These trends are relatively consistent with performance in our major markets around the world.\nProcessed transactions grew 17% year-over-year, up 37% versus 2019, lagging volume growth due to larger ticket sizes. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe on a constant dollar basis grew 44% year-over-year and was 4% above 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth remained strong at 67% above 2019, up 17 points from the first quarter. The cross-border travel recovery has stalled since late December due to Omicron, indexing at 72 to 2019, in line with the first quarter. Border reopening, and we expect the recovery to resume in February. Total cross-border volume was 14% above 2019.\nMoving now to our outlook for the second quarter. Domestic volume growth has stayed robust and stable for the past 3 quarters. While Omicron has had some recent impact, it has been modest and will ease as the way of crest. This is also the case with e-commerce growth both domestic and cross-border. We are assuming that these trends continue. The swing factor is cross-border travel. As discussed, the cross-border travel recovery was very rapid in October and November as the U.S. border reopened and many countries ease restrictions or announced plans to do so. With Omicron surging, some restrictions were put back in place and some reopening plans were put on hold. However, restrictions are being eased and border reopening. We're assuming the cross-border travel recovery resumes in February.\nAs such, we expect net revenues to grow at the high end of high teens in the second quarter, including over 1 point of exchange rate drag. Incentives should grow at a similar rate as the first quarter, which as a percent of gross revenues will likely be in the 25.5% to 26.5% range based on volumes, renewal activity and cross-border performance. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens with some additional investment spend. The inclusion of Currencycloud will add another 1.5 points to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to come in at the high end of the 19% to 19.5% range.\nWe can also update some of the planning assumptions for the full year we had shared with you in October. Domestic payments volumes and cross-border e-commerce volume as well as the associated transactions are largely in line with expectations. At the end of December, we were running significantly ahead on cross-border travel indexed to 2019 relative to our assumptions in the fall. As such, we are now assuming that the cross-border travel index for 2019, excluding intra-Europe, end the fiscal year 10 points ahead of our prior assumptions are at 90%. Inclusive of intra-Europe travel, this would be back at 2019 levels.\nWith these updated assumptions, net revenue for the full year would grow at the high end of high teens including 1 point of exchange rate drag. Obviously, revenue growth would be higher if the cross-border recovery is more robust in the second half and more akin to what we saw in October and November. With revenue mix improving from higher cross-border volumes, incentives as a percent of gross revenues would range between 25.5% to 26.5% for the year. We expect organic non-GAAP operating expenses growth at the high end of mid-teens. The inclusion of Currencycloud will add another point to non-GAAP operating expense growth. Tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range.\nOn a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, the impact of Currencycloud is not material for the year. As a reminder, in our non-GAAP numbers, we make adjustments to exclude amortization of intangibles and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs.\nIn summary, FY '22 is off to an excellent start. We expect our growth this year will be well above the pre-COVID rate as cross-border recovers. This will likely continue into fiscal year '23. Beyond that, we are confident the business can sustain a revenue growth rate above pre-COVID levels for 3 reasons: first, an acceleration away from cash and check for merchant payments both domestic and cross-border as digitization becomes pervasive across consumers and businesses globally; second, acceleration of cash, check and wire transfer displacement as our new flows initiatives penetrate a broad range of new use cases with very large total addressable markets; third, sustainable high-teens growth across our value-added services, both from existing services and new offerings. As new flows and value-added services become a larger part of our revenue mix, growing faster than consumer payments, the sustainable growth rate will continue to rise. We are and will continue to invest in the capabilities required to capture the extraordinary growth opportunity ahead of us.\nWith that, I'll turn this back to Mike.\n\nMike Milotich\n\nSVP of IR, Visa Inc.\n\nThank you, Vasant.

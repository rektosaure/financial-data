Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Louise Bick. Please go ahead.\n\nLouise Bick\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Sempra's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Events and Presentations section.\nWe have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President of Sempra and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Caroline Winn, Executive Vice President of Sempra; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nEarnings for common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We'll also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\nI'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 5, 2025, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you all for joining us today. Before discussing today's financial results, I want to spend a moment reviewing how we've positioned our portfolio to deliver significant value to our owners through the end of the decade.\nToday, our company is situated at the intersection of several important secular trends, including the ongoing electrification of America's energy systems, AI deployment and the growing need to deliver energy safely and reliably. In order to capitalize on these trends, we've worked closely with our Board of Directors to update our corporate strategy to focus on lower risk and higher value transmission and distribution investments, growing our position as a leader in large economic markets, shifting our capital allocation to fund the growing needs of our U.S. utilities and doing so with a sharp focus on Texas, which is a market that we believe offers the best long-term value proposition for our owners.\nNext, let me turn to our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.11, which compares favorably with the prior period's results of $0.89. Also, with the strength of our year-to-date results, we're affirming full year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.30 to $4.70 while also affirming our 2026 EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.30. And finally, we're affirming our projected long-term EPS growth rate as shown on this slide.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll provide an update on our 2025 value creation initiatives. You'll recall that earlier this year, we announced a company-wide campaign focused on 5 initiatives to create value for owners. First, we set a goal of investing approximately $13 billion this year with the vast majority being allocated to our U.S. utilities.\nThrough the first 3 quarters, I'm pleased to report that we've successfully deployed nearly $9 billion of capital and remain on track to meet or exceed our year-end goal of $13 billion. Moreover, at Sempra Texas, we're benefiting from improving returns, primarily attributable to increased capital efficiency at Oncor, which is associated with the newly implemented unified tracker mechanism.\nMoving to the second initiative. We're pleased with our recent announcement to sell a 45% stake in Sempra Infrastructure Partners for $10 billion. We view that transaction as a major catalyst in unlocking Sempra Infrastructure's franchise value while also benefiting Sempra in numerous ways, including: number one, improving our business growth profile as the mix of regulated earnings significantly increases; number two, unlocking reinvestment capital for our U.S. utilities; number three, adding an average of $0.20 to EPS accretion over the 5-year period starting in 2027; and number four, fortifying our balance sheet, deconsolidating Sempra Infrastructure Partners' debt and paving the way for improved credit metrics.\nIn parallel, the ongoing sales process for Ecogas continues to generate a lot of interest from a number of prospective buyers, and we're expecting to receive final bids before the end of the year. Both transactions are expected to close by the middle of 2026.\nThe last initiative shown here at the bottom of the slide is aimed at improving community safety and driving operational excellence across the organization. This includes efforts to improve the regulatory environment with a view toward reducing enterprise risk. A great example is California SB 254, which strengthened the long-term stability of the state's wildfire fund while also improving claims liquidity.\nThe key takeaway on this slide is that progress on these initiatives is translated into improved financial and operational results, and I cannot be more proud of our employees who have embraced our commitment to both modernize and scale our organization, improve our cost structure and better serve all of Sempra's stakeholders.\nPlease turn to the next slide where Karen will walk through business updates.\n\nKaren L. Sedgwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Jeff. At Sempra, California, SB 254 was enacted, which is a significant derisking event for the California electric utilities. Jeff mentioned it earlier that the bill calls for an even split of funding between the California IOUs and their customers with no upfront contributions. Importantly, SDG&E share of the various contributions is a modest 4.3% for what amounts to just under $13 million per year through 2045, with additional future contingent contributions being required only if needed.\nContinuation account also strengthens the cap on reimbursement in the event of a finding of imprudence. It's also important to note that any contributions made by IOU shareholders to the continuation account may be also counted as prepaid credits against potential reimbursement amounts in the future.\nTaken together, we believe these measures, which are outlined on Slide 15 in the appendix, significantly strengthened the financial safeguards for electric utilities, an important achievement for all of California.\nAs we approach year-end, we're tracking several regulatory matters in California that we hope to wrap up, including Track 2 of the GRC, the 206 proceeding at FERC and the CPUC's cost of capital proceeding.\nMoving to Sempra Infrastructure. We previously announced a definitive sales agreement that's expected to reduce our ownership percentage to 25% will be accretive to EPS forecast and credit. And following the close of the transaction, we expect to maintain a solid cushion above our FFO to debt thresholds.\nAmong other benefits, a lower equity stake will also improve our regulated earnings mix, while allowing Sempra to deconsolidate Sempra Infrastructure debt from our GAAP financials.\nIn our LNG business, Port Arthur LNG Phase I continues to make notable headway with Train I expected to reach COD in 2027. We're on schedule and on budget with over 1/3 of piping installation complete on Train I. Recently, we also completed the Tank A Roof Air Race, which is another important milestone for the project.\nEarlier in the quarter, you'll recall that we also reached FID at Port Arthur Phase 2 and issued a full notice to proceed under our fixed-price EPC contract with Bechtel. This is important because it gives us the opportunity to leverage continuous construction at the site and reduce project risk. To date, we placed all high-value orders for long lead plant equipment and also completed the project's first permanent piles for Tank C and Train III.\nI'll also add that the value proposition of Sempra Infrastructure's LNG franchise continues to grow, as the European Council recently backed the EU proposal to end deliveries of pipeline gas and LNG from Russia by the end of 2027.\nMoving to ECA LNG Phase I. The project is over 95% complete and pre-commissioning activities are ongoing. Certain systems have moved into the commissioning phase, and we're currently working on repairing an auxiliary turbine designed to increase efficiency. Based on progress at the site, we continue to expect first LNG production in the spring 2026 with commissioning cargoes expected to commence thereafter.\nAt Cimarron construction continues to advance with the overall project being approximately 95% complete. And just last week, Cimarron achieved initial synchronization of approximately 1/3 of the turbines that are now online and operational. And importantly, the project remains on target to achieve COD in the first half of 2026.\nFinally, at Sempra Texas. Oncor's base rate review continues to make considerable progress. In September, a settlement on interim rates was approved that allows Encore to apply the final approved rates back to January 1, 2026, if the case is not finalized by that date. And through October, Oncor has evaluated arguments submitted rebuttal testimony and is actively engaged in settlement discussions with all parties.\nNext, the procedural schedule calls for a hearing on the merits to begin the week of November 17. With completion of the base rate review and an updated 2024 test year, together with the opportunity to improve capital efficiency with the UTM, Oncor will be better positioned to support customer growth across its service territory.\nAnd at the end of September, we continue to see strong growth in Oncor's core markets. Oncor's active LC and IQ has increased over 10% from the prior quarter. Further, premise count increased by 16,000 and Oncor also built, rebuilt or upgraded nearly 660 circuit miles of T&D lines during the quarter.\nAs customer growth continues to accelerate, in the transmission expansion plans advance, Oncor anticipates a substantial increase to its 2026 to 2030 capital plan.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Turning to the Texas 765 transmission expansion. We believe this remains a key growth driver that's underappreciated by the market. Ercot estimates $32 billion to $35 billion to complete the full build-out. And as a reminder, we estimate Oncor's portion of these projects will surpass 50% of the total investment with Permian projects expected to come online by the end of 2030 and non-Permian projects being completed in the 2030 to 2034 time frame.\nAs a result, Oncor is now forecasting an increase of over 30% to its projected 2026 to 2030 capital plan. And though we're still early in our fall planning process, Oncor continues to see substantial upside opportunities to its updated base plan forecast. That's why at Sempra, we're prioritizing the Texas market within our portfolio and assuming a constructive rate case outcome you should expect us to allocate a significantly greater share of investment capital to Sempra Texas in our roll forward plan.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll review the third quarter financial results. Earlier today, Sempra reported third quarter 2025 GAAP earnings of $77 million or $0.12 per share. This compares to third quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $638 million or $1 per share. Note that third quarter 2025 GAAP earnings include a $514 million tax expense related to classifying Sempra Infrastructure Partners as held for sale, which is nonrecurring in nature.\nOn an adjusted basis, we're pleased with our strong year-to-date execution, as third quarter 2025 earnings were $728 million or $1.11 per share. This compares favorably to our third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $566 million or $0.89 per share. We believe this sets us up well for the remainder of the year as well as next year where we're anticipating strong year-over-year growth from the midpoint of our 2025 guidance.\nWe're continuing to expect several regulatory decisions in the next several months and don't want to get ahead of the CPUC. Ultimately, the resolution of these matters will be helpful in determining where our full year financial results come in.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Variances in the third quarter 2025 adjusted earnings as compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows: At Sempra, California, we had $76 million primarily from higher income tax benefits, partially offset by higher net interest expense. This included $32 million associated with the election to accelerate deductions for self-developed software expenses authorized under OB3 as well as return to provision impacts and timing of flow-through tax benefits in the quarter.\nWe're also pleased that Sempra California had $47 million from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, partially offset by lower cost of capital.\nTurning to Sempra Texas. We had $45 million of higher equity earnings from higher invested capital, Oncor system resiliency plan and unified tracker mechanism, partially offset by higher operating and interest expenses.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, we had $26 million, primarily from higher asset optimization, partially offset by lower transportation results, lower tax benefits and other. At the parent, the $32 million decrease is primarily due to higher net interest expense, lower investment gains and others, partially offset by higher income tax benefits from OB3.\nPlease turn to the next slide. To conclude our prepared remarks, we continue to execute on our 2025 value creation initiatives and also have delivered solid third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Further, the Sempra Infrastructure Partners transaction is a significant positive catalyst for our company and reinforces our mission of building America's leading utility growth business.\nTo accomplish that, we're targeting strong rate base growth in Texas and California with a view towards posting improved and more durable earnings and cash flows in the future. And as we've indicated, we think there are significant incremental capital investment opportunities to do just that over both the near and long term, which is why we feel confident in announcing that Oncor's roll forward capital plan is expected to increase by at least 30% over its current $36 billion base capital plan.\nLooking forward, we expect to officially announce Sempra's 2026 to 2030 capital plan on our fourth quarter call in February, subject to the completion of Oncor's pending base rate review.\nThank you for joining us, and I'd now like to open up the line for your questions."

    "content": "Half Year 2025 Sirius Real Estate Ltd Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2025 Sirius Real Estate Ltd Earnings Call\n\nSRELONDONNOV 17, 4:00 AM\n\nAndrew Coombs\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to today's presentation of Sirius Real Estate's Interim Results for the Period Ending September 2025. My name is Andrew Coombs. I'm the Chief Executive Officer of the Sirius Group, and I'm joined this morning by Chris Bowman, who is the Group Chief Financial Officer of Sirius Real Estate. Together, we will take you through this morning's presentation.\nAs you all know, we are an on-balance sheet, best-in-class owner and operator of mixed-use light industrial business parks on the edge of key towns in Germany and the United Kingdom. Please remember that Sirius operates in both the German and the U.K. markets under the brand of Sirius in Germany and BizSpace in the U.K. The group currently operates over EUR 3 billion of property, 90% of which is wholly owned by the group. This consists of 160 sites in total, 77 in the U.K., 76 in Germany and 7 sites within the Titanium joint venture in Germany.\nLet's now turn to Page 4 and look at the highlights for the period. The Sirius Group is a rigorous, well-run and very importantly, growing organization. We have proved the resilience and the reliability of the business model during COVID, during the gas crisis in Germany and most recently, through a period of rising interest rates in Europe and the U.K., during which we have successfully protected valuations in spite of yield expansion. In that time, we have continuously, without exception, grown our revenues. We have continually, without exception, increased our dividend payments. And as I said, we have made sure that the value of our properties goes up, not down.\nIn the period to September '25, we successfully grew like-for-like rent roll by more than 5%. And as a result of the acquisitions in the period, we have grown the total rent roll by more than 15%. We have done this by maintaining occupancy in Germany and increasing it by just over 1% in the U.K. And we've increased like-for-like pricing in both markets by more than 4%. As a result of this, we are announcing a dividend of EUR 0.0318, which at per share level is a year-on-year increase of 4%.\nSo let me now ask you to turn to Page 5, and Chris will take us through the income statement.\n\nChris Bowman\n\nCFO & Director\n\nThank you, Andrew. Good morning, everybody. As Andrew said, over the next 4 pages, I will run through some of the highlights of the P&L and also the balance sheet, just picking out some of the key items.\nSo on Page 5, just starting at the top, very pleased that the -- that increasing like-for-like rent roll of 5.2% has underpinned growth in rental income of 7.7% for the first half versus the first half last year. So you can see there, we've achieved EUR 112.6 million of rental income. That has translated to a 4.9% increase in net operating income. As I've mentioned in the past, as we have acquired assets, we're in acquisition mode, very active acquisition mode. As we've acquired assets, some of those assets tend to have higher service charge leakage than in our existing core portfolio. So there is a small drag, which we turn around relatively quickly on service charge costs that you can see there. That is obviously upside for the future to come through.\nLooking down at EBITDA, you can see of that 7.7% top line, we've achieved 9.7% increase in EBITDA. So very pleased to achieve some operating leverage there. As we grow the asset base, and we grow the income base, we are keeping a very tight control of our costs and to then improve our margins. Specifically within that corporate costs and overheads dropping from 24.8% to 22.7%. We have been very careful from a headcount perspective and found efficiencies. We've also tightened up and had various initiatives internally to improve our cash collection that has allowed us to be tighter on provisioning and again, has provided upside there.\nMoving on. I'm going to be -- unfortunately, I'm going to continue to talk about headwinds of finance cost, unfortunately, for the next 2 or 3 years. We do have the finance cost headwind that we continue to outrun. So you can see there our net finance expense goes from EUR 6.3 million to EUR 9.4 million, and -- but still, we more than have outrun that with the growth in -- at the EBITDA level to achieve an FFO up 6.6% of EUR 64.7 million. As I think those of you know us already, FFO is what we -- is our core target in the business. It's the cash flow, it's the profitability of the business that we really focus on. We are an operationally focused business. We are not trying to guess the property markets or play valuation yields. We're focused on providing profits -- growing profits to provide growing dividends. So very pleased to achieve that 6.6% increase in FFO.\nI've included the detail all the way down to profit after tax on this page because there are three items that I think need further explanation. One, headwind, and two, tailwinds. So within the foreign exchange, you can see there EUR 14.3 million, there is a EUR 14.2 million of that is what is classed as a realized FX loss, which relates to sterling cash balances, which we held at the beginning of the period in anticipation of that cash being placed into U.K. assets -- U.K. investments. So it was a very busy first half for acquisitions. We acquired over EUR 200 million worth of property in the U.K. We held the appropriate level of cash in sterling to do that. When that cash converted from the cash line into the investment properties line, it was mark-to-market at the FX at that moment. So it is -- unfortunately, it does all flow all the way through EPRA earnings. So you'll see it, but it is a one-off, and I'll happily take questions further on that.\nOn the upside, we have EUR 14.4 million of valuation gain. So that is purely for the first half. I would expect to achieve better than that in the second half. But again, that's with virtually no yield contraction. We'll come on and talk about later. That's really valuing the increase in rent roll that we've achieved.\nAnd then further down the page, you can see the profit after tax is materially up 56.8% at EUR 87 million. And part of the fiscal stimulus that Germany is -- has enacted is the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 15% to 10%. That goes down by 1% a year from 2028. What that means is that our deferred tax liabilities on the gains in our property portfolio reduce. So you can see there's a EUR 29.8 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities that flows through the P&L and hence drives that profit after tax number up.\nGoing over the page to Page 6, just reflecting that on a per share basis. We have the EUR 98 million of NOI converts to EUR 0.0652 per share. These numbers all still have the impact of the additional shares that came into the share count from July '24 equity raise. So prior year, there was a weighted average number of shares, now this is on the full number of shares that is outstanding. And the interest and current tax equates together to EUR 10.8 million. That's a EUR 0.72 cost line gets us to the EUR 0.043 of FFO. Below the FFO line, really the thing I would flag is that EUR 14.2 million foreign currency translation that then has an impact on the adjusted earnings and EPRA earnings, but as I say, is noncash. If you look at our cash flow statement, our operating cash flow broadly correlates with the FFO.\nWe have paid out in dividend EUR 0.0318 or proposing to pay out EUR 0.0318, as Andrew said, up 4%. That equates to a 74% payout ratio for the first half. That will start to transition down going forward, and we will settle around 70% payout ratio in the next 3 to 4 years as we go through the financing windows.\nOn to Page 7, just looking at the balance sheet. At the top line, you can see that our investment properties have increased by EUR 300 million. So within that, you have the EUR 295 million of acquisitions that we actually completed on in the period. You've got EUR 14.4 million of valuation gain across the group and then a disposal of some smaller sites in the U.K. is the balance. The cash balance has come down to EUR 424.9 million, of which EUR 389 million is ours, excluding the deposits of tenants. The EUR 179.9 million movement is net of the bond tax that we did in the period of EUR 105 million. And then on the bottom half of the balance sheet, really, the only thing to flag there is that the debt outstanding is at EUR 1.416 billion. Bear in mind that we have the repayment of the June '26 bond coming up for EUR 400 million, hence, why the cash balances are relatively inflated and also the debt balance is relatively inflated as well, but those two net each other off. Just a reminder, we also put in place EUR 150 million RCF during the period, which provides that liquidity to repay that debt.\nLooking down NAV, reported NAV is up 0.8%, benefiting from that valuation gain. Adjusted NAV is down 0.9%, roughly EUR 0.011. Again, there is a foreign exchange unrealized currency translation there of EUR 29 million, which in simple terms is just converting our U.K. assets into our reporting currency of euros. Bear in mind that if you then convert the entire NAV back to sterling, our sterling is up on a sterling base -- our NAV is up.\nOn to Page 8, just quickly just running through the waterfall of NAV from EPRA at each end from March to September. I think EPRA NAV going from EUR 117.6, we target ourselves on adjusted NAV, EUR 118.89. As I say, the EUR 0.02 headwind is the unrealized FX of EUR 29 million. We achieved EUR 27.5 million recurring profit after tax in Germany. We had EUR 17.7 million upside in valuation in the German portfolio as well as then EUR 19 million of profit after tax in the U.K., which is EUR 1.27 million, a small valuation loss after CapEx of EUR 2.2 million in the U.K. Net of the dividend gets you back down to EUR 117.84. So really, the delta in there, the movement is the FX, which without the FX, we would have been up in NAV terms. I'll hand over to Andrew on Page 9.\n\nAndrew Coombs\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nSo Page 9 deals with the organic growth in Germany. And just before I delve into the numbers, let me give you a little bit of the narrative because if I cast my mind back to the beginning of the period, the first quarter of this financial year, so April starting quarter, it's easy to forget that the German government had only just taken power in April of this year. And I think it's probably fair to say that the new government was still establishing itself and certainly hadn't gained any momentum at that point. And we certainly felt that in the trading. The first quarter of this year in Germany was a tough quarter. We made our numbers, but the effort and the workload that we had to put in to achieve that was certainly much greater than it normally is. We saw the momentum start to establish itself in the second quarter. And I'm pleased to tell you the 6 weeks following the end of the period, we very much feel that, that momentum is gathering pace. I would describe Germany, at the moment, is in a transitionary phase. And it's quite confusing because when you look at numbers like the numbers on German manufacturing, you don't see any substantial increase at this point in time. Lots of people, therefore, turn around and say, what's happening in Germany and are things good in Germany. What we see on the ground is we see reorganization. So we see factories stopping production. We see things being reorganized. And they're typically being reorganized towards defense. But the problem right now is that you have to stop producing what you produce in your factory in order to strip it out and prepare the production lines to produce defense-related items. And that's what I mean by a transitionary phase. And that's why the production numbers are going down. But what is happening is the preparation is being laid for -- in a couple of quarters' time, those production lines to be up and running and operating not just one shift as we often see here in the U.K., but typically a continental shift pattern of three shifts every 24 hours, at least six days a week. So what we believe is that Germany is preparing to substantially increase its output. We've seen this before in previous years. We've seen it where they've used in the past, furlough or kurzarbeit as they call it in Germany, where suddenly what happens is the economy appears to flip. Some have called it in the past, the German economic miracle. It's no miracle at all. It's Germans preparing before they flip the switch. That is exactly what we see happening in Germany at the moment. And in that period, what we were able to do is we were able to grow the like-for-like rent roll by EUR 7.2 million, so 5.3%. We were also able to increase the overall annualized rent roll by 12%. But the difference between that 5.3% and the 12% is, of course, acquisitions. We were able to increase pricing by 4.7%. Would you believe it? That's a little bit more than we wanted to do. We are in an occupancy-led strategy here. What that means is that we want to control our pricing to about 4% and get the rest of the effect out of increase in occupancy. When you've got a workforce who've been used to putting prices up, not only do you have to get your processes and your systems to do the right thing, you've got to get people to do what is the opposite of what we've been asking them to do for years, which is put prices up by less. And actually, in that regard, we slightly failed because our occupancy remained constant and price, we were aiming for 4%, price nearly hit 5%. You can see that in doing that, what we did is we had to lower our move-in rate, and what we achieved was a move-in rate that was just marginally higher than the move-out rate. So move-in at EUR 7.66 versus move-out at EUR 7.52. But all of that was successful in lifting the underlying like-for-like rate per square meter in the portfolio as a whole from EUR 7.38 per square meter per month to EUR 7.73 per square meter per month. So a delicate balance largely due to the first quarter, but successful in as much as we continue to push rate up in the portfolio. And in doing so, we've been able to make sure that we at least maintain our occupancies.\nWe go across the page, and we look at that rent roll movement, you can see the EUR 7.2 million is reflected in the difference between EUR 135.3 million and EUR 142.5 million. What we faced was EUR 19.5 million of move-outs and the way in which we compensated for that was really the EUR 6.2 million of CapEx-assisted move-ins together with the EUR 14.1 million like-for-like move-ins. Those two gave us a total of EUR 20.3 million, so EUR 800,000 above the move-out effect. And then the uplifts, the pricing at 4.7% gave us 6.4%, and that 6.4% together with the 0.8% gets you to the 7.2%. But really, the exciting thing is those acquisitions in the right-hand column. And bear in mind, the last EUR 40 million of acquisitions in Germany that completed only last week, not included in these numbers. But what you've got is you've got over EUR 9 million of second half effect to come from those acquisitions. That EUR 9 million will build closer to EUR 10 million. So that's a EUR 20 million annualized effect that's going to bake through into next year's numbers. Now half of it will get eradicated by increased interest rate, and Chris will talk about that. But we've got sufficient acquisitive growth here to be able to deal with the increased interest and still have EUR 10 million of FFO growth. Put on top of that, the 5% organic growth. And I hope what you can see is rather than using interest rate increases as an excuse to go backwards, what we've been able to do through careful planning and careful execution over the last 18 months is put ourselves in a position where we can outgrow next year's problem.\nIf I go across to the following page, we can talk about valuations. So the first thing that I would draw your attention to is on the right-hand side above the total assets black headline, net yield shift of 1 bp. That shift is the yield coming in, not going out. Why the valuers would have bought us in by 1 bp, I cannot imagine, but I would suggest it is a signal. And the signal is clearly that the direction of travel is that the yield is shifting in, in Germany, not out. Clearly, it's made very little, if any, difference because we started in March '25 with a valuation of EUR 1.890 billion, and we get to September '25 on EUR 1.921 billion, clearly, a EUR 31 million shift there. That EUR 31 million shift comes from EUR 2.3 million of additional rent roll valued at a gross yield of 7.4%. And what you can see in the bottom right-hand corner of this page is you can see after the acquisitions that we're talking about have been made, the yield at a gross level goes up slightly and the capital value per square meter goes down. That is because we are buying vacancy. That is because we are buying lesser quality rent roll because that is exactly our runway to put our machine across the top of it and improve it. So the reason that you are seeing that gross yield go out is because of the opportunity that we're buying and the belief that we can do something with that opportunity by putting it over our platform.\nIf I go across to the inquiry stats, what we can see here is the number of sales, the number of customers we have acquired is 3% down. The sales volume that we've acquired compared to same period last year is 2.5% down. However, what we are pleased about is sales conversion is at 14.6%, up from 12.8% and close to our long chased target of 15% sales conversion. We are at last beginning to hit those numbers on a regular basis. What this shows is it shows the pain in quarter 1 of the first half, and it shows our ability to work the platform harder in the form of sales conversion in order to make what we've got count and drop more frequently to the bottom line. So this reflects the first quarter, but it also reflects the strength of the platform to deal with issues as and when they arise.\nIf we go across to some of the acquisitions, I'm not going to go through every single one because they've been covered previously in lots of different announcements. But I draw your attention to Dresden. Dresden is, we think, one of Germany's best kept secrets. Silicon Saxony, where there is the most incredible amount of inward and foreign investment going in. Tim Lecky and I were in Dresden a few weeks ago. What did we count something like 17 cranes on the horizon and not 17 static cranes, 17 working cranes within the eye line in Silicon Saxony building things. Lubeck. Lubeck is in the area that benefits from the biggest infrastructure spend that is currently going on in Germany. And if we go across the page, we see Dresden again, no surprise. And we see Feldkirchen on the right, just outside Munich. This is an asset where 1/3 of the rent roll is a defense supplier, a defense supplier who specializes in the manufacture and development of optical devices, most notably night vision technologies for the military.\nIf I go across to Page 15, let me hand across or hand over to Chris.\n\nChris Bowman\n\nCFO & Director\n\nThanks, Andrew. And so just on Page 15, I just thought it would be good to update everyone on the current status of the portfolio and also on the next 2 pages on CapEx as well. Really, Page 15, I think, is the kind of secret sauce in Sirius for the growth of Sirius. That is how do we take the Sirius platform, put it to work on our property portfolio and take assets which have value creation opportunity and capitalize on that value. How do we create that value for shareholders? Now we break down our portfolio into the 2 buckets of value-add and mature. You can see there that the -- roughly speaking, it's 1/3 mature, 2/3 value add. And really, the value-add piece is the piece where we go to work on these assets to essentially try and mature them to try and put them into the mature bucket. And what -- why do we do that? We do that because of the opportunity to drive value. So you can see the average yield -- gross yield is 6.8% on our mature assets, 7.9% on our value add. Importantly, the gap between net and gross yield, the leakage on service charge is 90 bps on value add versus 30 bps on mature and also how the valuers then value that greater income and better performance. On average, we are at EUR 1,277 capital value per square meter in the mature versus EUR 868 in the value add.\nYou can see what we have to achieve to get from one to the other in terms of occupancy, on average, 78.9% versus 94% and also the upside from rate. So by improving our assets that have this opportunity in them, we get many benefits, not only additional rent roll, but how -- but also then better net operating income because better management in terms of property expenses. We get valued better by the valuers. And obviously, we've achieved higher rate as we improve the quality of the site as well. It becomes an ever-improving cycle essentially on those assets as we improve them.\nNow we have overall 336,000 square meters of vacancy to power the growth in the business. On average, we typically look to improve roughly 100,000 square meters a year. That links into our CapEx plans each year. And so you have at least a 3-year runway of growth in the business. And obviously, as we're acquisitive at the moment, we are continually replenishing that opportunity.\nOver the page, just looking at where we are really putting capital to work to help on that journey from value-add to mature. In the first half, we have invested EUR 18.6 million in our CapEx programs, roughly split 2/3 Germany, 1/3 U.K. The value-add CapEx is that piece of the pie that really generates the high returns. We put a minimum 30% return on investment. So that's cash return on what we spend. So we're looking for a 3-year payback on incremental rental income from all of our value-add CapEx spend. You can see again, it's split roughly 2/3 Germany, 1/3 U.K. On the right-hand side, you can see some of the pictures of where we've actually put that capital to work. Bottom right, Vantage Point, when the range -- when we moved the range out of Vantage Point, essentially, there was three large halls left for us to tackle. We have already refurbished one of those halls. We put EUR 1.5 million of CapEx into that hall, and we have let it to Big Doug, which was an existing tenant on the site. I think for those of you who have been to Vantage Point, I remember we visited them before they were moving into the new space. Pleased to say they have now moved in. And the effect of that EUR 1.5 million spend allowed us to achieve double the rate on that space that it previously was achieving.\nNew builds, we are in a cycle here where we have just finished the new builds at Gartenfeld. So on the top right there, you can see 1 of the 3 halls we built at Gartenfeld. So just EUR 800,000 went into just final completion of that hall. We've rented all three of those halls at Gartenfeld at far better rates than we expected. And then from a works perspective, just under EUR 10 million spend on works. So we keep a very, very tight lid on our -- that's essentially the maintenance CapEx. That's often the likes of renewing lifts, for instance, that type of spend. But within there, there is EUR 2 million of spend on ESG, which is principally PV solar in Germany as well as EUR 2 million in the U.K., which relates to EPCs and our continuing drive towards C and B.\nOver the page, Page 17, just to -- I've rolled this forward essentially. So I'm looking back over the last three years, what is our spend, and how are we performing. We have put 293,000 square meters of vacancy. We have put CapEx into value-add CapEx. That equates to EUR 31 million of spend, on average, EUR 106 per square meter. So this is not what I'd describe as kind of high-risk CapEx. We're not -- as a norm, we're not completely rebuilding or knocking down space. We are typically refurbishing space. The most complicated it tends to get is subdivision and the fire safety regulations that come with that. But it's very much low-risk and low-cost refurbishment.\nWe've achieved EUR 12.7 million of rent improvement of that. So -- and at the moment, the occupancy is 74%. That continues to build as the CapEx we've spent in the most recent period, some of that space continues to be let up. And we're achieving rates of EUR 491, which gives us a return on investment of 41% cash return.\nJust conscious of time, move on to Slide 18. As I say, new builds, we have just come to the end of the A, B and C halls at Gartenfeld, and I would highlight that we've achieved a yield on cost there of 9% on a site which is valued at 5.5%. So obviously, as that income is valued at 5.5%, we've achieved 21% IRR on those developments, which is on surplus land at Gartenfeld. In the pipeline, there is an additional EUR 25 million of projects. That's spread across. There's a site in Dresden -- there's two sites in Dresden where we have opportunity for development. And there is also another space at Gartenfeld as well where there is further development.\nI'll hand back to Andrew to talk about U.K.\n\nAndrew Coombs\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay. I've got switching to U.K. mode now and think about the U.K. picture, which is a different picture from the picture I described in Germany.\nSo let's start firstly with the annualized rent roll. The annualized rent roll, which obviously benefited from acquisitions. Many of you have seen Hartlebury, was up 21%. 5.1% of that comes from the like-for-like rent roll. And as you can see, what happened here was we were more successful in convincing our sales force to be able to lower price and in doing so, raise occupancy by 1.2%. However, you've got a slightly different situation here with your move-ins and your move-outs. We actually dipped below the move-out rate on the move-ins, but we were still successful in that equation in terms of lifting the like-for-like underlying rate in the portfolio by 4.1%, namely from 14.38p per square foot to 14.97p. How did we do that? Well, we did that with our expansion initiatives. As you can see, what happened is we had 344,000 square foot move out, 302,000 move in. But what we were also able to do is to work the existing base of customers to get some of them to take more space and some of them to take more products. So we've had to work very hard here in the U.K. in order to be able to get that 1% of occupancy and also to be able to not just maintain, but increase price by at least 4%. That 4% is important because we know inflation in the U.K. isn't as much as 4% at the moment, but it could be soon. And we don't want to be caught out by that. We don't want to be trying to catch the inflation. We want to make sure that we are in a process in the U.K., where we're always ahead of inflation in terms of the way in which we manage that rent roll of customers. So rate per square foot is up by 4.1%. Move-outs are at GBP 18.44, which is 57p or 3% lower than the move-outs. That's had about a 1% overall effect because your new business affects about 1/3 of your total. It's your renewals that affect typically the other 2/3. And what we're seeing in the U.K. in contrast to Germany is we're seeing the U.K. get harder. Germany is getting easier. U.K. is getting harder. We are not panicking about that. We believe that the platform in the U.K. is now well enough developed and strong enough to be able to overcome that market effect, and that's exactly what you're seeing in the figures on this page in front of you now.\nIf we look at the way it's built, you can see GBP 59.3 million rent roll moves in September '25 to GBP 60.4 million. You can see that the move-outs and move-ins that the move-outs are not quite covered by the move-ins. But look, that pricing uplift of GBP 3.8 million becomes so, so important because that's what gives you the final edge. And then if you look at acquisitions, GBP 14.4 million coming from acquisitions. As you know, in the last 6 months, the acquisitions have been slightly more weighted to the U.K. than Germany. That will change now going forward. We are going to be looking at a predominantly German-only effort, at least until May, June of next year.\nIf we have a look at what that looks like in a valuation perspective, net yield shift of 4 bps. Well, that's going out, not coming in. So again, the 4 bps don't really make much difference, but the signal from the values is that -- in the U.K. yields continue to widen. If we look at the bottom right-hand corner and you see the assets being included not just on a like-for-like basis, but the acquisitions that have been made in the period, you see the opposite to what I described in Germany. You see a gross yield coming in to 12.3%. At March 25, it was 14.1%. And you see the net yield coming in from 9.5% to 8.8%. That is reflective of the quality of assets we've been buying in the U.K. When you think about Hartlebury, when you think about Vantage, when you think about Chalcroft, I could go on. We have consistently been buying higher quality assets than the assets we inherited when we bought the business. They typically have longer lease lengths. That's not long lease lengths. That's longer lease lengths. So what we're doing in the acquisition program that we've conducted thus far in the U.K. that we are going to be pausing on until at least June of next year. What we've done is actively gone out to increase the overall quality of the portfolio, and that's reflected by what you see in the bottom right-hand corner.\nIf we go across the page, what we can see in the U.K. is we've been able to attract more inquiries. A little bit deceiving there because we're not passive. It's not like we just sit there and say, what does the market give us in inquiries. We have worked much, much harder to acquire more inquiries that we've -- then been able to convert into sales. Please don't look at these numbers and think U.K. market is going up, because this lead flow reflects what is happening when you just passively sit there and try and collect whatever the market gives you. These numbers are misleading if you read them like this. We have had to work a lot harder to increase that inquiry flow in the U.K.\nIf we go across to the acquisitions, I've talked about Hartlebury in the middle here. Bedford on the left-hand side, interesting enough, 1/3 of the rent roll in Bedford is underpinned by a company that manufactures parts for ejector seats for the defense industry. In fact, they make parts for the ejector seats in the F-35, Typhoon Eurofighter. So when you see these orders being announced by U.K. defense industry, that factory is one of the beneficiary of those orders. Chalcroft, I'm delighted to tell you that we've had very strong interest from a major supermarket. So Chalcroft next door to it has got hundreds of new houses currently being built. And we're in advanced discussions with a major supermarket to develop on the front land of that site, one of the big four supermarkets to serve that residential area. So call that a stroke of luck, call it whatever you like, but that's going to be quite good for us.\nLet me hand over to Chris.\n\nChris Bowman\n\nCFO & Director\n\nSo I don't intend to -- just on Page 24, I won't go through these line by line, but I think the highlights, obviously, on -- in aggregate, we have acquired an 8.1% gross yield. You've seen earlier that our existing portfolio is valued around 7.4, 7.5, and in aggregate, we have acquired EUR 338 million, of which EUR 295 million completed in the period. Feldkirchen just at the bottom there in November, completed last week. So that is also now on balance sheet. I think if you look at timing, then just to reiterate Andrew's point earlier, the majority of these acquisitions actually completed towards the end of the first half. So really, that annualized rental income of EUR 25.8 million has yet to actually flow through into the P&L, but there is significant growth to come through, which is in the tank for future periods. On the disposals, Pfungstadt, we have notarized the recycling of that asset, EUR 30 million in Germany, that completes at the end of this financial year, so at the end of March for EUR 30 million. Just to head off, I'm sure I got a question on Tyseley, why have we sold an asset in Tyseley at 16.6% gross yield. There was also significant maintenance cost there and getting straight to the point, it needed a new roof, which would have been an additional EUR 3 million spend. So from a business planning perspective, it made sense to realize that asset at this time. And it's also linked to the continued consolidation of the U.K. portfolio. We're just looking to exit some of the non-core smaller assets, and you'll continue to see us do that.\nPage 25.\n\nAndrew Coombs\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay, folks. So just before I introduce Page [ 5, ] let me remind you that we are currently within our stated mission to get to EUR 150 million. And according to consensus, we should get there at the end of the '28 year. We obviously want to do it earlier, but we should get there at the end of the '28 year.\nNow if you look at this page on the left-hand side, it picks stuff up at the end of the financial year last year, so March '25, when we did EUR 123 million of FFO. As you know, consensus is that we'll do north of EUR 133 million this year, and we are trading in line with those expectations. So when you come out of this year at EUR 133 million, looking at doing something beginning with EUR 140 million next year, you then need to start thinking beyond your EUR 150 million goal. There is no point in a long-term business like property or wait until you get there and then go, let's pause, congratulate ourselves, start again after we've had a holiday and a bit of a break because you lose the momentum. You've got to start thinking far enough ahead about what you do now that determines your result in 3 years' time. Think about it, we buy a property now. And in some cases, it becomes -- you really get into the value add next year. But in a lot of cases, it takes 2 or 3 years to get into that sweet spot of value creation. And therefore, unless you're thinking about it now, you're not going to be there in 3 years' time. So it should be no surprise that now that we are in the EUR 133 million a year, moving into the EUR 140 million-something a year, that what we do is we start to plan beyond the EUR 150 million. And this is not just for shareholders. This is internally in the company. We are having meetings with people, and we're saying, what's next? Are we properly resourced? Do we have the right sites? So what you're seeing for the first time on this page is you're seeing us publicly talk about the next leg of the journey. Now beyond the EUR 150 million, the ambition will be EUR 200 million. But the first leg of the journey from EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million will be the leg to EUR 175 million, and that's what you see laid out here. And one of the things that you should take great comfort from is if you look at that pillar that says EUR 40 million, well, half of that is already done. Half of that has been executed, closed off, in the bag, in our control. What we need to focus on is the other half of it. And this EUR 175 million, when we get to this EUR 175 million, this should be driving a dividend at roughly a 70% payout ratio, a dividend that's somewhere in the region of about EUR 0.075. So at the moment, we're heading towards EUR 0.064. This EUR 175 million takes you to EUR 0.075. Now it does matter the detail of how you get there. But at the moment, it kind of doesn't because at the moment, it's about the aspiration. It's about the mindset. It's about the shape of your thinking to be pushing towards that EUR 175 million, to be able to realize the value creation and the value benefits that come from that. And that's why we're laying it out in public because we've already started to talk about it internally and plan for it. But what you should take some comfort from is the mindset of this company is to grow. And in spite of the headwinds that Chris has spoken about, those headwinds are not a reason for us to stop. They are a reason for us to accelerate. They are a reason for us to expand our thinking because if we're going to achieve the growth trajectory that we're used to, we need to think beyond the problem of the finance headwinds, which I hope we've demonstrated thus far, we are capable of overcoming.\nLet me turn to the next page and let Chris take you through financing.\n\nChris Bowman\n\nCFO & Director\n\nSo yes, just on Page 26, just on financing, just as a reminder, on the balance sheet, we have EUR 1.21 billion of unsecured borrowings. That is in 3 bonds. So June '26, EUR 400 million comes due. That is essentially refinanced. We have the cash plus RCF to be able to repay that, and we have that cash earmarked for that. So that is done. November '28, we have EUR 465 million outstanding at a 1.75%. That is our last refinancing of what I call legacy debt. It's been great. It's been fantastic, but we need to take that journey back up to market. So EUR 465 million comes due in November '28.\nI would guide you now to we will refinance that in autumn of '27. And that is factored into all of our forecasting, et cetera, to still outrun that, still grow FFO and get through that journey. January '32, we have EUR 350 million outstanding at 4%. That was a bond we issued in January this year for which we had around EUR 2 billion of demand. So we've got great support from the debt capital markets. And obviously, we also tapped the '28 bond in the summer for EUR 105 million. Again, great support for that issuance.\nWe do remain below a benchmark issuer. So we're having investment-grade rating that was reaffirmed by Fitch. But in the bond markets, over EUR 500 million gets you to benchmark issuer size. The reason I flagged that is because at the point that we become a benchmark issuer, you should expect our marginal cost to start coming in a little bit as well as we essentially become an issuer that investors need to look at as we go into those indices.\nOn the secured side, EUR 232 million with Berlin Hyp and Deutsche pbb that is secured out to 2030 on a portfolio of German assets at 4.25%. Net LTV is up at 38.3% at the period end, reflecting the acquisition activity during the period. Interest cover over 4.5x. Net debt- to-EBITDA 6.7x, well below 8x where we target. As I say, we also signed a EUR 150 million RCF in the period with BNP, HSBC and ABN AMRO. There is an accordion feature in there to be able to increase it by another EUR 100 million. I have verbal indications of wanting to do that from banks. So we are in a strong position liquidity-wise. And as well, as I said, we have a bond tap in the period.\nPage 27. I'll just summarize before handing over to Andrew to conclude. So I think what have we seen in this period, we've seen fantastic strong organic growth as well as acquisitive growth that is in the tank, which has partly come through in the period, but will really start to accelerate our performance in the second half and beyond. So 6.6% FFO growth, underpinned by that 5.2% like-for-like rent roll, but the 15.2% increase in total rent roll gives you the marker as to where we are heading. U.K. and Germany, both performing well as discussed. And acquisitions, we've touched on. We've increased the dividend by 4%. That is ahead of expectations. I think the market was only expecting between 1% and 2%. I think you should take that as a sign of confidence from Andrew and I and also our Board in the future performance of this company. We want to continue to focus on generating cash flow, which we reward shareholders with through dividends. So I'd guide you to that kind of level of increase going forward as well. We're in a strong position on the balance sheet side, EUR 389 million of unrestricted cash plus the RCF that's undrawn, 38% LTV, and we've touched on the bond and RCF earlier.\nI'll hand over to Andrew on 28.\n\nAndrew Coombs\n\nCEO & Executive Director\n\nOkay. So really, the sort of second and third point here are all about the 5% growth. I just want to sort of cover something that I think is quite important because the group continues to trade in line with management expectations for the full year, but the cynics around the table might possibly look at the 5.2% like-for-like growth and compare it to the same period last year at 5.5% and think actually, it's less than it was this time last year. And of course, factually, you'd be absolutely correct. I wouldn't draw a great deal from that at all because when we say that we're trading in line with expectations, we mean we're trading in line with expectations. And I would draw your attention to the half year in 2022, where in the first half of the year, we achieved 2.4% like-for-like growth. But what actually happened when we looked at the full year is we came out at nearly 6.5%. What we always do is try and make sure that our problems are stacked into the first half. If we have a lease that is a big move-out that's due to go on March 31st, we'll try and push it years before it happens into April. When we're signing something new, if we know that it's a high proportion of a site, we will tend to make sure that the lease can only terminate in the first half of the year. We deliberately try and stack our problems into the first half to get a better and accelerating run in the second half. And if you look historically at our performance in H2 versus H1, you will see time and time again that our momentum accelerates in the second half. We would plan to be somewhere in between that 6% to 7% like-for-like for the year, probably somewhere around the midrange of that. Please do not think that because we're 5.2% this year and 5.5% last year, that there is some kind of slowing effect here. That is not what we are seeing, particularly given the momentum that we're anticipating in Germany. We accept things are going to get more difficult in the U.K., but we believe that will be balanced out in Germany. And please let's not forget that what we have done here in this last 6 months is not just gone out and acquired EUR 340 million of property, but we have continued to operate the company and do so well with a decent set of numbers. So one has not distracted the other. We have demonstrated the ability of the portfolio to do both and to do both well.\nAnd what I'd like to finish on is the 10-year track record of performance and growth where this company is concerned, and particularly at the top, the dividend, where we are now paying our 24th consecutive increase in dividend. And as Andrew Jones would say, dividend aristocracy is, I think, 25 years of progressively increasing dividend. We are now reaching the halfway point on that journey. Thank you very much.\nHappy to answer any questions people may have."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Sempra's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section.\nWe have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Don Clevenger, Chief Financial Officer of Encore; Caroline Winn, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And -- actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, February 25, 2025 and -- and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 5, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. This year as we report our Q4 and full year financial results. We've organized our materials to lay out a clear road map for our company to deliver a decisive decade of growth. In part, that's why we took the time over the last several months to reach out to investors and the research community to get new ideas and suggestions on how to make today's call as informative as possible.\nWith your input, we've added a lot more content to today's presentation and adjusted our list of presenters so you get to hear directly from a broader group of executives. In terms of our agenda, I'll start by reviewing our accomplishments in 2024 and provide an overview of our corporate strategy. Then we'll move to the leaders of our 3 business segments, where each will discuss recent developments and operational initiatives in their businesses as well as their respective capital plans. Afterwards, Karen will follow the presentation on our Q4 and full year financial results and the details surrounding our new 5-year capital plan. And then at the end, I'll rejoin you to make some closing remarks.\nTurning to our 2024 financial results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $4.65, which is just below the midpoint of our guidance range. Later in today's call, Karen will walk through the key drivers behind those results.\nTurning to 2025 guidance. We've adjusted our financial forecast to account for a series of changes. These include the final decision in our California rate cases as well as updated assumptions relating to interest rates commodity prices and O&M cost. Another key assumption in our 2025 guidance has to do with Oncor filing its next base rate review.\nAs you know, Texas is enjoying strong economic and population growth. Some estimates project Texas to have the largest population in the United States by 2045. And -- and to further that point, from July 2023 to July 2024, Texas added over 0.5 million new residents, the most of any state in the nation. New business continues to move to the state as well. And as the economy expands through the end of the decade, electricity demand is expected to nearly double.\nWith this backdrop, there is a significant need for new infrastructure, which creates opportunity for Oncor to increase its capital investments in the state. That's why Oncor is preparing to file a comprehensive base rate review later this year rather than waiting until 2027. Allen will go into more detail, but if the team elects to file a base rate review, which we have assumed in our plan, we believe this will strengthen the company's financial position as it looks to make critical investments necessary to support expected growth in energy demand.\nTaking all these factors into account, we're revising our full year 2025 EPS guidance range to $4.30 to $4.70. And -- our revised 2025 guidance falls below the prior expectations set for our company. That said, I'm confident that we're making the right decisions for the business as 2025 will form a new foundation for our future growth.\nIn addition, we're announcing our full year 2026 EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.30, which represents roughly a 12% growth rate from the midpoint of our updated 2025 guidance. This is important because we expect to pull through strong growth from 2026 into future years.\nIn addition to the reference year-over-year growth, we're seeing remarkable growth in our expected earnings from Sempra Texas, which supports raising our projected long-term EPS growth rate to 7% to 9%. Going forward, we'll update our estimated long-term growth rate on our year-end calls in February at the same time that we announced our updated capital plans.\nFinally, in keeping with our commitment to provide investors with a competitive total return, we're also pleased to announce that Sempra's Board of Directors approved increasing the company's annualized dividend for the 15th consecutive year to $2.58 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll walk through our recent accomplishments. In 2024, we made important progress on our 5-year capital plan by deploying nearly $10 billion of capital across our 3 business lines, while also delivering solid financial results with 2024 adjusted earnings of roughly $3 billion.\nIn terms of other accomplishments, we ended the year with utility rate base of $56 billion. It's also important to note that we're announcing a new record capital plan of $56 billion for 2025 to 2029, which represents a 16% increase over the prior plan. With over half of our new capital driven by opportunities at Oncor, where Allen and his team are seeing remarkable customer growth and taken together with California, 90% of the new capital plan is dedicated to our core strategy of investing in regulated utilities with constructive regulation.\nIn California, SDG&E and SoCalGas received a final decision on their 2024 general rate cases, which support critical new investments in safety, reliability and affordable customer service.\nMeanwhile, in Texas, you'll recall that the PUCT approved Oncor's nearly $3 billion system resiliency plan, highlighting the constructive nature of that jurisdiction and Oncor's ability to work collaboratively with key stakeholders to advance good public policy. Oncor has already begun making investments in accordance with the SRP and there are a significant number of near-term growth opportunities that Allen will be discussing momentarily.\nIn addition, Allen will outline more clearly what investments fall within his new $36 billion capital plan as well as providing very important visibility to other incremental investments are expected to be added to its 2025 to 2029 plan and new investments that are estimated for the 2030 to 2034 time frame.\nAnd finally, at Sempra Infrastructure 2024 was an important year in terms of execution as we continue to advance construction across a series of large-scale infrastructure projects, including most notably, ECA LNG Phase 1 and Port Arthur LNG Phase 1.\nPlease turn to the next slide. A couple of takeaways here. Utility capital investments have grown steadily at approximately 4% over the last decade. However, with economic expansion coming out of COVID, reshoring of industry and record levels of investment in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data centers, we're seeing a notable uptick in energy demand. That's why utilities all across the country are quickly ramping up investment to build new energy infrastructure that supports growing energy demand.\nWith over $200 billion of anticipated sector investment in 2025 alone, we certainly believe we're in the early innings of a new super cycle for the sector. On a relative basis, our 16% year-over-year increase in our 5-year capital plan compares favorably to the trend shown here. In part, that's why we continue to believe Sempra is well positioned in the right markets with the right corporate strategy to create a lot of value in the coming years.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Here, Sempra's core strategy centers on making disciplined investments in good businesses where we can earn quality returns while building scale advantages in large economic markets with favorable regulation.\nPlease turn to the next slide. At Sempra, we have narrowed our participation in the energy value chain with the goal of reducing the impact of commodity, environmental and credit risk. By concentrating on transmission and distribution investment, it also improves our line of sight to future growth and helps us produce high-quality recurring cash flows from regulated utilities while also investing in long-term contracted assets with investment-grade counterparties in our infrastructure platform.\nPlease turn to the next slide. To be clear, our corporate strategy is designed to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of customers and shareholders. To do that, we're launching a new record $56 billion capital plan that targets compound annual rate base growth of 10%. Note 2, that our expectations of future growth are expanding, particularly in the state of Texas. That's why we're raising our long-term EPS growth estimates to 7% to 9%.\nPlease turn to the next slide where Allen will walk you through a business update at Oncor.\n\nE. Allen Nye\n\nCEO & Director, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you, Jeff. We had a successful year at Oncor headlined by several key accomplishments. We deployed approximately $4.7 billion, a new record and grew our rate base by approximately 15%. We continue to believe in the Texas Miracle and do not see it slowing down anytime soon.\nAs Jeff mentioned, we are contemplating filing a comprehensive base rate review with the PUCT this year. As you may recall, our last base rate review was approved in 2023, and -- based on a 2021 historic test year.\nMarket conditions have certainly changed with higher interest rates and insurance premiums and inflationary pressure to name a few.\nMoving to our operational performance. In 2024, Oncor built, rebuilt or upgraded 4,300 miles of T&D lines, increased our premise count by approximately 77,000, set company records for new and active transmission interconnection requests and witnessed 4% growth in electricity volumes delivered. Oncor was also recognized by EEI, with the Emergency Response Award for our May 2024 storm response, the second worst storm in Encore's history. Further demonstrating our commitment to restoring power after extreme weather events as soon as safely possible.\nTo come full circle, the main takeaway is that Oncor had an excellent year. And I'll speak next about the long-term growth we are seeing.\nPlease turn to the next slide. As we've highlighted throughout the year, new points of interconnection requests grew 27% in 2024. And -- this is an important metric because it serves as a strong leading indicator of customers looking to connect to Oncor system and simultaneously helps replenish the existing queue of active requests, both of which represent future investment opportunities.\nThe increase in interconnection interest continues to emerge primarily from large C&I customers, which span multiple diverse industries located across our service territory. As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of commercial and industrial load seeking transmission interconnection equaled 137 gigawatts, an approximately 250% increase from 2023.\nAnd I'd also like to note that Oncor is already in possession of over $2 billion of collateral held under signed agreements, split approximately even between generation and large C&I customers, about a 10x increase since 2018. This collateral protects rate payers and us from the risk of cost being incurred for a project that is subsequently abandoned.\nExecuted agreements are one of the ways we evaluate the probability of load increases into our capital planning process, and this figure indicates these are serious customers with high intentions of developing their projects. Additionally, we provide ERCOT with a high confidence projection for C&I loads seeking interconnection to our transmission system.\nLast year, we provided a projection through 2030 of 25 gigawatts. This year, based on the number of customers who have taken concrete steps towards an interconnection agreement, we have increased our high confidence projection to 29 gigawatts through 2031. That amount, combined with the customers who have already signed interconnection agreements, could potentially increase our 2031 peak load by approximately 36 gigawatts from C&I transmission customers alone. To put that into context, today's peak load for our whole system is 31 gigawatts.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Today, we're announcing another record 5-year capital plan totaling $36 billion, an increase of 50% over the 5-year plan we announced last February. Oncor's investments over 2025 through 2029 are expected to support diverse growth across our service territory as the region continues to exhibit strong annual premise growth in the 2% range, receive a growing number of interconnection requests from large C&I customers, while remaining a highly desired destination for both business and residential customers to the state.\nOncor's territory is vast. Our distribution service territory is over 54,000 square miles, roughly the size of the whole state of New York, and our growth is not concentrated in any 1 area, but spread out across the DFW Metroplex, West Texas and along the I-35 corridor. We're continuing to see strong growth in residential premises that exceeds the historical national average as well as significant new growth in the large C&I space.\nExamining the components of our new $36 billion capital plan, the increases arise from the following items: nearly $3 billion for the SRP, $2 billion for the brownfield local common projects for the Permian Basin reliability plan, $1 billion for transmission projects for the Delaware Basin load integration plan and West Texas 345 kV infrastructure plan, $2 billion for interconnection of generation and large C&I customers with executed agreements and $4 billion for distribution upgrades and other capital needs.\nWe're excited by the prospect that more than 60% of our capital plan presented today is allocated towards transmission projects that will support the growing energy needs of the state of Texas, as these projects tend to be substantial with cost and benefits shared with all ratepayers. Our distribution investments, which we recover through the DCRF will also continue at a robust pace and comprise another 27% of the capital plan, demonstrating the breadth and diversity of growth throughout our service territory.\nThe SRP, which we've highlighted previously, also accounts for $3 billion, and that capital is recovered more favorably than our other investments. These investments are critical because they support a safer, smarter, more resilient electric grid to help enable continued development across the state of Texas. Notably, Oncor's $36 billion CapEx plan only includes expected spend for major transmission projects for which we have obtained all regulatory approvals.\nFor example, in the Permian Basin Reliability Plan, approximately $2 billion has been included for brownfield projects that require no further approvals. Additionally, with regard to customers seeking interconnection at the transmission level like data centers, our plan only includes those projects for which customers have executed an agreement with us.\nPlease turn to the next slide. As a result, Oncor has clear line of sight to meaningful projects that could amount to an additional $12 billion over the course of 2025 to 2029, and -- that are outside of our base plan. These projects include potential updates to our SRP in 2028 and 2029, and -- Local projects of the Permian Basin reliability plan requiring regulatory approvals, projects and the import path of the Permian Basin reliability plan, additional transmission POIs such as data centers that have not yet signed agreements with us and projects arising from ERCOT's 765 KV Strategic Transmission Expansion Plan or STEP, among other things.\nRegarding the Permian Basin reliability plan, ERCOT and the PUCT are still evaluating the optimal voltage level for the import pathways as part of the import path base. We anticipate further determination to be made in the second quarter of this year that will provide clarity on the need and timing of additional transmission investment. With targeted in-service dates of 2030 and beyond, we anticipate these potential investments to occur in the back end of our current 5-year plan and extending into the next decade.\nWe are excited to have begun needed investments to support grid resiliency, and we understand this is not a one-off event. As such, we anticipate filing an update to our current SRP in 2027, with additional measures to continue the important investments around grid hardening, situational awareness and cyber and physical security of our system.\nERCOT has laid out a vision for the development of a modern statewide EHV super highway. In ERCOT's 765 kV STEP released last month ERCOT indicated that the cost between an EHV solution and a traditional 345 kV solution are likely to be very similar, but the EHV solution would provide a number of superior benefits. We expect more guidance from the PUCT in the first half of this year. Under either solution, Oncor expects to build a significant amount of the needed transmission.\nMany of these projects I am discussing today continue past the current 5-year plan. When we look further out, we believe our growth continues well into the next decade. If current growth trends continue, we estimate investment in our system requiring $55 billion to $75 billion from 2030 to 2034. In other words, the Texas Miracle doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon. As we execute on our current plan, and prepare for potentially higher levels of capital spending. I'll speak to how we prepared to support this growth.\nPlease turn to the next slide. For years now, Oncor has been taking deliberate steps to help secure our future growth potential. Over the past 5 years, we've significantly expanded our supplier base and inventory stock to help ensure materials are available when and where they are needed. We've also increased our talent pool to bring new knowledge, skill sets and abilities to our workforce, while deploying modern technologies and exercising prudence in increasing our head count so that we can efficiently grow our business.\nAs we enhance our resources we are also achieving improved safety metrics, which is a testament to our continued focus on operational excellence.\nPlease turn to the next slide, and I'll hand the call over to Karen.\n\nKaren L. Sedgwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Allen. I'll start by providing an update on Sempra, California's 2024 accomplishments and 5-year capital plan. Then since we've received a lot of outreach from the investment community on how the state limits investor exposure to wildfire risk I want to reserve time to provide an update on that as well.\nStarting with 2024 accomplishments, we saw a number of material developments at our California utilities. First and foremost, we received a final decision in our general rate cases. With the final decision, we're now able to focus our efforts on executing the approved plan and continuing to provide customers with safe and reliable energy. And speaking of safety, SDG&E became California's first utility to be awarded with a prestigious Caloia VPP safety certification. This designation is the highest safety recognition offered by the nation's largest state-run division of occupational safety and health, and the award is reserved for organizations to demonstrate exemplary safety practices, employee engagement and injury prevention measures that exceed standard regulatory requirements.\nIt is also noteworthy to mention that SDG&E was also once again recognized as the best in the West for electric customer reliability for the 19th consecutive year. Another accomplishment we're quite proud of.\nOperationally, we continue to see growing energy demand. And recently, the California Energy Commission issued a report projecting 2.8% annual growth in statewide electricity consumption from 2023 through 2030, which should have favorable impacts to customer affordability by putting downward pressure on rates.\nIn October, SDG&E submitted its [ P06 ] filing with FERC, including a 50 basis point California ISO adder. In December, FERC issued an order finding that SDG&E is not eligible for the ISO adder. SDG&E believes there is a reasonable basis to appeal this decision and has already requested a rehearing.\nAt SoCalGas, the CPUC issued a final decision authorizing the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility to operate at 68.6 billion cubic feet or 80% of the site's capacity representing approximately 11% of the state's overall storage capacity. Ongoing operations will be subject to future CPUC review but we believe this action confirms the valuable role natural gas continues to play in contributing to a stable and affordable California energy grid.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Sempra California's capital plan totals over $22 billion through 2029. Major areas of investment include our wildfire mitigation, energy storage and smart meter replacement initiatives. We're also building new transmission lines under FERC'S authority, investing in the modernization of the Marino and Onorancho compressor stations and continuing to bolster safety through our gas pipeline safety and integrity management programs.\nAs we look into the next decade, we see further opportunities to improve how we deliver our services through innovation and grid modernization efforts focused on safety, reliability and affordable customer service. Moreover, additional investments will be needed to support growing energy demand and economic development throughout the state.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Operationally, Sempra, California has a track record of effectively mitigating risk and making innovative investments, which further our market position as a leader in delivering safe and reliable energy. SDG&E recently scored as the most mature wildfire mitigation program across all international utilities. SDG&E's investments in wildfire mitigation have been instrumental and hardening our system based on advanced risk modeling that identifies the most weather-sensitive areas.\nMoreover, these advanced technologies also track wildfire risk throughout the year. With an established leadership position in wildfire mitigation and data science, we commonly field questions about programs here in the state, and I thought it'd be helpful to share our company's perspective.\nIn 2019, the state established a wildfire fund under AB 1054 and -- to support the financial stability of investor-owned utilities. When the fund was formed, SDG&E initially contributed roughly $320 million. Since then, SDG&E has contributed just under $13 million annually. As of today, SDG&E's tool contributions represent roughly 2% of the $21 billion fund.\nSDG&E's lower level of contributions reflect its lower risk profile due to 3 considerations. The relatively small size of SDG&E service territory,; the desert like topography that predominates this part of Southern California and the robust level of prior investments SDG&E has made to materially mitigate wildfire risk.\nAlso, it's important to note that SDG&E is not standing still. The company continues to strengthen its capabilities with new investments in wildfire mitigation programs as well as newly developed technology and data science that support proactively monitoring and better protection for local communities. This played out during the recent weather events, where SDG&E encountered substantially similar and, in some cases, worse red flag conditions and what was experienced in the Los Angeles region. SDG&E successfully managed its system safely, and the company came through the event safely. Remember, too, that SCG hasn't had a utility cause wildfire of any significance for over 17 years.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where Justin will provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nPresident, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThanks, Karen. Geopolitical and market events continue to highlight and strengthen the value proposition of our Sempra Infrastructure platform, and we're making the most of the opportunity. We're making substantial progress on our dual basin LNG strategy through the construction of ECA LNG Phase 1, Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and the active development of Port Arthur LNG Phase 2. And when ECA and Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 are up and running, we'll have the ability to deliver natural gas from the Permian and Haynesville basins into our terminals and dispatch LNG into both the Pacific and Atlantic Energy markets.\nAnd as the CEO, I can tell you, this is an exciting time for Sempra Infrastructure. First, we delivered financial results at the high end of our range in 2024 and continue to generate strong distributable cash flow to our owners.\nSecond, construction on ECA LNG Phase 1 continues to progress, and we expect to be on time and on budget in the spring of 2026. The -- we also reached COD on our GRO pipeline supporting natural gas supply into ECA LNG.\nThird, construction on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 with Bechtel as our EPC contractor and our associated pipeline remain on time and on budget.\nLastly, the development of Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 is an advanced development. We already have an HOA with Aramco that includes offtake of 5 million tons per annum and a 25% equity interest. We have a fixed price EPC agreement with Bechtel and we have interest of well over 5 MTPA for the rest of the capacity for Phase 2. With this in mind, we're pleased to announce we're targeting FID in 2025.\nPlease turn to the next slide. At Sempra Infrastructure, we continue to focus on safety, disciplined development and construction and operational excellence. At Cameron, which is now in its fourth year of full production, the team continues to optimize its operations with the plant reaching a 98% reliability rate in 2024. And -- during 2024, Cameron loaded 193 cargoes and has now reached 895 cargoes since production began in May 2019.\nAt Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, we have 3,600 workers on site, are building out the steel framework for the trains, tank construction, above ground and underground piping, marine birth dredging and have commenced major equipment setting. We continue to target commercial operations for Train 1 and Train 2 in 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nAt ECA LNG Phase 1, we're excited that the project has reached 90% completion, including engineering, procurement and construction progress. Current work is now focused on pipe testing and insulation, electrical instrumentation and precommissioning activities.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Turning to Sempra Infrastructure's updated capital plan, we estimate spending $4 billion through 2029. And -- as a reminder, per our convention, we only include Sempra's proportionate share of capital of projects that have reached FID. And to be clear, our plan is narrowly focused on investments in LNG assets with 16 million tons per annum of projected capacity as well as the supporting pipeline infrastructure.\nIn the meantime, our renewable projects, such as Cimarron, represent a great way to layer in higher return projects with a shorter construction window to take advantage of Sempra Infrastructure's excess electric transmission capacity.\nOverall, our assets have 18 years of average contract life remaining which gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering recurring cash flows and value to our owners in the foreseeable future.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The development of Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 increases the value of our SI franchise. The brownfield expansion is expected to benefit from scale advantages and continuous construction under Bechtel's leadership. Furthermore, Phase 2 will benefit from the common facilities that will be completed in Phase 1. In combination, we believe this translates into a lower cost and lower risk expansion of Phase 2.\nAs I mentioned, we announced an HOA with Aramco for approximately half of the offtake, where they'd also participate in 25% of the project equity. Additionally, we have well over 5 million tons per annum of interest for the remaining offtake and are confident in our ability to meet our customers' needs. Many of our stakeholders are eager for this project to succeed, including ConocoPhillips, as they mentioned in their recent earnings call.\nGiven recent commercial discussions for additional demand, the momentum of project development and our continued expectation to receive the DOE non-FTA permit, we're excited to announce we're targeting a final investment decision later this year, pending the execution of definitive commercial agreements, obtaining permits and securing financing, among other factors.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Over the long run, our strategy is increasingly focused on the expansion of our dual basin LNG strategy, which could over time represent up to 90 million tons per annum in total LNG exports, while significantly increasing the scope and scale of our business. The timing and ultimate ownership stakes in these projects will depend on market demand, which we believe will remain robust through 2040.\nFor context, LNG demand has grown 6% per annum over the last 25 years, and going forward, we estimate that global demand could grow by up to another 350 million tons per annum through 2050. We -- based on these forecasts and recent capital markets activity in the LNG infrastructure industry, we believe our infrastructure growth franchise continues to provide compelling value to Sempra's shareholders.\nNow please turn to the next slide where Karen will walk through the Sempra financial update.\n\nKaren L. Sedgwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Justin. Earlier today, Sempra reported fourth quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $665 million or $1.04 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $737 million or $1.16 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2024 earnings were $960 million or $1.50 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings of $719 million or $1.13 per share.\nFull year 2024 GAAP earnings were $2.817 billion or $4.42 per share. This compares to 2023 GAAP earnings of $3.3 billion or $4.79 per share. On an adjusted basis, Full year 2024 earnings were $2.969 billion or $4.65 per share. This compares to our previous full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.92 billion or $4.61 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Variances in the full year 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows: At Sempra, California, we had $46 million primarily from higher electric transmission margin higher AFUDC equity and higher CPUC base operating margin and $157 million primarily from higher income tax benefits from flow-through items, including higher gas tax repair benefits partially offset by higher net interest expense.\nTurning to Sempra Texas. We had $43 million of higher equity earnings, primarily from higher invested capital and customer growth, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses and lower consumption primarily due to mild weather. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $170 million of lower transportation earnings including the cumulative impact of new tariffs going into effect in 2023, lower asset and supply optimization and lower volumes for the renewables business, partially offset by $50 million, primarily from lower net interest expense due to higher capitalized interest and higher income tax benefits. At Sempra parent, the $77 million net decrease is primarily due to higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Now let's turn to our planned investment over the next 5 years. Driven largely by growth at Sempra Texas, our new record $56 billion capital plan represents an increase of 16% over the prior year plan. Capital investment will remain overwhelmingly focused on our T&D infrastructure with over 90% allocated to our regulated utilities.\nIn Texas, the growth is simply remarkable. And on top of that, the regulatory construct continues to improve, with 97% of our investments now being recoverable through efficient tracker mechanisms, which diminish the impact of regulatory lag.\nAt Sempra, California, with the GRC final decision, SDG&E and SoCalGas are focused on executing the daily mission of delivering safe and reliable energy. As a reminder, our Sempra Infrastructure platform is underpinned by long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts that mitigate commodity and counterparty risk. And our infrastructure business provides a great opportunity to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns on long-duration energy infrastructure projects.\nWith the long-term tailwinds we've discussed today, you can see there's a consistent pipeline of new opportunities to deploy capital, which supports increased earnings power for each of our 3 platforms. Although there is a lot of excitement about our growth opportunities, we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation process and financing our growth as efficiently as possible.\nPlease turn to the next slide. One of the key takeaways of our capital plan is that we're projecting total 2024 rate base of $56 billion to expand to over $91 billion by 2029, and -- which amounts to a 10% compounded annual growth rate.\nPlease turn to the next slide to cover our financing plan. As we've highlighted throughout the morning, we have a very large capital plan focused on key investment opportunities with a primary focus on Texas. Our sources and uses calls for a thoughtful mix of investable cash from operations, debt and equity issuances, capital investments and capital returns to shareholders. Consistent with past practice, our recurring cash flows provide the majority of funds planned for capital investments.\nYou will recall that in late 2023, we sold approximately $1.3 billion of common stock that settled at the end of last year. We also established our $3 billion ATM program in November of last year, and sold approximately $270 million in equity under the program in the fourth quarter.\nThe plan presented today is intended to provide strong support for our credit ratings with equity issuances in the front end of the plan and share repurchases on the back end. As Jeff will share later, we've historically grown our earnings faster than the sector, which requires a higher level of reinvestment in the business. We have remained consistent in both our dividend strategy and our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nPlease turn to the next slide. In response to requests from investors for a more fulsome view of Sempra's financing plans, in addition to the prior slide, which is our traditional view, this slide provides more detail into our financing strategy. On capital recycling, as we have demonstrated in the past, we'll evaluate and execute on opportunities at Sempra Infrastructure with a view toward improving our regulated business mix over time.\nIn the future, we anticipate these opportunities could come from a variety of areas such as project equity, joint venture arrangements, asset sales or further sell-downs within the capital structure of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, among other things. What's most important as we're going to remain focused on continuing to provide significant value for shareholders as we look to fund our robust capital plan in the most efficient manner possible.\nFinally, we also remain committed to growing our dividend as part of our total shareholder return strategy and are now in our 15th consecutive year of dividend raises.\nPlease turn to the next slide. To wrap up my remarks, let me discuss our 2025 and 2026 guidance. As Jeff noted earlier, we're revising our 2025 EPS guidance range to $4.30 to $4.70. Our revised range contemplates Oncor submitting for a base rate review this year, which impacts their tracker filings where the case is ongoing. While there is a near-term earnings headwind this year associated with the filing. We believe it's the right business decision since Oncor as an important inflection point and an unprecedented growth cycle.\nIt's also important to note that the financial impact of higher growth at Oncor is not fully reflected in the intermediate term financial results due to regulatory lag. However, we know over time that Texas will realize increased benefits of this growth and continue to be a larger and important contributor of Sempra's earnings mix.\nBeyond the adverse impacts of Oncor filing its base rate review, there are other considerations impacting Sempra's 2025 guidance. At Sempra, California, we're negatively impacted by the implementation of the GRC final decision, a 42 basis point decrease in our return on equity determined by the CPUC related to the CCM as well as the FERC order removing 50 basis points, California ISO adder to transmission-related ROE.\nMoving to Sempra Infrastructure. The 2 main variables factoring into the lower guidance are the delay in ECA LNG Phase 1 COD until spring of 2026 and recent changes to assumptions for natural gas prices. This will be partially offset by the optimization of transportation capacity.\nFinally, at Parent and Other, we've assumed higher interest expense as a result of higher capital investments in 2025 and -- and weighted a capital structure mix more towards higher rate hybrid security issuances.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Looking to 2026, we're announcing projected midpoint earnings of over $3.3 billion as ECA LNG Phase 1 and Cimarron Wind are expected to reach commercial operations, and we start to see more benefits from Oncor's increased investments, including the SRP. This results in a projected EPS range of $4.80 to $5.30 based on 660 million shares outstanding, reflecting minor impacts from equity sales under our financing programs.\nTo reiterate, we delivered solid financial performance in 2024, and we remain extremely excited about the future, particularly with improved visibility to strong growth in the medium and long term. With our new capital plan presented today, we're raising our projected long-term EPS growth rate to 7% to 9%.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where Jeff will finish with his closing remarks.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Karen. Next, I'd like to briefly summarize the key takeaways from today's call. Over the last 3 decades, roughly 10% of public companies have been successful and consistently growing earnings faster than U.S. GDP, and -- that's why I've long believed that EPS growth in our sector and others is loosely correlated to GDP growth.\nLooking at this slide, you can see this play out over the last 5, 10 and 20-plus year time horizons. U.S. GDP has grown on average at 2%. And over those same time periods, the utility sector has grown earnings per share in the range of 3% to 4%. In contrast, over the same time period, Sempra, has been successful in growing its adjusted earnings per share faster than both U.S. GDP and the utility sector's adjusted earnings.\nNote too that we're one of the few companies in the utility sector who have both, number one, announced a long-term EPS growth forecast of 7% to 9% and also, number two, delivered that same level of growth over the short and long term. We've been able to accomplish this by emphasizing the importance of a clear corporate strategy, disciplined capital allocation and efficient sourcing of capital, while also simplifying and derisking our business and advancing the culture of high performance.\nTo be clear, we have a bullish view of Sempra's future growth, and we believe we're in the right markets with the right strategy to continue posting strong financial results over the long term.\nPlease turn to the next slide. In 2024, we delivered a total return of 21%. And -- as shown on this slide, Sempra has also delivered a solid total return over the last 3 years of 45%, which compares favorably to the utility sector.\nPlease turn to the next slide. There are 2 key takeaways here. First, there is a changing business mix within Sempra's earnings composition, where we're targeting higher exposure to U.S. investments and specifically regulated utilities. Second, driven by a portfolio of remarkable investment opportunities in Texas, our Sempra Texas platform is projected to account for over half of our record $56 billion 5-year capital plan.\nGiven the plan that Allen outlined today and the clear line of sight to significant new investments that fall outside of Oncor's $36 billion plan, we are taking concrete steps to firmly set our growth strategy around the Texas market. That includes setting an aspirational goal of producing 1/2 of Sempra's earnings from Texas by the end of the decade.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Earlier, I review the strength of our recent total return. On this slide, you can see that Sempra has been successful in posting strong total returns that compete favorably to the utility sector and the broader market over a longer time horizon. That's why, from our perspective, the blueprint for long-term value creation comes from investing in good businesses, running them well, building leadership positions in key economic markets, allocating excess cash flow wisely and compounding returns over long periods of time.\nAt this point, I'll pause, and we'll take a moment to open up the line to take your questions.\n\nDon J. Clevenger\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you for joining today's call. Before opening up to Q&A, I want to make a few supplemental remarks. I know we passed out a lot of new information this morning and the changes in assumptions or calls and impacts to your financial models and also a lot of frustration. So let me start off by apologizing.\nWe have lowered our guidance in 2025 due to a series of issues, most notably key changes in our planning assumptions in the last couple of months. First, the California GRC came in, in late December below our planning assumptions, particularly on the front end of the plan. We do have opportunities, however, to support stronger growth from Sempra, California in the back half of the plan as we get recovery from the investments we're making outside the GRC based revenues.\nSecond, based on the FERC decision on December 31, and -- we have removed the FERC ISO adder from our expected return on our transmission assets in California. And finally, and this is an important one, we think it's the right decision for Encore to go back in early for a base rate review to reset its cost structure, and that puts downward pressure on their earnings forecast for this year. That decision will be made by the Oncor team later this spring.\nNow turning to guidance. We had the opportunity to continue a 6% to 8% growth rate off of 2024 actuals. I'd like to repeat that, we could have maintained a 6% to 8% growth rate, but we chose not to because we have fundamentally raised our expectation of the earnings power of this business over the long term. We have discussed this difference in view of long-term growth on previous earnings calls. But at Sempra, our long-term growth forecast represents the growth we expect to produce over a sustained period of time. in this higher growth environment, we believe that range of 7% to 9%, and we've appropriately raised our guidance.\nTurning now to our current 5-year plan. We expect to grow earnings per share at 9% or higher and we expect the earnings contribution from Texas, which is more valued in the market to significantly increase as a part of our overall earnings mix with Oncor's rate base roughly doubling over the plan period.\nBefore I close out, let me tell you why we're confident in our plan and producing results well above what we've talked about today. Number one, as Karen talked about in her prepared remarks, the most important way to finance growth is through operating cash flows. That's why we have various initiatives underway in our company to improve our cost structure and our financial returns. Improved financial returns will improve our long-term growth.\nNumber two, as Allen outlined, his team expects to add another $12 billion to their capital plan. It's important to be clear here that is incremental capital that is expected within the plan period between 2025 and 2029.\nThird, Port Arthur Phase 2 is not included in the plan. but we certainly expect that project to move forward later this year. You'll recall we have a very conservative practice of only putting projects in the plan at Sempra Infrastructure after they have reached a final investment decision.\nAnd finally, number four, in our utility segments, there are other planned opportunities related to authorized ROEs and capital structure as well as other improvements to the applicable regulatory construct.\nIn conclusion, we have lowered our guidance for 2025, and -- but the key takeaway is we expect to produce stronger earnings per share growth in the future. Conservatively, we expect to produce 9% or higher through 2029 and it will disproportionately come from Sempra Texas.\nI'll stop at this point so the operator can open the call, and we'd be glad to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glenn Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Sempra's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure. Alan Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team. .\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nEarnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 06, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. As we close out the first half of the year, we continue our focus on safety and operational excellence, and we're pleased with the strength of our financial performance. This actually sets us up well in the second half of the year while also supporting our confidence in a projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. And more importantly, we think there's a lot to be excited about. .\nAt Sempra, California, we continue to play a critical role in helping the state achieve its safety, reliability and decarbonization goals. That's why we continue to make important investments to improve safety, modernize the grid and better support the delivery of cleaner forms of energy. We also look forward to advancing our general rate cases here in the state and anticipate a proposed decision later this summer with a final decision expected before the end of the year. The outcome of the GRC is expected to help our utilities better meet the state's public policy goals, advance reliability and community safety and improved visibility to our plan of execution through 2027.\nAt Sempra, Texas, Oncor continues to see remarkable growth, and it's coming from a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, technology and digital infrastructure. Annual premise growth is 1 example, continues to trend around 2%, which is almost double the national average. Alan will walk through how electricity demand is impacting the Texas grid and also driving the need for new capital investments, all across Oncor's service territory. Against that backdrop, you recall that Oncor is currently executing on a record 5-year capital plan of roughly $24 billion with a pending regulatory filing to improve system resiliency by investing incremental capital of up to $3 billion from 2025 through 2027.\nWith the remarkable growth in Oncor service territory, we continue to expect to see higher levels of capital spending in the future and this will be a key consideration in our financial planning process this fall. Finally, Sempra Infrastructure remains focused on advancing critical infrastructure investments that support the energy transition and enhanced energy security, and we continue to see progress across several key development initiatives.\nMoving to our financial results for the quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.89 and year-to-date adjusted EPS of $2.24. As a reminder, these results do not reflect the impact of a final California GRC decision, which we expect before year-end with rates retroactively applied to January 1. From my perspective, we've had a great start to the first half of the year. As a result, we're affirming both our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range and our 2025 EPS guidance range. Please turn to the next slide.\nAs a reminder, we view our corporate strategy as an opportunity to assert a competitive advantage in energy markets, and there are 3 key elements to our plan of execution. First, we positioned our portfolio in some of the most attractive economic markets in North America. California and Texas, for example, give our utilities great exposure to increasing demand for new infrastructure investments while separate infrastructure benefits from strong tailwinds around the reshoring of industry to North America and global demand for improved energy security associated with the export of liquefied natural gas from the United States.\nSecond, we focused our investment strategy in a more narrow part of the energy value chain, namely transmission and distribution investments. By doing so, we aim to improve the quality and recurring nature of our earnings and cash flows while reducing exposure to risk and price volatility. We believe this provides an improved risk-reward profile for our owners. And finally, we aggressively compete capital inside our company across all 3 growth platforms to help ensure we're delivering the best, overall returns to our owners.\nAt the end of the day, being good stewards of capital is a top priority and has allowed us to continue delivering attractive, risk-adjusted returns. As an example, we've been successful in delivering a 10% adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate since 2018. Next, I'll turn the call over to Alan to walk through the improving growth story that continues to unfold in Texas. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nE. Allen Nye\n\nCEO & Director, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you, Jeff. I'd like to start by saying that growth continues at a rapid pace all across the state of Texas and especially in the Oncor service territory. In the second quarter alone, we built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 1,050 miles of T&D lines, increased our premise count by approximately 20,000 and received approximately 100 new transmission POI requests which has increased our active interconnection requests in our Q by 13% year-over-year. It's also important to note that we continue to make progress on the 5-year capital plan that was announced earlier this year of approximately [ $24 billion ].\nAs Jeff mentioned, this does not include the capital expenditures that may be approved as part of our system resiliency plan or SRP. We filed our first SRP with the PUCT in May of this year. Turning to our operating environment. Texas, like the nation as a whole, is seeing an increase in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. The number of extreme storms, including ice, intense heat and extremely high winds have shown us that we must be even more focused on reliability, resiliency and response. That's why our SRP identifies 7 measures, with detailed programs and activities for each measure to address the wide range of resiliency events we're seeing across our service territory, including extreme weather, the risk of wildfires, physical security threats and cyber security threats.\nAlong with the hardening of our system to prevent outages, our proposed initiatives include a substantial opportunity to expand distribution automation to the legacy portions of our system. We call this our flexible and self-healing distribution grid measure. Today, newer facilities on our system have this technology, which allows us to automatically redistribute load to undamaged parts of our grid during extreme weather or other events, significantly reducing or, in some cases, eliminating lengthy outages for many of our customers.\nWe recently provided some examples to the PUCT of how this technology helped hundreds of our customers avoid what could have been day-long outages from the severe storms we experienced in May. Among other areas, our SRP also proposes retrofitting older portions of our system with this technology. Additionally, we have proposed expanding our vegetation management programs by approximately $90 million per year, including further use of remote sensing and other new technologies to better target fast-growing vegetation.\nThis expansion is expected to more than double our distribution vegetation management efforts. These investments together with the SRP measures that specifically target wildfire risk will also accelerate our work to help comprehensively address wildfire mitigation. These efforts will continue to build on our collaborations with the Texas A&M Forest Service and our counterparts at San Diego Gas & Electric, both of whom are globally recognized as subject matter experts with significant experience in wildfire mitigation and response.\nIt's also noteworthy that our SRP filing is not the only action we're taking to improve our resiliency and preparation for extreme weather events. Over a 21-day period in the months of May and June, tornadoes touched down in the [ Temple Colin ] area, a storm with straight-line winds measuring as high as 95 miles per hour passed through the DFW Metroplex and additional storms impacted our East Texas region. I want to thank the 12,000 Oncor employees, contractors and off-system personnel who worked around the clock restoring service to our customers as soon as safely possible. Recently, we also sent 500 mutual assistance workers to the Gulf Coast to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Barrel. These storms have shown that our industry must continue to improve our plans for prevention, response and communication so that we are meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations for the safe and reliable delivery of electricity.\nAnd I can assure you that it's a top priority for our team. At Oncor, we are dedicated to being a safe and reliable operator and helping ensure a resilient grid, which is even more critical given the amount of growth we're seeing in Texas. Please turn to the next slide. interconnection requests from large C&I customers and the additional transmission expansion needed to bring power to these high-demand customers are the primary drivers of the growth in our capital plan. Under our current capital plan, Oncor's rate base is anticipated to grow at an average annual rate of 11% from 2023 through 2028.\nTo help meet the scale of these new investments, We've taken important steps to diversify our supplier base, enter into multiyear agreements, ordered various critical inventory in advance and have begun procuring necessary equipment with significant investments in warehousing and laydown yards to support the timely rollout of our capital investments. We also see opportunities for significant future growth in our service territory. As announced earlier this year, ERCOT projects peak load in 2030 to be 152 gigawatts, nearly double the current record of 85.5 gigawatts set in August 2023.\nBased on our current share of ERCOT load, and our internal projections, we expect approximately 40% of that future load to be served by Oncor. Included in ERCOT's load growth projections are the continued electrification efforts in the Permian Basin. In response to House Bill 566 passed in the 2023 legislative session to address this growth, ERCOT filed a plan with the PUCT in late July that identifies new transmission investments of $13 billion to $15 billion by 2038.\nGiven the scope of our operations in the region, we expect to build a significant portion of the projects that are ultimately approved in the Permian plan. As Jeff noted, there is a likelihood of higher capital spending in the future, and we continue to review our forecast for future capital expenditures and expect to provide an update on the Q4 earnings call after our SRP filing is finalized by the PUCT and our analysis is complete and reviewed by Oncore's Board.\nI would conclude by saying that we are all really excited about the opportunity set in Texas and will remain relentless in our efforts to provide reliable, affordable electric service to our customers while maintaining a sharp focus on the safety of everyone who works on our system. Please turn to the next slide where Karen will walk through Sempra California's business update.\n\nDon J. Clevenger\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you, Alan. Sempra California is strategically positioned the largest economy in the U.S. and benefits from constructive regulation that supports investment opportunities to decarbonize and improve the safety and resiliency of the grid, forward-looking rate cases, cost of capital adjustment mechanism and an established wildfire fund that backstops the financial strength of the state's utilities.\nAt SoCalGas, we're participating in several decarbonization initiatives that support California's statewide goals. Recently ARCHES of which SoCal Gas is a partner, became the country's first hydrogen hub to sign with the DOE to secure its funding. ARCHES' forecasts California will need 17 million tons per year of hydrogen to help meet the state's 2045 climate goals. These cleaner molecules are expected to play a pivotal role in helping Los Angeles, one of the nation's largest manufacturing hubs lower its emissions and heavy-duty transportation and other hard-to-electrify sectors. That's why SoCalGas has proposed Angeles Link will form a key component in California's regional hydrogen hub.\nTurning to SDG&E. Community safety continues to be our #1 priority. Over the last 2 decades, we've made significant investments in wildfire mitigation and hardened 100% of the transmission lines in our Tier 3 high fire-threat districts. We've proactively taken steps to further strengthen our predictive tools, training and resources by making significant upgrades to SDG&E's wildfire and climate resiliency center.\nI recently had a chance to visit the state-of-the-art facility, and it's impressive. I invite you to come and see the facility if you can. Substantial innovative features of the facility include AI-enabled solutions, high-resolution cameras, enhanced drone data and line conductor fault detection. This facility is one of the most technologically advanced of its kind anywhere in America, and plays a central role in helping to ensure SDG&E is prepared for and actively mitigating risks related to its operating environment.\nThis is all part of a larger effort at SDG&E to meet the state's public policy goals while building out a climate-resilient energy grid. Now moving to our regulatory updates of California Utilities. In June, SDG&E delivered a notice of termination to FERC of [indiscernible] transmission owner formula rate mechanism or TO5 and is preparing its TO6 filing. We expect SDG&E to make a submission in the fourth quarter with an effective date in 2025.\nIn our filing, we anticipate updating our formulaic rate and making a constructive case for competitive ROE, reflecting today's market conditions. Lastly, on the California GRC, we expect to propose decision later this summer and a final decision by year-end. As a reminder, the final decision will be retroactive to the beginning of this year. Please turn to the next slide.\nSempra Infrastructure's long-term strategy is focused on capitalizing on the growing demand for cleaner and more secure energy. Wood Mackenzie estimates that global LNG demand will grow nearly 70% and reach more than 700 million tonnes per year by 2050. Our development pipeline is making significant strides to help meet those needs. At ECA LNG Phase 1, we are roughly 85% complete. However, our contractor has experienced labor retention and productivity issues in recent months.\nAs a result, our commercial operations date will be delayed until the spring of 2026. We are actively engaged with our contractor to advance the project, and we'll see increased capital expenditures for the project in the form of additional carrying costs and lower estimated commissioning revenues, which are based on forward price curves. Despite the delay of potential changes in capital, we still expect to maintain strong integrated financial returns, consistent with our original forecast at the time that we took FID in 2020.\nThis is the result of a combination of factors, including optimization opportunities, stronger LNG demand over the long term and inflation protection within the SPAs. Moving to Port Arthur LNG, we're making steady progress on Phase I. And we remain on budget and schedule. We recently received FERC authorization for 24/7 construction, which is expected to improve the overall efficiency of the construction activities.\nAt Cameron Phase 2, we continue to work with our partners to enhance cost efficiency through value engineering. Finally, we've begun construction on Cimarrón wind, a 320-megawatt project and expect to reach commercial operations in the first half of 2026. Our experience in Mexico demonstrates our ability to work well with both regulators and legislators, and we look forward to supporting their increasing energy needs as industrial restoring continues to drive economic expansion.\nPlease turn to the next slide for an update on progress at Port Arthur Phase 2. We're very excited about some of the recent developments at Port Arthur LNG Phase 2. Earlier this summer, we executed an HOA with Aramco for 5 million tonnes per annum of offtake capacity and 25% interest in the project level equity. Last month, we also executed a fixed price contract with Bechtel. This contract provides an opportunity to continue our partnership with a world-class EPC firm while also benefiting from continuous construction.\nIn combination with the common facilities that are being constructed as part of Phase I, we expect to generate robust investment returns on the overall Port Arthur Energy Hub. We are working with all stakeholders to advance this project, which has received all material permits with the exception of the DOE non-FTA export permit that is pending approval.\nHowever, we do not anticipate the DOE pause will impact our development time line. As a reminder, Phase 2 at Port Arthur and all other projects that have not reached FID represent upside to our existing capital plan. Please turn to the next slide where I'll walk through Sempra's financials. Earlier this morning, Sempra reported second quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $713 million or $1.12 per share.\nThis compares to second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $603 million or $0.95 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2024 earnings were $567 million or $0.89 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2023 earnings of $594 million or $0.94 per share. The key takeaway is that we're pleased with our financial results. For the first 6 months of the year, we're trending above our financial forecasts and are well positioned to deliver another strong year of financial performance.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Variances in the second quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows: At Sempra, California, we had $26 million primarily from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, including higher authorized cost of capital. This was more than offset by $49 million, primarily from lower income tax benefits, lower regulatory awards and higher net interest expense.\nAs a reminder, because our GRC is still pending, our CPUC-authorized base revenues in second quarter 2024 are based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because any true-up later this year will be retroactively applied to January 1 once the final decision is approved. Turning to Sempra Texas, we had $42 million of higher equity earnings attributable to rate updates, increased invested capital and consumption, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, we had $48 million of lower equity earnings and revenues in the transportation business, including the cumulative impact of new tariffs in Mexico in the prior year and $8 million of higher income tax expense, higher O&M and lower revenues, partially offset by lower net interest expense. At Sempra parent, the $10 million net change is primarily due to lower taxes from the interim period application of an annual forecasted consolidated effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net interest expense.\nPlease turn to the next slide. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to reiterate a couple of the key points that help drive the overall success of our corporate strategy. As energy needs to grow and evolve in North America, our unwavering commitment to safety and operational excellence support our delivery of safer, more reliable and resilient energy and our position as a leader in some of North America's largest economic markets, offers investors visibility to our future growth as we look to invest higher levels of capital and critical new energy infrastructure through the end of the decade and beyond.\nTo conclude, this is an exciting time for our company, and we look forward to continuing to deliver strong financial and operational results. Thank you for joining us, and I'd now like to open the line for your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. I'd also like to mention that forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 7, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to report our first quarter financial results. It's a great start to the year and sets us up well to provide strong financial performance for 2024. In addition to the strength of our financial performance, the market backdrop for energy infrastructure continues to be very constructive. We're seeing strong macroeconomic fundamentals supporting U.S. energy demand, with the economy continuing to grow at a steady pace, with manufacturing production gains, easing of supply chain constraints, and continued job creation.\nWe previously discussed the view that our industry is experiencing a super cycle of growth and believe Sempra's strategy and portfolio are well positioned to benefit from current trends. In addition to the long-term demand from reshoring and electrification of transportation, artificial intelligence and data centers are driving new growth in digital infrastructure with demand estimates tripling from 2.5% of total U.S. electric consumption to 7.5% by 2030. Growth in Texas is also particularly remarkable with ERCOT recently raising its forecasted peak demand by the end of the decade to over 150 gigawatts. Of note, that's 65 gigawatts higher than the all-time record in the state.\nAgainst the backdrop of strong industry fundamentals, Sempra offers several competitive advantages: First, in California, we're at the forefront of the energy transition, serving 25 million consumers in the country's largest economy and one of the largest manufacturing bases in the U.S. And through our general rate cases, we're expecting to make new investments that support electrification and decarbonization while also improving affordability, safety, and reliability.\nTurning to Texas, we're seeing diverse industrial, C&I and residential growth, which is creating jobs increase in electricity demand and requiring significant investments to modernize and expand the electricity grid. With economic expansion, the safety and resilience of the grid becomes even more critical, and in part, that's why Oncor's recently filed system resiliency plan is both timely and important. Allen will speak to this in greater detail later in today's presentation.\nAnd finally, at Sempra Infrastructure, we're supporting global demand for energy security are in the midst of a second wave of LNG developments expected to support over 700 million tonnes per annum of demand by 2050. Our dual-coast LNG strategy is contributing to this push with approximately 16 million tonnes per annum of new capacity currently under construction, which would more than double our existing LNG operating footprint. The key takeaway is we're excited about the opportunities ahead as Sempra Infrastructure looks to provide cleaner and more reliable sources of energy to its customers while charting a course for attractive built-in growth through the end of the decade. It's also important to note that Sempra Infrastructure's growth forecasts are based solely on projects that have reached FID and are under construction and doesn't yet include expected upside from a series of other projects still in development.\nTurning now to our financial results. We reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.34. In addition, we're pleased to also affirm our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.90 and 2025 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.25. As a reminder, when you look at our adjusted EPS guidance range from 2023 to 2025, it reflects approximately 7% annual growth, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth expectations of 6% to 8%. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Karen to provide several business updates.\n\nKaren L. Sedgwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Jeff. We've previously said that 2024 will be an important year of execution at each of our growth platforms, and I'm excited to provide an update on our progress. At Sempra California, we continue to see constructive regulatory outcomes. In March, the CPUC issued a proposed decision supporting the updated return on equity that was implemented this year as part of the CCM trigger. The commission agreed that the current cost of capital mechanism operated as designed, and the recently established returns on equity at SDG&E of 10.65% and at SoCalGas of 10.5% should remain in place through 2025 unless market conditions result in a trigger. Importantly, this improves regulatory certainty by affirming the protection that the CCM provides to customers and shareholders. And the key takeaway is that this is another constructive data point for California's regulatory framework.\nAnother example of this is rate reform. Improving affordability for all of our utility customers is a top priority. And I'm pleased to share that a proposed decision was issued at the CPUC in March to implement a fixed charge for residential electric customers. As currently proposed, this will reduce volumetric rates, support a more fair rate structure, and help California meet its clean energy goals. A final decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024, and the fixed charge would then be expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nDuring the quarter, we also made a joint filing with the other California utilities to develop projects that successfully demonstrate blending hydrogen into the natural gas system. These projects will begin blending at up to 5% on isolated sections of the natural gas system and incrementally increase the hydrogen concentration based on safety and technical feasibility. Hydrogen blending has been demonstrated safely and reliably around the world for decades. And we look forward to working with our partners to support new and improved ways to expand decarbonization efforts here in the state.\nTurning to the GRC. We expect a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision this year. Once the final decision is obtained, it will be retroactive to the beginning of the year. As a reminder, after we receive a final decision, we will have a clear regulatory pathway for execution on our utility-focused capital plan through 2027.\nLastly, Cal ISO updated SDG&E that it was not selected to move forward on the Imperial Valley transmission line and substation. It's important to note that we were financially disciplined in how we developed our bid, and we look forward to supporting the project's successful development as well as building the other transmission projects that were directly awarded to SDG&E by Caltrain.\nTurning to Texas, we continue to see significant growth across Oncor's service territory. Just last month, ERCOT issued an updated transmission planning report, forecasting approximately 40% higher load in 2030 than in last year's report. And yesterday, Oncor made its inaugural SRP filing, which includes approximately $3 billion of capital investments. In addition to SRP, the 2023 legislative session was particularly constructive for the state's utilities. We're already seeing the positive impacts at Oncor in terms of the planning and execution that support the state's priorities and improve the timing of the company's returns on capital.\nMoving to Sempra Infrastructure. We're very excited about the opportunity to help deliver cleaner energy to our customers and partners. Recently, we declared a positive FID at our Cimarron Wind Expansion project. This project demonstrates our ability to generate attractive returns while utilizing existing company-owned transmission capacity to serve the California market and targeting O&M efficiencies based on locational advantages. Additionally, we're making great progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 and Port Arthur LNG Phase I. ECA is roughly 80% complete and remains on target to start commercial operations in the summer of 2025. Port Arthur also remains on schedule with significant ongoing construction activity, including excellent progress around soil stabilization, new foundations, and the commencement of concrete pouring and structural steel work.\nTurning to our marketing efforts. The LNG market is long term by nature, and while the DOE pause has received a lot of press, we remain confident in our ability to deliver projects that offer long-term, secure, and cleaner energy to customers. Sempra Infrastructure benefits from experienced project development teams that continue to make progress on critical work streams, including permitting, engineering, and commercial negotiations. Moreover, the referenced pause does not impact our confidence in the overall competitive positioning of our development projects, and we're strategically utilizing this time to steadily advance our opportunities.\nAlso of note, even if you only take into consideration projects that have reached FID, Sempra Infrastructure has incredible built-in growth. With 16 million tonnes per annum of LNG export facilities, associated infrastructure, and a new wind project under construction, we're improving visibility to attractive earnings growth through the end of our planning period in 2028. And that's all before taking into account our development project pipeline, which Jeff referenced earlier and offers notable upside. We can now turn to the next slide where Allen will discuss ERCOT's new planning processes.\n\nE. Allen Nye\n\nCEO & Director, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you, Karen. As we have been discussing for several quarters now, Texas continues to experience strong demand growth. Oncor now serves close to 13 million customers and has now surpassed over 4 million meters. ERCOT is adapting to this growth with a recently announced new planning process to account for higher expected electricity needs in the future. In April, ERCOT announced that peak load is expected to reach 152 gigawatts in 2030, nearly double the record set last year of 85 gigawatts. This load growth is coming from a wide range of industries across the state, including new and expanded C&I, electrification of oil and gas operations, data centers, manufacturing, and residential.\nTo put this growth in context, the change from 2023 to 2030 would be like adding load greater than the size of the entire California power market. Currently, we anticipate that approximately 40% of the new load will come from Oncor service territory. So from our perspective, as one of the premier builders of T&D infrastructure in America, we are excited about the opportunity to continue to scale our investments in electric infrastructure. Since 2018, Oncor has constructed approximately 13,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, approximately 6 miles per day. We have an active planning process underway and are confident in our ability to secure the materials and labor necessary to serve our customers in the ERCOT market.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Given the growth in the state, resiliency is more critical than ever. In 2023, the Texas legislature passed House Bill 2555, which allows electric utilities to file system resiliency plans proposing capital and operational expenditures to improve overall grid resiliency. We made our first filing yesterday for approximately $3 billion of new capital expenditures and just over $500 million of operating expenditures to be made over a period of 3 years. This investment would address overhead and underground system resiliency and modernization, flexible and self-healing distribution system, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation, and cyber and physical security.\nTo provide some additional color, the majority of our proposed spend is in the modernization and hardening of the older parts of our distribution system by adding lightning protection, stronger class poles and cross arms, and addressing capacity constrained parts of the grid during extreme temperatures. Furthermore, we are proposing significant technology and infrastructure investments that will help enable the automated reconfiguration of our system when extreme storms hit, quickly restoring service to customers on undamaged segments by intelligently rerouting power.\nI would also like to highlight that we have invested in wildfire mitigation for many years, including effectively partnering with industry leaders like SDG&E and the Texas A&M Forest Service. Now thanks to HB 2555, Oncor has an additional opportunity to further accelerate our wildfire mitigation strategies across our service territory. We estimate that approximately $900 million of the total proposed spend, including both CapEx and OpEx, will focus on expanding our wildfire mitigation tools and implementing our grid modernization and hardening measures in wildfire-prone areas.\nProcedurally, the SRP statute provides 180 days for the PUCT to review the filing, and we anticipate having a decision by the end of the year. The SRP program, with approximately $3 billion of capital expenditures if approved, would be incremental to Oncor's $24.2 billion of planned CapEx announced earlier this year for the 5-year period 2024 to 2028. We believe our proposed SRP creates an opportunity to fundamentally improve customer reliability and overall customer service during and after extreme weather events while also helping to mitigate other risks. I will now turn the call back to Karen to walk through Sempra's financial update.\n\nKaren L. Sedgwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Allen. Earlier today, Sempra reported first quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $801 million or $1.26 per share. This compares to first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million or $1.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2024 earnings were $854 million or $1.34 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2023 earnings of $922 million or $1.46 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Variances in the first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows: at Sempra California, we had $24 million primarily from higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits and $12 million of lower CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, offset by higher authorized cost of capital. As a reminder, because our GRC is still pending, our CPUC revenues in first quarter 2024 are still based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because any true-up later this year will be retroactively applied to January 1 when the final decision is approved.\nTurning to Sempra Texas. We had $56 million of higher equity earnings attributable to rate updates, increased embedded capital, and consumption, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $13 million of lower transportation revenues and higher O&M, partially offset by higher power results, and $27 million of lower asset and supply optimization, partially offset by lower net interest expense due to capitalized interest, lower taxes and other. As a note, beginning this year, the waterfall numbers are presented after noncontrolling interest to improve comparability.\nAt Sempra Parent, the $48 million quarter-over-quarter change is primarily due to higher taxes from the interim period application of an annual forecasted consolidated effective tax rate, which is expected to turn around over the course of the year.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Before we close out our prepared remarks, I want to outline Sempra's value proposition as we execute our corporate strategy. At Sempra, our management team is committed to challenging the status quo in all aspects of our business operations. We offer exposure to growth in some of North America's largest economic markets. Our position as a leader in the infrastructure development in these markets translates into a record $48 billion capital campaign through 2028.\nIn addition, we make energy infrastructure investments that target attractive mid-teens returns on equity, and we understand that disciplined capital allocation is central to our success. And we understand the importance of returning capital to our owners and expect to continue growing our dividend. Of note, we've successfully grown our dividend at a rate of roughly 7% annually over the last 10 years. This is particularly noteworthy, given the expected strength of our future earnings growth.\nTo conclude, the role of our industry is becoming increasingly important to society, and at Sempra, we're excited about the prospects ahead of us. Sempra is competitively positioned to capitalize on opportunities, and we'll continue to invest in our people, prudently manage risks, efficiently finance our businesses, and be good stewards of the capital entrusted to us. We thank you for joining us, and I'd now like to open the line for your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Sempra's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nEarnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage to review of our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nPlease note that all share and per share amounts reflect the 2-for-1 split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend that we announced on the second quarter call and distributed in August. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, November 3, 2023, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We're pleased with the strength of our third quarter results, which sets the stage for our company's continued growth. Given current geopolitical tensions, countries around the world are looking to ensure they are not dependent on supply chains that are subject to disruption and uncertainty. Increasingly, they want to source essential goods, whether food, liquefied natural gas or microchips, closer to home or from dependable allies.\nWith this trend toward deglobalization, we see North America as one of the principal beneficiaries. We also believe these trends support important new growth in Mexico, where in the first half of 2023, foreign direct investment has risen sharply by approximately 40% over the prior year comparable period. Just this year, Mexico has also surpassed China as America's largest trading partner.\nAs these trends continue, new higher levels of investment in North America's energy grid will be critical to supporting continued economic expansion. That's why at Sempra, we're really excited about our mission to build this premier energy infrastructure company. As part of that mission, we focus significant time and effort on building a high-performing culture where we invest for the long term in our business and our employees.\nAnd in combination, this has helped us achieve strong financial and operating results. Our strategy focuses on what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America with strong economic growth and constructive regulation. Combined with capital discipline, dispositions Sempra to deliver competitive long-term returns for our owners. Also, our business is expected to benefit from secular tailwinds that support our 5-year capital plan of approximately $40 billion.\nYou will recall, I've spoken before about the opportunities that lie ahead for Oncor and the possibility of doubling their rate base over the next 5 to 6 years. While we're still early in our fall planning process, we expect to increase our $40 billion capital plan by 10% to 20% when we update our 5-year plan on our fourth quarter call. This increase is expected to be anchored by regulated utility investments and primarily driven by Oncor. Overall, we continue to see significant growth in multiple areas of Oncor's service territory. And with Allen here today, he will speak to some of those opportunities later on today's call.\nTurning to the quarter. We believe our results demonstrate the strength of our business and our ability to continue producing strong earnings growth. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 and year-to-date 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $3.48. Given our year-to-date success, we're expecting to be at or above the high end of our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, and we're affirming our 2024 EPS guidance range and projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%.\nFinally, let me take a moment to speak about Kevin Sagara, who will be retiring next month after nearly 30 years of service at Sempra and its predecessor companies. Kevin was instrumental in the 1998 transaction that originally formed Sempra when the parent companies of SDG&E and SoCalGas merged. He has held many leadership positions across our companies, including CEO of Sempra Renewables, CEO of San Diego Gas & Electric as well as his recent role as Group President over our California Utilities.\nHe's had a really amazing career here and made significant contributions to our success and will be greatly missed. Now let me turn the call over to Allen Nye, who will take us through business development in Texas.\n\nE. Allen Nye\n\nCEO & Director, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you, Jeff. Today, I'd like to highlight our strong operational performance this quarter and speak to the recent legislation that we believe will improve our ability to provide high-quality service to customers and deliver improved financial performance. I'll then finish by highlighting some of the underlying growth drivers at Oncor. Despite record heat throughout the third quarter, the Oncor team performed exceptionally well, and I would like to thank them for working safely in extremely difficult conditions.\nAs a result of our team's efforts, reliability continued to be strong with average outage duration improving by 9% over the last 12 months. Turning to the continuation of the Texas Miracle, Oncor is one of the nation's largest pure-play T&D utilities operating in one of the fastest-growing states. With over 30 million people, Texas GDP is approximately $2 trillion, which makes it the eighth largest economy in the world. Texas annual GDP grew at 3.4% last year, well above the U.S. average of 2.1%.\nOur Pro business climate is well documented and has driven diversified job creation across many sectors of the economy. Oncor serves 4 of the top 15 fastest-growing cities in America, with premise growth of approximately 2% annually expected in our service territory. The population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is larger than most states and in each of the last 2 years, added more people than any other U.S. metropolitan area.\nThis growth has certainly impacted the demand for electricity. This past summer, 10 peak demand records were set in the ERCOT region, culminating in an 85-gigawatt peak, which is 16% higher than the peak just 5 years ago. This growth also continues to fuel significant expansion of our system. In the third quarter, Oncor connected around 20,000 additional premises; built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 630 miles of T&D lines; and managed 755 active transmission interconnection requests, a 34% increase over last year.\nSpecifically, retail interconnection requests have increased about 90% since the end of Q3 last year, which will be a major driver in our capital budget. Turning to the recently completed Texas legislative session, several bills were passed that give utilities better tools to support the growth of the state and improved resiliency of the grid.\nAs we discussed on the second quarter call, HB 2555 provides a new opportunity for Oncor to develop a forward-looking plan to invest in the resiliency of our system. The PUCT rulemaking associated with this legislation is currently underway, and we expect it to be finalized in the fourth quarter of this year. We are targeting the first quarter of 2024 to file our first system resiliency plan, or SRP, with the Public Utility Commission, HB 2555 provides for a 6-month time line for review and approval of the SRP.\nWhile much work remains to implement this legislation, we are optimistic that it will provide needed hardening, modernization and risk mitigation to our T&D grid for the benefit of our customers while improving the earnings and cash flow needed to support these investments in the future. Additionally, you'll remember, Oncor is now also able to file 2 distribution cost trackers each year as opposed to just 1. Thanks to SB 1015.\nIn September, Oncor submitted its second DCRF tracker for investments made in the first half of the year. SB 1015 accelerated DCRF approval time lines to 60 to 75 days, matching the efficient interim T cost process that has worked well for 2 decades. As we said last quarter, WE expect the addition of the second DCRF filing to improve Oncor's earnings by approximately $70 million to $90 million annually.\nOncor is actively evaluating our 5-year capital plan to reflect the continued growth across Oncor service territory and the impacts of new legislation. After reviewing with our Board, we expect to announce an update as part of Sempra's fourth quarter earnings call. Please turn to the next slide. This slide demonstrates the diversity of our service territory, both geographically and by customer type, which propels Oncor's expected higher capital plan.\nAs you can see, growth is driven by a broad group of industries, including manufacturing, oil and gas, professional services and large data centers arising not only in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex but in North, Central and West Texas. Notably, the Permian Basin continues to be one of the premier energy producing regions in the world and is undergoing a major electrification effort. The load demand in this region is projected to increase from 4.2 gigawatts to roughly 17.2 gigawatts over the next decade.\nPlease turn to the next slide. While I will hand the call to Trevor to review business updates at Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure as well as Sempra's detailed financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Allen. Starting in California, it's worth reminding everyone that during the third quarter, Southern California experienced a rare tropical storm, and I am pleased to say that both SDG&E and SoCalGas Systems remained resilient and operational. We believe delivering energy under these circumstances validates the important work our teams have accomplished in continuing to improve system safety and reliability.\nOver the past several decades, PA Consulting has published reliability rankings for American Utilities, and SDG&E was recently awarded the #1 ranking of best in the West for the 18th year in a row. They also received the National Grid Sustainability Award. This award is presented to a leading American utility, demonstrating excellence and reliable service to its customers, including the application of clean energy technology and investment in the grid.\nIn combination, these awards are a great credit to Caroline Winn and the entire SDG&E team. One key consideration in supporting the energy transition is the ability to store and discharge excess power. With more renewable energy, storage and dispatchable resources are critical for maintaining the stability of the grid even during extreme weather events. That's why, in the third quarter, SDG&E requested approval for another 160 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage assets.\nThis is in addition to the 171 megawatts of recently commissioned assets that we discussed on our second quarter call. If approved, this would bring SDG&E's energy storage portfolio to over 500 megawatts in support of their ability to deliver safer, cleaner and more reliable energy to its customers.\nImportantly, as SDG&E integrates innovative technologies, such as utility-owned storage to help meet its good reliability and clean energy goals, we're also pursuing federal investment tax credits, which could result in an estimated $215 million in savings. The potential savings would be passed on to customers and included in the calculation to establish rates beginning in January 2025 as part of the company's continued efforts to drive a series of cost savings initiatives to improve the affordability of its services.\nLast quarter, we updated you on the approval of Cal ISO's transmission plan and the recent assignment to us of $500 million of new projects in our service territory. Also, SDG&E submitted bid materials for Cal ISO's FERC 1000 solicitation, and we expect to be quite competitive as part of that process. As you know, transmission assets deliver benefits integrating increasing amounts of clean energy to the broader state of California, and as such, these costs are spread across the state.\nRecently, the CPUC approved an increase in the authorized working gas storage capacity at Aliso Canyon. The CPUC recognized the importance of the facility to help improve grid reliability and customer affordability. The additional gas storage capacity is also expected to help mitigate potential price volatility. Additionally, in the third quarter, Governor Newsom directed the formation of California's hydrogen market development strategy, which will employ an all of government approach to lay out pathways for building a robust hydrogen market in the state.\nWe're excited to see the innovative ways that hydrogen may be used to help decarbonize California's economy. On the federal side, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded up to $1.2 billion of funding for our regional clean hydrogen hub in California. SoCalGas is proud to be a partner in Arches, the statewide public private partnership sponsoring this application. The DOE's award demonstrates support for the valuable role hydrogen could play in decarbonization while striving to ensure safety, affordability and resiliency.\nCalifornia recently passed into law SB 410, supporting investments for further decarbonization and electrification of the energy system. As electrification continues to become a larger part of the state's strategy to achieve its climate goals, demand on the electric grid will also increase, meaning utilities will need to proactively plan and build distribution grid upgrades to meet customer needs.\nSimilar to some of the Texas legislative updates that Allen described, SB 410 is California's recognition of the need to utilize existing regulatory mechanisms such as balancing accounts to support customer needs in between GRC cycles and help California's utility make critical new investments to keep pace with the state's expanding economy and decarbonization goals.\nI'd like to provide a brief update on the GRC process. Our applications are centered around safety, reliability and the delivery of increasingly clean forms of energy. We recently filed a few settlement agreements with various interveners, including Cal advocates, small business utility advocates While there remains input from other interveners and ultimately approval by the CPUC as part of the final decision in the GRC, we believe this is a constructive step in the process.\nWe continue to expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year. As a final note, most of you already are aware that the cost of capital mechanism triggered in both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed advice letters, which are pending commission approval. These applications are expected to increase ROEs by approximately 70 basis points beginning January 1, 2024.\nWe believe this adjustment should be approved by the commission as part of the established mechanism and is one of the key components that supports California's constructive regulatory environment. We believe California's regulatory framework is quite constructive relative to other jurisdictions, given its forward-looking rates, attractive ROEs, cost of capital adjustment mechanism and advanced framework for handling climate-related event risks.\nWith California's continued economic growth and constructive regulatory framework, we believe our utilities are well positioned to continue improving their service to customers while supporting overall system growth and resiliency. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to Sempra Infrastructure. We've reached several key milestones in the quarter. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, we completed the previously announced sale of a 42% indirect noncontrolling interest in the project to KKR. And recently, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 received a permit from FERC, a critical milestone in the project's development.\nNow that FERC has issued its approval, the DOE is able to consider the environmental review associated with our non-FTA application. Marketing our Phase 2's offtake continues to build momentum as we see volumes coalesce in the market around projects that have the highest potential of commercial development. Phase 2 is also expected to add 2 additional liquefaction trains, capable of producing an incremental 13 Mtpa, which would effectively double the total capacity of Port Arthur.\nIn its entirety, the Port Arthur Energy Hub showcases the expertise and value that Sempra Infrastructure's integrated capabilities bring to project development. Earlier this year in March, Cameron LNG Phase 2 received approval for its FERC order. Sempra Infrastructure and its partners at Cameron LNG continue to develop a fourth liquefaction train. We have now begun working with Bechtel to perform value engineering to reduce construction risks and project costs. We expect this process will continue through the end of the year.\nSempra Infrastructure's mission is to provide energy for a better world through its high-growth, low-carbon platform. We're excited about collaborating with Mitsubishi Corporation and a consortium of Japanese natural gas utility companies to explore the development and export of e-natural gas, which is synthesized from captured CO2 by combining it with green hydrogen.\nTogether, the stakeholders intend to evaluate a Gulf Coast project with a view towards producing approximately 130,000 tons of e-natural gas annually that would be liquefied and exported from the Cameron LNG terminal. Wrapping up on Sempra infrastructure, the overall scale of our portfolio positions us to capture additional growth opportunities, create new synergies and support the growth of top-tier projects, as demonstrated by the Port Arthur Energy Hub currently under construction and development.\nAs Jeff mentioned earlier, we believe North America's energy markets will continue to be driven by the trends of decarbonization, energy security and reshoring of manufacturing back to North America. Sempra Infrastructure remains well positioned to contribute to and capitalize on such opportunities.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Turning to our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $721 million or $1.14 per share. This compares to third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $485 million or $0.77 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2023 earnings were $685 million or $1.08 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2022 earnings of $622 million or $0.98 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $27 million of lower income tax benefits and higher net interest expense, offset by $27 million of higher electric transmission and CPUC base operating margin at SDG&E, net of lower authorized cost of capital and higher regulatory interest income at SDG&E and SoCalGas.\nAt Sempra Texas, $49 million of higher equity earnings from weather-driven consumption, new base rates and customer growth. At Sempra Infrastructure, $21 million of lower net interest expense due to higher capitalization of interest on projects under construction. $16 million primarily driven from higher transportation tariffs. At Sempra Parent, there were $23 million of higher costs, primarily driven by increased interest expense, partially offset by a net income tax benefit.\nGiven the geographic and regulatory overlays between the 2 companies, we are currently considering resegmentation in which our SDG&E and SoCalGas segments would be combined into one reportable segment, Sempra California. We intend to complete our analysis in the fourth quarter of 2023 and assuming a positive determination is made, we would implement the resegmentation in our annual 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2023.\nPlease turn to the next slide. We are pleased with the strength of our third quarter results and the positive message it conveys about Sempra's business quality and the robust growth we are seeing across all 3 platforms. Before I close, let me briefly touch base on the balance sheet. Debt is a core component of our capital structure. And over the past 3 years, we've taken important steps to transition to lower rate, longer duration fixed rate debt.\nWe have been prudent with our balance sheet management by using proceeds from the noncontrolling interest sales to KKR in 2021 and ADIA in 2022 and to repay short-term debt and limit near-term parent debt maturities. In fact, at the parent level, if interest rates increase by another 50 basis points, we would project a negligible impact to EPS between now and 2027.\nPlease refer to Slide 14 in the appendix for additional information. Looking forward, we remain focused on identifying and executing on sound capital investment opportunities. We are continuing to optimize our financing plan to support the growth we highlighted today, and we'll evaluate all of our financing options, including the use of common equity to support accretive growth. Throughout our history, Sempra has demonstrated operational excellence, strong financial stewardship, meaningful earnings growth and a commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We would now like to open the line up and take some of your questions."

Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Please note that these earnings per share amounts do not reflect the 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend that we announced earlier this morning.\nThese amounts will be updated when we announce our third quarter and full year 2023 financial results. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 3, 2023, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you all for joining us today. Earlier this summer, Semper celebrated its 25th anniversary. While the company was founded in 1998, our operational routes at San Diego Gas Electric and SoCalGas date back to the late 1800s. Over that time, we've embraced a strong commitment to serving others, delivering energy with purpose and better in our communities.\nToday, we have 3 premium growth platforms located in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. And looking forward to the next 25 years, we're really excited about the opportunities in front of us to modernize and expand our energy network so that we can deliver increasingly clean, affordable and reliable energy to our customers.\nThis year, we also published our 15th corporate sustainability report, emphasizing how our sustainable business practices help mitigate risk and unlock new opportunities as we continue executing on our record $40 billion 5-year capital plan, which you'll recall, only includes Sempra's proportionate share of the capital. Today, Sempra has multiple tailwinds supporting our growth and income equity story, and we're confident in our ability to continue delivering high-quality earnings and dividend growth to our shareholders.\nThat brings me back to the quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 and year-to-date 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $4.80. As you'll recall, we discussed the company's 2023 and 2024 guidance on our first quarter call in May. And based on the strength of our results across the first half of the year, we're pleased to affirm both our 2023 and 2024 guidance ranges and our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%.\nAlso, just yesterday, Sempra's Board approved a 2-for-1 stock split with the distribution date on August 21. The split does not impact our reported results for the second quarter, but it's important to note that in the third quarter, our historical and future financial results will reflect the post-split share count. For the last several years, we've had one of the highest stock prices in the S&P 500 Utility Index. So if the plan split, we believe it will increase our trading volume and provide more accessibility for a broader group of investors to join us on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company.\nPlease turn to the next slide. When Sempra began its journey in 1998, we had a relatively modest rate base of roughly $5 billion. And across the last 2.5 decades, we've been successful in transforming the size and scale of Sempra's overall portfolio while also simplifying our business model. Today, we own $45 billion of rate base and over $80 billion of assets with an investment focus on what we believe is the higher value, lower risk portion of the energy value chain or transmission and distribution assets.\nI'd also note that Sempra's businesses are located in contiguous markets in the southwestern tier of North America and really benefit from strong economic growth across the region. Our strategy focuses on investing in regulated utilities that are decoupled from direct commodity exposure and long-term contracted energy infrastructure while avoiding the volatility associated with commodities and the uncertainties facing legacy generation facilities.\nIn other words, our core value proposition focuses on investing in the transmission and distribution backbone of North America and helping to efficiently move energy from producers to customers. Finally, our T&D utility investments benefit from constructive regulatory mechanisms with competitive returns on equity and the timely return of capital.\nSempra Infrastructure's business is underpinned by long-term contracts with world-class counterparties that are expected to provide steady recurring cash flows. Taken together, our 3 platforms provide great visibility to high-quality, long-term earnings growth, which is aligned with our overall mission to continue building out the premier energy infrastructure company in North America.\nPlease turn to the next slide where Trevor will walk you through both our business and financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Jeff. As we close the first half of the year, we're pleased with our financial results, which highlight the strength of our business model. For background, Sempra was formed via the merger of the parent companies of SDG&E and SoCalGas. And it's exciting to see how that foundation has allowed us to build a much larger and more successful company over time.\nToday, we have a leading position with $24 billion of rate base within our Sempra California platform and serve nearly 26 million consumers. As electrification continues to increase, we're seeing significant load growth. Since 2022, SDG&E has experienced load growth of approximately 3%. This is the result of economic expansion and the trend of more business and consumer activity switching to electricity.\nFor example, the Port of San Diego recently unveiled the arrival of 2 all-electric cranes, which are the first of their kind to be unveiled in North America. The port also approved an electrification project, enabling cruise ships to plug into the grid while as opposed to running their diesel engines, thereby significantly reducing emissions.\nThe Port of San Diego is also expecting to receive the first all-electric tugboat to support further emission reductions across their operations. As these trends continue, we see opportunities for increased investment in infrastructure to support continued decarbonization in the region. Another great example is the ongoing electrification of transportation. California is leading the nation in electric vehicles, and SDG&E now has over 110,000 EVs in its service territory as of the first quarter, an increase of almost 35% compared to last year.\nAt Sempra, our employees have also been leaders in promoting electrification. Back in 2015, we set an internal goal to have 500 employees using electric vehicles as a primary means of transportation. We're pleased to report that we have recently exceeded the 1,000 employee mark, making us one of the first companies in Southern California to reach this milestone. And as electrification and customer adoption increases, we expect this to drive increased load growth in our service territory.\nFurther, with an increasingly complex grid, significant modernization is required to maintain safety and reliability. SDG&E's recent commissioning of 171 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage assets is another great example of utilizing technology to store and dispatch clean energy while reducing reliance on conventional gas-fired power plants.\nTo help ensure California can meet its reliability and clean energy goals, CAISO approved the 2022 to 2023 transmission plan in May, awarding SDG&E an estimated $500 million of new development projects. Also in June, CAISO initiated a comprehensive bidding process with over $2 billion of additional projects located within SDG&E service territory. At Sempra, we're one of the largest owners and operators of transmission assets in North America, and we believe SDG&E is well positioned to compete favorably.\nThe company has a long track record of operating success here in Southern California. And we certainly believe our leadership and credibility in wildfire mitigation will also inform the quality and competitive nature of our bid. Also in June, SDG&E announced that 80% of San Diego County customers are now receiving their electricity supplies from third-party providers. This is consistent with SDG&E strategy of focusing more narrowly on modernizing the grid to efficiently move cleaner sources of energy to customers, or what we refer to as an energy delivery model, much like Oncor in Texas.\nTurning to SoCalGas. The company released an expanded Clean Fuels analysis, indicating the need to plan and account for increased levels of clean, firm dispatchable generation. Results highlight the potential reliability benefits of electric resource diversity and the value of hydrogen generation. The report also contemplates how cleaner fuels can be delivered safely and affordably through SoCalGas' existing and potentially new energy networks to help support electrification and decarbonization.\nIn connection with California's new renewable gas procurement standard, known as SB 1440, SoCalGas recently issued a new request for proposal for biomethane supply in the form of RNG and/or biosynthetic natural gas. At the end of 2022, RNG represented 5% of core gas deliveries at SoCalGas, and the mandated procurement through SB 1440 is expected to support the adoption of RNG in the state and, in turn, help SoCalGas meet its goal of 20% RNG in core customer deliveries by 2030.\nThis is a prime example of how SoCalGas is using its existing energy network to help the state decarbonize in a safe and affordable manner. Finally, our California GRCs are well underway. Our application in those cases are centered around delivering cleaner energy, safely and reliably and in alignment with California's decarbonization goals.\nRecently, SDG&E and SoCalGas participated in evidentiary hearings with interveners and submitted updated testimony and the regulatory process continues to advance in a constructive manner. The next key milestone is opening briefs, which are scheduled to be filed in mid-August. We continue to expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Turning to Texas. I first want to acknowledge the excessive heat that customers are currently enduring across the state while also recognizing the strong performance of the grid under some of the challenging conditions. Oncor's innovative and dedicated employees are the driving force maintaining reliable electric service, despite challenging external factors, and they go to work each day with this commitment to excellence.\nWhen we acquired just over 80% in Oncor 5 years ago, it had $11 billion of rate base, and Sempra made a regulatory commitment to support a minimum $7.4 billion 5-year capital plan. That same capital spend grew to be nearly $12 billion over that same period, and Oncor has nearly doubled its rate base to $21 billion as of the end of 2022. Over the past 5 years, Oncor system has grown substantially, having added approximately 7,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines.\nEarlier this year, Oncor increased its 2023 to 2027 capital plan to $19 billion with continued strong economic growth and the recent positive legislation, we now certainly anticipate upside when we roll forward the new 5-year capital plan. We have long talked about the incredible macroeconomic growth in Texas and how it continues to drive additional capital investments.\nTo put Oncor's customer base into perspective, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex alone has a larger population than 38 states. Since June of this year, ERCOT set 6 new records for peak demand. And it's also noteworthy that over the past 7 years, there has been a 17% increase in ERCOT's peak demand. Specifically for Oncor, both C&I and residential customer demand continues to grow.\nA great example of this incremental C&I demand is the roughly $60 billion of chip manufacturing facilities that have begun construction in the cities of Sherman and Taylor over the past 18 months. These large manufacturing sites are expected to drive demand and require the build-out of significant new electrical infrastructure in the surrounding communities.\nFinally, we also want to provide an update on a series of positive legislative outcomes that could add significant long-term value for Oncor and its customers by attracting additional capital to meet the state's growth and resiliency needs. Please turn to the next slide. Several bills were recently enacted in Texas that are designed to provide enhanced recovery mechanisms for utilities and reduce regulatory lag.\nTogether, these bills are expected to improve realized ROE and facilitate additional investment to support Texas' growth. We believe that the improved regulatory legislation, coupled with an incredible economic growth story, positions Oncor as one of the premier regulated T&D utilities in the country.\nStarting with SB 1015, Oncor is now able to file a distribution capital tracker twice a year as opposed to only once. Similar to the existing regulatory mechanism for transmission investments, this should reduce regulatory lag and reflect Oncor's distribution investments in a more timely manner. This should improve both earnings and cash flows and is critical in markets like Texas, which is experiencing increased demand requiring rapid capital deployment.\nMoving to HB 2555. This bill is designed to allow utilities to file a plan to harden and make its transmission and distribution systems more resilient to potential disruptions. Of note, the bill provides a separate regulatory mechanism for recovery of commission-approved resiliency investments. The PUCT is currently drafting new rules to specify actual implementation, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. The rulemaking will lay out the procedural steps and time lines between future filings and the actual rate implementation.\nSB 1076, the Permitting Efficiency Bill, helps address the transmission grids expansion needs by shortening the time to approve CCN applications from 12 months to 6 months. Finally, HB 5066, Directs ERCOT and the PUCT to develop plans for transmission projects to serve high-growth areas of Texas, including the electrification efforts in the Permian Basin and could provide incremental investment opportunities for Oncor.\nTogether, these constructive legislative outcomes enhance Oncor's ability to better serve customers and support system growth. Please turn to the next slide, where I will turn the call over to Justin to provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure and Port Arthur.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nPresident, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThank you, Trevor. Sempra Infrastructure was formed 2 years ago to streamline our business and bring together decades of energy infrastructure development and operating expertise under a single platform. Our increased scale positions us to capture new opportunities, create portfolio synergies and support the growth of North American energy markets.\nThere are 3 key trends that support these opportunities: decarbonization; energy security; and reshoring of manufacturing to North America, all of which give us confidence in the long-term growth profile of our business. Trade between the U.S. and Mexico continues to grow as a result of a strong reshoring trend. For example, a recent Reuters article identified more than $9 billion of capital that has flowed into Mexico from overseas manufacturers in the last 9 months.\nAnd recently, Mexico surpassed Canada to become the largest trading partner of the U.S. Given our position as a leading player in North American energy infrastructure, we are well positioned to support growing cross-border trade with Mexico. More recently, we received several positive regulatory approvals across a number of our assets in Mexico, including in our energy networks and clean power segments.\nMoving to projects under construction. Our teams have been busy with over 10 million accumulated hours worked without a lost time incident. We expect these projects will come online over time with GRO expansion and ECA targeting COD in the second half of 2024 and the summer of 2025, respectively. And finally, Port Arthur Phase 1 is also advancing as expected and continues to target commercial operations of Train 1 and Train 2 in '27 and 28, respectively.\nTurning to LNG development at Cameron Phase 2. We're at a stage in the competitive feed process where we have selected Bechtel to move forward to complete the remaining work. We are aligned with our partners to invest additional time upfront to reduce construction risks and project costs. We expect this process to continue through the fall, positioning us to take FID next year after satisfactorily finalizing the additional FEED work, securing project financing and any required regulatory approvals.\nThe selection of Bechtel is a significant milestone, and we're implementing a strategy similar to what we did at Port Arthur to reduce overall cost and risk to deliver another world-class LNG project. Also, we are pleased with the marketing and development at Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 and are particularly encouraged by recent comments made by the FERC Chairman in support of energy infrastructure projects needed for reliability.\nLooking ahead, we're also expecting that Sempra Infrastructure Partners will finalize its project-level ownership stake in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 at 28%. This is within the previously shared target range of 20% to 30%, and we expect the transaction with KKR to close in the third quarter. Based on this updated ownership forecast for the project, Sempra Infrastructure Partners equity requirement is anticipated to be approximately $1.74 billion and its proportionate share of EBITDA is estimated to be $460 million, which excludes certain upside economics such as Sempra Infrastructure's right to common facility payments from future phases.\nPlease turn to the next slide. At Port Arthur, we're developing a flagship energy hub that showcases the value of Sempra Infrastructure's world-class integrated capabilities. Sempra Infrastructure can leverage development and operational expertise across its portfolio to enhance the total value of Port Arthur. With 13 million tonnes per annum already under construction, Phase 2 is expected to double that capacity.\nFurther, we're leveraging the integrated capabilities of our business segments by developing the proposed Louisiana Connector pipeline, gas storage facilities, Titan Carbon Sequestration facility and an early-stage hydrogen project in the Port Arthur region. This comprehensive development approach supports the sustained growth of our energy infrastructure portfolio and is expected to help us capture a larger piece of the economics from the Port Arthur footprint.\nAt Port Arthur Phase 1, construction is well underway with more than 2.7 million hours worked without a lost time incident. Many of you are likely aware that our recent FERC request, which would enable Bechtel to expand staffing and work schedules to include 24-hour shifts. This provides for better optimization of construction activities, focusing on safety and allows for certain tasks to be completed at night, such as material deliveries and next-day site preparation.\nWe also believe it will improve workflows and streamline schedules, so it's a mutually beneficial situation from our perspective. With that, please turn to the next slide where Trevor will discuss Sempra's financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $603 million or $1.91 per share. This compares to second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $559 million or $1.77 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2023 earnings were $594 million or $1.88 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2022 earnings of $626 million or $1.98 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $32 million of higher CPUC base operating margin at SDG&E and higher amounts earned under certain CPUC regulatory incentive mechanisms and $14 million of higher CPUC net interest income earned on regulatory balances and higher tax benefits on flow-through items at SoCalGas, partially offset by net higher interest expense.\nAt Sempra Texas, $26 million of lower equity earnings from higher expenses and lower weather-driven consumption, offset by new base rates and customer growth. At Sempra Infrastructure, $40 million of higher earnings attributable to NCI, including the 10% sale of a minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to ADIA and higher development expense.\nThis was partially offset by $33 million of higher equity earnings, primarily from transportation tariffs; partially offset by lower asset optimization revenues, primarily from lower LNG diversion fees and lower generation at TdM from a scheduled major maintenance. At Sempra Parent and Other, there were $45 million of higher costs, primarily driven by lower tax benefits and increased net interest expense, partially offset by net investment gains.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Over the past 25 years, Sempra has transformed from a regional Southern California utility to a leading North American energy infrastructure company and is positioned at the intersection of multiple macroeconomic growth trends. Along each step of the way, we've exhibited strong financial stewardship, overseeing meaningful earnings growth and return significant capital to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nLooking ahead, we're focused on reaching a constructive outcome on our California rate cases, executing our record capital plan, demonstrating financial discipline and materially advancing critical infrastructure projects across our growth platforms. We've had a great start to the year that highlights our compelling growth story. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop, open the line and take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section.\nHere in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including: Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nEarnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. And we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.\nWe also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 4, 2023. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you all for joining us today. We're excited to report that through the first 4 months of this year, we've accomplished several significant objectives that advance our business strategy and position the company for future success.\nWe're off to a great start for this year. So what I'd like to do is provide you updates on several key business developments, growth opportunities over the next half decade and our EPS guidance for 2023 and 2024. After that Trevor and Justin will walk us through the business and financial achievements for our three growth platforms. And at the end of today's call, we'll reserve time for your questions.\nTurning now to business developments. Oncor completed its base rate review last month with an updated ROE of 9.7% and a continuation of its existing equity layer of 42.5%. This constructive outcome provides strong support for Oncor's credit ratings and the expanded capital spending that's needed to meet the strong growth that's continuing to occur across its service territory.\nJust last week, Oncor's Board met and reviewed the company's updated 5-year capital plan, which increased from roughly $15 billion to $19 billion. Oncor continues to see strong demand growth on its system and the need to make additional capital investments in transmission, distribution and new technology to continue improving safety and reliability. It's also important to note that we expect Oncor management will again refresh their long-term capital plan in the future with a view toward increasing it for the roll-forward 5-year period ending in 2028.\nNext, I'd like to mention that I'm pleased with the recent positive final investment decision at Port Arthur LNG. It's an important milestone that highlights the growing franchise value of Sempra Infrastructure and how well positioned that platform is for continued growth through the end of the decade.\nWe also have a lot of respect for ConocoPhillips and their management team. Their participation in the capital structure and offtake creates strong alignment with us for successful execution of the project. I would note as well that we're bullish about future LNG opportunities and expect the U.S. LNG capacity will grow annually at a double-digit clip through the end of the decade and that Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to help the U.S. extend its leadership position in this area.\nWith these developments and a newly updated view of our planned capital spending across all three growth platforms, we're announcing Sempra's new 2023 to 2027 capital plan of $40 billion. Note, too, that this number only includes Sempra's proportionate ownership share of the capital being allocated to Oncor and Sempra Infrastructure, including Port Arthur LNG.\nThis year, we're celebrating Sempra's 25th anniversary. Our 20,000 employees are on a mission to build North America's leading energy infrastructure company. And it's our commitment to innovation, sustainability and leadership that guides our disciplined investment strategy. We aim to provide a growing and competitive dividend while also increasing the company's earnings per share over the long term at rates of growth that continue to trend above the industry average.\nWith that backdrop, we're affirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20 and issuing our full year 2024 EPS guidance range of $9.10 to $9.80. Together, this updated guidance and our new capital plan provide a solid foundation for our long-term projected 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate, which we're also affirming today.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Trevor to discuss our 5-year capital plan in more detail and provide a summary of our business and financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Jeff. We continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our utilities and infrastructure businesses, resulting in a $40 billion 5-year capital plan, which, as Jeff mentioned, is approximately $5 billion higher than the previous plan. I'll briefly summarize the expected spending at each business.\nAt Sempra California, their 5-year $21.4 billion capital plan is aligned with the state's priorities, which include safety, reliability, wildfire mitigation and sustainability with a focus on customer affordability. At Sempra Texas, the $15.3 billion capital plan includes our proportionate share of Oncor's $19 billion plan. Expected spending is in response to robust economic and demographic growth that is occurring across the state. As Jeff mentioned, we expect this capital plan will likely be revised upward in the future.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, its new capital plan of $3.6 billion now includes Sempra's proportionate share of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, assuming Sempra Infrastructure's targeted 25% ownership level. To fund this growth, our customary approach is to start by reinvesting operating cash flows and raising debt financing at our regulated utilities in line with our authorized capital structures.\nWe also evaluate other financing options, such as project-level debt and equity and asset sales before issuing common equity at the parent, all with the goal of solving for the lowest cost of capital. This approach is consistent with our past convention, where we've raised efficient financing through various asset and minority equity stake sales and our financing of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1.\nOverall, this approach of sourcing the lowest cost of capital has allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet and continue to return capital through our growing dividend, all while providing flexibility to support infrastructure investments and deliver strong financial performance. The key takeaways for me as the CFO is that this is an exciting time for Sempra. And we have improved visibility to a portfolio of opportunities to capture strong growth across this decade.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Over the next 5 years, our rate base is expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 9% with over 70% dedicated to electric infrastructure. This growth reflects the positive macroeconomic tailwinds in our core markets and attractive regulatory environments.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll speak to Sempra California's and Sempra Texas' accomplishments this quarter and their updated capital plans. Beginning with SoCalGas, you'll recall that in late 2022, the CPUC issued its decision for the Angeles Link memorandum account, which also directed SoCalGas to work with the state in its application to the DOE for hydrogen hub federal funding. In doing so, SoCalGas is honored to be a partner with more than 100 other entities to support California's application.\nAccording to DOE, clean hydrogen hubs are expected to create a network of producers, consumers and local connected infrastructure to accelerate its implementation as a scalable clean energy source. SoCalGas is excited to support the state's application and looks forward to advancing the development of critical new infrastructure to support cleaner fuels for the benefit of its customers.\nFurther, customer affordability is a top priority. That's why SDG&E has been working closely with regulators to proactively develop solutions to reduce bills while continuing to enhance customer safety and reliability. SDG&E is advancing several initiatives that we believe will improve the overall affordability of its services.\nFirst, it recently filed a joint proposal with the other two large investor-owned utilities in the state to redesign electric rates to include a fixed charge, which is intended to make electricity more affordable and encourage broader support for the electrification across the state. A proposed decision is expected in early 2024.\nAlso, SDG&E announced that it submitted an application to DOE seeking up to $100 million in federal matching funds to support the strategic undergrounding and hardening of overhead power lines in and near federally recognized tribal nations land within a service territory. SDG&E would invest an additional $100 million towards this effort, subject to approval from the CPUC. Exploring options to tap into federal funding for infrastructure hardening is a great example of how SDG&E is working to advance safety and reliability in a more cost-efficient manner for our customers.\nFurther, the California ISO recently issued a draft 20-year transmission outlook, which included several important projects in SDG&E's service territory that would support further renewable integration and overall grid reliability. Within the draft plan, the projects identified meet both reliability and policy objectives. The estimated cost of these projects are approximately $500 million based on reliability needs and an estimated $3 billion for projects consistent with state policy, which will be subject to a competitive bid process.\nThe draft plan is anticipated to be reviewed by the CISO Board later this month. We're encouraged to see their outlook is beginning to incorporate the higher expected electrification loads that will be needed to further decarbonize the state in accordance with state policies. Additionally, we expect the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&E and SoCalGas to establish the critical foundation for meeting the future needs of customers.\nImportantly, our filings are centered around delivering cleaner energy, safely and reliability in alignment with California's sustainability goals. Based on the current schedule, we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year.\nIn the meantime, SDG&E is continuing to execute a state-of-the-art wildfire mitigation plan, advancing the integration of utility storage and distributed resources and supporting electrification for the transportation sector. For SoCalGas, Scott and his team are focused on continuing to make improvements in the safety and integrity of the natural gas system while preparing its infrastructure for the delivery of cleaner fuels.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Moving to Sempra Texas. I'm pleased to report that Oncor is off to a strong start to the year. As Jeff mentioned, Oncor received a constructive final order for its base rate review in April, which preserved Oncor's equity layer at 42.5% and updated its ROE to 9.7%. As part of its decision, the commission recognized Oncor for its track record of excellent reliability of service, even with the extreme weather events that have occurred in its service territory.\nThis regulatory outcome has bolstered our confidence in the regulatory construct in the state. Having received the final order, Oncor updated its 5-year capital plan for 2023 through 2027 to $19 billion with a view toward making critical investments that support growth in the Texas economy and benefits customers through improved reliability of service.\nAlso, as a reminder, as part of Sempra's agreement to acquire Oncor in 2017, we committed to deploying $7.5 billion for the 5-year period from 2018 to 2022. At the end of 2022, Oncor had invested nearly $12 billion over that same period or nearly 60% more than its 2017 regulatory commitment. And now its 5-year plan anticipates $19 billion of investments, which is 2.5x its original regulatory commitment at the time of Sempra's investment.\nIncreases to Oncor's new capital plan are expected to support: growing generation interconnections, which are primarily related to renewables and clean power; strong premise growth; grid resilience and reliability; and technology and innovation advancements on the grid. You've heard us talk a lot about the attractiveness of this market in the past. In part, it's because Oncor benefits from the efficient capital recovery tracker mechanisms that are designed to limit lag associated with its investments.\nThere is now pending legislation that we are following that could improve Oncor's capital efficiency even further. In particular, SB 1015, if passed, would provide for two DCRF filings per year instead of the one that Oncor currently operates under. Passage of the bill would reduce regulatory lag and further support Oncor's efficient deployment of capital.\nFrom an operational perspective, Oncor had another strong quarter with a 41% increase in active and retail transmission interconnection requests at the end of March compared to the same time last year. Also, premise growth continued to be robust in the first quarter, where Oncor connected 17,000 new premises.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I will turn the call over to Justin to provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nPresident, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThanks, Trevor. Sempra Infrastructure had a strong first quarter of strategic accomplishments, particularly across its LNG and net-zero business lines, where continued demand for cleaner, more secure energy has strengthened the need for future development.\nOn the Gulf Coast, we've had several positive developments I want to highlight. I'll speak to Port Arthur in a moment. But first, in March, FERC approved Cameron LNG Phase 2's amendment to transition from gas turbines to electric drives. The completion of this work stream is critical to the development of the project. Given its competitive position to deliver LNG to customers in Europe and Asia, we remain confident in the attractive upside opportunity offered by this proposed expansion.\nAs a reminder, we expect that Cameron partners will take their share of offtake and SI will sell its share of volumes under back-to-back contracts. We continue to advance the competitive feed process. We've been targeting the completion of this process later this summer.\nConsistent with our disciplined approach to project development, we and the Cameron partners may extend this process beyond the targeted time frame to reduce construction risk, project cost and optimize the construction schedule through COD. We would expect to take FID after completing the FEED process as well as the project financing.\nAt Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, we reached a positive final investment decision in March. We closed on $6.8 billion of nonrecourse project debt and executed definitive equity financing agreements, which paves the way to advance the project. We continue to target closing our transaction with KKR this summer, pending regulatory approvals.\nThe momentum on Phase 1 sets us up well for a potential Phase 2 expansion at the facility. And it's important to note that SI has retained rights over the associated development and common facilities. We're continuing development work on the proposed expansion. And last month, we were pleased to receive the environmental assessment from FERC, citing no adverse impact, another positive step in our development.\nPort Arthur LNG Phase 1 was a great example of our strategic approach of collaborating with world-class partners to identify and execute investments with long-term contracted cash flows, all with a view of creating incremental value to our owners. We're continuing to execute this strategy, capturing new opportunities to support energy security and the global energy transition.\nIn Sempra Infrastructure's new capital plan, we have included Sempra's targeted proportionate share of the $13 billion projected capital expenditures at Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. Sempra Infrastructure Partners is targeting a 20% to 30% ownership interest in the project. Based on Sempra's 70% ownership of Sempra Infrastructure Partners and assuming its 25% target ownership in the project, we're including approximately $2 billion in our capital plan.\nAs a reminder, our planning convention is to only include projects that have reached FID. And therefore, our plan does not currently include Cameron LNG Phase 2, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 or other development opportunities where we haven't taken FID yet.\nAs you look to the robust growth opportunities that we've outlined in the appendix, I also would highlight we're now including the Port Arthur Louisiana Connector Pipeline. The pipeline would support 2 Bcf per day of feed gas supply for Port Arthur from the strategically located Gillis hub.\nPlease turn to the next slide. With FID at Port Arthur now behind us, I'm excited to provide you the first update on construction progress and how quickly teams, led by Bechtel, have mobilized to start construction. There are already approximately 450 people on site, including both the Bechtel and SI teams.\nAs a result, the site is changing daily. Clearing of the areas for the two LNG trains and two storage tanks is almost complete. And we've already started soil stabilization. We're doing this all with a firm eye on maintaining both a strong safety culture and deep community support for the project.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million, or $3.07 per share. This compares to first quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $612 million, or $1.93 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2023 earnings were $922 million, or $2.92 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2022 earnings of $924 million, or $2.91 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The variance in the first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $32 million of higher net interest expense at SoCalGas and SDG&E and lower income tax benefits at SoCalGas, primarily from flow-through items netted against lower income tax expense at SDG&E, primarily from flow-through items, partially offset by $14 million, primarily from higher CPUC and FERC base operating margin at SDG&E and lower CPUC base operating margin at SoCalGas.\nAt Sempra Texas, $35 million of lower equity earnings, primarily due to higher depreciation expense, interest expense, O&M and lower revenue from decreased consumption, partially offset by higher revenues from rate updates and customer growth.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, $56 million of lower earnings, driven by the sale of a minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure, more than offset by $71 million of higher earnings, primarily from the transportation business in Mexico, asset optimization and higher LNG diversion fees, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefit.\nAnd other items at Sempra parent, which includes $36 million of lower costs, primarily driven by return on investments, supporting certain nonqualified benefit plans and higher income tax benefits, partially offset by higher net interest expense.\nPlease turn to the next slide. We have a clear strategy to build leading T&D infrastructure businesses in some of the most attractive markets in North America. And we have demonstrated a consistent ability to identify and deploy capital into attractive regulated and long-term contracted businesses. We have also taken concerted steps to simplify our business model into three growth platforms.\nAnd this has improved our capital discipline and allowed us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders over short- and long-term investment periods. Now with our updated capital plan and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, paired with disciplined financial and operational execution, we believe we're well positioned to continue delivering an attractive dividend and compelling earnings per share growth.\nPlease turn to the next slide. On our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we outlined our commitment to resolving some key outstanding items. And in just 2 months, we've delivered on those priorities, including: Oncor receiving a constructive base rate review, supporting our view that Texas continues to be a very strong regulatory environment; taking FID and beginning construction at our LNG development project at Port Arthur, which sets the stage for additional growth at Sempra Infrastructure; announcing a record 5-year capital plan at Sempra of $40 billion, anchored by Oncor's new $19 billion capital plan; and issuing our 2024 EPS guidance range.\nAs we look ahead, we continue to prioritize creating value for our shareholders while supporting our customers. To deliver on this commitment, we're focused on the following: receiving a constructive outcome on our ongoing rate cases in California by the middle of next year, which will pave the way for the next 4 years of expanded investments in safety, reliability and sustainability; executing on our strategy of building modern energy networks underpinned by our new record 5-year capital plan; and continuing to capture incremental capital opportunities at Sempra Infrastructure from our growing development pipeline of LNG and other large-scale infrastructure projects.\nAs I've talked about this before, delivering in these areas provides enhanced visibility to future growth and, coupled with our strong position in highly attractive markets, gives us confidence in our ability to create meaningful value for our shareholders through the end of this decade.\nWith that, this concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now stop and open the line to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Sempra's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under our Events and Presentations section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Sedgwick, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Group President, Sempra California; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Justin Bird, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Earnings per common share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.\nWe also encourage you to review our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please note that all share and per share amounts reflect the 2-for-1 split of our common in the form of a 100% stock dividend that we announced in the second quarter call and distributed in August.\nI'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, February 27, 2024, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please Slide 5, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the last several months, we spent time with investors and the research community soliciting feedback on ways to make today's call more informative. In response to your feedback, we'll be providing more information today from more executives. I'll start off by summarizing our recent business accomplishments and our corporate strategy and will be followed by the leaders of each of our business platforms who will likewise summarize their accomplishments business model and expected capital deployment. Karen will close out today's presentation with a review of our Q4 and full year financial results and outline our new 2024 to 2028 capital plan. We'll also be sure to save time at the end to take your questions.\nNow turning to '23. It was a strong year of operating and financial performance for our company and in large measures a credit to our corporate strategy and our success in simplifying our business model. At Sempra, we're focused on making disciplined investments in large and growing economic markets that are looking to modernize their energy networks and connect communities to safer, more reliable and cleaner energy. Over the last 5 years, this strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of customers and shareholders. As we previewed on our third quarter call in November, I'm excited to announce that our capital plan has increased by 20% to a new company record of $48 billion with more than 90% allocated to regulated transmission and distribution investments. Trevor, Allen and Justin will go into more detail later in today's presentation. but the overall scope and size of our capital plan really speaks to the robust markets we operate in and the magnitude of growth opportunities that are in front of our company.\nTurning to our 2023 financial results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $4.61 exceeding the high end of our guidance and providing support to narrow our full year 2024 EPS guidance range to $4.60 to $4.90. This morning, we're also announcing full year 2025 EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.25, which represents approximately 7% growth from the midpoint of the prior guidance range. Based upon the continued growth we're seeing across our 3 T&D growth platforms, we're affirming our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. Finally, we're also pleased to announce the Board of Directors approved increasing our dividend for the 14th consecutive year to $2.48 per share. Please turn to the next slide.\nFor the past several years, the United States has experienced significant economic uncertainty due to higher inflation, supplying disruptions and higher interest rates. Against this backdrop, Sempra delivered strong financial performance in 2023 with record adjusted earnings and record adjusted earnings per share. Also, over the last several years, our investment strategy has consistently prioritized making investments in energy networks in California and Texas, and this has allowed us to grow our rate base in those markets at the end of 2023 and to just over $50 billion. Looking forward, 1 of the primary benefits of rolling out an expanded capital plan is that it provides unique visibility to the strength of our long-term earnings growth. Also, it's important to note that our equity offering last November was successful in mitigating future equity needs associated with our new plan.\nOn the regulatory front, we've made several advances highlighting the constructive nature of the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work effectively with key stakeholders. In California, the cost of capital mechanism triggered. As a result, SDG&E and SoCalGas increased their authorized ROEs last month. We also reached a proposed settlement with certain intervenors for a portion of our pending rate cases, which we view constructively.\nTurning to Texas. Oncor successfully completed its base rate review last spring, Also, several important pieces of legislation were passed that support new investments in transmission and distribution that benefit customers and the continued growth of the state's economy. Also at Sempra Infrastructure, we declared positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, secured financing and began construction. We continue to make steady progress on our development projects. While the pause on non-FTE export permits has impacted the sector, we're confident in the commercial value of our projects, and we'll continue to develop these critical infrastructure assets on a reasonable time in. Justin will address this topic further in his section. Please turn to the next slide.\nSempra is building critical new infrastructure designed to support economic and population growth while providing attractive financial returns to our owners. Through 2050, global GDP is expected to more than double, much of which will come from emerging economies, driving the need for incremental energy resources. Going forward, we strongly believe renewables, natural gas and cleaner molecules will be critical in meeting rising energy demand as we transition to an energy future with lower carbon intensity.\nAs an example, United States natural gas production set a record during 2023 for the third consecutive year, fueled by strong domestic demand and record LNG exports all while still achieving lower carbon emissions over the past several decades as renewables and cleaner burning natural gas replace coal as a fuel empower generation. Please turn to the next slide.\nAs we modernize our energy grids, the IEA estimates that $11 trillion are expected to be spent in the North American energy sector through 2050, with over $5 trillion focused on T&D investments. Please turn to the next slide.\nAs we've outlined in the past, we've been disciplined in maintaining our focus on what we believe is the higher value, lower risk portion of the energy value chain. In the T&D segment, we made disciplined investments with the view toward producing high-quality recurring cash flows from regulated utilities and long-term contracted assets that generally grow with inflation. Please turn to the next slide.\nAs you can see here, our strategy, combined with disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to successfully meet or exceed our EPS guidance range for the last 6 years. Over this same time period, our adjusted EPS has compounded annually at approximately 10% since 2018, which is top decile amongst our peers. Please turn to the next slide.\nImproving our corporate strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, and that's been demonstrated by the consistency of our financial performance. It's also noteworthy that we've accomplished this across different market cycles that have included a global pandemic, supply chain shortages, high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical unrest. In short, our disciplined execution has consistently delivered total shareholder returns at levels that are well above our peer group. Please turn to next slide.\nBefore I hand the call to Trevor, I'd like to reiterate our key investment highlights. We own high-quality T&D growth platforms located in California and Texas, some of North America's most attractive economic markets that also benefit from constructive regulation. We exercised a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are excited to launch our new 5-year capital plan of $48 billion. We believe this sets out a clear road map for our future growth and supports our expected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%.\nIn conclusion, we're proud of our recent accomplishments and the growing strength of our business franchise. Across our management team, there's a lot of excitement about the opportunities that are ahead of us. Now please turn to the next slide where Trevor will walk you through the business updates at Sempra, California.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Jeff. Let me start by highlighting the financial results at Sempra California. Earnings for the full year 2023 were $1.75 billion, benefiting from $4.6 billion of capital investments, focused safety, reliability and wildfire mitigation. These investments increased rate base by 11% over 2022. We have long emphasized California's constructive regulatory compact, including forward-looking rate cases, access to the cost of capital mechanism and an established wildfire fund. And this year, we had several positive regulatory outcomes that reinforced our conviction and supports attracting capital to the state.\nAs Jeff mentioned, last fall, the cost of capital mechanism triggered and the CPUC approved increasing our authorized ROE at SDG&E and SoCalGas by 70 basis points. This increase was effective January 1, 2024. In October, we reached settlements for important capital and O&M portions of our rate case requests with certain intervenors. And while these settlements are subject to CPUC approval, we're encouraged by that progress. And we anticipate receiving a proposed decision on our GRC in the quarter. As a reminder, once finalized, rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2024.\nSeparately, in addition to the recently awarded transmission projects by CAISO, SDG&E has advanced their competitive bid for the Imperial Valley to the north of [ Songs ] transmission line and expect an update in late April. We're also extremely proud of the recent recognition of our electric business. SDG&E was again awarded Best in the West for electric reliability for the 18th consecutive year and recognized for their industry leadership in wildfire mitigation predictive modeling technology.\nThe CPUC also recently increased the authorized storage capacity, Aliso Canyon by over 50%. This demonstrates the commission's recognition of the importance of energy infrastructure and the critical role SoCalGas plays supporting reliability and affordability and of both natural gas and electricity in California. And finally, ARCHES, which is one of SoCalGas' strategic partners, was selected to receive DOE funding to help develop a regional hydrogen hub. This is important because Los Angeles is one of the nation's largest manufacturing hubs and cleaner molecules are expected to play a pivotal role in helping hard to electrify sector lower their emissions. Please turn to the next slide.\nNow let's turn to some of the key trends that are supporting growth at Sempra California. We operate in the largest U.S. market, representing nearly 15% of National G. California is also among the top 3 states for job growth, with nearly 1 million jobs created over the past 5 years. We are also well aligned with the state policy that promotes building and economy based on sustainable energy. Earlier this month, the CPUC made further commitments to renewables, mandating the construction of 56 gigawatts of new clean energy by 2035, including over 15 gigawatts of energy storage. California also remains home to the largest source of solar power and the highest penetration rate of electric vehicles of any state in the country. Just in San Diego County, there are now over 140,000 EVs, and that number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years.\nIt is also noteworthy that San Diego County leads the state with 23% of our customers having installed rooftop solar systems. These systems are often accompanied by a battery and as battery storage solutions become more cost effective, the need to reliably integrate these technologies on our network is expected to increase.\nTurning to Los Angeles. The manufacturing sector generates over $80 billion in annual GDP. For customers that require high heat content molecules, RNG and hydrogen will be increasingly important for affordable, reliable and safe operations. When you pair California's economic growth with its ambitious clean energy goals, the need for significant T&D investment is critical to help ensure reliability and affordability. The key takeaway here is that our investment strategy and the rate case filings are closely aligned with public policy and the direction the state is going. Please turn to the next slide.\nSempra California is modernizing the T&D infrastructure necessary to integrate more renewables and clean molecules to serve the growing energy needs of customers while facilitating California's energy transition. As this slide shows, our utilities play a central role in connecting new cleaner sources of energy to a diverse and growing set of customers. We continue to prioritize safety and reliability with a strong focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. We currently have the lowest bills relative to our peers in the state and are in line with the national average. We will always be focused on providing the best possible service while ensuring customer affordability is a top priority. Please turn to the next slide.\nTurning to our 5-year capital plan. We're announcing over $24 billion of investments. On the electric side, we are pursuing safe and reliable infrastructure investments, integrating renewable energy, incorporating battery storage, supporting EV infrastructure and hardening the system against event risks. On our natural gas system, we will continue to modernize our gas network, reduce carbon emissions and make investments in energy infrastructure that support the delivery of cleaner molecules. We expect these investments show our rate base at an approximate 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. We're excited about the growth prospects at Sempra California. And we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to deliver safe and reliable energy in a market with a constructive regulatory environment.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where Alan will discuss Oncor's accomplishments in Texas.\n\nE. Allen Nye\n\nCEO & Director, Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC\n\nThank you, Trevor. Oncor delivered strong financial performance in 2023, deploying $3.8 billion of capital and growing rate base by 12% over the prior year. We were pleased to complete our base rate review at the PUCT and emerge with a constructive outcome, where all prior T&D investments by Oncor were deemed prudent and approved. 2023 also marked one of the most successful Texas legislative sessions for our industry in recent history. Several bills that were passed during the 88th Texas legislative session demonstrates the state's commitment to supporting a safer, smarter, more resilient and more reliable electric grid to power continued growth across the state. Oncor has historically worked closely with the Texas legislature and as many stakeholders to achieve productive outcomes. But this session in particular, was incredibly constructive.\nFirst, the legislature increased our allowed distribution cost recovery tracker filings to twice a year reducing Oncor's regulatory lag on critical investments. Additionally, the legislature passed HB 2555, which encourages utilities to make their systems more resilient, and provides expedited recovery for approved capital and O&M expenditures. The PUCT finalized rules to implement HB 2555 last month. We expect to file our first system resiliency plan or SRP, within the next several months. The PUCT has allowed 6 months to review the SRP and if approved, we would expect to begin implementation by year-end.\nDistribution capital approved in the SRP will be recovered through our DCRF tracker filings. Regulatory lag that normally accrues between the time of in-service and the implementation of rates will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be recovered in our next DCRF. Similarly, O&M expense approved as part of the SRP will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be included for recovery and a subsequent DCRF. Use of this new mechanism should reduce the regulatory lag normally associated with these types of expenditures. We look forward to using the capital and O&M that gets approved under our SRP plan to improve the resiliency of our system, harden the system against storms, extreme weather and wildfire risk and generally improve our customers' experience, while at the same time, improving recovery of the expenditures.\nFrom an operational perspective, Oncor continue to execute at a high level. In 2023, we built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 3,200 miles of T&D lines, while also increasing the number of premises we serve by 73,000. In West Texas alone, we built, rebuilt or upgraded over 650 miles of T&D lines and 8 new switching and substations. The Texas grid performed very well through record demand peaks over the last 12 months.\nOncor's reliability performance as measured by our nonstorm [ SADI ] score, improved by approximately 7% in 2023 compared to the previous year. Finally, in 2023, we set company records for active transmission interconnection requests, and new transmission interconnection requests in the queue. Active generation and retail interconnection requests increased 25% year-over-year. New interconnection requests increased 19% year-over-year. Please turn to the next slide.\nThese interconnection requests are driven by the dynamic economic growth that we continue to see in Texas. The Texas Miracle continues and is demonstrated by the continued strong growth both in population and diverse commercial and industrial businesses moving to the state. Oncor serves some of the country's fastest-growing metro areas, including 4 of the 15 fastest-growing cities. From a sheer scale perspective, Texas GDP is second only to California and continues to grow at a robust pace, growing at approximately 8% during the third quarter. Faster than the nation as a whole for the fifth quarter in a row. Texas continues to see electric vehicle penetration as well. Over a recent 12-month period, the DFW Metroplex had the largest increase in EV registrations out of any major metro area in Texas with 63% growth. Please turn to the next slide.\nOncor has also seen significant growth in commercial and industrial customers, representing electric loads that are larger than traditional commercial projects. Data center development continues to be robust across our service territory, including new sites that have the potential to support hyperscale computing and generative artificial intelligence services. These projects represent the potential for thousands of megawatts of new electric load often hundreds of megawatts for just 1 project.\nSimilarly, electrification of the oil and gas industry in West Texas continues at an impressive pace. A Permian Basin reliability plan update published by ERCOT earlier this month projects that within 15 years, total demand in West Texas could increase fourfold from its current 6.5 gigawatts to 26 gigawatts. This growth is expected to support oil and gas production as well as general electrification. Oncor will be at the forefront and expanding our system to meet the requirements of these customers.\nFinally, as the population continues to expand both organically and from relocations, we still expect total premise growth to continue at approximately 2% annually. Each of these developments creates new opportunities to expand the Oncor Energy system. We are positioning ourselves to meet these demands through hiring, supply chain procurement and system planning and looking forward to continuing to serve our customers in the ERCOT market. Please turn to the next slide.\nOn Sempra's Q3 call, we discussed this growth and announced our intention to increase our capital plan. We are pleased to announce that Oncor's 5-year capital plan for 2024 through 2028 is projected to be $24.2 billion which is a 26% increase over our previous 5-year capital plan of $19.2 billion. The vast majority of this capital plan is to serve customer growth, although the maintenance needs of our system continue to grow steadily well. This plan does not include the amount of capital expenditures that we expect to request in the upcoming SRP filing that I mentioned earlier. We expect to file that plan in the first half of this year, and the proposed spin will be subject to PUCT review and approval.\nWith today's updated plan, we anticipate Oncor's rate base to grow at an annual average rate of 11% from 2023 to 2028. While historically, our earnings growth rate fell below our rate base growth due to regulatory lag. The -- of enhanced recovery mechanisms arising from the legislative session should move our long-term earnings growth rate closer to our rate base growth rate.\nPlease turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call to Justin to update you on Sempra Infrastructure.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nPresident, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThanks, Allen. We're also excited about the opportunities in Texas. Sempra Infrastructure is advancing the approximately $13 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project in Texas. This investment, along with Oncor's capital plan, certainly makes Sempra among the largest investors in the state. At Sempra Infrastructure, we're advancing construction on 5 projects, all of which are on time and on budget. And our strategy differentiates us from others in the space. We have a dual coast LNG export strategy, a robust energy network portfolio and power transmission infrastructure to move more renewable power across the border, all with the goal of delivering cleaner molecules and cleaner electrons to our customers and partners.\nWe've achieved several noteworthy milestones in 2023, declaring positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase I was a major success, and we secured all required project level debt and equity contributions. Financially, we executed well relative to 2022's strong results, our ability to maintain momentum through 2023 and is another indication of our attainable business model. Sempra Infrastructure's 2023 adjusted earnings were $764 million. I'd also like to specifically call out the progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 as it approaches its summer 2025 COD. We are excited to bring one of the first North American Pacific Coast export projects to market.\nAt ECA LNG Phase 1, we've now exceeded 700 cargoes since production began in May of 2019, and we couldn't be more pleased with the high-quality operations from this critical infrastructure asset. On the development growth pipeline, our priorities remain focused on advancing commercial discussions for offtake volume and equity ownership at Port Arthur Phase 2 and assessing Cameron LNG Phase 2 EPC opportunities. At Cameron LNG Phase 2, we've been working with Bechtel on value engineering. And at this stage, we feel it's best to continue those efforts while evaluating other potential EPC contractors. We're continuing to work closely with Bechtel on Port Arthur Phase 1 and potentially Phase 2, but we and the Cameron partners want to take some additional time to help ensure a cost-effective build plan. and conduct additional value engineering and analysis to improve the overall value of the project to our customers.\nAt Port Arthur LNG Phase II, we received FERC approval in September. And earlier this month, FERC staff issued an environmental assessment finding no adverse impact as a result of the Port Arthur Louisiana Connector pipeline amendment. I also want to mention that we continue to make significant progress toward an FID on [ Cimarron ] Wind. Recall, this is a 300-megawatt wind project located near our existing ESJ and ESJ 2 wind projects that would directly interconnect with the California market.\nFinally, I wanted to highlight a hydrogen hub project, we are participating in called High Velocity that is expected to receive $1.2 billion from DOE funding to pursue development. We are also actively engaged with a group of Japanese utilities on a collaboration to produce e-natural gas using renewable hydrogen and CO2 as inputs. Projects like these demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's innovative entrepreneurial culture as we seek opportunities to provide cleaner and more secure energy for customers. Please turn to the next slide.\nTurning to macro trends impacting Sempra Infrastructure. Global energy demand continues to increase. On sustainability, Sempra Infrastructure plays a critical role in providing cleaner alternative solutions to head carbon fuels like coal and oil, natural gas and particularly LNG, can effectively replace less sustainable energy sources today. In fact, industry sources estimate that global LNG demand, in particular, will grow approximately 50% by 2045. There is an additional tailwind associated with emerging market growth as their share of global GDP increases relative to advancing economies. This drives overall energy consumption because developing economies tend to be more energy intensive as they modernize and improve quality of life. Sempra Infrastructure also develops renewables and associated infrastructure that provide cleaner sources of energy and contribute to a broader decarbonization efforts in North America.\nThe final macro driver is the need for energy security, energy dense, reliable and affordable energy is a key ingredient to building advanced economies. The key question is where that incremental energy production will be sourced. Recently, the DOE announced a pause on granting non-FDA LNG export permits to reevaluate the impact granting these permits would have on domestic energy costs and to consider whether climate factors impact the public interest. LNG's climate role is important which is why even before the regulatory development, we started work on several initiatives designed to minimize our environmental impact and help reduce emissions across our portfolio.\nOne example being the conversion of e-Drives at Cameron LNG Phase 2. We're also developing carbon capture and sequestration infrastructure associated with our LNG projects. Long term, we are confident in the commercial, economic and environmental value of our export facilities, and we'll continue to work hard on behalf of our customers and investors to advance these projects. With that said, this permitting pause only applies to projects that haven't yet received their non-FDA export permits, such as Port Arthur Phase 2. This pause does not impact on any of our assets in operation or under construction. As a reminder, Cameron Train 4 has a non-FDA export permit and the DOE stated in hearings earlier this month that the pause would not impact in service date extension requests for projects with existing permits.\nPer Sempra's planning and development projects such as Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2 have not reached FID and are not included in our capital plan or guidance. So any potential delay would not impact our current earnings growth visibility or our existing capital plan. We can't speculate on the ultimate outcome of this policy but we'd like to reiterate the compelling environmental value proposition that natural gas and LNG provide. The United States has decreased carbon emissions 17% below 2005 levels despite increasing GDP by more than double in that time. A major reason for that progress is natural gas replacing coal and energy production. We believe a lasting policy of limiting LNG exports would unfortunately hurt the global climate interests because prospective buyers could be forced to rely on more carbon-intensive fuels, including coal and fuel oil.\nWe remain as enthusiastic as ever about the merits of our LNG projects as well as our ability to appropriately navigate the regulatory landscape to advance each one. Further, we are optimistic that normal permitting conditions will resume after all relevant variables have been carefully evaluated by the administration. Please turn to the next slide.\nOn this slide, we highlight some key projects under construction in the Pacific and Gulf Coast. These projects strengthen our competitive advantage as a strategically located supplier to both Asia and Europe. The beauty of greenfield development is that it unlocks highly compelling brownfield expansion opportunities. We have begun procurement and engineering activities at Port Arthur, Louisiana pipeline. A pipeline connecting Port Arthur LNG to [ feed gas and gulf ].\nWe've also begun procurement and engineering at Louisiana storage, a salt dome natural gas storage facility. These assets will contribute to the larger Port Arthur Energy Hub and demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's expertise in developing comprehensive energy projects. Meanwhile, construction across the Sempra Infrastructure platforms continues to progress well. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, the next milestone will be to structural steel. At ECA LNG Phase 1, we are targeting 90% completion of structural steel. And at the GRO expansion, we have initiated construction and are targeting completion of the construction of the [ Mexicali ] segment later this year. To reiterate, Sempra Infrastructure is playing a key role in securing energy needs and contributing to decarbonization efforts for customers around the globe. Please turn to the next slide.\nLooking further out, we are developing an enviable portfolio of projects, and this slide showcases some of our more significant pursuits. For a full list of development assets, please refer to the appendix. I would also note that a number of these projects are brownfield investment opportunities made possible by our initial greenfield investments at Cameron and Port Arthur. Please turn to the next slide.\nTo conclude, we have $4.4 billion of capital deployment opportunities anchored on providing our long-term customers with cleaner and secure energy. And as a reminder, this number only includes projects which have reached a positive FID. Major 2024 investment allocations are slotted for the Port Arthur Energy Hub as Phase 1 construction progresses ECA [ LNG ] Phase 1, as we closed in on COD, the GRO pipeline expansion project and the Louisiana storage development.\nNow please turn to the next slide, and let me turn it over to Karen, who will take us through the financial update.\n\nKaren L. Sedgwick\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Justin. I'm excited to share our year-end results and give you more details on our financial plan. Earlier today, Sempra reports fourth quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $737 million or $1.16 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $0.69 per share. On a [ non-GAAP ] basis, fourth quarter 2023 earnings were $719 million or $1.13 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings of $743 million or $1.17 per share. Full year 2023 GAAP earnings were $3.30 billion, or $4.79 per share. This compares to 2022 GAAP earnings of $2.94 billion or $3.31 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, Full year 2023 earnings were [ $2.920 ] billion or $4.61 per share. This compares to our previous full year 2022 adjusted earnings of [ $2.95 ] billion or $4.61 per share. This year's results demonstrate the combined strength of our 3 growth performs and sets us up for improved growth in 2024. Please turn to the next slide.\nNow I will summarize the variance of full year 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period for last year. At Sempra, California, we had $69 million of higher net interest expense, partially offset by net tax benefits, offset by $51 million of higher electric transmission and CPUC-based operating margin and $52 million of higher regulatory interest income and regulatory awards. At Sempra Texas, we had $2 million of higher equity earnings attributable to increased invested capital, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. I'd note that earnings in 2022 and 2023 were impacted by the lack of capital trackers that can't be filed during the rate case.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, we had $85 million of higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. $10 million of higher taxes, partially offset by lower interest expense given increased capitalized interest, offset by $49 million of higher transportation tariffs, higher asset supply optimization, partially offset by lower equity earnings from Cameron LNG.\nFor Port Arthur, while our ownership stake is approximately 20%, we consolidate the project accounting purposes. thus capitalizing interest based on the projects in progress construction. As construction advances, you're seeing the impact of higher capitalized interest versus previous years. Ultimately, these capitalized costs will be amortized back as higher depreciation after the plant moves into commercial operations. At Sempra Parent, there were $15 million of higher investment gains, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits. Turn to the next slide.\nTurning to new investments. As Jeff noted earlier, we're announcing a company record $48 billion capital plan with over 90% of the planned investment allocated to our regulated utilities. This represents an impressive 20% increase over the previous plan and will ultimately serve as the foundation for our company's growth over the coming years. About $24.1 billion, roughly half of the capital plan is marked for investment at Sempra California's 2 utilities, which together have a weighted average ROE of approximately 10.5%.\nAt Sempra Texas, $19.5 billion includes our proportionate share of [ One's ] planned CapEx, where recent legislative development should help Oncor reduce regulatory lag and improve its ability to help lessen the gap between authorized and actual rates of return. The remaining $4.4 billion are primarily associated with Sempra Infrastructure's LNG projects under construction and their associated infrastructure. Please turn to the next slide.\nWith this record capital plan, I would like to illustrate some of the key sources and uses. As you know, Sempra raised equity in November 2023 and to support our future investment needs to mitigate the financing risk associated with the capital plan. As a result, we are in a strong financial position and anticipate our reliable internal operating cash flows and regulatory authorized debt will provide the vast majority of our financing needs. We are a growing business, we'll maintain balance sheet strength, all of which delivering attractive total shareholder returns over the long term. Along those lines, Sempra will continue to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio, providing plenty of reinvestment flexibility. Please turn to the next slide.\nMoving to the utilities. Our strong earnings trajectory is underpinned by long-term rate base growth. California and Texas rate base is expected to grow at 7% and 11%, respectively, from 2023 to 2028. Our rate base is split approximately evenly between California and Texas, where we benefit from constructive regulatory jurisdictions and strong macroeconomic growth. On a combined basis, we anticipate just over 9% annual growth through 2028, and this gives us added confidence in our projected 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth rate. Please turn to the next slide.\nGiven the strength of our 2023 results, we've narrowed our 2024 earnings guidance estimates and are now projecting EPS guidance for the year, ranging from $4.60 to $4.90. Also, we're announcing 2025 earned per share guidance with a range of $4.90 to $5.25. This equates to a projected EPS midpoint is about 7% higher than 2024 guidance. Now let's break down a few of the assumptions embedded in these figures.\nAt Sempra, California, this already includes the cost of capital trigger. As for the GRC, we're assuming outcomes that are in the range of historical rate case decisions, and continue to work constructively with the CPUC and interveners through the proceeding to achieve an outcome that allows us to continue to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable energy for our customers.\nTurning to Texas. We said in the prior call, the guidance took into effect Oncor's second DCRF. Subject to PUCT approval, the system resiliency plan will apply to 2025 through 2027. And due to timing differences between filing and construction of projects, we'd expect minimal financial impact in 2025.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, there are a few things to highlight. 2022 and 2023 benefited from an attractive commodity price environment. And in 2023, we received the cumulative benefit of new tariffs on select Mexico pipeline. Due to the conservative nature of our project development process, we secured rights on the gas pipeline connecting ECA well in advance of COD. This allowed us to better optimize results during this period, but we would expect this impact to moderate as we go forward, particularly with the lower forward curve for natural gas.\nAnd now with the magnitude of large projects currently under construction, we have better visibility to certain noncapitalized costs that have now been added to our 2024 plan. And we have ECA LNG Phase I, expected come online in the summer of '25, with full year operations expected in 2026.\nAnd finally, regarding the share count. The main driver of the increase is our recent equity offering. As we've discussed, the green shoe of just over 2 million shares settled immediately in November of 2023. Over the course of this year, we're assuming weighted average diluted shares will increase by $4 million, which reflects the dividend reinvestment program equity-based plans and the drawdown of our forward settlement, which we now assume will occur in the second half of 2024. About 2025 reflects those shares outstanding for the interior year, increasing our share count to approximately 654 million shares. Please turn to the next slide.\nIn addition to our new 5-year plan, we've added this slide in an effort to be more responsive to input from our many investors. Here, it shows the various categories of investments that we're tracking or developing that fall outside of our current plan. It totals over $10 billion, and many of these opportunities could form part of our future capital campaign. Please turn to the next slide.\nYou've heard this from our other executives today, but it is important to note that we're excited by the investment opportunities in front of us. We are owners and operators of top [ TV ] utility platforms located in North America as the largest economies. Moreover, our utilities benefit from constructive regulation that support significant investment and help ensure safe, reliable, resilient and increasingly sustainable energy for our customers. Over time, our key priorities remain largely the same. We will invest in our high-quality T&D energy infrastructure to improve customer service, maintain a prudent balance sheet and provide compelling returns to shareholders. A record $48 billion capital plan focused on our regulated utilities will be the primary foundation for our increasing rate base, growth in earnings power and gives us confidence in achieving our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%.\nWe thank you for joining us. We continue to build North America's premier energy infrastructure company. And we're as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to continue delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last month, and I'll be out on the road with the IR team in March. And hope to connect with those of you I haven't had a chance to meet yet.\nWith that, I'd now like to open the call for some of your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVP of IR, Sempra\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nI'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, February 28, 2023, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased with our accomplishments in 2022 and in large measure, it gives us added confidence in our future performance. In 2023, we'll be celebrating our 25th anniversary and across our management team, we're pursuing future opportunities with a lot of optimism.\nFor purposes of today's call, I'll provide summary comments on our performance, recap our business strategy and frame our success in terms of our accomplishments over the last half decade. Then Trevor and Justin will review our business and financial accomplishments in greater detail, and we'll reserve time for your questions.\nLet me start with Sempra Infrastructure. In 2022, the United States reached an important milestone as an energy exporter. It was the first year that our country became the top exporter of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, while also leading the LNG industry and new offtake contracts that support future development. This supports our view that U.S. LNG exports will more than double by the end of the decade. At Sempra Infrastructure, we built an exciting backlog of LNG development projects that are expected to support that forecasted growth.\nAs one example, Sempra Infrastructure signed more long-term SPAs and HOAs for LNG offtake in the fourth quarter of 2022 than any other market participant. In part, this has allowed us to stay on track in meeting our goal of taking a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 before the end of the quarter. Outside of our LNG business, we see the continued need to expand and modernize North America's energy networks particularly in California and Texas. There is a common opportunity set in front of each of our business platforms focused on investments in modern energy infrastructure that accelerate electrification and the transition to cleaner fuels.\nWe expect significant opportunities for investment across all 3 growth platforms and are affirming our full year 2023 and EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20. Additionally, on the basis of this future opportunity set, we're reiterating our long-term forecast of a 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate. Consistent with our past practice, our long-term forecast uses the midpoint of current year guidance and is anchored by strong projected rate base growth at our California and Texas utilities. Given Oncor's ongoing rate case, I also want to note that we plan to share an updated 5-year capital plan as well as our EPS guidance range for 2024 on our first quarter earnings call.\nPlease turn to the next slide. At Sempra, our high-performance culture, one that is centered around safety and operational excellence is the foundation for delivering on our mission to build a premier North American energy infrastructure company. Our corporate strategy guides our business activities and continues to be validated by the strength of our overall financial performance.\nIn recent years, we've grown the business, strengthened the balance sheet, delivered an attractive dividend and meaningfully increased our rate base, which continues to be a principal driver in our future growth. Looking ahead, our team is excited about the future in part is because we expect our culture and commitment to excellence will continue creating value through the end of the decade as we extend our position as a leader in the markets we serve and continue to invest in our employees.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Since 2017, we've executed on our strategy to simplify our business model, build our leadership position in some of the largest economic markets in North America and improve our financial performance. We've streamlined our portfolio, exited non-core businesses and extended our regulated utility footprint into Texas by acquiring an ownership stake in Oncor and InfraREIT. Through this strategic repositioning, we've been successful in creating greater scale across our franchise and new growth opportunities.\nTo add context around our financial accomplishments since 2017, we have doubled our adjusted earnings, significantly exceeded a compound annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, increased our combined utility rate base in California and Texas by 300%, all while supporting our balance sheet and maintaining a balanced 50-50 capital structure. It's also important to note that our commitment to this more simplified business strategy has resulted in a strengthened market position, improved business mix, enhanced quality of cash flows and perhaps, most importantly, improved visibility to future growth.\nToday, in many ways, it is pride in our past that gives us confidence in our future is from Sempra's rich tradition of serving others that we understand our role in society and how we can best meet the expectations of a growing list of stakeholders. While much has changed over the last quarter century, our vision, delivering energy with purpose has remained constant as we embrace each new challenge as an opportunity to create innovative forward-looking solutions. To be clear, this is an important time for our company. At Sempra, we understand that modern energy infrastructure is a great enabler of prosperity, health and well-being for billions of people around the world.\nThat is why Sempra is pursuing the dual opportunities of advancing decarbonization and helping to deliver energy security globally, all while improving the resiliency of how we deliver energy in our core markets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Trevor to discuss business and financial updates.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Jeff. What we would like to do is update you on 3 things: First, I'll provide business updates on Sempra California and Sempra Texas then Justin will discuss Sempra Infrastructure, including notable progress on our LNG export projects, and then I'll wrap up with a review of our financial results.\nLet me start with Sempra California. Community safety is a core tenet of our culture, and I'm proud to highlight that in 2022, SDG&E completed the hardening of 100% of its Tier 3 high-fire threat district transmission infrastructure. This has been a long journey that reflects the dedicated efforts of our employees, extending across more than a decade and have significantly improved community safety. In November, SDG&E received a final decision from the CPUC maintaining its 2022 cost of capital rates of return. In December, SDG&E and SoCalGas received a final decision authorizing the 2023 cost of capital, which preserved both companies' equity layers at 52% and updated SDG&E's and SoCalGas' ROE to 9.95% and 9.8%, respectively, through 2025.\nLast year, we announced the Angeles Link hydrogen proposal. In December, SoCalGas received CPUC approval to establish a memorandum account that allows the company to track the costs of performing Phase 1 feasibility studies. This is an important milestone in evaluating new opportunities to advance California's decarbonization goals. Moreover, the CPUC directed SoCalGas to include this as part of California's application to the U.S. Department of Energy for Hydrogen Hub federal funding. SoCalGas believes Angeles Link has the potential to serve a significant strategic role in supporting the build-out of a full scale Hydrogen Hub and the transition to a green hydrogen economy in Southern California.\nAs proposed, this would be one of the largest hydrogen infrastructure hubs in the U.S. and would support the decarbonization of hard-to-electrify sectors in the greater Los Angeles region, which is one of the largest manufacturing areas in the country. Also, SDG&E and SoCalGas are working closely with their customers and regulators to help mitigate the impacts of unusually high winter prices for natural gas, which has been a challenge all across the western region of the country.\nFrom the state of Washington to Wyoming and Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and California, the Western region experienced a difficult price environment. Fortunately, natural gas prices across the country have dropped more than 65% since December. And here in Southern California, our utilities have also seen price declines in recent weeks and expect that trend to continue. Some materials from a recent CPUC En Banc as well as a summary of the programs that SDG&E and SoCalGas have in place to support their customers, are included in the appendix of today's presentation.\nFinally, the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&E and SoCalGas established the foundation for meeting the future needs of our customers. It is also important to note that our filings are well aligned with the state's clean energy, safety and reliability goals, and we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with retroactive treatment to the beginning of the year.\nMoving to Sempra Texas. I'm happy to report that Oncor achieved strong employee safety results in 2022, which is a testament to the high-performing culture and operational excellence at our Texas platform. In fact, in a year marked by extreme weather, Oncor had a nearly 5% improvement in its SAIDI reliability score. On the transmission side, Oncor set another company record with 280 new annual interconnection requests in 2022, which is a 30% increase compared to 2021. To put this into context, 2021 was also a record year for the company, which as you think about it, further underscores the scale of growth that continues to come on Oncor system.\nIn 2022, Oncor built or hardened nearly 2,000 miles of T&D lines across its service territory and connected over 2,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation to the grid. By the end of 2022, cumulative connections to Oncor system totaled over 18,000 megawatts of wind and solar generation, representing nearly 40% of ERCOT's total wind and solar resources. The momentum of transmission and distribution growth this year was driven by continued high demand for renewables and strong demographic and premise growth across Oncor service territory.\nOncor's rate case is on the PUCT open meeting agenda for March 9, and we expect a final order to be voted out in the next 4 to 6 weeks. Oncor has a track record of working constructively with the regulators for the benefit of its customers and to advance the key public policy priorities of the state.\nIn part, these considerations support our view that Oncor will receive a constructive rate case outcome. Since the public proceedings are ongoing, Oncor has not unveiled their new capital plan. In conjunction with its final rate case, Oncor expects to review an updated capital plan with its Board. Afterwards, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to publish our updated 5-year capital plan, which will most likely occur on our first quarter earnings call. I'll turn it over to Justin to provide updates for Sempra Infrastructure and progress on development at Port Arthur Phase 1 and Cameron LNG Phase 2.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nCEO, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThanks, Trevor. I'm excited about Sempra Infrastructure's recent accomplishments and want to highlight some of our key achievements. Sempra Infrastructure has seen a solid year of commercial activity with robust LNG, cross-border renewables and pipeline infrastructure demand, creating a foundation for future growth.\nDuring the year, Sempra Infrastructure brought assets online within its Clean Power and Energy Networks businesses, while operations at its Cameron LNG Phase 1 terminal exceeded production targets. On the Pacific Coast, we continue to expect ECA LNG Phase 1 commercial operations to commence in the summer of 2025. Also, both ECA LNG Phase 2 and Vista Pacifico LNG received DOE approvals to re-export U.S.-sourced natural gas from Mexico in the form of LNG to non-free trade agreement countries.\nPlease turn to the next slide. As you all know, we continue to advance our strategy of building out a dual market platform that allows us to efficiently deliver LNG to customers in the Atlantic and Pacific regions. To that end, I'm excited to say we've completed the marketing phase for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. We have carefully structured this development project to reduce risk by fully contracting the long-term offtake securing a fixed price EPC and identifying world-class development partners.\nIn November 2022, we announced the execution of definitive agreements with ConocoPhillips, pursuant to which they would acquire a 30% ownership interest in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and take 5 Mtpa of offtake from the project. In January, we announced that Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was fully subscribed at 10.5 Mtpa of definitive long-term take-or-pay contracts with world-class counterparties. We also have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract with arguably the most experienced LNG EPC provider in the U.S., Bechtel.\nWith the completion of marketing and execution of the EPC contract, we're now focused on finalizing the project level debt and equity financing. On the basis of the current financing efforts that are underway, we aim to efficiently raise lower-cost capital and protect Sempra Infrastructure's investment-grade balance sheet. We are targeting Sempra Infrastructure Partners' ownership in the project of between 20% and 30% with ConocoPhillips owning 30% and the balance being sold in the form of a noncontrolling interest to one or more investors.\nThis is an exciting project. In this initial phase, we're aiming to generate equity returns in the mid-teens while preserving Sempra Infrastructure's investment grade rating and reducing our equity contributions to the project. As we approach FID, we continue to focus on striking the right balance of efficient financing, risk mitigation and retention of upside from future project cash flows and earnings.\nOver the past decade, we've successfully built LNG export and other large infrastructure facilities, demonstrating our deep development expertise and capabilities to build world-class infrastructure. I believe this experience serves us well as we aim to bring Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 to FID through construction and ultimately to commercial operations as we execute on our goal of delivering cleaner, more secure U.S. natural gas to global markets.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Turning to Cameron LNG Phase 2. As a reminder, this project is also competitively positioned on the Gulf Coast to export LNG to Europe and Asia. And given that as a brownfield facility, it has a distinct advantage to produce competitively priced LNG. The expansion project remains on track as we advance our key work streams. We outlined last year that our activities are focused primarily on completing the FERC amendment, advancing marketing efforts with the goal of securing long-term offtake agreements and completing the competitive feed process.\nOn the regulatory front, the FERC commitment process that supports the transition from gas turbines to electric drives is progressing well. We received the environmental assessment from FERC citing no adverse impact, which is a positive step toward securing the final authorizations.\nTurning to marketing. 100% of the expected offtake is subscribed under HOAs. Our existing partners will take their 50% of production and SI's 50% of volumes is already subscribed under existing HOAs on a back-to-back basis.\nNext, on engineering, as we have talked about in the past, we're running a competitive feed process between Bechtel and a JGC-Zachary joint venture. This process is on track to be completed in the summer of this year, and we would expect to make a final investment decision shortly thereafter.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $604 million or $1.90 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2022 earnings were $743 million or $2.35 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings of $688 million or $2.16 per share.\nFull year 2022 GAAP earnings were $2.94 billion or $6.62 per share. This compares to 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.254 billion or $4.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2022 earnings were $2.915 billion or $9.21 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full year 2021 adjusted earnings of $2.637 billion or $8.43 per share.\nAs a reminder, 2022 includes the minority interest sale of Sempra Infrastructure to ADIA that closed in June of 2022. Even after considering this minority interest sale, our strong performance and growing adjusted earnings demonstrate our ability to generate value for our shareholders while providing safe and reliable service to our customers.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The variance in full year 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following: at Sempra California, $161 million of higher earnings from higher CPUC base operating margin, net of higher operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas and $46 million of higher flow-through items related to repairs deduction allowances and self-developed software and other items recorded as a reduction to income tax at SDG&E, partially offset by $52 million of higher net interest expense primarily due to higher debt balances at SDG&E and SoCalGas.\nAt Sempra Texas Utilities, $120 million of higher equity earnings primarily due to rate updates at Oncor to reflect increases in invested capital, higher consumption and customer growth. And at Sempra Infrastructure, $160 million of higher earnings driven by excess production at Cameron LNG Phase 1 and strong production from existing energy networks and clean power assets as well as new assets placed into service and $110 million of higher income tax benefits, partially offset by $250 million of lower earnings driven by the sale of our minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure.\nPlease turn to the next slide. As we near the end of our prepared remarks today, I'd like to take this opportunity to bring this all together and highlight Sempra's investment proposition. We've built a high-performing energy infrastructure company that is well positioned in some of North America's most attractive markets. We're focused on strategically deploying capital in what we believe is within the higher-value, lower-risk portion of the energy value chain and provides significant visibility to growth and shareholder value. At our utilities, this year, we will continue to be focused on advancing our rate cases, which center around making the needed investments to further safety, reliability and decarbonization to serve customers.\nFor Sempra Infrastructure, we're nearing FID for a large-scale LNG project in Texas, dedicated to helping provide energy security to our country's allies and directly supporting the energy transition. With that said, at Sempra, there are a number of open items to be completed this spring, including finalizing the Oncor base rate case and taking FID on Port Arthur Phase 1. That is why, as mentioned earlier, we plan to update our 5-year capital plan on our first quarter earnings call in May and also expect to issue our EPS guidance for 2024 at that time. Our work today gives us confidence in our ability to continue the build-out of one of the largest and most competitive energy networks in North America.\nBy advancing our position as a leader in technology and innovation, we are better positioned to serve customers and create value for our shareholders. That's why today, we're announcing the approval by our Board of Directors of a quarterly dividend of $1.19 per common share, a projected annualized dividend of $4.76. We look forward to continuing our commitment to creating and returning value to our owners by building the energy networks of the future. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now stop and open the line to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVP of IR, Sempra\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nEarnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\nI'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, November 3, 2022, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. At Sempra, we're on a mission to build one of the largest and most resilient energy networks in North America. Today, think about our company's role in the energy markets, particularly against the backdrop of what the international energy agency has called the world's first global energy crisis.\nOverseas, the supply/demand balance for oil and natural gas continues to be disrupted. War in Ukraine, supply chain challenges and reduced investments in traditional forms of energy resources as compared to prior periods are contributing to the global challenge. Without adequate security of supplies, coal is unfortunately playing a much larger role in the global energy mix today. In fact, the combustion of coal is expected to match a record-high reach nearly a decade ago and will likely move higher and set a new record next year.\nHere in North America, energy markets are continuing to expand and become increasingly integrated. That is why investing in a modern energy network to support cleaner forms of energy and future economic growth is central to our efforts here at Sempra. We're also developing new, large-scale export facilities so that European and Asian buyers of natural gas can diversify and improve the security of their energy supplies while backing coal out of their supply chain and the production of electricity.\nWe're focused on expanding and modernizing North America's energy grids. Sempra's 3 growth platforms: Sempra California, Sempra Texas and Sempra Infrastructure are strategically positioned to help serve the growing needs of consumers in North America and around the world, while staying at the forefront of innovation and integrating cleaner forms of energy.\nSempra's value proposition comes to life through its commitment to growing a stronger and more valuable business, one that serves the long-term interest of our customers and owners. Trevor will take us through each segment in detail, but first, I'd like to highlight some strategic focus at each of our growth platforms.\nAt Sempra California, we're continuing to innovate and invest in new technologies that are aligned with the state's clean energy goals and focus on safety, innovation and grid resiliency. At Sempra Texas, Oncor is advancing its base rate review which supports the continued expansion and modernization of its grid in Texas with a focus on load growth, grid reliability and integration of renewables. We expect these developments will lead to substantially higher capital spending in future periods. And at Sempra Infrastructure, we're making significant progress aimed at providing cleaner and more secure energy to our customers. Specifically, we're excited to announce that we're expecting to take a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 in the first quarter of next year.\nShifting to the results for the quarter. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and year-to-date 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $6.87. Based on the strength of these results, we are raising our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.70 to $9 per share. We're also affirming our existing full year 2023 EPS guidance range.\nPlease turn to the next slide. In August, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. This is largely viewed as one of the most significant clean energy bills in U.S. history and incentivizes substantial investments in key areas that are expected to reduce carbon in society. This legislation also builds on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed last summer with a focus on modernizing infrastructure across the country.\nWhile some of the details in the IRA are still being finalized, we believe that our growth platforms are well positioned to benefit from the positive tailwinds created by this legislation. For example, a common component of these bills is the focus on electrification. And our California and Texas platforms are located in high-growth markets, where the integration of renewables and the electrification of transportation continue to be major drivers of transmission and distribution infrastructure needs.\nAdditionally, SoCalGas continues to advance its position as a leader in the clean fuel space. The federal bills I mentioned outline key spending priorities such as carbon capture, hydrogen and biogas. This is important as you consider the different innovative pilots SoCalGas has underway that are focused on the commercialization of new and cleaner fuels.\nFurther, SoCalGas is integrating renewable natural gas, or RNG, across its pipeline system today. As a reminder, earlier this year, the CPUC issued a decision established in a statewide RNG procurement standard, which, together with the federal bills, supports investment and continued decarbonization of SoCalGas' T&D system.\nAnd finally, at Sempra Infrastructure, we have identified opportunities for further innovation in carbon capture and sequestration such as the Hackberry project and other investments to further decarbonize our facilities and support our goal of delivering cleaner energy to our customers.\nIn summary, we believe our platforms are well positioned to advance the critical priorities detailed in the legislation. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide several business updates for the quarter.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Jeff. Beginning with Sempra California. For SDG&E's 2022 cost of capital, a proposed decision and an alternative proposed decision were issued on September 30, and the CPUC is expected to vote out a decision today. We are pleased that both proposed decisions confirm that extraordinary circumstances were present, and the cost of capital mechanism for 2022 should be suspended. If the proposed decision is approved, a second phase to determine SDG&E's rate of return for 2022 will be held. If the alternative proposed decision is approved, the 2022 cost of capital rates of return will be preserved and the proceeding will be closed.\nNext, I'd like to remind everyone that both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications with the CPUC in the spring to update their respective authorized rates of return for 2023 through 2025. As part of this, both utilities updated their respective cost of debt requests as recently as September. We continue to expect a final decision on these filings by year-end.\nAlso, both SDG&E and SoCalGas jointly filed a CPUC application with Southwest Gas to conduct hydrogen-blending demonstration projects designed to further enhance grid resiliency and help California reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. Each project builds upon years of research to identify ways to scale hydrogen blending to help drive decarbonization across multiple industries. These innovative projects are examples of our strong alignment with policymakers at both the state and federal level and are expected to provide incremental opportunities to invest in new sustainable forms of energy.\nSeparately, SoCalGas recently made significant progress to substantially resolve the remaining legal and regulatory matters related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak. In October, we announced that we settled with the fifth and final property developer and executed a settlement agreement with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division and Public Advocates Office to resolve all aspects of the Leak OII. The settlement with regulators is pending CPUC approval. Finalizing these settlements is a critical step in this matters resolution, and we recorded a $101 million after-tax charge in the third quarter. Please refer to our SEC filings for additional details and descriptions of the remaining open issues.\nShifting to Sempra Texas, Oncor continues to experience tremendous growth. During the third quarter of 2022, Oncor added another 14,000 new premises to its system and continues to anticipate maintaining approximately 2% average annual long-term premise growth, which is significantly above the national average. Also during the third quarter, Oncor added approximately 65 new transmission interconnection requests to its queue, which at this pace would set a company record for new annual interconnection requests. This highlights the continued growing demand and penetration of renewables in its service territory.\nLast month, Oncor management reviewed with its Board the need to grow and expand its transmission and distribution system with the expectation of substantially higher levels of capital spending. We expect to provide you with a more fulsome update on the 5-year capital plan in the first quarter. Additionally, Oncor expects a final order regarding its pending rate case by the end of the first quarter of 2023, with new rates going into effect thereafter.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, we've made substantial progress moving Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 closer to FID, and Justin will speak to those details in just a moment.\nAt both Sempra and Sempra Infrastructure, we've stated the importance of advancing projects with a robust risk-adjusted return as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. To that end, we've been working diligently on an optimal financing and capital structure plan for Port Arthur to align with those principles that would allow us to enhance our risk-adjusted returns, all while maintaining or exceeding our credit metrics.\nWe're currently advancing 2 efforts to raise capital to fund the construction of the first phase of Port Arthur LNG, all with a view towards securing lower cost of capital for the project. The first work stream targets issuing debt at the project level, and we expect to kick this off in the coming weeks. In addition, we've already launched the second work stream, which aims to raise capital by selling project-level equity to one or more investors. These work streams are expected to pull forward a portion of the project's NPV to reduce our capital contribution, maintain Sempra and Sempra Infrastructure's strong credit profile while also highlighting notable value to our owners.\nNext, I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss additional updates at Sempra Infrastructure.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nCEO, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThanks, Trevor. Let me start at Cameron LNG, where operations for Phase 1 are going very well, with production levels exceeding expectations. In addition, both the proposed Phase 2 expansion project and related debottlenecking activities of the existing 3 trains are moving along as planned. At Train 4, PHMSA, the U.S. pipeline regulator, recently voiced support for our pending FERC permit. We continue to work through the competitive feed process, which we anticipate will be completed in the summer of 2023 and expect to take FID shortly thereafter. Also, we expect the full debottlenecking efforts to be complete before commercial operations commence at Train 4.\nNext, I want to provide you an update on progress at our ECA LNG Phase 1 project, where we recently began erecting the first structural steel on site. Overall construction is slightly behind our original plan, but the project is on budget, and we continue to expect to commence commercial operations in the middle of 2025.\nAt our Energy Networks business, we're pleased to announce that our Puebla fuels terminal outside of Mexico City has started commercial operations. This terminal is integrated with our Veracruz Port and via de Mexico terminals and combined creates our refined fuels terminal network that we collectively refer to as Golfo Centro. This network provides for the end-to-end transportation of fuel by ship to the port of Veracruz and then into the Mexico City market by both rail and truck. The facilities are supported by a 20-year contract with Valero for the entire offtake.\nFinally, at our Clean Power business, we signed a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement for Cameron, a 300-megawatt wind development project with Silicon Valley Power, a AA-rated entity to deliver electricity into the California power market. The site is adjacent to our Energia Sierra Juarez Phase 1 and 2 wind facilities and directly ties into our power transmission lines at the California Mexico border. We plan to proceed to FID pending receipt of final permits and completion of the engineering and design work.\nWith that, let's move on to the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 update. Please turn to the next slide. As Trevor mentioned, we've had an exciting quarter. Port Arthur LNG continues to draw strong market demand, and its advanced permitting and development status makes it an increasingly attractive project. As I have mentioned, there are 3 key work streams associated with reaching FID, and we are optimistic that we can achieve each of these by the first quarter of next year.\nFirst, we completed the EPC refresh and signed a $10.5 billion contract that is dependent on reaching FID. This fixed price turnkey contract creates critical momentum for the project. Efforts to date for the project include preparing the site for an efficient construction process, moving a major state highway, building dock capacity for the construction materials and conducting robust soil test across the entire site.\nSecond, as Trevor detailed above, the financing work streams are underway. Finally, on the marketing front, things continue to progress at a rapid pace, and we are in advanced discussions with several potential customers for long-term offtake contracts and are confident in our ability to convert existing HOAs into SPAs. Based on these discussions, we have more than enough interest to be in a position to take FID in the first quarter of 2023.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The interest in Port Arthur LNG exceeds the volume of Phase 1, and we are actively marketing an expansion that could include a combination of Trains 3 and/or 4. The takeaway here is that there are scenarios in which we are oversubscribed for the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 development project and look forward to advancing ongoing offtake discussions for a potential expansion phase. We will provide a further update on Port Arthur on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where Trevor will review Sempra's financial results for the quarter.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $485 million or $1.53 per share. This compares to third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $648 million or $2.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2022 earnings were $622 million or $1.97 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $545 million or $1.70 per share.\nOn a year-to-date basis, 2022 GAAP earnings were $1.656 billion or $5.23 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2021 GAAP earnings of $650 million or $2.09 per share. Adjusted year-to-date 2022 earnings were $2.172 billion or $6.87 per share, which compares to our year-to-date 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.949 billion or $6.27 per share.\nAs a reminder, this is the first quarter where we will reflect the full impact of the minority interest sales in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, which closed with KKR in October of 2021, and ADIA in June of 2022. In addition to improving our year-over-year results, we raised over $5 billion of capital through our minority interest sales, a portion of which was used to lower parent debt and reduce our interest rate exposure outside of our utilities. Taken together, our strong financial results and growing adjusted earnings demonstrate the strength of our underlying business.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following: $79 million of higher earnings at Sempra California from income tax benefits from flow-through items and CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas; $50 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to higher consumption and customer growth and rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital; $74 million of lower earnings at Sempra Infrastructure attributable to higher noncontrolling interest net of operating earnings and $22 million of lower losses at parent and other.\nPlease turn to the next slide. We are pleased with our performance this quarter, which has generated a lot of momentum across our platforms for the remainder of the year. We look forward to progressing the cost of capital and general rate case proceedings at Sempra California and the resolution of the base rate case at Oncor while continuing development progress at Sempra Infrastructure. We view these work streams as opportunities to continue to drive significant growth in shareholder value into 2023 and beyond.\nAnd with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. And I will now stop, and we can open the line up to take some of your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Glen Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nVP of IR, Sempra\n\nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.\nWe have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, August 4, 2022. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.98 and year-to-date 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $4.90. Based on the strength of these results, we're now guiding to the high end of our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, and we're also affirming our full year 2023 EPS guidance range.\nNext, let me offer some perspectives on how we think about the future. At Sempra, we've worked hard to simplify our business model, to improve safety and operations and with the benefit of more disciplined capital allocation to also improve our financial performance.\nToday, we have built 3 large-scale growth platforms operating in some of the largest energy markets in North America. Within these platforms, we have an exciting opportunity set. Here's a quick summary. At Sempra, California, we're making capital investments to continue improving safety, reliability and sustainability. Each are key components of our recent GRC filings. At Sempra Texas, we couldn't be more excited about the work Oncor is doing to support strong economic and demographic growth and the continued integration of cleaner renewable resources.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, there are significant growth drivers across all 3 business lines: LNG and Net Zero solutions, clean power and energy networks. In the first half of this year, the United States became the #1 global exporter of LNG. And by the end of the decade, we expect the United States will extend its significant leadership advantage in this area.\nIn combination, these investment opportunities support our record $36 billion capital plan for 2022 through 2026 as well as our continued confidence in our projected 6% to 8% annual average long-term EPS growth rate, which we announced earlier this year. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide several business updates.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Jeff. Beginning with Sempra California, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their general rate cases with the CPUC in May to update their authorized revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. These comprehensive filings represent a thoughtful effort to support our customers by striking the right balance between maintaining customer affordability and making the necessary infrastructure investments for safer, cleaner and more resilient energy systems.\nNotably, both utilities have outlined the critical areas of investment needed to safeguard their systems and support the state's clean energy goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. As an example, SDG&E's GRC filing is centered around investments such as wildfire mitigation, system hardening, EV infrastructure and innovative technologies to modernize our electrical system. For SoCalGas, investments in pipeline safety and integrity and emissions reductions are key priorities in its application. Support for these rate case priorities will lead to a cleaner energy system and provide long-term benefits to our customers. We look forward to working with all stakeholders on these proceedings to advance a positive outcome.\nIn April, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications to update their respective authorized rates of return for 2023 through 2025, and we expect a final decision by year-end. To further support grid resiliency, the CPUC approved SDG&E's 4 new microgrid facilities. These new energy storage projects are expected to improve power continuity during grid outages and are great examples of the critical investments SDG&E is making to integrate renewables while enhancing reliability for its customers.\nAdditionally, SoCal Gas recently announced that since 2015, it achieved a 37% reduction of fugitive methane emissions significantly ahead of the state's goal of a 20% reduction by 2025 and nearing the state's goal of a 40% reduction by 2030. This achievement is significant and demonstrates SoCalGas' focus on helping to accelerate the decarbonization of California's energy systems.\nShifting to Sempra Texas. Oncor continues to benefit from its demographic growth and strong economic expansion across its service territory. As a result, Oncor has added another 35,000 new premises so far this year. We continue to anticipate maintaining an annual premise growth of approximately 2% in the near term which is significantly above the industry national average. Also, Oncor has seen more than a 70% increase in new requests for transmission interconnections compared to the second quarter of 2021.\nThis highlights the continued growing demand and expected penetration of renewables in their service territory. On top of significant organic growth, Oncor continues to experience near record high temperatures. And in recent weeks, ERCOT has set new records for peak electrical demand. As a grid operator, Oncor has been doing its part to help maintain grid reliability during these extreme weather events, while also executing against a record $15 billion capital plan for 2022 through 2026.\nGiven Oncor's significant growth across its service territory, we expect their CapEx program will again be adjusted this fall. As it has done in the past, Oncor will present its updated rolling 5-year capital forecast to the Board at their October meeting. In May, Oncor filed its rate case with the Public Utility Commission of Texas, requesting a 4.5% revenue requirement increase over current adjusted rates to support Texas' rapid growth trends and need for continued reliability. The new rate is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of 2023. Oncor looks forward to working in partnership with its stakeholders to achieve a positive outcome. Now I'll turn the call over to Justin to discuss updates at Sempra Infrastructure, where we've successfully reached a number of important commercial milestones this quarter.\n\nJustin Christopher Bird\n\nCEO, Sempra LNG LLC\n\nThanks, Trevor. Last year, we formed Sempra Infrastructure to be a leading North American infrastructure platform with a standalone investment-grade balance sheet. This has enabled us to attract strategic investment partners like KKR and ADIA while also highlighting the growing equity value of the business.\nIn June, we were pleased to close our 10% sale to ADIA for approximately $1.7 billion, with an implied equity value of close to $18 billion. We look forward to a strong partnership with ADIA. And together with KKR, we are working collaboratively to advance our strategy of providing cleaner and more secure energy to global customers.\nJeff talked earlier about the growth that we're seeing in all 3 business lines at Sempra Infrastructure. But what I thought would be helpful is to focus my time on recent developments in U.S. LNG. Please turn to the next slide.\nSempra Infrastructure's U.S. LNG development portfolio has made significant strides. As we outlined in our last quarterly earnings call, the key work streams that Cameron LNG Phase 2 include completion of our pending FERC amendment, the competitive feed process and ongoing marketing.\nWith regard to our recently announced commercial arrangements at Cameron, we have worked hard to align our economic and commercial interests with those of our customers. You will recall that we plan to take our 50% share of the Train 4 offtake and sell it back to back to global counterparties under long-term sale and purchase agreements. We are pleased to confirm that we have substantially achieved this marketing goal as a result of the HOAs with the Polish oil and gas company and INEOS, which include the optionality to move volumes between Cameron LNG Phase 2 and Port Arthur LNG.\nTurning to engineering. We are running a competitive feed process with Bechtel and JGC Zachry joint venture. This is expected to be completed in the summer of 2023, at which time we would expect to move to FID. Next, let me discuss Port Arthur LNG.\nSimilar to Cameron, we have maintained a disciplined marketing approach with a focus on linking U.S. natural gas production with some of the leading European buyers of LNG. This strategy has served us well in the current environment given supply disruptions in Europe. Just as a reminder, we have a FERC order and a DOE expert permit in hand, and the permitting and design work are highly advanced for the initial phase of the project. The key remaining work streams involve finalizing the EPC contract with Bechtel to include updated pricing and signing definitive offtake arrangements.\nSince our Q1 earnings call, we have entered into HOAs with RWE, the Polish Oil and Gas company and INEOS, and announced a strategic partnership framework with ConocoPhillips, under which Conoco would receive roughly half of the offtake volumes or 5 MTPA under a 20-year tolling type arrangement and potentially make a 30% equity investment in Phase I.\nImportantly, these announcements mark substantial progress in the marketing phase of this project. As it moves forward, we will continue to work with stakeholders, including customers, contractors, debt holders, equity investors and credit rating agencies. The positive takeaway from this is we continue to see great interest from European buyers and volumes are coalescing around projects that have the greatest probability of advancing. We look forward to updating you on future progress in November on our third quarter call.\nAs Jeff mentioned earlier, the U.S. has recently become the #1 global exporter of LNG. Based on the quality of our development sites and their geographic positioning relative to Europe and Asia, we believe our business can help advance America's leadership position in this area while also providing energy security to our allies and helping facilitate the global energy transition. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call back to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $559 million or $1.77 per share. This compares to second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $424 million or $1.37 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, second quarter 2022 earnings were $626 million or $1.98 per share, which compares to our first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $504 million or $1.63 per share. On a year-to-date basis, 2022 GAAP earnings were $1.171 billion or $3.70 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2021 GAAP earnings of $1.298 billion or $4.24 per share.\nAdjusted year-to-date 2022 earnings were $1.550 billion or $4.90 per share, which compares to our year-to-date 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.404 million or $4.58 per share. Please turn to the next slide.\nThe variance in the second quarter 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following: $48 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to customer and consumption growth and increase in invested capital; $41 million of higher CPUC base operating margin net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as higher FERC margin at SDG&E; and $33 million of higher earnings at Sempra Infrastructure. There are a number of items driving this variance, so please refer to the appendix for further detail.\nPlease turn to the next slide. As we close our prepared remarks, let me give you a couple of key takeaways. First, comparing the financial results from the first half of this year to the same period in 2021, we posted adjusted earnings growth of 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 7%. It's equally important to note that we have accomplished these results even with the sale of a 30% minority interest in Sempra infrastructure.\nSecond, the steps we've taken to diversify and strengthen SI's capital structure came at an opportune time and have put us in an improved position to execute on a new set of exciting development opportunities, particularly in the LNG space. Third, going forward, we remain highly focused on safety and operational excellence by executing on our strategy, which includes progressing towards constructive GRC outcomes at Sempra California, extending and improving electric grid resiliency in Texas, while Oncor works with its stakeholders to finalize a constructive base rate case for its customers, and achieving further milestones in our overall development pipeline at Sempra Infrastructure.\nAnd with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. So I will now stop and we can open the line to take your questions."

Welcome to the Sempra first quarter earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donovan. Please go ahead.\n\nGlen Donovan\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.\nWe have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Lisa Alexander, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Faisel Khan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.\nWe also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 5, 2022. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, our company remains focused on executing our T&D investment strategy in our core markets. Sempra California is preparing to submit GRC filings at both SDG&E and SoCalGas later this month, focused on providing safe, reliable and cleaner energy to its 26 million consumers.\nTurning to Texas, Oncor is executing on its record 5-year capital plan focused on critical T&D infrastructure investments across its service territory to support strong demographic growth and plans to file its rate case later this month. And at Sempra Infrastructure, they're developing a platform that's uniquely positioned to export LNG directly from the Gulf and Pacific Coast to customers in Europe and Asia.\nThe recent tragic events unfolding in Ukraine have highlighted the need for secure access to reliable sources of cleaner energy and Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to be part of the solution. Our strategy of investing in T&D infrastructure to expand and modernize North America's energy systems across each of our 3 growth platforms is continuing to drive our record $36 billion, 5-year capital plan and has helped us deliver another quarter of strong financial results.\nAlso in April, we completed $250 million of share repurchases under our existing board authorization. In the last 6 months, we've returned $750 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, which taken together with our dividend program, demonstrates our commitment to returning value to our owners while remaining focused on investing in and growing our businesses as part of the disciplined capital allocation strategy.\nShifting to our quarter results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $2.91. We're also affirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2022 and our EPS guidance range for 2023. Please turn to the next slide.\nI'd now like to briefly highlight some of the key strategic advantages of our T&D portfolio. Sempra's 3 growth platforms are strategically positioned in highly attractive and contiguous markets in North America and serve one of the largest utility consumer bases in the United States. Our strong position helps create momentum for critical investments in advancing safety, reliability and cleaner energy as the global energy market continues to evolve. We also believe our platforms will play an important role in building the energy systems of the future.\nPlease turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Lisa to provide an update on our sustainable business practices.\n\nLisa M. Larroque Alexander\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Affairs & Chief Sustainability Officer, Sempra\n\nThanks, Jeff. I'm pleased to share that we recently issued our annual Corporate Sustainability Report for the 14th consecutive year. Sustainability is central to our strategy, capital allocation and sustained performance. Throughout our report, you'll see examples of our sustainable business practices, including how we've aligned our portfolio with long-term macroeconomic market and policy trends. Among other factors, our corporate strategy is focused on enhancing safety, climate resilience and affordability and capturing new investments in infrastructure that support increasingly diversified and cleaner forms of energy.\nOne of the key improvements to the report is our enhanced ESG reporting to address the evolving needs of our stakeholders in light of a constantly changing environment. We appreciate the collaboration and continue to align our reporting to track and deliver on key ESG metrics.\nA couple of other highlights from the report are reflected on this slide. Recently, SDG&E issued its decarbonization road map for California, the path to net zero, which demonstrates our position as a leader in helping the state reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. It's also important to note that safety is foundational to our business. We're continuing the essential work of helping ensure employee and contractor safety and operational excellence.\nFor example, ECA LNG recently surpassed 1 million hours worked without a lost time injury. Additionally, customer affordability is another top priority, and we're investing in the necessary infrastructure to help mitigate operating risks and enable a just energy transition. This approach of investing in our business while striving to maintain affordability underscores our values of doing the right thing, championing people and our unwavering commitment to safety across our operations.\nFinally, we have a demonstrated history of sound corporate governance and oversight by our Board of Directors. The report highlights our Board's skills and experience and, among other areas, cybersecurity, energy transition and operational excellence. Our strength in sustainable business practices has been recognized by experts in the sector, including the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. And we've been named to the list for 4 consecutive years. Notably, we are the only North American utility company to be so recognized.\nI'm very proud of the collective effort from each of our businesses and our shared work with all our stakeholders. With sustainability at the heart of our corporate strategy, it provides a clear sense of purpose for our 20,000 employees.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll hand the call over to Trevor to provide business and financial updates.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Lisa. We made solid progress in the first quarter with a number of positive developments at each of our operating companies. Beginning with California, we're excited about SDG&E's completion of the Cleveland National Forest Fire Hardening and Safety Project, which is an example of SDG&E's commitment to making its electric system safer and more reliable.\nNext, I'd like to remind you of an important decision issued by the CPUC in February, establishing a statewide renewable natural gas procurement standard with procurement targets for California's investor-owned gas utilities in 2025 and 2030. This decision reaffirms the role of renewable natural gas in the state, and we view it as a significant step toward the future of cleaner fuels in California. Against that backdrop, SoCalGas continues to execute on its own goal of 20% renewable natural gas delivery to its core customers by 2030.\nIn April, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their cost of capital applications to update each of their authorized rates of return, which would be effective for 2023 through 2025. We expect a decision by year-end. Regarding SDG&E's off-cycle cost of capital application for 2022, we expect a decision later this year. For more information on the cost of capital filings, please refer to the appendix.\nAdditionally, both utilities plan to file their general rate cases with the CPUC in the coming weeks to update their authorized revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. Among other considerations, our filings will focus on safety and reliability investments, while also looking to advance the state's clean energy goals. We look forward to working with the commission and all of our stakeholders on these important regulatory proceedings.\nShifting to Texas. It's important to note that in 2021, it was a record year for Oncor in terms of the new and active requests for transmission interconnections, highlighting the rapid economic growth in its service territory. This growth has continued in the first quarter of 2022, with a 78% increase in new interconnection requests compared to the first quarter of 2021. Oncor's service territory continues to experience strong new commercial development and population increases as demonstrated by Oncor connecting approximately 16,000 new premises in the first quarter.\nAdditionally, last month, Oncor's Board of Directors approved an update to its 2022 capital plan from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. While Oncor's Board typically approves the annual capital plan in October, this off-cycle approval is another example of the robust economic growth in Texas, driving investments to support transmission and distribution expansion. Also in March, Oncor received approval of its transmission cost of service filing for the recovery of its 2021 capital investments. Oncor also plans to file its rate case with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas later this month.\nNow let's shift to Sempra Infrastructure, which is focused on making critical new investments that support the energy transition. As part of this strategy, Sempra Infrastructure is working to export LNG directly from the Gulf and Pacific Coasts to customers in Europe and Asia. Furthermore, our U.S.-Mexico cross-border infrastructure business supports the growing integration of North American energy markets. As part of our effort to develop Cameron LNG Phase II, we've successfully reached a number of important commercial and permitting milestones and are now progressing towards the engineering stage of the project.\nAs a reminder, in January, we filed our amendment with the FERC to transition from gas turbines to electric drives. If approved, this would result in a more capital-efficient single train with an estimated 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous design. Also, last month, we signed project development agreements and an HOA with Cameron LNG partners to advance Phase 2 of the project. These arrangements provide the commercial framework for the development of a fourth train as well as increased production capacity through debottlenecking activities from the existing 3 trains.\nSempra Infrastructure contemplates taking its share of the offtake and selling it under long-term sale and purchase agreements to third parties. In summary, under the proposed arrangement, Cameron LNG Phase 2 would be fully contracted prior to reaching a final investment decision.\nIn addition, we selected 2 FEED contractors to run a competitive process, which is intended to culminate in a fixed-price turnkey EPC contract. The FEED process is expected to conclude in the summer of 2023, which would allow us to evaluate taking FID thereafter. We believe we have a strong plan of execution, and this detailed and rigorous FEED process will result in better scope, definition, cost and schedule for the project.\nNext, as we continue to advance our dual market strategy, we broadened our alliance with TotalEnergies to advance the Vista Pacifico LNG project and to explore renewable opportunities in North America. The MOU to develop Vista Pacifico LNG contemplates that TotalEnergies would receive 1/3 of the project offtake and potentially participate in the project equity.\nGiven the increasing demand for LNG projects, we're continuing to have active discussions with market participants around Port Arthur LNG. As a reminder, the proposed facility at Port Arthur has advanced permitting and design work and is targeted to have total capacity of approximately 13.5 Mtpa. Lastly, at Sempra Infrastructure, we continue to expect the sale of a 10% interest to ADIA for approximately $1.8 billion to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing adjustments and conditions.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $612 million or $1.93 per share. This compares to first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $874 million or $2.87 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2022 earnings were $924 million or $2.91 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of $900 million or $2.95 per share. Please turn to the next slide.\nThe variance in the first quarter 2022 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be explained by the following key items: $42 million of lower earnings at Sempra Infrastructure attributable to higher noncontrolling interest, consisting of: $24 million increase as a result of the decrease in our ownership interest of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, net of an increase in our ownership interest in IEnova, and $18 million, primarily due to an increase in Sempra Infrastructure Partners' subsidiaries net income.\nThis was offset by $27 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to the increased revenues from the rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital, higher customer consumption and customer growth; $25 million of higher transportation and terminal earnings at Sempra Infrastructure; and $22 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E. Please turn to the next slide.\nTo summarize, we've continued to invest in our record capital plan to help build the energy networks of the future. We're pleased about the strength of our financial performance this quarter, and we'll remain highly focused on executing our strategy and capital program throughout the remainder of the year.\nWith that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now stop and take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nelly Molina. Please go ahead.\n\nManuela Molina Peralta\n\nVP of IR, Sempra Energy\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sempra's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. We have several members of our management team with us today, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Lisa Lorock Alexander, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Faisel Khan, Chief Financial Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; elen Nay, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; and Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.\nBefore starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.\nAll of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.\nWe also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 25, 2022, and it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Walker Martin\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Nelly, and thank you all for joining us today. In 2021, we delivered another year of strong performance. We'll discuss some of the operating highlights in a moment. But on the financial side, we invested over $7 billion in critical energy infrastructure, a record amount for our company, and we delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $8.43 well above our increased adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.75 to $8.35 per share.\nThe strength of that performance, together with a portfolio of investment opportunities across all 3 of our growth platforms gives us a lot of confidence in the future. Today, we're announcing approval by our Board of Directors of an increased annualized dividend of $4.58 per share, consistent with our long-standing commitment to return value to our shareholders, record 5-year capital plan of $36 billion with nearly 94% dedicated to our utilities, continued confidence in our full year 2022 EPS guidance range and the issuance of our full year 2023 EPS guidance range.\nAnd finally, we're announcing a projected long-term EPS growth rate for the company of 6% to 8%. Please turn to the next slide. Next, I'd like to highlight a few of our accomplishments. From a strategic standpoint, we've made great progress over the last 4 years in updating our portfolio with 3 goals in mind: First, prioritizing markets with strong fundamentals and constructive regulation; second, simplifying our business model to improve execution; and third, building scale, financial strength and a high-performing culture to deliver improved financial results. 2021 was another key milestone in that journey.\nWe've completed a series of transactions to form Sempra Infrastructure, a simplified growth platform with scale and portfolio synergies, all while generating over $3 billion by selling a noncontrolling interest to support growth and the return of capital to our owners.\nFurthermore, these transactions highlight the underlying market value of this business and demonstrate Sempra's continued ability to source lower cost of capital and recycle it into organic growth at our utilities.\nMoving on, we continue to advance our capital plan in 2021, deploying over $7 billion with a continued focus on supporting the strong growth at our utilities. From a safety standpoint, we had record employee safety results at Sempra, California and Sempra Infrastructure also had a great year, advancing construction at ECA LNG Phase 1 on time and on budget with over 1 million hours worked without a lost time injury.\nTaken together, these accomplishments and the quality of execution we're seeing across our businesses, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Sempra's growth platforms are strategically positioned in highly attractive and contiguous markets in North America where we serve one of the largest utility consumer bases in the United States.\nEach of these growth platforms have both scale and a leadership position in our core markets, and that is central to our strategic execution.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Our growth platforms benefit from 3 main competitive advantages. Size and scale in attractive markets, lower risk and strong recurring cash flows associated with T&D investments and positive growth trends centered on the expansion of energy networks to support cleaner forms of energy, improve safety and reliability and the continued integration of North American energy markets.\nOur 3 platforms combined for nearly 300,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, all in key markets in North America, while serving nearly 40 million consumers. These integrated growth platforms generated approximately $2.6 billion in 2021 full year adjusted earnings and position us to grow earnings well into the future.\nTrevor will walk through the details on our long-term growth drivers later in the presentation. But at a high level, our projected growth of 6% to 8% is supported by; strong continued investment at Sempra, California to support safety, reliability and the state's ambitious energy transition goals; investment in our Texas utilities to support strong economic growth and a significant interconnection queue loaded with renewables; and disciplined investments at Sempra Infrastructure for fully contracted assets currently under construction; and, potential upside to projected growth from projects we currently have in development.\nFinally, I think it's worth noting that the vast majority of our assets have some form of inflation protections built into them, either through regulatory constructs such as upcoming rate cases or pass-through mechanisms on our infrastructure projects.\nAdditionally, given our strategic focus on T&D infrastructure, the lower risk section of the energy value chain, we believe we've reduced our exposure to many of the traditional risks in the energy space whether it's commodity exposure, extreme weather, retail credit or stranded generation investments.\nAs we continue to advance our role as a leader in the energy transition, we're also creating an opportunity on this call and future calls for our Chief Sustainability Officer, Lisa Alexander, to update you on our progress. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nLisa M. Larroque Alexander\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Affairs & Chief Sustainability Officer, Sempra\n\nThanks, Jeff. For 2 decades, Sempra has been on a sustained path to decarbonize our business operations and the markets we serve. Innovation and new technologies are central to a clean energy future, enabled by investments in 3 key capabilities: decarbonization, diversification and digitalization.\nThis past year, we summarized our aspirations in each of these areas as part of Sempra's Energy Transition action plan, and I'm pleased to update you that we're making great progress.\nHere are a few examples. In California, SDG&E completed its inaugural issuance of $750 million in green bonds and secured regulatory approval for 3 new energy storage projects expected to total 161 megawatts. Additionally, SoCalGas achieved over 4% renewable natural gas deliveries to core customers in 2021.\nMoving to Texas. Oncor is doing an excellent job connecting customers to cleaner renewable sources of energy by expanding and modernizing Texas' vast transmission and distribution network.\nIn 2021, Oncor connected nearly 2,200 megawatts of wind and solar generation, bringing the total renewables connected to Oncore system to approximately 15,500 megawatts. In addition to progress on its operations, Oncor has also entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility with sustainability-linked performance metrics.\nAnd lastly, at Sempra Infrastructure, the newly consolidated platform is advancing opportunities in renewables, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG and carbon capture infrastructure. The company recently filed an amendment with FERC to incorporate electric drives at our proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project, which could help reduce facility emissions by up to 40% while continuing to help decarbonize global markets.\nEarlier this year, the company also announced an MOU with Entergy to develop options intended to accelerate deployment of renewable energy to power primarily LNG facilities. Across our industry, companies are adjusting their business models to meet customer demands for increasingly cleaner sources of energy.\nAt Sempra, we think these trends play to the strength of our company and effectively create a tailwind for new and cleaner investments across our platforms. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll hand the call over to Trevor to provide business and financial updates.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Lisa. To begin, we've had several positive developments at our operating companies. In the third quarter, SDG&E filed an application with the CPUC to assess its cost of capital for 2022 as a result of the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December, the CPUC issued a scoping memo with a final decision expected later this year. Also, the CPUC authorized a memorandum account effective January 1, 2022, to track any differences in revenue requirements resulting from the interim cost of capital decision expected later this year.\nAdditionally, the CPUC is working through the implementation of a renewable natural gas procurement standard. We're excited about this development and view it as a significant step forward in advancing the future of cleaner fuels here in California. Lastly, SoCalGas recently announced a bold new vision to develop a proposed green hydrogen infrastructure system to serve the Los Angeles Basin called Angeles Link.\nAs contemplated, this project would be the nation's largest green hydrogen infrastructure system and will deliver green hydrogen to the country's largest manufacturing hub to help decarbonize electric generation, industrial processes heavy-duty trucking and other sectors that are challenging to fully electrify.\nShifting to Texas. Oncor set a company record for the number of new and active requests received for transmission interconnections in 2021 demonstrating the rapid growth in Texas and continuing opportunities for Oncore to grow its system. Oncor service territory continued to grow as well, with Oncore connecting approximately 70,000 additional premises in 2021.\nAt Sempra Infrastructure, we signed 2 MOUs to advance our unique capability of delivering LNG into both the Atlantic and Pacific basins. The first with Entergy that Lisa discussed earlier and the second, an MOU with CFE to jointly develop Vista Pacifico LNG as well as a new regasification project in La Paz, Baja California Sir.\nAdditionally, Sempra Infrastructure established a new credit facility in the fourth quarter and issued its inaugural investment-grade bonds last month, all with the intention of efficiently financing its growth along with internally generated cash flows.\nPlease turn to the next slide where I'd like to go into additional detail on an update relating to Sempra Infrastructure. Here, the key takeaway is that we're making progress on our announced sale of an additional 10% interest in the business to Adia.\nThis transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions and third-party and regulatory approvals, valued Sempra infrastructure and an enterprise value of approximately $26.5 billion, which was $1 billion higher than the KKR transaction. We expect to use the proceeds to fund utility capital, execute share repurchases and continue supporting improvements in the balance sheet.\nPlease turn to the next slide where I'll review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we recorded fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $604 million or $1.90 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $414 million or $1.43 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2021 earnings were $688 million or $2.16 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings of $668 million or $2.28 per share. Full year 2021 GAAP earnings were $1.254 billion or $4.01 per share. This compares to 2020 GAAP earnings of $3.764 billion or $12.88 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, full year 2021 earnings were $2.637 million or $8.43 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full year 2020 adjusted earnings of $2.342 billion or $8 per share.\nPlease turn to the next slide. The variance in full year 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the prior year was affected by the following key items: $78 million of lower earnings due to the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean utilities in April and June of 2020, respectively, $126 million of lower earnings from a CPUC decision in 2020 that resulted in the release of regulatory liabilities at Sempra, California related to prior year's forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account.\nThis was offset by $216 million due to higher earnings from Cameron LNG JV primarily due to Phase 1 achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020 and asset and supply optimization primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices and higher volumes, $139 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to the lower preferred dividends from the mandatory conversion of preferred stock and lower net interest expense, $52 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas, $44 million charge in 2020 for amounts to be refunded to customers related to the energy efficiency program at SDG&E, $37 million of higher earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth.\nPlease turn to the next slide. We continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our utilities and infrastructure businesses, resulting in a $36 billion 5-year capital plan, the largest in our history.\nAnd notably, a $4 billion increase over the prior plan we announced last year. This plan is anchored by $33 billion of utility investments, representing nearly 94% of the total capital plan.\nFor SDG&E and SoCalGas, safety and reliability continue to be at the forefront of our planned expenditures. This is important. Our investments in California centered around the state's regulatory priorities including wildfire safety and the integrity and safety of our gas infrastructure along with technology investments.\nAdditionally, at Oncor, the capital plan addresses the strong organic growth. For example, the population of Texas increased more than any other state in 2021, continuing the need for further investments to support this growing demand.\nPlease turn to the next slide. These capital investments in top-tier markets in North America are driving tremendous growth in our projected rate base. In 2017, we had $14 billion of rate base at the California Utilities. And through adding our interest in Oncor as well as organic growth at both our California and Texas utilities, we grew our rate base to $41 billion in 2021 and expect to grow it even further to $62 billion by 2026.\nJust as importantly, we expect to support the strong projected growth without issuing common equity. Notably, over the next 5 years, our rate base mix is not expected to change materially with approximately 70% of total rate base dedicated to electric infrastructure, which reflects how well positioned we are to continue supporting strong trends in electrification in our core utility markets.\nPlease turn to the next slide, where I'll provide additional details on the opportunities we have to efficiently fund our growing rate base. As we think about our financing strategy, we have multiple opportunities to efficiently fund the expansive growth that we're experiencing at our utilities.\nOver the past few years, you've seen us rotate capital to fund utility growth while also strengthening the balance sheet, finishing 2021 in a strong position with 47% total debt to capitalization and 18% FFO to debt.\nLooking forward, our financial plan is underpinned by a portfolio of strong operating cash flows that are backed by regulated returns or long-term contracts. Our robust utility capital plan is further supported by cash generated from Sempra Infrastructure where projected cash distributions to Sempra, combined with the proceeds from the sales to KKR and Adia are expected to provide over $7 billion from 2021 through 2026.\nTurning to the dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50% to 60%, which allows us to aggressively invest in utility growth while supporting the dividend. In addition to the dividend, we see opportunistic share repurchases as a way to efficiently return capital to shareholders from time to time.\nWe remain focused on delivering shareholder value. And through this efficient financing strategy, we expect to deliver strong EPS and dividend growth without issuing external common equity.\nPlease turn to the next slide where I'll discuss our near-term EPS guidance ranges and projected long-term EPS growth rate. We're reaffirming our 2022 EPS guidance range of $8.10 to $8.70 per share, and we're introducing our 2023 EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20 per share.\nThe aforementioned guidance includes plans to continue returning capital to our owners in the form of $1 billion of share repurchases. This would be in addition to the $500 million of share repurchases we recently completed.\nNow let me talk about our longer-term growth. Our historical execution, combined with the growth opportunities in front of us, give us confidence in providing a long-term EPS growth rate of an annual average of 6% to 8% starting at the midpoint of 2022 EPS guidance through 2026.\nThis 6% to 8% growth is driven by our 5-year capital plan and continued operational excellence across our businesses. It is anchored by an 8.5% projected rate base growth at our utilities and only includes projects currently in construction at Sempra Infrastructure. Importantly, we see opportunities to outperform this projected growth rate through incremental investments across our 3 platforms.\nA few examples would include additional spending on energy storage, wildfire mitigation, electric vehicle infrastructure and related make-ready work and pipeline safety and reliability in California, further economic growth driving transmission and distribution expansion in Texas and lastly, executing on incremental LNG and other development projects at Sempra Infrastructure that are currently outside the plan.\nPlease turn to the next slide where I'll highlight our historical execution. This slide is a good depiction of how we've historically met or exceeded our published EPS guidance ranges and done so consistently, reflecting our long track record of disciplined capital allocation, thoughtful execution and a commitment to deliver on our financial projections.\nPlease turn to the next slide. Let me summarize our investment proposition. We've invested time and energy in building a high-performing infrastructure company that is well positioned in some of the fastest-growing markets in North America.\nOverlaid with a commitment to capital discipline, we have a track record of operational excellence, disciplined financial execution and dedication to consistently returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.\nBottom line, we're excited about the future of Sempra and the critical role that our infrastructure will play in supporting future economic growth in the energy transition.\nPlease turn to the last slide. Over the last 4 years, we've continued to update our portfolio with a view towards prioritizing markets with strong fundamentals and constructive regulation and simplifying our business model to improve execution and building scale, financial strength and a high-performing culture to deliver improved financial results.\nWith the benefit of those strategic efforts, it allowed us to end 2021 in a strong position and looking forward we have 3 integrated platforms with improved visibility to future growth. With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now stop and take your questions."

As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Alexia Quadrani, Executive Director and Head of Investor Relations.\nOn today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago, and we also have an earnings presentation which will be made available on our website after the call. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.\nJulie will begin with an overview of our results. Angie will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on the market position before Angie provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2026.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings.\nThese risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations from non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section on our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Alexia, and to everyone joining this morning, and thank you to our more than 779,000 re-inventors around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients. In fiscal year 2025, we delivered a strong year financially. We significantly elevated our competitive positioning, and we took our next big steps to position us for growth in the age of AI.\nWe grew 7% last year, which was adding $5 billion in revenue, with over $80 billion in bookings, and we did so against a macroeconomic backdrop that did not improve over FY 2024. Of that 7% growth, the majority was organic, and the growth was broad-based across markets, industries, and types of work. We also delivered strong Earnings Per Share growth and generated strong free cash flow, both above our guidance on an adjusted basis, and we returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders, an increase of 7% over FY 2024.\nWe took share at more than 5x our investable basket. How did we do it? We built on the rapid shift in our business we made by the end of FY 2024 to address the challenging market conditions. We then took action to fully capitalize on the competitive advantages we have built over a long period of time to deliver these results. These advantages include our ecosystem partnerships, our breadth of capabilities, our deep and trusted client relationships, our track record of investing in new skills and rotating our business with successive technology revolutions, and, of course, our ability to invest.\nOur strategy for more than a decade has been to be the number one partner for the tech ecosystem, and it's serving us well. Technology is front and center for every client, and in FY 2025, we continue to be the number one partner for all of our top 10 ecosystem partners by revenue. 60% of our revenue is from work that we do with these partners, which grew 9%, outpacing our overall revenue growth in FY 2025.\nThese partners are the world's largest technology tech companies by revenue, and they're seeking deeper and deeper partnerships with us as they look for help to turn their technology into business outcomes and scale the adoption of AI. We continue to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients. Our deep and long-standing relationships mean we know our clients and their industries inside out.\nOur global footprint and breadth of capability means we can serve more of our clients' needs for large-scale transformations than any other player in the industry. We added 37 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in Q4 alone, bringing us to a record of 129 such bookings for the year, and we finished the year with 305 Diamond clients, our largest relationships. Our early and decisive decision in FY 2023 to invest significantly to become the leader in GenAI with a $3 billion multi-year investment is clearly paying off as we capture this new area of spend for our clients.\nIn FY 2025, we tripled our revenue over FY 2024 from GenAI and increasingly agentic AI to $2.7 billion, and we nearly doubled our GenAI bookings to $5.9 billion. As a reminder, these numbers only reflect revenue and bookings specifically related to advanced AI, which is GenAI, agentic AI, and physical AI, and do not include data, classical AI, or AI used in delivery of our services.\nWe're now going to use the term advanced AI as it encompasses the latest developments that are starting to gain traction. In addition to all we're doing around advanced AI, for over a decade, we have made disciplined inorganic investments to expand our market and fuel organic growth. For example, our capital projects business, which was initially built through several acquisitions around the world, is now a $1.2 billion business for us, and in FY 2025, it grew 49% year-on-year, largely organically.\nWhile delivering these results, we also took the next big steps in our reinvention for the age of AI. We are reinventing what we sell, how we deliver, how we partner, and how we operate Accenture. In short, on the ground, advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do. Let's review our reinvention to date. By definition, every new wave of technology has a time where you have to train and retool. Accenture's core competency is to do that at scale.\nOur clients cannot possibly build all of the expertise they need on their own. They need us to go first and fast. In FY 2023, we had 40,000 AI and data professionals, with roughly 30 people working on a handful of GenAI projects with negligible revenue. Today, we have 77,000 AI and data professionals. We've worked on more than 6,000 advanced AI projects just this year, and we delivered meaningful revenue in FY 2025.\nWe're also in the process of equipping all of our reinventors with the latest AI skills. Over 550,000 of our reinventors are already trained in the fundamentals of GenAI. We've already significantly embedded advanced AI into key platforms like GenWizard so that we are now delivering differently for our clients. We've reinvented our corporate functions to create additional investment capacity, among other benefits, and we'll now increasingly use advanced AI in the next chapter.\nIn FY 2025, we focused our new actions on the ecosystem, our talent strategy, and our growth model. We expanded our partnerships beyond the top 10 in AI and data and created new ones with companies that are becoming critical to many of our clients who also want to work with us to help them scale their relationships, and our revenue is growing in double digits with many of these partners.\nIn FY2026, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business. In addition to continuing to hire world-class talent, in FY 2025, we developed and are implementing a refreshed, robust, three-pronged talent strategy to rotate our workforce. We are investing in upskilling our reinventors, which is our primary strategy.\nWe are exiting on a compressed timeline. People we're reskilling based on our experience is not a viable path for the skills we need, and we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI, in order to create more investment capacity. Finally, our growth model. On 1 September, 2024, we launched reinvention services, which brings all of Accenture's capabilities into a single unit. Nearly 80% of our large deals are multi-service.\nThe model, as we fully roll it out, will make it faster and simpler to sell and deliver everything Accenture offers and to rotate our offerings to embed more AI and data, and equip our people. In summary, I am pleased with our strong results in FY 2025 and our positioning for FY 2026 and beyond. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which were at the top of our guided range,, and completed another strong year for Accenture. Our results reflect a relentless focus to consistently deliver on our shareholder value proposition while investing for long-term market leadership, and reinforce our role as a trusted reinvention partner for our clients and a leader in AI.\nNow, let me summarize a few highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 4.5% in local currency. Excluding the 1.5% impact from our federal business, our revenues grew 6% in Q4, and we continue to take significant market share at more than 5x, reflecting the relevance of our services and the strength of our diversified portfolio and execution. As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market.\nWe use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to adjusted Q4 results last year. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our business and our people.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.03, which represents 9% growth compared to adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.8 billion and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends this quarter. Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1 for a total of approximately $865 million over the period.\nThe business optimization program has two parts: one related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business.\nIn FY 2026, we expect to increase our headcount overall across all three markets, including in the US and in Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business. Now, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $21.3 billion for the quarter, representing 6% growth in US dollars and 3% growth in local currency, which is on top of the 24% growth in Q4 of last year.\nOverall book-to-bill was 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.00. Managed services bookings were $12.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $17.6 billion at the top of our guided range, reflecting a 7% increase in US dollars and 4.5% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.8 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 3% in local currency.\nManaged services revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8% in US dollars and 6% in local currency, driven by high single-digit growth in technology managed services, which includes application managed services and infrastructure managed services, and mid-single-digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets. In the Americas, revenue grew 5% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrials, and software and platforms, partially offset by a decline in public service. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\nExcluding the 3% impact from our federal business, Americas grew 8% in local currency in the quarter. In EMEA, we delivered 3% growth in local currency, led by growth in insurance, life sciences, utilities, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services, partially offset by a decline in public service. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Spain, partially offset by a decline in Italy.\nIn Asia-Pacific, revenues grew 6% in local currency, driven by growth in banking and capital markets, public service, and utilities, partially offset by a decline in energy. Revenue growth was led by Japan and Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared with 32.5% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 10.7% for the fourth quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expense was 6.6% compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that results in Q4 FY 2025 and Q4 FY 2024 include costs associated with business optimization actions, which impacted operating margin, tax rate, and EPS. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 15.1% adjusted operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with adjusted results in Q4 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.9% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.2% for the fourth quarter last year.\nAdjusted diluted Earnings Per Share were $3.03 compared with adjusted EPS of $2.79 in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting 9% growth. Days' sales outstanding were 47 days compared to 47 days last quarter, and 46 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.8 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.9 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $108 million.\nOur cash balance at 31 August was $11.5 billion compared with $5 billion at 31 August last year. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 1.6 million shares for $474 million at an average price of $295.45 per share. Also, in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $922 million.\nNow, I'd like to take a moment to summarize the year as we successfully executed our business to deliver or exceed all aspects of our original guidance that we provided last September on an adjusted basis. We delivered bookings of $80.6 billion, with a record 129 quarterly client bookings over $100 million and a book-to-bill of $1.2. Revenues of $69.7 billion for the year reflects growth of 7% in local currency, with nearly $5 billion in incremental revenue added this year.\nOur federal business was a 20 basis point headwind to our overall growth for the year. Consulting revenues were $35.1 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 5% in local currency. Managed services revenues were $34.6 billion, up 9% in both US dollars and in local currency, driven by 10% growth in technology managed services and 6% growth in operations. The following comparisons exclude the impacts of business optimization actions I noted earlier and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating margin of 15.6% was a 10 basis point expansion over our adjusted FY 2024 results. Adjusted Earnings Per Share were $12.93, reflecting 8% growth over adjusted FY 2024 EPS. Free cash flow of $10.9 billion was up 26% year-over-year, reflecting a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.4. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we returned $8.3 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $1.5 billion across 23 acquisitions.\nIn closing, we feel good about how we manage our business while navigating the macro environment in 2025, and now we are laser-focused on executing and delivering fiscal 2026. Back to you, Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Today, we work across every major market with more than 9,000 clients, including the world's largest companies, 3/4 of the Fortune Global 100 and 500. As we look at the market, we have not seen any meaningful change, positive or negative, in the overall market. We are focused on delivering results regardless of the market conditions by being the most relevant to our clients. Relevance today requires leadership in AI.\nWe're working with companies early in their journey to use AI, which want our help to get them AI-ready and to leverage our assets and platforms to accelerate their ability to deploy AI, as well as to help them do what they can now to use AI, even when they're not fully ready across the enterprise. We also are working with companies far along their journey to be AI-ready and wanting to be the first to change the game with AI, even as its potential is still emerging.\nThe technology itself is new and rapidly changing, so across companies, they need help in understanding the tech landscape. This is where we are in the age of AI. It is very early innings, however you look at it, which means there is massive opportunity ahead for our clients, our ecosystem partners, and us. It is well recognized that advanced AI has taken the mind share of CEOs, the C-suite, and boards faster than any technology development we've seen in the past two decades.\nAt the same time, as reported widely, value realization has been underwhelming for many, and enterprise adoption at scale is slow other than with digital natives. This is why our clients are turning to us. We know that the gap between mind share and faster actual adoption is because the enterprise reinvention required to truly unlock the value of advanced AI is hard and has significant costs.\nThere is a huge difference between how we're all using AI in our individual lives that is incredibly easy and what it takes to use it in an enterprise. The opportunity for AI is at the intersection of business strategy and tech and org readiness. For most companies, the biggest gap between mind share and adoption is tech and org readiness. We're still in the thick of cloud, ERP, and security modernization. Data preparedness is nascent in many companies, and companies grapple with fragmented processes and siloed organizations.\nGenerations of leaders need new skills to understand how AI should inform their business strategy. The workforce needs new skills to use AI, and new talent strategies and related competencies must be developed. Helping clients with all of this work is what is driving our growth, and our pipeline of large-scale transformations continues to grow. We're also starting to see early signals of an inflection point, with more clients looking for true enterprise-wide plans and activation and seeking out our successful experience with scaling in enterprises and at Accenture.\nTwo years into this AI journey, we also are seeing a pattern in how AI can expand our opportunities with our clients. As some companies are making progress in creating AI readiness, it leads to even more work. Long-standing partnerships are deepening, and the demand for transformation is accelerating. For example, take a major financial services client we've worked with for over a decade. Their reinvention began with digital operations and cloud modernization.\nNow they've asked us to modernize their data estate, the foundation for scaling AI across the enterprise, from the contact center, marketing, finance, and the trading floor. As we begin to implement AI into many facets of their business, our relationship continues to grow as we retire legacy systems, transform core functions like HR, and risk, and build AI-centric capabilities to keep them ahead of shifting customer expectations.\nThis has meaningfully expanded the amount of work we do for this client, and in fact, over the past five years, the value of our contract has more than doubled. We're seeing more stories like this across our portfolio, where AI is extending across the enterprise and adjacent work is following. Our contracts are expanding, and our client relationships are compounding, creating a powerful, sustainable growth engine for Accenture.\nBuilding the Digital core remains our biggest growth driver. Only now, our clients understand that Accenture is bringing even more capabilities because we understand how the Digital core will enable them to use Advanced AI, and Advanced AI is now a new catalyst for doing the large-scale transformations of the Digital core in the first place. Taking an industry lens, let's look at banking. In banking, investment in Digital core modernization remains strong, with Cloud adoption accelerating as AI demand grows.\nHere's what it looks like in practice, and I'm particularly proud of this work because the scale is frankly breathtaking, and we were trusted by this client with mission-critical work. The Bank of England's Real-Time Gross Settlement Service, which lies at the heart of most electronic payments in the UK, was rebuilt on a modern digital core using private cloud and end-to-end automation. This upgrade improved security, reliability, speed, and scale.\nThe system now offers faster onboarding and secure APIs, giving more financial institutions safe access. It processes about $1 trillion in transactions every day, and in its first five months up to today, has handled 22.5 million transactions worth $110 trillion. For people, that means big payments like buying a home go through quickly and safely. This modernization strengthens a national platform, reducing risk and creating a trusted foundation for innovation.\nNow the system is ready for what's next, even the potential for the market adopting AI-driven payment services. Now let's take a horizontal lens across industries with security. Security is essential to a digital core, which is reflected in our 16% growth for the year. We're seeing increased demand for advanced cyber protection and more integrated intelligent security solutions that can fully harness AI's potential and keep pace with emerging threats.\nTo further strengthen our position, in the past quarter, we agreed to acquire CyberCX, our largest cybersecurity acquisition to date, which helps us in geographic expansion, bringing approximately 1,400 specialists in APAC and also bringing AI-powered security platforms, which are applicable globally. We also acquired IAM Concepts, a Canadian identity security specialist serving critical infrastructure, expanding the depth and regional reach of our managed security and identity capabilities that underpin secure AI adoption.\nNow let's look through the lens of our unique industry functional process and talent and org capabilities. These, coupled with our technology expertise, are making a difference to our clients. And these next two examples also demonstrate the pattern we're seeing in expanding our relationships due to advanced AI. Ecolab, a global sustainability leader, has been a client for 15 years.\nThree years ago, we partnered with Ecolab to lay the foundation for their growth transformation, One Ecolab, bringing the company together as one team to better serve customers, drive cross-sell and upsell, and improve operational efficiency. A year into that journey, we started working with Ecolab and its leadership to accelerate value with AI. Instead of executing one-off use cases, we redesigned the entire lead-to-cash process, the steps from generating a lead to collecting payment using nine scaled agentic AI agents.\nThese agents clean core data, resolve billing errors, and automatically match customer payments to the right billing invoices. In cash application alone, work that used to be 100% manual is now about 60% automated, reducing errors and speeding up processes. By using AI to streamline operations, Ecolab is on a path to deliver an estimated 5%-7% sales growth and 20% operating income margin without increasing costs at the same pace.\nBig picture, it supports the company's mission to deliver water, hygiene, and infection prevention solutions to more customers worldwide. We're partnering with a leading energy company, which has been a client for nearly two decades, to reinvent field operations with cloud, data, and GenAI. The challenge was scale, safety, cost, and sustainability, running thousands of wells with fragmented data and a leaner field workforce.\nWe unified data from more than 25 legacy systems into a single cloud-based digital core. On top of that, we built AI-powered scaled digital twins that monitor, optimize, and control the field in real time using our Accenture Industrial Intelligence Suite solution. That live view speeds decisions and improves safety, often without sending a technician on-site, while emissions are continuously monitored for compliance.\nThis solution is expected to reduce lost production by up to 2%-4%, increase productivity by up to 28%, and decrease costs by up to 22%. Field exposure and unplanned visits are also reduced, and emissions are expected to be lower. People can now focus on higher value work, and the business can respond faster to a changing energy landscape. Our scaled examples set the North Star.\nHere's an example of how our clients are starting to work with us for broader AI adoption across multiple areas to enable their business strategy. We've partnered with UOB, a leading bank in ASEAN, for nearly two decades on various initiatives, including multi-country application services rollouts to omnichannel enhancement. Today, we're helping them scale GenAI and use Agentic AI to transform customer experience and core operations.\nUsing our AI Refinery platform, we're supporting them in powering high-value use cases, customer engagement, risk management, and workforce enablement. This transformation enables faster, more personalized service, strengthens decision-making with predictive insights, accelerates response times, and enhances operational resilience. Together, we're positioning UOB to lead and create sustainable impact in the financial services industry.\nNow, an important part of our growth strategy is to be relevant to the core of our clients' industries, such as digital manufacturing, and to be relevant to their growth agenda. Industry X grew 10% and Song grew 8% in FY 2025. Both follow a similar pattern of needing a strong digital core and reinvention. The digitization of digital manufacturing and engineering and the use of AI and data to reinvent customer experience is still in the early days.\nWe're seeing strong demand across both areas and continue to invest both organically and inorganically. For example, we recently acquired Momentum ABM in the UK and Super Digital in the US, extending our edge in B2B, social, and influencer marketing. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect revenues to be in the range of $18.1 billion-18.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately +1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Our Q1 guidance reflects an estimated 1%-5% growth, including about a 1.5% impact from our federal business, with AFS contracting mid-teens.\nFor the full fiscal year 26, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately positive 2% compared to fiscal 2025. For the full fiscal 2026, we expect revenue to be in the range of 2 to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2025, including an estimated 1%-1.5% impact from our federal business.\nExcluding the impact of federal, our revenue is expected to be an estimated 3%-6%. This year, we expect an inorganic contribution of about 1.5%, and we expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year 26 to be 15.7%-15.9%, a 10-30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 25 results. We expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5%-25.5%.\nThis compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2025. We expect our full-year adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share for fiscal 2026 to be in the range of $13.52-$13.90, or 5%-8% growth over adjusted fiscal 2025 results. For the full FY 2026, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $10.8 billion-$11.5 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow to be in the range of $9.8 billion-$10.5 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. We expect to return at least $9.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of $1 billion, or 12% from FY 2025. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.63 per share to be paid on 14 November, a 10% increase over last year, and approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority. We remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash generated to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Alexia?\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator 4\n\nAbsolutely. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Today's first question comes from [Tin Jin Wong] with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good presentation here. My first question I'll ask on visibility on revenue growth, if that's okay. Just love to hear your thoughts on visibility compared to the last couple of years, given the backlog, which is quite big with large deals. You have the pipeline, of course, and then what you're seeing on discretionary spending, given the economic backdrop as you see it.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Hi, [Tin Jin]. Good morning. Let me start with that. As we look at FY 2026, we feel really good about our positioning. And so, as you said, you saw our strong bookings of $80.6 billion in FY 2025 that positions us for FY 2026. We can see our backlog from the large deals. And if you look at our pipeline and looking at our pipeline, it's solid overall, and we see strong demand for our large transformation deals.\nFrom a discretionary perspective, what we've assumed is at the top end of the range, there's no change in discretionary spend, while at the bottom of the range, it allows for deterioration. By the way, as you think about our guidance of 2-5, excluding AFS, we're at 3-6 for the year.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Thanks for that, Angie. Just maybe, Julie, I liked your AI remarks. Can you dig this? I'd like to dig in a little bit more, if you don't mind. Just give us your latest thoughts on AI-driven productivity and those gains and how they might unfold. I get that question quite a bit from investors. Do you see potential deflationary effects, and how might that impact Accenture services, both positively and negatively?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks. Great. Thanks, Tin Jin. We don't see AI as deflationary. We do see and are seeing it as expansionary, similar to every tech evolution we've been through. The move from an analog to digital, from on-prem to cloud, and SaaS, and as many of you who've been with us over the course of the years have known, in every successive tech evolution, we've become stronger.\nAnd so if you look at AI, we see the same thing. Yes, AI absolutely boosts efficiency in areas like coding or operations, but those savings don't disappear. They're being reinvested into new priorities. The list of what our clients want to do with technology is truly virtually unlimited. And so when we can save them money by delivering our services with advanced AI, that frees up their budget to do the next things on their list.\nAnd that's what they're doing. They're always going to those next priorities, and we're best positioned then to help them. That is how we delivered our 7% growth last year. I mean, two years in, we're seeing the pattern for how that journey to advanced AI is expanding our business. By the way, I will add that one of the most consistent things that I'm telling CEOs today is that their AI strategy has to focus on both growth and productivity.\nAlmost every CEO that I've talked to says they pivoted way too far toward productivity and not enough to growth, which, of course, we are helping them with things like Song. We give that advice really from our own experience in how we have successfully grown through every tech evolution, embracing the productivity on one side and then capturing the opportunity it creates on the other side by helping our clients.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Dave Cunningham with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Great job, and great to see GenAI bookings re-accelerate. A question, I guess, a little like Tin Jin's question. Just wanted to ask about the balance between GenAI and managed services. You do a ton of managed services work. You get to know client operations really well. You can probably go in and recommend GenAI work and gain a lot of share there, but then maybe displace some managed services. And how does that really balance between consulting and managed services over time, and does the net of it all push revenue and margins higher?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Well, first, let me just kind of ground you in how we're thinking about consulting and managed services in FY 2026, just so we all have kind of the facts of how we're thinking about it in FY 2026. I'll give you some more color on how we see those things actually work in the market. So, Angie, you want to just ground them in the FY 2026 piece?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, David. Good morning. So overall, for our guidance for FY 2026, both consulting and managed services are balanced. We see both of them in the low to mid-single-digit range. So that's the context. Yeah.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nAnd then how it actually works out on the ground, right, is that as you think about enterprise-wide strategies, a lot of times what we're talking to our clients about is where do you invest and build proprietary capabilities, where do you want to buy capabilities, and where are you best situated to go faster because you're partnering and buying them through a managed service like Accenture.\nAnd so what we're seeing a lot of is, for example, companies that are really behind, they're not as far along in their tech journey, they need managed services because they simply can't go fast enough. It's not just a cost play. They want the cost take out, but they want to use everything we've invested in our platforms to get them to the Advanced AI. Similarly, in the core operations, things like digital manufacturing, supply chain, we're developing more and more managed services there in order to allow them to go faster.\nAnd so we see this kind of continuing to develop as we have over the last several years where managed services have become very strategic. They're not just a cost play. And of course, the more we can save them money in the way that we deliver, right, so using advanced AI, that allows them to then reinvest into the business. And so very similar patterns. Managed services, really, for the last five or six years has become a very important part to the strategy of companies and how to use advanced technology, now with advanced AI, faster.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGreat. No, that's super helpful. And then maybe just quick follow-up. [Though], are you expecting a similar Q4 headwind through the first three quarters of this year and then anniversary it in Q4, and then kind of going forward, maybe not having much impact at all? Is that kind of how you're modeling it?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThat's exactly right. We expect it to anniversary at the end of Q3.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys. Nice job.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Fawcett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much. Appreciate all the incremental color and detail here from everybody. Wanted to ask, we see, at least in the forecast, a little bit of increase in CapEx, etc. Wondering if you can give us a little bit of detail where that investment is going and how we should expect that to play out further.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nSure. So, hi Jim. On our CapEx, we expect about $1 billion this year, which is about $400 million more than FY 2025. This is really about us expanding our real estate and leasehold improvements in certain geographies, certain major markets for us, because we're bringing more people back to the office, so. Yeah. That's why.\n\nJames Fawcett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's kind of what I suspected. And then the second thing was just you mentioned, and we saw the re-acceleration in GenAI and bookings, etc. How is the pricing of those projects evolving, and has the velocity of projects transitioning from proof of concept to production changed at all?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYes. Let me just start on the pricing. For our GenAI projects and the pure GenAI that we were, or advanced AI that we've been talking about, we do see pricing that is accretive overall to Accenture's average.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. In terms of acceleration, in terms of kind of moving from proof of concept to production, right, we're seeing more and more now move into production because it's just we're helping them with the proof of concept, and then we're helping them scale. But you also are just continuously seeing companies that weren't as fast out of the block now starting proof of concept.\nSo it really is a cycle that many companies are going to go through. And you've got leaders who are way ahead. We've got other companies that are just getting started. And what I would say is, rather than a re-acceleration or deceleration, these things are going to be like everything. They're going to be lumpy, right, in terms of it. But what we really look at is the overall trend of how much growth that we are getting and our share of this new spend. Thanks.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator 4\n\nYes, ma'am. And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nHi. Good morning. I too appreciate your prepared remarks. Really thought-provoking. I wanted to ask Julie about the way you're defining advanced AI. And I think if the transcript's right, you say GenAI, agentic AI, and physical AI. I'm actually asking about why you're saying you're not including data because we've sort of been trained that data is foundational. So why is the data component not in the definition of advanced AI?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nBecause what we're trying to share with you is how we're taking spend in a new market. And by the way, data is absolutely critical. In fact, one out of every two projects in GenAI, agentic AI, physical AI has significant data pull-through. So our data business is on fire, right? This is an absolutely critical area. Companies are just getting started.\nIt's nascent in many places. It's part of the digital core that we're building. It's just that to date, we've wanted to share with all of you transparently the really new areas. So data is part of the digital core that's growing. We've shared with you that 60% of our revenue is from the ecosystem partners. That's including the data. And look, going forward, now that advanced AI is, in fact, in all of the work, because it's either actual work or we're getting ready for the work, we'll think about how to share that.\nBut just to date, since this started for all of us, really from negligible revenue, we wanted to share how we've been specifically accelerating in the new area of spend.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nGot it. Thank you. And then going further, will you say that every new wave of technology has a time where you have to train and retool, and your core competence is to do that at scale? So I'm just wondering relative to prior technology, and you alluded to some of this in prior architectures, but how do you think about that requirement, which you have tremendous mindshare at, which is to do technology at scale? How do you think about this relative to some of the previous technological evolutions? Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nIt's going faster. I mean, there is so much demand, and the technology is moving faster. So the more advanced skills and the new types of skills are coming faster. And that's why we're being very decisive, right?\nUpfront, we said, \"We've got to start training everyone in the new skills.\" We're now saying, \"We've got to move faster to that.\" And also, remember that when we went into this, we'd already trained about 500,000 of our people on classical AI because going back to FY 2019, we said the next decade would be about tech cloud, data, and AI. So we start with a very strong base. And this is definitely moving faster than prior technology evolutions in terms of how fast the demand is coming and the importance of us really winning the talent rotation.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nPerfect. Thank you both.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Brian Bergen with TD Cowan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Bergen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning. And thanks for the added detail in the slides here. My first question on GenAI impact: can you speak about client behavior in seeking to use GenAI and agentic solutions more themselves? You mentioned the efficiencies from the tech in areas like software development. So I'm curious if you're seeing more clients seeking to then benefit to do that more themselves versus with third parties.\nAnd I'm also curious if you've seen clients that thought they could do it themselves six, 12 months ago and then realize they do need help and they return to you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYes. And in fact, especially early on, because GenAI seems so simple, right? And then the reality is it's not the technology that is the biggest barrier. It is actually being able to get the mindset reorganized around how best to use it, the ability to do the change management, the process reinvention. If you think about your average company, their core competencies inside are not things like end-to-end process reinvention, right? You're hard-pressed to find a CEO that doesn't say, \"I feel like my organization is too siloed.\nI feel like we don't have the right way of managing our data.\" So we've had lots of clients who have started things on their own and then come to us who've got good proofs of concept that their team was able to do but then just can't scale it. I mean, I'm doing right now, just in the next few weeks, I'm personally leading a few different workshops with the entire C-suites of companies where the focus is, \"Share with us how do we actually scale it, and what can we really do now?\" Right?\nBecause we're a couple of years into this, we have a number of solutions which we're now doing repeatedly within industries and cross-industries. And our clients are looking for us to share that success so that they can start, stop just having their own team saying, \"Well, I have this idea, this idea,\" and saying, \"How can we actually get scale now?\"\n\nBrian Bergen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, follow-up on the business optimization plan. Can you talk about the assumed savings you expect to achieve from this optimization plan and how it may help you evolve your operations? I'm specifically curious if you see that kind of combined with GenAI adoption internally allowing you to operate at a sustainably higher utilization as that did take up this quarter.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHi, Brian. I think that for overall, we expect savings of over $1 billion from our business optimization program, which we expect that we will reinvest in our business and in our people because it's so important for our future growth. So we expect to reinvest that while still delivering modest margin expansion.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Then in terms of kind of the connection, just making sure this particular, these moves are primarily due to our talent strategy. The other piece was an exit of a couple of non-strategic acquisitions. But on the talent strategy, it's more around, well, our number one strategy is upskilling. Given the skills we need, and we've had a lot of experience in upskilling, we're trying to, in a very compressed timeline where we don't have a viable path for skilling, sort of exiting people so we can get more of the skills in we need.\nThat's really not related to kind of the utilization piece in terms of it ticking up to 93%. We think it'll stay in the zone, right, and the low 90s to that, and it'll fluctuate a little bit. But to your point around sort of what can we do long-term, we are continuously looking at, as the technology matures, our new structure around reinvention services. We'll look to see, are there ways that we can use the technology to deliver our services and operate Accenture and its core better?\nAnd that's one of the reasons why we have the new reinvention services to really simplify how we're operating because that makes it much easier to start to use this AI. And so more to come as we fully roll out that model and identify new opportunities.\n\nBrian Bergen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator 4\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Darren Peller, Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research",
    "content2": "Hey, guys. Thanks. It's good to hear from what it sounds like the pace of procurement change has calmed down a bit from the government side such that you can forecast those. I guess number one, just to verify that's where you feel more confident around forecasting on it. But then there's a lot of policy changes. Just wanted to touch on a couple and ask you your thoughts lately.\nNumber one, now that we have a little more clarity on tariffs, do you see more capital investment, especially in areas like products? Number two, maybe you could just comment on H-1B changes or potential changes. What are your thoughts around either wages or the pace of hiring of H-1Bs going forward and how it may or may not impact the business? And then just a quick one on healthcare and the big UFO bill, any impact you're seeing there. Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Well, thanks. So just quickly on federal, we do see procurement is now starting to pick up, although it's still slower than it has been in the past. The demand in federal is very much around modernization, consolidation, and efficiency. Tech is at the center, so lots of demand around ERP and platforms. Our position with the ecosystem is really key here, and our strategy to expand that partnership, those partnerships is also important.\nWe're really pleased with our new partnership with Palantir, which is really playing a critical role in federal. So we feel good about where we are in federal and our relevance to the administration's agenda. And that's what we're really focused on, is being relevant to our clients. So that's federal.\nOn capital investment, I would say it's still a little early, right? I mean, obviously, you've seen the improvement with the cut in interest rates. We're a global company, so there's a lot of stuff going on around the world. And so I think it's just a little bit too early to call yet how much this is going to open up on the capital investment. Of course, we're growing very significantly in taking advantage of the investments that are already happening, as you saw in our capital projects business.\nOn H-1B visas, for us, this is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and therefore really specialized experience and skills for our clients. So not something that is really a big impact on Accenture. And then whether it's healthcare or a lot of the different policy changes, remember, our business thrives by helping our clients navigate change, right?\nSo what we're seeing is that every time there's big policy changes, and this has been true for decades, right? That's why in our business, we have industry expertise. We have the functional expertise. And so when you have new compliance rules, etc., that usually drives more business for us. And so at this point, we see an opportunity to really stay close to our clients and help them navigate, take advantage, and comply with new policy changes. And that's true in healthcare, and it's really true across the board.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThat's great to hear. Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator 4\n\nAbsolutely. And our final question comes from Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Julie, I just wondered if I could follow on your comment. Do you expect headcount to grow during the course of the fiscal year across all regions? Can you maybe kind of frame for us the magnitude of that and the timing for it, given the context of some of the other business optimization actions you're seeing? Where would you expect headcount growth to land exiting the year, perhaps?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nI'll take that. Hey, Jim. Good morning. What I would tell you is we expect it to grow across all markets. We don't have a specific number that we're giving you, but based upon the demand that we see, we expect our headcount to grow.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. And then as a follow-up on that, if you could sort of maybe talk about the net impact of AI you're using internally to optimize your own work, your own business utilization, as I think you mentioned earlier, 93%, that's basically hitting a new record. But when would we expect to see that either reflected in even higher utilization or potentially gross margins, even though we know you don't manage directly to that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Remember, right now, our utilization is really a reflection of the kind of momentum in demand that we're seeing. You saw the bookings, right? And so our utilization, we would expect to continue to move around in the low 90s. So we don't have a structural change in utilization due to AI. We are already embedding AI, particularly in our big platforms like GenWizard, to drive efficiencies.\nAnd that's reflected in both our bookings and in our guide for the year. We're going to continue to be the leaders because that is what works, right? If you lead yourself, we're able to take that to our clients. We're able to show them how we're doing it and then help them do it in their business. So that's kind of how it's developing.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Julie Sweet for closing remarks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nTerrific. Thanks again, everyone, for joining. In closing, I just want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We are working every day to earn your trust. And a huge thank you to all of our reinventors because you are why we are able to deliver these results. Thanks again.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Today's conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to [indiscernible] . Executive Director and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2025 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Alexia Quadrani, Executive Director, Head of Investor Relations.\nOn today's call, we will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we've issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call.\nJulie will begin with an overview of our results. Angie will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before Angie provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and our full fiscal year 2025. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.\nThese risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Alexia, and to everyone joining this morning. And thank you to our more than 790,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in another strong quarter of reinvention across industries, companies and countries.\nStarting with our quarter. We are very pleased with our results as we continue to deliver on our strategy to be our clients' reinvention partner of choice and lead in GenAI. Our clients continue to prioritize large-scale reinventions as reflected in our bookings of $19.7 billion, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. We grew 7% in local currency with revenue of $17.7 billion, above our guided range, and we continue to take market share on a rolling 4-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors which is how we calculate market share.\nWe are a leader in GenAI with another milestone quarter of $1.5 billion in bookings and over $700 million in revenues bringing our Q3 year-to-date GenAI bookings to a total of $4.1 billion and revenue to $1.8 billion. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points compared to adjusted operating margin last year, and we delivered EPS growth of 12% over Q3 FY '24 adjusted EPS. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas. We invested in our people with 38 million training hours year-to-date, up 18% over the same period last year.\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 75,000 continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY '26. We invested over $297 million across 4 strategic acquisitions and investments. We are expanding our Learn Vantage capability through this quarter's acquisitions of Talent print in India and Ascendiant in the United States, enhancing our ability to deliver industry relevant certifications and tailored upskilling and reskilling programs.\nIn Japan, we acquired Umami, which strengthens [indiscernible] ability to craft, launch and scale digital products that are both intelligent and impactful. We are also investing in our industry X capabilities with the acquisition of [indiscernible] in Scotland, expanding our infrastructure and capital projects expertise globally and across Europe. We are proud to have earned the #6 spot on the Great Place to Work list of the world's best workplaces and to have been recognized as a great place to work in 12 individual countries, representing nearly 80% of our people. And in recognition of our strong brands, we are proud to have earned the #20 position on Cancer Brands prestigious list of the top 100 most valuable global brands.\nOur brand value has increased by 27% to $103.8 billion, up from $81.9 billion last year. A key component of our long-term strategy is investing and maintaining thriving communities and creating pipelines of talent the skills we need, which are important for businesses to thrive. In the U.K., one of our largest markets, we are supporting a government initiative to create a coalition with 10 other companies focused on upskilling 7.5 million people, 1/5 of the U.K. workforce in AI skills, breaking down barriers to opportunity and unlocking economic growth. I'm also thrilled to congratulate our 97,000 people who were promoted this fiscal year including more than 800 who are promoted to Managing Director.\nIn summary, we had a strong quarter. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nManaging Director & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. we are very pleased with our third quarter results with revenue above our guided range as well as very strong margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow.\nThese results reflect the diversity and resilience of our business and demonstrate our ability to deliver significant value for our shareholders. Based upon the strength of our results, we once again raised our full year revenue outlook, and we are on track to deliver or exceed all aspects of our guidance provided in September.\nLet me summarize a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 7% in local currency and continued to be broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups and both types of work. Seven of our 13 industries grew high single digit or higher in the quarter, and our federal business had an immaterial impact to our overall growth in Q3 and we continue to take market share, reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio and execution.\nOperating margin of 16.8% for the quarter, an increase of 40 basis points compared to adjusted Q3 results last year and includes significant investments in our people and our business. We delivered EPS in the quarter of $3.49, reflecting a 12% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.5 billion and returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Nine months into the fiscal year, we have invested $789 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $19.7 billion for the quarter, a 6% decrease in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1.\nConsulting bookings were $9.1 billion with the book-to-bill of 1.0, Managed Services bookings were $10.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $17.7 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency, above our FX-adjusted guided range as the foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately positive 0.5% compared with a negative 0.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency.\nManaged services revenues were $8.7 billion, up 9% in both U.S. dollars and in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in technology managed services, which includes application managed services and infrastructure managed services and mid-single-digit growth in operations.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In the Americas, revenue grew 9% in local currency. Growth was led by banking and capital markets, Industrial and Health. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. In EMEA, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by growth in Life Sciences, Banking and Capital Markets and insurance. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 4% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, banking, capital markets and insurance, partially offset by a decline in chemicals and natural resources.\nRevenue growth was led by Japan and Australia, partially offset by a decline in Singapore. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.4% for the third quarter of last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.9% compared to 10.6% for the third quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.3% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q3 of FY '24, we recorded $77 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions which decreased operating margin by 40 basis points and EPS by $0.08. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nOperating income was $3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16.8% operating margin, a 40 basis point increase from adjusted operating margin in Q3 of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.49 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.13 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 12% growth.\nDays services outstanding were 47 days compared to 48 days last quarter and 43 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.7 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $169 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $9.6 billion compared with $5 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6 million shares for $1.8 billion at an average price of $302.35 per share.\nAs of May 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $924 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on August 15, a 15% increase over last year.\nIn closing, we feel very good about our results in Q3 and are now working hard to deliver Q4 and continuing to operate our business with rigor and discipline.\nAnd now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Angie. Let me start with the environment in which our clients are operating today. Stating the obvious, as we shared last quarter, we continue to see a significantly elevated level of uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment as compared to calendar year 2024.\nIn every boardroom in every industry, our clients are not facing a single challenge. They are facing everything at once. Economic volatility, geopolitical complexity, major shifts in customer behavior. In these times, our clients need us more than ever. They look to us to help them build resilience and deliver results to not really navigate the environment, they want to thrive and be the first to reshape their industries. To do so, all roads lead to reinvention.\nGen AI has been a catalyst for reinvention because the power of Gen AI has created the opportunity to meet challenges in new ways and is creating new opportunities to achieve even better results than any single technology in the Internet era and yet Gen AI alone is just a tool. The work needed to use Gen AI to create value at scale is substantial. We are working with our clients using all of our reinvention expertise our deep understanding of how to build a cognitive brain for the enterprise and our deep understanding of data, every function in the enterprise, industries and change as well as our own experience reinventing Accenture. The breadth and depth of our capabilities across industries and solutions that use all of our services is clear in the examples I will highlight today.\nWe are working with Air France-KLM, a global leader in aviation on a digital transformation that will redefine how they operate and serve millions of travelers worldwide by using the power of cloud, data and AI. As part of a multiyear partnership, we will help them move away from proprietary data centers and migrate their legacy applications to the cloud. This work is expected to unlock new efficiencies across passenger flights, cargo services and aircraft maintenance to improve the traveler experience.\nIt will drive faster decision-making using real-time insights and a scalable platform to quickly deploy additional resources when there is a spike in demand and we have already delivered value by successfully deploying over 400 apps using a proven governance model that accounts for the company's need for safety, reliability and resilience to disruptions. With a more agile digital foundation in place, Air France-KLM will be setting the stage for growth through continuous reinvention and the creation of new value. We are advancing our partnership with Vincanteria, 1 of the world's largest shipbuilders to accelerate digital transformation across the maritime industry, helping the sector navigate growing complexity, rising operational demands and the urgent need for sustainability.\nCombining our deep expertise in digital platforms, AI and connected and intelligent operations, we're building Navis Sapiens an AI-powered ecosystem designed to make ships smarter and more integrated. This includes building application services that streamline how ships operate and are maintained, creating a secure AI-powered platform and establishing a marketplace where maritime companies can share digital solutions. For example, a next-generation cruise or naval ship will use a digital twin and IoT sensor network to simulate and monitor vessel core systems. This, coupled with real-time data exchange between ports, ships and shipyards will support AI-driven diagnostics like predictive maintenance and energy management such as fuel efficiency to create a more resilient and sustainable infrastructure.\nThe first AI equipped ship is expected to launch for the end of 2025, demonstrating how we're helping Fincontaria set a new bench work for innovation in capital-intensive industries. We partnered with Nationwide Building Society, 1 of the U.K.'s leading financial institutions and the world's largest building society transformed their cybersecurity operations and stay ahead of evolving threats. We built a cloud-based GenAI-powered security information and event management capability and migrated hundreds of terabytes of security logs and detection use cases to help them achieve a streamlined security infrastructure.\nThis is expected to fast track the deployment process by 40% compared to traditional methods while maintaining full operational continuity. Now Nationwide has a future-ready security operations center that can detect cyber sets faster than before, reduce manual effort required from its cybersecurity team and enhanced business resilience, laying the foundation for future adoption of automation and Gen AI in its security ecosystem.\nOur clients continue to take advantage of Gen AI as one of the ways they can accelerate their reinvention, and we see many clients successfully scaling Gen AI to create value today. We are deepening our partnership with Pfizer, one of the world's top pharmaceutical and biotech companies to lead the next wave of reinvention, using Gen AI and Agentic technologies to transform operations, empower talent and accelerate digital maturity.\nThrough our Gen Wizard platform, we are reimagining how technology managed services are delivered by embedding AI into the process to reduce redundancy, lower costs and increase efficiencies. We are also integrating components of AI refinery into the Gen Wizard platform to help the company implement Agentic AI and zero ops automation. Now intelligent agents will proactively monitor and resolve issues bringing up support teams to focus on higher-value work. For example, when an employee encounters a system issue, an Agentic AI agent can instantly identify similar past cases resolve the ticket automatically and take steps to prevent such issues in the future, reducing manual effort and improving speed to resolution. And through our Learn managed services, we are training the company's digital employees on leveraging Agentic-AI to drive operational facilities, efficiencies, foster joint ownership and enable seamless adoption. This transformation is helping Pfizer set a new standard for how digital and AI technologies and capabilities accelerate innovation and drive efficiencies to bring medicines to patients faster.\nWe are continuing our work with [indiscernible] an integrated mine to pigment global market leader to reimagine operations using AI-driven solutions that will enhance data trust productivity and operational agility. Together, we will build a cloud-based standardized data foundation as the backbone for the company's digital core. Using our AI refinery platform, we will launch a new set of services based on high-value priority Gen AI and agentive use cases, focusing on productivity, site efficiency and workforce enablement. For example, a sales and marketing adviser to streamline customer segmentation, a knowledge assistant to unify institutional knowledge across global sites and an asset management tool to proactively identify and resolve operational issues. The platform will also support process control and decision-making using data to enable predictive insights, faster response times and improved operational stability.\nOur collaboration means [indiscernible] is positioned to achieve long-term differentiation in the pigment manufacturing industry. We are continuing our work with Vale, a Brazilian mining and logistics company to transform its environmental licensing program, accelerating permit applications and advancing its sustainability goals. We've now expanded smart licensing an end-to-end management platform to support greater scale and functionality. Using generative AI, the platform scans application materials and environmental studies to help ensure compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements. Building on this foundation, we've continually introduced new features and enhance the platform's intelligence and business value. These include tailoring checklist for applicants based on project type and location, automating document validation steps and deploying AI-powered chatbots to assist users throughout the licensing process.\nTogether, these improvements have significantly reduced internal review time and improve submission quality while minimizing rework with demand areas. With our broad capabilities, across everything needed to serve the customer from creative to industry expertise to technology and, of course, the latest in AI, we are helping clients shape new growth opportunities. We are collaborating with Nestle, a global leader in food and beverage with well-known brands like Purina, Nescafe, Dolce Gusto and Nespresso to accelerate its digital transformation journey using AI-powered digital twins to meet the growing demand for personalized high-quality content.\nIn partnership with Accenture Song, we've developed a secure cloud-based platform that creates 3D virtual replicas of physical products to streamline content creation and localization Nestle's marketing experts can now generate campaign ready assets without repeated reshoots, digitally adjusting packaging and integrating products into formats tailored to each channel and market. With thousands of digital assets already created, Nestle is reducing the time and cost of scaling digital twins by over 70%, accelerating production intense and quality and keeping their iconic brands top of mind.\nAccenture Song also is helping a Fortune 100 high-tech company transform its sale and marketing functions to meet the demands of a fast-evolving business landscape. With increasing pressure to improve execution, the company's focus on simplifying structure, reducing cost and unifying efforts across regions under a leaner, more agile approach powered by an integrated customer data layer. Together, we're shaping a future-ready model that brings greater integration across sales and marketing. Accelerating speed to market, increasing efficiency through automation and shared services, driving value through Gen AI and agentic architecture. By focusing on data, AI, customer experience and simplified ways of working Song is helping this leading company strengthen execution, enhanced creative impact and deliver lasting business results. I hope these examples have brought to life the amazing work on which we have the privilege of partnering with our clients and the technology ecosystem.\nWe are able to do this quarter in and quarter out because we invest in having great people and in building extraordinary capabilities across our services, developing deep industry and functional expertise, creating world-class AI-enabled assets and platforms like Gen Wizard, the AI refinery in SynOps and by investing in our unmatched technology ecosystem partnerships and then we bring all of these capabilities together as solutions for our clients that deliver measurable value, which brings me to the exciting news we announced today for how we are changing our growth model so that we can be the most AI-enabled, client-focused great place to work in the industry and capture the massive opportunity we see for our clients, technology partners and Accenture.\nStarting September 1, we are bringing all of our services, strategy consulting, Song, technology and operations together into a single integrated business unit called reinvention Services. Once we fully implement our new model, we will be able to bring more leading solutions faster and embed data in AI more easily into our solutions and delivery. We will also be able to help our people learn and imply AI more easily as this technology continues to evolve quickly. We will continue to manage our business through our geographic markets, the Americas, EMEA and APAC and go-to-market by industry. I'm excited about these changes and how they will fuel our growth.\nBack to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nManaging Director & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '25, we expect revenues to be in the range of $17 billion to $17.6 billion. This has seen the impact of FX will be approximately positive 2.5% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 and reflects an estimated 1% to 5% growth in local currency. I'd also like to provide some additional context on our guidance for Q4.\nAs it relates to our federal business, we saw an immaterial impact to our overall growth in Q3 and our best estimates right now include about a 2% headwind overall in Q4.\nMoving to full fiscal '25. Based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be positive 0.2% compared to fiscal '24. For the full fiscal '25, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal '24. We expect our inorganic contribution for the full year to be about 3%, and we now expect to invest about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year.\nFor operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '25 to be 15.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '24 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal '24. We now expect our full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '25 to be in the range of $12.77 to $12.89 or 7% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal '24 results.\nFor the full fiscal '25, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.6 billion to $10.3 billion property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $9 billion to $9.7 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.\nFinally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash for shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Alexia?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks Angie, I would ask to you ask 1 question and a followup to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator would you provide instructions for those on the call?",

We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining this morning. And thank you to our more than 800,000 people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in a very strong quarter creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Starting with our quarter, we are very pleased with our results as we continue to deliver on our strategy to return to strong growth in FY25. I will share some highlights from the quarter and then turn to an update on new developments since we were together in December in our federal business and the current environment more broadly.\nOur clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, and we are their reinvention partner of choice, as reflected in our bookings of $20.9 billion, including 32 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. We grew 8.5% in local currency with revenue of $16.7 billion at the top end of our guided range, and we continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We had another milestone quarter in GenAI with $1.4 billion in new bookings and approximately $600 million in revenue.\nOperating margin contracted 20 basis points compared to adjusted operating margin last year, and we delivered EPS growth of 2% over Q2 FY24 adjusted EPS. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas, with over $250 million deployed primarily across six strategic acquisitions, and we invested in our people with approximately 15 million training hours this quarter, designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills, and reinvent our services using GenAI.\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 72,000, continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY26. We continue to invest in creating and maintaining thriving communities, which is a component of our long-term growth strategy. This quarter in India, we launched a transformative hospitality skilling program in collaboration with our client, Marriott International, which prepares disadvantaged youth for entry-level jobs in the hospitality sector, including training for digital skills.\nBecause we help our clients execute on some of their most important priorities, and we need to attract and retain the best people, recognition of Accenture as an ethical and admired company is critical for our clients' confidence and to attract these great talents.\nWe are pleased that we have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 18th year in a row, and for the third consecutive year, we ranked number one in our industry and among the top five overall in JUST Capital's America's Most JUST Companies. In addition, thanks to our clients, partners, and the wider business community, we earned the number one position in our industry for the 12th year in a row and number 30 overall, our highest stint on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. Now for two updates. First, Accenture Federal Services.\nFederal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of America's revenue in FY24. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue. In addition, recently, the General Services Administration has instructed all federal agencies to review their contracts with the top 10 highest-paid consulting firms contracting with the US government, which includes Accenture Federal Services.\nThe GSA's guidance was to terminate contracts that are not deemed mission-critical by the relevant federal agencies. While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission-critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government's priorities evolve and these assessments unfold. Based on our significant experience across federal and commercial clients, we see major opportunities over time for us to help consolidate, modernize, and reinvent the federal government to drive a whole new level of efficiency.\nSecond, in recent weeks, we are seeing an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our Q1 FY25 earnings report in December. At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong, and we are very well positioned with our clients because all strategies continue to lead to reinvention through new ways of working, tech, data, and AI. We are confident in executing our strategy to help clients reinvent. As you would expect, we are laser-focused on bringing tremendous value to our clients.\nOur strengths lie in our agility as the market we operate in changes, utilizing our deep client and ecosystem relationships and our leading position in GenAI and technology more broadly. We are also well-diversified across markets, industries, and types of work, which enables us to continue to lead in a changing market context as we have done before. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the second quarter, particularly our continued strong top-line growth, which was once again broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups, and consulting and maintenance services. Let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 8.5% in local currency, which was at the top end of our guided range, with nine of our 13 industries growing high single-digit or higher. We continue to take market share.\nWe delivered EPS in the quarter of $2.82, reflecting 2% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Operating margin of 13.5% for the quarter decreased 20 basis points compared to adjusted Q2 results last year and includes significant investments in our people and our business.\nFinally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. In the first half of the year, we have invested almost $500 million, primarily attributed to 11 acquisitions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $20.9 billion for the quarter, a 3% decrease in US dollars and flat in local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of $1.3. Consulting bookings were $10.5 billion, with a book-to-bill of $1.3. Maintenance services bookings were $10.4 billion, with a book-to-bill of $1.2.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.7 billion, a 5% increase in US dollars and 8.5% in local currency. The foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately negative 3% compared with the negative 2.5% estimate provided last quarter.\nConsulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 3% in US dollars and 6% in local currency. Maintenance services revenue were $8.4 billion, up 8% in US dollars and 11% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in technology-maintenance services, which includes application-maintenance services and infrastructure-maintenance services, and high single-digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets. In Americas, revenues grew 11% in local currency. Growth was led by banking and capital markets, industrial, health, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services.\nRevenue growth was driven by the United States. In EMEA, we delivered 8% growth in local currency, led by growth in public service, life sciences, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 1% in local currency, driven by growth in insurance and utilities, partially offset by a decline in chemicals and natural resources.\nRevenue growth was led by Japan, partially offset by a decline in Singapore. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared to 30.9% for the second quarter last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.1% compared with 10.3% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.3% compared to 6.9% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q2 of last year, we recorded $115 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.14.\nThe following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.5% operating margin, a 20 basis point decrease from adjusted operating margin in Q2 of last year.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.8% for the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.82 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.77 in the second quarter last year, reflecting 2% growth. Days sales outstanding were 48 days compared to 50 days last quarter, and 43 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.7 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.9 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $171 million.\nOur cash balance at 28 February was $8.5 billion compared with $5 billion at the end of 31 August. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4 million shares for $1.4 billion at an average price of $361.16 per share.\nAs of 28 February, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $929 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year. And our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on 15 May, a 15% increase over last year. And now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, our clients continue to be focused on reinvention, and GenAI is a catalyst for reinvention. They're focused on building the digital core, with more AI being built in, which is driving our growth, and on areas such as the customer and core operations, including supply chain and Industry X. For our clients, the twin themes of achieving both cost efficiency and growth continue. The number of clients embracing GenAI is increasing significantly, and we are starting to see some tangible examples of scale in data and AI.\nWe are partnering with Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications company, to create a new joint venture to accelerate its data and AI roadmap and fast-track the business into a new era of AI-driven reinvention. Through the joint venture, we will work together to simplify and modernize their data systems and set up a comprehensive AI foundation to deploy advanced AI solutions across their organization. Value-driving AI use cases have been identified across the business that are suitable for scaling and will enhance network resilience, deliver seamless connectivity, and better customer experience.\nUsing our AI refinery platform, we will reimagine business processes by implementing identical AI. Specialized AI tools will support their employees to work smarter and faster, and teams to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, we will help evolve Telstra's Data and AI Academy, a company-wide upskilling initiative leveraging our learning and development programs, helping to build data and AI fluency and future critical skills across its workforce.\nBuilding on Telstra's globally leading responsible AI practices, the JV is designed to sustain and improve on this by identifying and mitigating AI risks while building trust and adoption as it scales AI across the organization. This partnership with Telstra illustrates to clients that there are creative ways to accelerate their own use of data and AI. Clients in Australia from banking, retail, and utilities are working with us to design their own innovative ways to jump-start their reinvention with data and AI.\nWe continue to see our clients building their digital core as a foundation for reinvention and increasingly asking us to incorporate emerging technologies like AI as well as data into this work. Cloud saw double-digit growth this quarter, and security had very strong double-digit growth. We are working together with a multinational food processing company to help reinvent themselves as a data-driven organization, revolutionizing their enterprise.\nThis includes the end-to-end supply chain and frontline sales function to support rapid growth. Our unique partnership model uses our library of AI and GenAI assets to quickly deliver productivity, with the potential of generating over $0.5 billion in value to self-fund their reinvention. The savings are reinvested into an ongoing build-out of a robust digital core, which becomes the foundation to support and enable any new technologies, processes, or systems the company may adopt in the future.\nFor example, the company is using GenAI to forecast inventory risks and generate next best action recommendations, saving them millions of dollars annually. If excess inventory on a product is selling slower than expected in a region, GenAI tools proactively prompt a promotional sale or halt production before the inventory results in a margin loss.\nIn another instance, an AI-based communication platform was deployed that eliminates up to five different language barriers between supervisors and frontline workers in plants, reducing costly errors from miscommunications and delays. With many households having at least one of their products, this company's commitment to ongoing transformation will position them to continue to build, design, and run a future-ready enterprise, rethink work, and drive innovation.\nWe are helping one of the world's largest auto manufacturers modernize their security operations to protect the company's critical IT systems and stay ahead of the rapidly evolving security landscape. We will implement a modern threat detection and response platform that will enable the company to integrate its data across the enterprise, identifying cyber threats and responding to incidents faster.\nWe are building a new GenAI security engine on Accenture's MySecurity platform, which will help automate cloud migration tasks, moving the threat detection capability from the legacy platform to the new one without interruption. This is expected to increase the company's operational excellence, enhance cyber resiliency, increase risk visibility, and drive a significant improvement in efficiency. With the new platform, the company will be able to better safeguard digital assets, including information critical to automotive design and manufacturing.\nThis collaboration will help better protect the company, its partners, and customers, setting the stage for advanced AI, smart manufacturing, and increased innovation. To capture the value of technologies like generative AI, companies need a digital core. And now, to stay ahead and truly scale AI, companies also need what we call a cognitive digital brain, an always-on and always-learning system, as we shared in our Tech Vision 2025.\nOur industry expertise is critical to building the digital core and digital brain. A deep knowledge of the processes today and how they can be reinvented for tomorrow is key. Our proven track record of digital transformation and our ability to bring experience in strategy, consulting, industry, process, and technology services, and decades of experience in managed services for our clients, allows us to truly reinvent using AI, including digital agents, to create transformational value at scale.\nWe are deepening our partnership with Repsol, a leading multi-energy company and a client for more than a decade, to advance its digital program and scale agentic AI, reinventing key business operations to drive sustainable growth. Over the past three years, we have built a secure cloud-based digital core with a unified data foundation.\nNow, we will use our AI refinery platform to deploy customized AI agents across functions such as planning, forecasting, and customer service, making processes more dynamic and less complex. Employees will be able to work more efficiently and provide customers with accurate, personalized products and services. For example, AI agents can analyze available data to offer timely and relevant bundled energy solutions, enhancing Repsol's position as an integrated provider. We will upskill employees in AI and digital technologies through an expanded training program to support adoption.\nWe are also exploring digital twins and robotic solutions to enhance planned maintenance and other tasks in industrial and logistics centers. Repsol is positioning itself as an early adopter of AI in the energy sector, increasing efficiency, boosting productivity, and promoting new ways of working to better serve customers.\nThe transformation and digitization of manufacturing is an important area of growth, and Industry X grew high single digits this quarter. We are working with KION a global leader in supply chain solutions, to use AI-powered digital twins to create smarter, safer, and more adaptable warehouses that can evolve with the world around them and handle nearly any supply chain challenge, marking the next digital frontier. Picture a busy warehouse during peak shopping season, workers navigating narrow aisles and conveyor belts, forklifts loading and unloading freight.\nNow, imagine robots working seamlessly with human teams to fulfill orders faster and more safely. We are making this a reality by creating digital versions of physical assets such as conveyors and forklifts and integrating autonomous robots with human workers on an AI-driven platform that accurately simulates millions of complex factory processes to help ensure safety and avoid disruptions before robots hit the factory floor. We are also predicting and adapting to real-world challenges as they happen, such as how events like Black Friday sales or a product going viral might affect warehouse operations, adjusting robot brains in real time.\nWith these advancements, warehouse workers' responsibilities will evolve as they work alongside AI systems, making them more desirable candidates for higher skilled roles. Song grew double digits this quarter as more clients seek to reinvent customer and experience.\nWe have the unique ability to integrate creative, data and AI, tech, and strategy while leveraging our industry and operations expertise to unlock marketing and sales as a growth enabler for our clients while delivering efficiencies. We are partnering with a multinational conglomerate in the communications industry to streamline and optimize their media strategy and operations for their mobile division. We've implemented a new digital platform with a unified data foundation, which will provide transparency and real-time access to expedite campaign positions.\nThe company will also reduce the number of media agencies to a single partner, Accenture Song, to maximize media spend outcomes. Accenture's marketing operations managed services will leverage automation and AI to increase efficiencies in manual routine tasks, which will allow employees to focus on more strategic work.\nThese changes will also allow the company to shift from focusing solely on media-related data to incorporating broader insights to make more strategic and informed decisions that benefit the entire company, such as predicting customer content preferences, which can drive more efficient media placement and sales. Talent continues to be at the top of the agenda for CEOs and governments, and reinvention requires working in new ways and the development of new skills. LearnVantage positions us to be able to help clients develop talent and skills to drive future growth.\nOur clients are using LearnVantage to strengthen learning development, turbocharging the learner's experience. For example, we are bridging the skills gap and creating certification pathways for learners using LearnVantage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This will fast-track their careers and support their adoption of GenAI.\nA big-box retailer has accelerated learning opportunities for entry-level to highly technical skill sets, deepened understanding of current industry skills by role, needs by role, and empowered employees with guided learning based on the skills they need for their role. Finally, a look at how we continue to execute on our goal to strategically deploy $2 to 3 billion in BNA this fiscal year. We are investing in our Industry X and supply chain capabilities with our acquisitions this quarter of AOX and Staffan AG in Germany.\nWe also acquired IQT Group in Italy, a managed services provider, which will help utility providers build and modernize integrated electricity and water networks. To continue to lead in GenAI, we acquired Hafspace in Denmark to help our clients in the Nordics region leverage and scale AI to make better, more informed decisions faster.\nTo enable us to scale faster in financial services, we acquired Altus Consulting in the UK, a leader in consulting and digital transformation. Also, this quarter, we purchased a digital twin technology platform for banks from Proscipient, a Singapore-based fintech company with deep expertise in banking technology transformation. Back to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Before I get into the details of our outlook, as Julie mentioned, we have seen an elevated level of uncertainty, including in our federal business. Because this change is very recent, our revenue guidance range for both Q3 and the full year reflects our best view based upon what we see today, which may evolve differently from our estimates and assumptions. With that said, let me turn now to the business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.9 to 17.5 billion.\nThis assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 0.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and reflects an estimated 3% to 7% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2025, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2024. For the full fiscal 2025, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 5% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2024. We continue to expect an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3%, with about 4% in the first half and about 2% in the second half.\nWe now expect to invest about $2 to 3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2025 to be 15.6 to 15.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2024 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2024. We now expect our full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $12.55 to $12.79, or 5% to 7% growth over adjusted fiscal 2024 results.\nFor the full fiscal 2025, we continue to expect operating cash flow in the range of $9.4 to 10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 to 9.5 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. As we move into the second half of the year, we remain laser-focused on managing our business with rigor and discipline. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If your question has already been addressed and you'd like to remove yourself from queue, please press star then two. Our first question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for all of this. So I just wanted to start outside of US federal, so the other 92% of the business. Can you just clarify to what extent you are or are not seeing clients hit the pause button at all on new initiatives, any change in pace of converting pipeline to backlog or backlog into revenue? I can certainly appreciate that your tone's a little bit more cautious. Maybe the visibility isn't quite as high, but are you seeing tangible signs of any pause in client activity at this point in time?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Jason. Good morning. Thanks for your question. For us, there's really, we've seen no change overall. Yeah.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nAs you can imagine, some of these changes are relatively recent, and so we're in a lot of discussions. In some cases, those discussions are about accelerating, particularly in the cost discussions, right? Like, can we go a little faster to get to our programs for places where we're contracting? We are at the heart of many of the discussions where businesses are trying to process what this might mean. But we're not seeing any pauses now.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. We got to watch and wait on that. Let's go to US federal just for a minute. Can you just clarify for us what the growth rate was in US federal revenue in the quarter and what you're assuming for the second half of the year in US federal?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nJason, why don't I take that? Because I think it's important to give a little bit of context on our Q3 and our full-year guidance. Certainly, as it relates to Q2 specifically for federal, we really don't provide that during the year. As you know, we provide that at the end of the year. So let me just start with, because I do think this is important, when you think about we were really pleased with the quarter, our second quarter, and the first half of the year. For the second quarter, we did deliver revenue at the top end of our range. We're very pleased that we were able to update our guidance to 5% to 7% by taking off the bottom. Why is that?\nSo, pleased with how our business is positioned with the larger deals coming online, which was a very deliberate part of our strategy. And then, as you think about Q3 and the full year, it includes our current estimates and assumptions of the potential impacts of federal and the overall environment. And then, if I just break apart organic and inorganic, from an inorganic contribution, we continue to expect a bit over 3% with H2, about 2%, which is consistent with what we shared last quarter in our assumptions.\nAnd then, for the year, what that means is, from an organic perspective, we now expect 2% to 4% in organic growth for the year. And by type of work, to provide that context as well, consulting, we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range growth. And we now see managed services at high single digits.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Understood.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nAnd of course, when you think about, yeah. And then, okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tien Wong with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTina Wong\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thank you so much. So great to hear from you, Julie and Angie. Just maybe I'll ask, instead of demand, I want to ask on the margin outlook and the change there. How much of that is organic versus inorganic in terms of the change? And is it just, I'm always getting questions. Is it just costing more to do business? Is there a cost to execution here going up? Is there a pricing change? What more can you share?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nSure. And as it relates to, thank you, Tien Wong. As it relates to inorganic, our capital deployed, we've updated. We may be a bit lighter at $2 to 3 billion, but relative from a margin profile, no change there. So let me just peel this back a little bit.\nIn this quarter, we did see a decrease in our gross margin, primarily due to higher subcontractor costs and the impact of our business optimization actions, which reduced severance costs in Q2 of last year. As you know, this fluctuates quarter to quarter, which is really why we manage the overall operating margin. As you think about our operating margin for the year, based upon where we are, we now expect a 10 to 20 basis point expansion for the year while continuing to invest significantly in our business and our people. Look, we're seeing the variability in the operating margin throughout the year that we expected.\nSo what are we focused on? Pricing, which this quarter was relatively stable, how we deliver our contracts, and how we run our business, which includes managing supply and demand and digitizing and making our own operations more efficient. So we feel really good about our full-year guidance of 10 to 20 basis points, which includes EPS growth at 5% to 7%.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And Tien-Tsin Huang, we always update. We typically update about this time. We just don't see; we didn't see the 30 basis points. It's a super competitive market. So while pricing's relatively stable, as we've been talking about, it's a competitive market, so.\n\nTina Wong\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. No, that's all clear. Thanks for going through that. Just my follow-up. I think Jason Kupferberg asked about federal ready. Maybe I'll ask it differently. Is there a way to frame the real revenue at risk? I know mission critical is maybe hard to define it here on the call, but is there anything that you can share in terms of what's really at risk or not at risk, thinking about duration? Or is it really more of an issue of replenishing work, etc.? Just trying to get a better understanding of visibility there. Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. So, Tien-Tsin Huang, what I would say is, and what we've been clear about, is the guided range we're giving for the quarter and for the year reflects our best view of the impact that's coming from both the slowing of new procurement actions and the assessments of the work that we're doing.\nAnd so we don't get into different pieces of it, but we can see on one thing that we're looking at both two things: the range of outcomes, and that's reflected in the range. I mean, it is 8% of our business. We have lots of other parts of our business that are about that size that we are always looking at estimates and assumptions. This is our best view of it today, and the range reflects it.\n\nTina Wong\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. No, your view is better than mine, and glad to see the bottom end of the range taken up here. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one is, Julie, just thinking about how budgets were set and how conversations maybe changed from January, February, to March. Could you give us some color on that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nI'd start with, as we went into this calendar year, we did not see kind of across the board a meaningful increase in budgets for our services. We saw more of the same, which is consistent with what we've been talking about. As we went into the budgets, as the budgets were set, it was kind of more of the same. It's pretty early right now in terms of processing, right, what just happened. There's a lot of different things that can happen, right? So you sometimes see clients reprioritizing, like maybe they'll go faster on the cost cutting than on some of the building and that.\nEven that kind of a conversation, it's super early, right? So what we are seeing, though, is a continuation that these conversations always turn to, \"Okay, we got to go faster, and we got to go bigger.\" This theme around cost and growth, because that's really the unique way that we can help clients.\nSo one of the examples that I gave in the script around a major manufacturer of food supplies is all about when you are better managing inventory and supply chain; that's both driving growth and, at the same time, self-funding big transformation programs. So I think right now, if you think about just what is the impact of an elevated level of uncertainty, it's the same thing as what we've been seeing, like more desire to do larger transformation. And while we're at it, because I'm sure the question will come, discretionary spending this quarter, Q2, was overall about the same, still constrained.\nThere were some pockets of improvement, for example, in banking and capital markets in the Americas. But again, going into the calendar year, discretionary spending was overall about the same constraint, and particularly in small deals that we've been seeing. So yeah, that's kind of where we are.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nI would just add, Julie, thanks for that. I would just add that as you think about our guidance for the full year as well, what it assumes is discretionary spend does not have to improve at the top end of the range while it continues to allow for further deterioration at the bottom.\n\nBrian King\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, Angie, as my follow-up, I was going to ask, if you take that midpoint of that Q3 constant currency revenue, you get to about five. It implies Q4 revenue range looks a little wider than usual and maybe a couple points lower than the Q3. So just kind of what's built in? Are you building in a little bit of a slowdown in organic growth in that fourth quarter, or is that just some level of elevated uncertainty that goes into the fourth quarter number? Thanks so much.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nAnd Bryan, your math is right. So we have seen an elevated level of uncertainty, and so we spoke about that. And you're correct that as you think about our inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3% for the full year, it was roughly 4% in the first half. We're expecting about 2% in the second half, which means really importantly that our organic growth for the full year is now 2% to 4%.\n\nBrian King\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. And our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Good job. I guess my first question, health and public services typically is kind of flattish sequentially in Q2. It was down about 5% sequentially. I guess kind of asking Jason's question too is, is some of that US federal, or are there other parts of health and public services that were weaker than normal? I'm just trying to understand that.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHi, David. Good morning. Nothing to read into that. We didn't see any material impact within HMPS. It just ebbs and flows over the quarters, and so nothing to really comment there.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Just as a follow-up, I think you might have mentioned pricing was pretty stable. I looked back the last seven quarters. You called pricing as being down a bit. I mean, are we starting to get back to a more stable environment for pricing?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo as you think about our pricing, we did comment that it was relatively stable. The market continues to be very competitive. And so what you can count on us to do is we're always focused on it. And just as a reminder, pricing is the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYep. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Fossett\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. As we talk about the little bit of the slowdown that you've seen in recent weeks, how would you characterize it geographically or industry vertical, just trying to get a little more color there? And what do you think those customers are looking for in terms of their proceed, or continue to pause, or hesitate type of decision-making?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, James. I want to be clear. We haven't seen a slowdown in the last few weeks. What we commented on, which I think is kind of everyone's well aware of, is in the last few weeks, there's been an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty. There's a couple of big themes around that. Obviously, tariffs, and that's a global discussion. That is not just an American discussion. Also, consumer sentiment, which is a little bit more of an American discussion. So we're really just commenting on what I think we're all seeing, and that's only been in the last few weeks.\nSo we're already, of course, in the heart of the discussions of clients globally who are talking about it. You're seeing, for example, in Europe, there was an announcement of major spending in areas like defense where we've been investing in a well-positioned.\nBy the way, I do want to shout out to my UK team. Hopefully, all of you noticed that the UK is back, and we're driving our revenue. It's a great example of how we address challenges by leveraging our ability to invest. We've done a lot of acquisitions there. The agility, the use of data and AI, which are all driving the repositioning that you're starting to now see in the UK. So again, we have a lot of diversification of our business.\nWhen you think about the Americas and the agenda now in federal with respect to consolidating, modernizing, and reinventing the federal government, we're incredibly well-positioned because we've been driving already a lot of efficiency in the federal government with the work we've been doing for decades.\nWe're now bringing that reinvention that we've been doing now for a few years, those commercial solutions. We've got the ability to bring that to the federal government as they move forward with their agenda. The conversation's global, lots of opportunities that depend on the market. We have a really strong position. I'll just flag again the 32 clients this quarter who did over $100 million of bookings.\n\nJames Fossett\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great and great clarification. I appreciate that. Then I want to touch quickly on your AI and AI initiatives, etc. Can you give a little bit of color on how that's developing with your software partners, what kinds of improvements, or adjustments, and go-to-market that may entail? Just trying to get a sense for how you're working with the broader ecosystem to really drive results.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, James, the ecosystem is absolutely critical here. This is where decades of relationships really matter because GenAI is a new technology. The adoption of AI more broadly is new. It wasn't being adopted as much. And so we work so closely with our partners and the client really in three-way conversations and work in order to reinvent and do that. We're not taking things off the shelf and say, \"Here, go do this.\" And as you know, we are the leader with our ecosystem partners. And that has been a major differentiating factor when you look at our growth, particularly in these large deals where the ecosystem is absolutely at the heart of it.\nAnd by the way, I'm glad that you commented on the GenAI because I think it's important as we think about how GenAI is developing that we don't walk past that. In H1, we did $1.1 billion in revenue. Last year in FY24, we did $900 million for the entire year. So you're starting to see the leadership that we have in GenAI really come through on the revenue side.\n\nJames Fossett\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. Julie, hoping you're feeling well. I want to start on bookings. Can you just give us a sense on Q2 bookings, how they landed relative to your plan? Understanding just elevated uncertainty may extend signings. I'm just curious if that did, in fact, play out in Q2. Can you comment on how you feel you're set up for the second half in bookings?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, just as a reminder, that elevated uncertainty has been in the last few weeks. So no impact on our bookings.\nAnd Angie, do you want to add anything?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Bryan. So for us, we were pleased with our bookings this quarter of $20.9 billion. And importantly, our book-to-bill was 1.3. And again, reinforcing being the partner of choice for our clients with 32 clients with quarterly bookings over $100 million. So we feel really good about that.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. And then on the workforce, can you comment on how you're managing that mix of subcontractors versus employees? And is that higher subcon mix in the quarter just some form of a transition component as you've taken actions on bench across the organization? Or are there certain service types where you're having to lean a little bit more on that subcon mix?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nBrian, I think that as you think about our subcontractor and our workforce mix, certainly that can fluctuate quarter to quarter based upon the work that we're doing for our clients. As it relates to this quarter, you saw that we added a little bit over 2,000 people in Q2. As always, what we are all about is managing our supply and demand, including through the use of technology and reskilling. So for us, as you think about our workforce overall, subcontractors can fluctuate. At the same time, what we focus on is our utilization, which continues to be 91%, which is exactly the range that we want to be in.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Keith Bachman at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYes. Good morning. Thank you. Perhaps I'll ask my two just concurrently since they're on similar veins. On the first one, one of the previous questions was asking about AI more from the demand side or revenue side. I wanted to go back to the supply side and delivery side. While I think it's still really early in the life of GenAI because most of the work is actually still test, not inferencing, but are you seeing any changes in the nature of your economic relationship with your customers?\nIn other words, are customers asking for some of the savings, or is there any change in that narrative on how the supply side and economic relationship, broadly speaking, with your customers may unfold as GenAI matures a little bit?\nAnd then the second part of the question is, I wanted to just jump into Song for a bit and sort of the same type of question. I spent the last day with Adobe at their user group conference, and there's tremendous efficiency gains associated with both marketing and creativity. And just, Julie, any comments? I know you mentioned Song had double-digit growth, which is quite impressive. How do you see the durable growth rate of Song? And so that's it for me. And Julie, all the best to you in particular.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Keith. I think in the first question, what we've been seeing with GenAI is what we've seen in the past when we have new technologies. I take you back to 2015 when we first announced MyWizard, which we now call GenWizard as we've introduced GenAI.\nThat was that major shift that occurred with respect to automation, which, by the way, is still relevant, right? We are not seeing a different change. We've been continuously, particularly on the managed service side, our contracts assume that there's going to be more efficiency driven from technology. GenAI is allowing that to kind of go up over time. But the way that the model's working is just very similar to what we've seen with prior waves of big efficiencies from technology. We're not seeing new patterns evolve there. Of course, really, our strategy is to lead in both helping our clients use GenAI, but also to lead in our own use of GenAI.\nAt the same time, it is still early in the technology. It's still expensive. You have to get to the right ROI in terms of when to use it. It requires our clients to have foundations in place. This isn't just, sort of, push a button and we can have GenAI. And so we should expect that. Remember that this is still very early in the technology cycle. Excuse me. With respect to Song, one of the big areas that we're helping our clients on is build the data foundation in order to use the GenAI because those efficiencies that you're seeing, and as you know, we're Adobe's major partner, require the right data foundation.\nAnd they require really the reinvention of processes. We've seen that in our own marketing where we've been using agentic AI, but you had to completely change the way that you're doing marketing. So Song's durability is being at the heart of building the digital core and helping them do the reinvention while leading in our own use of GenAI, which is what we continue to be focused on.\nSo I feel very good about Song. And importantly, our diversification is we want to be relevant to all parts of the enterprise and the growth agenda, which is what Song positions us, in addition to our entire ability to be at the core operations and at the enterprise. So really very pleased with how our strategy to be relevant across the enterprise continues to give us resilience in the market.\n\nKeith Bachman",
    "content2": "Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Jonathan Lee at Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Lee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to clarify the change in the revenue outlook here. Your original outlook contemplated status quo at the high end of the outlook. Is that still the case? And is that indexed to what you're seeing today with the elevated uncertainty, but not necessarily any sort of slowdown?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. Yes, that's correct. So with our assumptions, the range of five to seven, which we raised for the full year, is a discretionary spend, does not have to improve at the top end of the range. While at the bottom of the range, it allows for further deterioration.\n\nJonathan Lee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThanks for that, Angie. Then on the pricing front, it's good to hear about the pricing stability you're seeing despite the competitive environment. How do we think through the timing in which it takes stable pricing to flow through the P&L, especially as it looks like we're still digesting some of the pricing headwinds we've been seeing over the last few quarters?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nAs you think about pricing, it does take time for it to layer in. And certainly, it depends on the mix of the deals that we're selling as well. So we'll see that come through over time.\n\nJonathan Lee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you. Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys, thanks. And Julie, I just want to wish you. Echo that and wish you my best as well. When we think about what we're seeing in terms of the larger transformational contracts that are benefiting you so much this year despite slower discretionary or not a real improvement in discretionary yet, just remind us again where you are on that path. I mean, again, bookings was a question before. It was up. Maybe it was more or less flat year over year, but your book-to-bill is still very strong, obviously.\nAnd so just help us understand what you're seeing in terms of the most transformational contracts right now that can give us room despite sort of whatever outcomes are on the discretionary. And then one quick follow-up, Julie. I know when we spoke last, you talked about how there was so much in terms of waiting by executive CIOs, CEOs, and others on tariffs and some of the policies you talked about earlier.\nIf we do get some resolution on that in the next couple of months, 2 April could be a big day for the administration in terms of explaining. I mean, how much have you heard from your customers on how much they're just really waiting? There's pent-up demand budget. Just help us understand that a little more if you can.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. So on the demand side, the 32 clients with bookings over 100 million continue to show that we're executing on that strategy. But what clients want to buy are larger transformational deals. They want the reinvention, and we continue to execute on that too, again, because we're going where the demand is, right? So that same sort of view of continuing to make sure that we're having those larger deals that will continue to layer in is the strategy, and really no change there because that's the demand, right?\nWe need to be focused on where clients are buying. Then, again, what I would say on how things might layer in, CEOs are actually focused on how do I succeed regardless of the level of uncertainty. The conversations we're having are not, \"Hey, what happens if the tariffs, this gets resolved, etc.?\" It's, \"Okay. We have a higher level of uncertainty than we did 90 days ago. And so how do we then reinvent faster, right? What do we need to shift to?\" CEOs, and this is not from this.\nThis has been going on for now for a few years, right? They're embracing that their responsibility is to grow regardless of what has been, in my tenure as CEO in the last six years, a series of a lot of different events. That's why, as we think about our own business, right, we continue to anchor on the characteristics that have allowed us to be the leader over these different cycles. That's the deep client relationships. Our top 100 clients, we've been with for over 10 years. The diversification of geographies, industries. I do want to give a shout-out to all my industry teams, the industry groups.\nWe had broad-based growth, but it allows us for that diversification as well as types of work. Then the all-important ecosystem relationships and our leadership in GenAI and technology, those are the building blocks of our resilient business. We all, our CEOs and ourselves, have to be agile to succeed in whatever market. That is what our range reflects. The fact that we took the bottom off of the range reflects our belief in our resilient model as we continue to navigate.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful, Julie. Just a quick follow-up would be on AI again, on DeepSeek, just given the developments. I mean, has there been more of an emphasis around it, just given the ability to use even more efficient systems? Or just help us understand in terms of, I know you've said before, 10% of customers might actually have the infrastructure ready. So we still have a lot of work to do to prepare. Has there been an acceleration in the momentum, or is it the same as it was the last couple of quarters? Thanks again.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you very much. We are seeing increasing numbers of clients embracing GenAI. Really, that is, in our view, DeepSeek is an interesting development. It's an example of the ongoing technology developments. But the reason they're embracing it is that they're seeing the proven value. And that is why we continue to grow because we're the ones in our client base helping our clients get to that value. And you saw that in a lot of the examples we've been giving. So there's an increasing number of clients embracing it as companies are seeing it. And there is no view that you can sit back, right, and wait on this.\nAnd that, two years in, is very evident in our conversations with clients. Thank you. Well, thank you again for joining. Before we wrap up, I have two updates versus many as you know. Last month, I did announce that I had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Just want to let everyone know I'm feeling good.\nMy treatment is on track, and my prognosis continues to be excellent. I have received so many well wishes, including on this call. And I just want to thank everyone for all of their support. It has meant a lot. I also want to thank Katie O'Conor, our head of investor relations. She has been an amazing partner to me, to Casey, and to now Angie for the last three years. We've asked her to take on a very important new role as the CFO of Avanade, our joint venture with Microsoft. I know we're all going to miss her in this role, and we're super excited to see Katie take on this next chapter of her very impressive career.\nSo thank you very much, Katie. And I'm also very pleased to welcome Alexia Quadrani, who will become our new head of investor relations. Alexia joins us from The Walt Disney Company, where she was the Executive Vice President of investor relations and shareholder services. Prior to that, she spent over 20 years as an equity analyst at JP Morgan.\nI know she's really looking forward to getting to know all of you in the days ahead, and I'm super happy to welcome her to Accenture. Finally, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We are working every day to continue to earn that trust. Finally, a huge thank you to all of our people for what you're doing every day. I will speak with all of you next quarter. Thanks again for joining.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The conference is now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation.\nYou may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O'Connor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our First Quarter fiscal 2025 Earnings Announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Connor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. Angie will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide an update on our market positioning before Angie provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2025.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings.\nThese risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com.\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thank you to our nearly 799,000 people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in a strong quarter of financial results creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I am very pleased with our performance this quarter as we delivered on our strategy to position Accenture for strong growth in fiscal year 2025. Here are a few highlights of the 360-degree value we created.\nOur clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, and we are their reinvention partner of choice, as reflected in our bookings of $18.7 billion, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million.\nWe grew 8% in local currency this quarter, with revenue of $17.7 billion, approximately $240 million above the top end of our guided range, and continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We had another milestone quarter in GenAI with $1.2 billion in bookings and approximately $500 million in revenue.\nOperating margin was flat compared to adjusted operating margin last year. EPS grew 10% over Q1 adjusted FY24 EPS, while we continued to invest in our business and our people with $242 million deployed primarily across five acquisitions and with approximately 14 million training hours this quarter designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills, and reinvent our services using GenAI. This averages 19 hours per person.\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 69,000, continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of fiscal year 2026. We are proud to be recognized by Fortune as one of the world's best workplaces, jumping from number 10 to number six. This recognition is important as it is based on feedback from our people around the world.\nAn essential part of our strategy is having access to the best people, and being an attractive workplace is critical to our success. In recognition of our strong brand, we are proud to earn our highest brand value to date on Interbrand's prestigious Best Global Brands list, increasing to $21.9 billion and ranking number 31. We continue to invest in creating and maintaining thriving communities, which our long-term growth depends on.\nThis quarter, among other things, Accenture has partnered with the NGO Instituto PROA in Brazil to help transform the lives of low-income youth by providing them with digital skills to enter the workforce. I am very pleased with our results this quarter and our return to broad-based growth due to our strategy to be our client's reinvention partner of choice. We also have a resilient business model with diversity across markets, industries, and the types of work our clients come to us for, both consulting type of work and managed services. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and happy holidays to all of you. Thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased\nwith our results in Q1, which exceeded our expectations and reflected momentum across our business. We are particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth, which was broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups, and consulting and managed services, demonstrating we are a leader in the market as a trusted reinvention partner for our clients.\nBased on the strength of our Q1 results, we are increasing our full-year revenue outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in our call. Let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 8% in local currency above the top end of our guided range, with six of our 13 industries growing double digits, and we continue to take market share.\nWe delivered EPS in the quarter at $3.59, reflecting 10% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Operating margin was 16.7% for the quarter, consistent with adjusted Q1 results last year, and includes significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $870 million and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $242 million, primarily attributed to five acquisitions in the quarter.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $18.7 billion for the quarter, representing 1% growth in both U.S. dollars and local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $9.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed Services bookings were $9.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Turning now to revenues.\nRevenues for the quarter were $17.7 billion, a 9% increase in U'S.dollars and 8% in local currency, approximately $240 million above the top end of our guided range. The foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately positive 1% compared with the positive 1.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 7% in US dollars and 6% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $8.6 billion, up 11% in both US dollars and local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Technology Managed Services, which includes our Application Managed Services and Infrastructure Managed Services, and high single-digit growth in Operations.\nTurning to our geographic markets, in the Americas, revenues grew 11% in local currency. Growth was led by industrial, Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets, and Consumer Goods Retail and Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States and Argentina.\nIn EMEA, revenues grew 6% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Life Sciences, and Health, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Italy, partially offset by a decline in France. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered 4% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in Utilities, Industrial, and Health, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was led by Japan, which represents approximately half of Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in Singapore and Australia.\nMoving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.6% for the first quarter last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 10.5% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year.\nBefore I continue, I want to note that in Q1 of last year, we recorded $140 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 90 basis points and EPS by $0.17. Following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Operating income was $2.9 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.7% operating margin, consistent with adjusted operating margin in Q1 of last year.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.2% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.59 compared with adjusted EPS of $3.27 in the first quarter last year, reflecting 10% growth over adjusted EPS in Q1 last year. Days sales outstanding were 50 days compared to 46 days last quarter, and 49 days in the first quarter of last year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $870 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $152 million. Following the completion of our $5 billion inaugural debt offering, our cash balance at 30 November was $8.3 billion compared with $5 billion at 31 August.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.5 million shares for $898 million at an average price of $355.03 per share. As of 30 November, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $926 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year.\nOur board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on 14 February 2025, a 15% increase over last year. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are off to a strong start in FY25. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, we saw more of the same. Our clients are focused on reinvention, which means large-scale transformations. We do not currently see an improvement in overall spending by our clients, particularly on smaller deals. When those market conditions improve, we will be well-positioned to capitalize on them as we continue to meet the demand for the critical programs our clients are prioritizing.\nAs expected, building the strong digital core required for reinvention was a strong driver of our growth this quarter. GenAI continues to be a catalyst for reinvention across the enterprise, and building out the data foundation necessary to capitalize on AI is an increasing part of that growth. Themes around achieving both cost efficiencies and growth continue across the demand we're seeing.\nThrough the examples from Q1, you can see both our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice and how we are bringing together our services, our ecosystem relationships, and our scaled investments in cutting-edge platforms like SynOps and GenWizard, as well as technologies like GenAI to drive value for our clients. We are helping our clients build their digital core, including in the cloud, which saw double-digit growth this quarter.\nAccenture Federal Services is working with the US Air Force, the nation's military service air branch, on a cloud modernization journey to manage its complex IT environment so that military personnel can maintain their competitive edge. We will develop a multi-cloud ecosystem using services from multiple providers to create a robust, secure, and integrated infrastructure. This will enhance how different systems and devices work together and communicate to quickly implement cutting-edge tools and technologies.\nWe also provide managed services that foster collaboration and enable personnel to quickly make data-driven decisions about their cloud usage and costs while adapting to changing mission requirements. This partnership will enable the US Air Force to get the most out of their cloud investments to achieve real-time cross-cost transparency, accelerated cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved agility.\nOur industry expertise is critical to building the right digital core. We are partnering with the BCC Iccrea Group, Italy's largest cooperative banking group, through a joint venture with its IT subsidiary on a reinvention journey to help over 100 affiliated banks grow. Our managed services will modernize the IT platform and migrate applications to the cloud, enhancing resiliency, stability, and service quality. We will also consolidate data and build an integrated cloud platform for advanced analytics and AI, strengthening their digital core.\nGenAI will be applied to increase internal IT efficiency and reduce customer response time on digital interaction channels. We will expand digital offerings, employee onboarding, and payments using our suite of shared finance services solutions. A change management communications program will offer targeted upskilling and reskilling opportunities to ensure employees use new technologies and methodologies effectively.\nTogether, we will help BCC Iccrea Group reduce costs and drive innovation, enabling the banking group to be more competitive and bring new products and services to market faster. Security is an absolutely essential component of every company's digital core, and we again saw very strong double-digit growth. We are the partner of choice in part because we bring both the understanding of cross-industry threats and industry-specific threats with our deep experience across 13 industry groups.\nWe are supporting a leading aircraft manufacturer in its cybersecurity across Aerospace and Defense, on critical infrastructure and production systems. We will provide managed services and solutions for their cybersecurity capability, leading to a more powerful and secure program, bringing security by design in industrial assets and the extended enterprise.\nOur solutions will help provide improved security and meet regulatory compliance. We are also helping with the digitization of manufacturing and supply chains. Industry X grew double digits this quarter. We are continuing to evolve our long-time partnership with a global leader in tire manufacturing to revolutionize the way factories operate and to reduce time to market for new products, accelerating innovation. We will build a hybrid data foundation in the cloud, integrating millions of data points. We will also implement advanced analytics, AI, and digital twin technologies to optimize operations processes such as quality checks.\nThis will enable the company to trace the root cause of a failed batch of tires back to a machine or process in minutes instead of days. Predictive maintenance will pinpoint what parts of their process or machinery may be impacting quality and productivity, preventing costly downtimes. Engineering teams will benefit from machine learning and simulation tools to generate and optimize the design of new products.\nWe will also implement new ways of working to attract tech-savvy talent and cultivate a learning culture where employees in over 100 factories are upskilled on the AI-powered tools. The company will look to increase growth opportunities and support their digital-first strategy, all while remaining competitive in the market. We are partnering with Puma India, a leader in sports lifestyle products, to reinvent their supply chain and distribution network.\nThis will meet the ever-evolving customer demand for order delivery in a highly competitive omnichannel market where quick commerce is becoming the norm. We will use data and AI to identify and set up localized fulfillment centers, optimizing their size and location based on customer sales. Digital twins of these facilities will simulate various process designs and physical automation scenarios to identify bottlenecks.\nThis will help redefine warehouse layouts and improve material flow for more efficient order and return processing, delivering orders up to 70% faster, with express delivery for online orders expected to double. Supply chain costs are also expected to decrease by up to 10%, and additional features like solar power and EV charging stations at fulfillment centers will further reduce costs and support sustainability goals.\nPuma India will be the first amongst sports brands in the region to build this type of cutting-edge operating model, enhancing customer loyalty to drive future growth. We are reinventing all things customer through Song, which grew high single digits this quarter. We have the ability to integrate creative data and AI, tech and strategy, while leveraging our industry, and operations expertise to unlock marketing as a growth enabler for our clients while delivering efficiencies.\nWe are helping Spotify optimize its advertising business by finding opportunities to drive efficiency as it scales globally. Our marketing operations managed services support their ad operations under a single roof, touching a significant amount of their ad revenue across 150 markets.\nWe've infused automation across their operational workflows to help significantly reduce the time and effort required to launch advertisers' campaigns, getting them to market more quickly to help ensure revenue realization and advertiser satisfaction. We continue to expand beyond ad operations, actively launching new capabilities across analytics and insights, data integrity and enrichment, customer support, and more. Our partnership helps Spotify to focus on its core competencies so it can achieve long-term relevance and growth in an increasingly competitive market.\nWe are collaborating with CaixaBank, a leading financial group in Spain, on their plan to enhance customer and employee experiences. We will increase productivity and efficiency by leveraging AI and GenAI to build multiple solutions, such as the bank's chatbot, which has significantly reduced response times and improved the quality of answers for clients, and an employee assistant tool that utilizes natural language conversations and solution searches.\nWe will also build a customer service claims solution that analyzes documents and supports agents and lawyers in proposing the right responses, reducing processing time and assisting specialized teams. This will help CaixaBank reinvent with GenAI. We are creating real value from GenAI across industries and countries.\nWe are partnering with Vale, a Brazilian mining and logistics company, to transform its environmental licensing program, speeding up permit applications and expanding its sustainability goals. We created Smart Licensing, an end-to-end licensing management platform that uses GenAI to scan application materials and environmental studies to promote compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements.\nThis creates actionable summaries, reducing internal document reviews from days to minutes. We've trained over 500 people to use Smart Licensing and established a change management team to combine previously segmented teams, helping Vale plan and execute more efficiency while further reducing environmental impact.\nWe are partnering with Indosat, a digital telecommunications company, and its subsidiary, Lintasarta, a leading provider of data communication, internet, and IT services, to launch Indonesia's first sovereign AI cloud platform. This will accelerate their AI-driven digital transformation and support the country's vision of becoming a digitally empowered nation by 2045.\nThe collaboration will initially focus on AI solutions for Indonesia's financial services sector, one of the key pillars of the country's economy. Accenture's AI Refinery platform will provide scaled AI capabilities with pre-built solutions that have a modular architecture to meet clients' needs wherever they are in their AI journey, significantly reducing time to value. This partnership will help Indonesian companies to drive reinvention by harnessing the power of scaled GenAI, propelling innovation, operational efficiency, and sustainable growth in a competitive market.\nTalent continues to be at the top of the agenda for CEOs and governments, and our Learning Managed Services position us to be able to help clients invest in their workforce. Our partnership with S&P Global, a leading provider of financial data analytics and ratings, is driving GenAI innovation across the financial services industry, empowering their workforce to adopt GenAI at scale to enhance productivity and deliver revenue growth.\nThey are equipping nearly 40,000 of their employees with the necessary skills, leveraging Accenture Learning Managed Services, a comprehensive GenAI learning program. This program includes curated and customized content to drive AI fluency and address the industry's evolving talent requirements. Finally, a quick look at how we're continually using our investments and acquisitions to drive our future growth.\nTo continue to scale Learning Managed Services, we acquired Award Solutions in the US, which expands our learning offerings tailored to the unique needs of the network leaders, network operations, and performance engineers, and IT professionals in the telecom space. To enable us to scale faster in Health, a $70 billion addressable market growing approximately 6%, we acquired Consus Health, a leading German healthcare management consultancy.\nHealth is an industry still early in digitalization, and our investments are positioning us for the continued growth we see over the next several years. Supply chain continues to be early in digitalization, and we are investing to continue to drive growth.\nThis quarter, we acquired Camelot, an international SAP-focused management and technology consulting firm from Germany with specific strengths in supply chain, data and analytics, and Joshua Tree Group in the US, a supply chain consulting firm specializing in distribution center performance. Back to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook.For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.2 to 16.8 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reflects an estimated 5 to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2025, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2024.\nFor the full fiscal 2025, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 4 to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2024, which includes an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3%, which we expect will be about 4% in the first half and about 2% in the second half. We continue to expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 to be 15.6% to 15.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2024 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2024.\nWe now expect our full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $12.43 to 12.79, or 4% to 7% growth over adjusted fiscal 2024 results, reflecting the raise in our revenue outlook and adjusting for the revised FX assumption. For the full fiscal 2025, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.4 to 10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 to 9.5 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Today's first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. It's really encouraging to see the revenue come in here above the guidance range. I think it's the widest margin in nearly two years.\nJulie, you said that the demand environment is more or less the same. So I'm curious what you attribute this new pattern to and if market conditions are maybe improving underneath here. Any comments?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Tien-tsin Huang. This is the strategy that we've been outlining for the last few quarters, where last year, when we saw the constrained spending, particularly on the smaller deals, we pivoted to really focusing on winning more reinvention partners of choice. So increasing the number of our deals that were over 100 million in a quarter. You'll remember last year, we actually had 125 of those. And the idea was to go after the demand, which is in the larger reinventions, and that that would position us to get back to strong growth in 2025 as those deals begin to layer in.\nWhat you're seeing is the result of what we're really proud of: quite a bit of agility last year that when the market changed, we changed. Because as you know, these are not easy deals to do quickly, and we quickly pivoted last year, went after the demand, and then put ourselves in this position. That's why we did underscore that the market environment has not changed.\nThis is the result of the strategy we executed, which we're uniquely able to do because we have all the skills and capabilities. We have the mix of consulting and managed services. This is what we were talking about last quarter when we said we're going to get back to strong growth based on execution of this strategy. Of course, these are super critical strategic programs.\nAnd so when spending does come back and the market does improve, we're at the heart of our client's business, and we should be well capitalized to pick up on that spending.\n\nTien Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. No, the last point is important. Short-term stuff comes back. You should see that pretty quickly as well on top of this. So good. Thanks. I have my follow-up. Just had to ask it. I get a lot of questions on the US federal government and Accenture's exposure there. I think it's about 8% of revenue based on some of your annual report disclosure. So just curious, given some of the change in administration and this discussion around efficiency, have your expectations or are you going to change your strategy here on the US federal government side? Any comments there would be terrific. Thanks for the time.\nYeah.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, we're really excited because our core competencies in federal, right, are around driving efficiencies. They're around helping keep our country secure. We're working with the US federal agency on securing critical infrastructure, right, and on changing citizen services. We work across very important agencies. And so we believe that we're super well-positioned to continue to help the mission of the federal government to secure itself, to help citizens, and to drive more efficiencies, which will be tied very much to cloud, data, and AI.\nAnd what really makes us uniquely positioned is that we believe that there's going to be an even greater appetite of taking commercial solutions to the federal government. And we are very uniquely positioned because we have strong government expertise, but we've got commercial and private sector solutions. We're the leader with every major ecosystem partner.\nYou saw that I was talking today about the US Air Force and what we're doing on the cloud modernization. Our work is mission-critical. I mean, the vast majority of what we do is mission-critical to the federal government. We see a real opportunity to continue to partner with the new administration as we've partnered with all administrations and also with all of the leaders in the federal government who every day are waking up to really drive those three things. Really, really feel good about where we are positioned in the federal government to help this agenda.\n\nTien Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Reseacrh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Happy holidays.\nI know that last quarter, you indicated the high end of the initial revenue guide for this fiscal year did not require any material improvement in consulting. I'm just wondering if that's still the case as you're now raising the top end a little bit, or are you now assuming any improvement in consulting since you're almost four months into the new fiscal year?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYes. Hi, Jason. Good morning. I'll take that. For us, with the raise in the four to seven for the full year, there's really no change in what we shared with you before, which is that at the top end of the range, we continue to see more of the same, whereas at the bottom of the range, we see a bit more; we allow for a little bit more deterioration. So no change there.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah.\nOur overdelivery, I mean, we're very pleased, obviously, with consulting and managed service growth this quarter. These large deals came in a little bit better, which is how we overdelivered, and are now raising the guidance.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Reseacrh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat to hear. Then just looking at the net headcount adds cumulatively over the past two quarters, I think we're almost 50,000. That was a pretty big step up from what the prior trend looked like. Can you give us any sense of how much of that was from acquisitions versus organic? I guess, is there any reason to not look at this accelerated hiring as kind of a bullish indicator?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nLet me take that question as it relates to the net people adds that we had in Q1.\nSo we did add about 24,000 people in the first quarter, which is really reflective of the momentum that we see in our business. And managing supply and demand is a core competency of ours. And what you see is the continued high utilization rates at around 90%. Looking ahead, we'll continue to hire for the demand that we see and the skills that we need.\nAnd I would give you a little bit more context that the hiring that we saw this quarter, similar to last, was that it was concentrated in India.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And I would just say that underlying our guidance, right, you're seeing organic momentum, right? So at the high end of our guidance, for the year, we're going to exit at four. The range of organic growth in our guidance is one to four, right?\nSo I think that it is a positive sign that we're hiring. And some of it's coming from acquisitions, but we are seeing organic momentum in our business.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Reseacrh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for the comments.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Congrats on the solid result and happy holidays. Kind of asking the guidance question a little bit differently. The 4% to 7% constant currency revenue guide for fiscal 2025 is a touch below just the Q1 number of 8% on a constant currency basis. So just trying to think about if there's any reason why the growth would decelerate off the Q1 level as we get more into fiscal 2025.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hey, Brian. Happy holidays to you as well.\nLet me give you, here's how we were thinking about our guidance for the full year and the raise to 4% to 7%. If you think about where we are, we had a strong start in Q1. We had strong guidance in Q2, which was really driven. It was broad-based and driven by our organic growth. At the same time, you heard Julie say the macro remains the same. There's no change in the overall environment.\nI want to reinforce, importantly, what I said earlier, which was we do expect, we continue to expect inorganic contribution of about a bit over 3%. And one of the things that we provided to you was how that will come in. So H1, we expect somewhere around about 4%. Second half, about 2%.\nThat will give you more of an understanding of how we see organic playing out for the year. We will continue to see organic throughout this fiscal year. Then as it relates to if you think about it, we're one quarter in. We've got one quarter under our belt. We've got three more to go. As Julie said earlier, we're executing on our strategy, and you can count on us to continue to do so.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Got it. That's helpful. Then maybe you guys could just talk a little bit about the industry group, the financial services. A lot of times, that kind of leads out of economic slowdowns.\nBut it sounds like Banking & Capital Markets was a little bit softer, but some other areas of strength, and just trying to figure out where that is in the industry right now because we're kind of getting mixed messages from some of the other IT service providers. Thanks so much.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And I think it's a little bit different by market, right? So we're seeing the results a bit different by market. I will say, by the way, that we were pleased to see the UK, as you might have heard, is coming back as we repositioned the UK. But with the dynamics in the US market, where it's a little bit better, in EMEA, it was a little bit worse. And you've got a mixed picture on the interest rates and what the expectations are. And so I'd say that and that is probably not a surprise.\nYesterday probably complicated that a little bit in the US, right? And so on the one hand, we're seeing a lot of interest, for example, in Banking and Capital Markets on things like GenAI. On the other hand, there's a lot that's being kind of processed with what's going to happen with interest rates and that. And so we see, obviously, it's getting better, but it is a mixed picture by region.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And just as a reminder, Brian, we look at financial services overall. We exited Q4 last year with a -2%, and we saw the uptick in the first quarter at 4% globally, which reflects the dynamics that Julie was just describing, which really placed our strengths as you think about the diversity of our business across markets and industries.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys, thanks. Great results. Can we just touch on your potential for visibility this year into budgets and the timing you'd expect again? I know last, I think earlier this year, it was generally in the January/February timeframe, which had moved back up a little bit. But do you still anticipate that kind of visibility at that part of the year where we could get a better picture on whether discretionary is really going to pick up or not?\nAnd then maybe just as a dovetail on that, maybe just conversations you're having right now around AI for next year. Obviously, the bookings keep looking really strong for you guys, which is great. Any more specifics on where you're seeing it incrementally improve? Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Yeah.\nA great understanding of Accenture. January is sort of January. February is where we really see what the client budget's going to be looking at. That's where we get the most visibility. We'll be reporting more on that in the next quarter. You're absolutely right. We do anticipate getting that visibility in January, February. With respect to AI, we're just continuing to see in our conversations, and I've probably talked to 30 CEOs in the last two months, right?\nIt's been a lot of time. Also around the world. It's been a busy travel quarter. I've been in Europe. I've been in Southeast Asia, Australia, and the US. Pretty consistently, clients are seeking to do more in AI, but they're in such different places.\nI mean, I'll be with one bank where we're talking about what is GenAI, AI, why does it matter, and the fact that they're not yet in the cloud. And I'll be talking to another bank where they've been fully in the cloud, and they want to be the first out to use GenAI. And so I think it's hard to generalize. You're still seeing that because the overall spending environment is the same, that those who really want to go into AI are more prioritizing spending as opposed to spending more, right?\nWhere we see the biggest opportunity when companies start to get more confident to spend more is going to be in moving faster with their data foundation that fuels AI and then AI. But right now, it still generally feels more like a prioritization within current budgets. And so we'll see what happens in January and February.\nAnd that's why our strategy has been to pivot there, right? So to go after more than our fair share of those budgets.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right. That's really helpful. Then just when we look at the opportunity for where you're hiring, you mentioned India, but we've heard a lot of customers are starting to think about a little bit even more onshore. So just maybe talk a little bit more about the mix again. It had gone for a while more offshore, looking for better price optimization. But where are we on that right now? Are you seeing any evidence of a shift back to nearshore or onshore? Thanks again, guys. Great job.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nNo big trend. What I'd say is we focus on the G2000, so a lot of our companies are global.\nAnd so they really are looking for optimization of right skills because a big piece of why people, for example, use India is about skills, right? Ten years ago, it was about labor arbitrage, right? Today, it's about the ability to get these skills at scale. What I would say is that we at Accenture are continuing to develop more because in some cases, it's language, right?\nAs you're kind of doing more transformation in new parts of the enterprise where you want maybe language with skills or time zones. So we have a global network with 100 centers around the world. In the US, for example, we've been opening some new centers in underserved environments. We opened a center in The Bronx recently. But all of it is kind of aimed at being very sophisticated. And we see ourselves as part of the integrated talent strategy of our clients.\nIt's like right skills, right time zone, right price continues to be the guiding with, I would say, an emphasis on skills.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Julie. Thanks, Angie.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Julie, I understand that your outlook and you're not really seeing any difference on macro side in your outlook with sort of idiosyncratic growth. But can you maybe discuss a little bit about when you talk with clients, what's the sort of range of outcomes for discretionary increases in the 2025 budget outlook? And how big a factor is rates specifically as a macro impact when they're thinking about that? And do you think that changes materially given the Fed's message yesterday? The rates definitely depend on industry, right?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo if you're a more capital-intensive industry or you're an industry that wants to grow more in acquisitions, the rates, there's lots of puts and takes in doing the range. And I think it's just too early based on yesterday's and a lot of speculation. I mean, our business is very much focused on when there's change, and it doesn't matter what the change is, good or bad change, that's where we really partner with our clients successfully.\nBecause if they've now got new constraints because the rates are higher, then they want more opportunity to cut costs. If the rates are going to fuel things like capital projects, we've got our capital projects business, right? So what we focus on, and I think what we're so successful is we have these deep relationships with our clients. Our top 100, we've been with over 10 years. We understand them.\nWe are always looking at this and saying, \"Okay, what does that mean?\" anticipating what they're helping. So that's whatever the change is, that's where Accenture really can help them pivot. And it's part of our strength that we're so relevant to both growth and cost.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to the AI work, I mean, you talked about some of the context of the client conversations you're having, but quantitatively, are you seeing any kind of major changes in terms of the size and scope of the individual projects? And what are clients saying about sort of their pivot or when they might pivot to sort of larger, more transformative projects within GenAI?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. We're already starting to see that, right? We're starting to see that clients and the characteristics are pretty clear.\nIf you have a client that's been investing in their digital core, including security and data for many years, and we have many of those that we've helped, they're now able to start to scale. We're starting to do that, and we're seeing those partnerships. Where you have clients where we've been helping them prove it and maybe scale in a part of the business, but they really haven't got their data foundation or they're not moving into the cloud, then what they're working with us is how do we accelerate that?\nWhat you probably heard as we were talking through some of the examples today is that there's a lot of data foundation now being built along with getting into modern cloud platforms. So we are seeing an acceleration of the data work, which is absolutely fundamental to using GenAI.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director, Robert W Baird & Co\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Great job. I guess my question just on the fiscal Q2 guide. Historically, Q2 has been a pretty flat sequential quarter. You're guiding, I believe, to down about $1 to 1.5 billion sequentially this quarter. I know a little of that, maybe a few hundred million, FX. I get that. But was there anything in Q1 that's kind of naturally falling off in Q2 this year that's a little unusual or some sequential pattern that's a little different?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYes. David, happy holidays and good morning. As we think about our Q2 guide of 5% to 9%, it's a very solid guide based upon what we see. There's nothing unique in Q2 that I would call out.\nIn fact, just anchoring back to our overdelivery that we saw in the first quarter, it was really a function of the larger deals coming online a bit better than we expected. We continue to see that, which gave us confidence in driving and raising our guidance for the full year. Nothing to call out for Q2.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director, Robert W Baird & Co\n\nGotcha. Yeah. You definitely crushed Q1. Then I guess one just a nerdy kind of financial question. Now that you fully have the debt in place, should we think about a sequential pickup in interest expense? I think it was $30 million in Q1. Does that go to $50 million in Q2 or something like that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Different than giving you the specific numbers. In terms of how to think about it, yes, that is correct.\nBecause there's certain things, of course, that we see in our income below Operations. And what you saw there was the net interest income was lower as a result of we did have average lower cash balances, also lower interest rates. And then we also had the interest expense from our long-term debt. But all of that has been factored in the guidance that we've given. And so it's in there.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director, Robert W Baird & Co\n\nGotcha. Thanks, guys. Great job.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Head of US IT Services and Fintech Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I want to just quickly ask a follow-up on capital structure and allocation. It sounds like you're still quite committed to pursuing both acquisitions as well as capital return. Last year, we looked at we did some essentially debt raise to help fund those priorities. Where are we at from that perspective?\nOr do you feel like we're in a pretty good overall cash position and continue to be able to do that? Or should we expect that at some point, at least over the next couple of years, we could see further increases in debt and debt raising to fund the capital allocation priorities?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hey, James. Nice to talk to you. What a nice start. We were pleased to execute our inaugural bond offering of $5 billion, which we did in October. When we stepped back, it was really a routine review of our capital structure where we tapped the long-term debt market to increase our liquidity for general corporate purposes. What it does is it ultimately optimizes our capital structure and reduces our cost of capital. That said, let me just reinforce for you.\nThere is no change to our capital allocation strategy, which also includes how we look at and use M&A.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. This year, we're going back to kind of more of a business-as-usual. We think it's going to be somewhere around $3 billion. But as we've always said, if there's opportunities or not, we've got the balance sheet. So we could raise debt. But there's no strategy to increase debt. But we might if we had the right opportunities. I mean, last year, we had a great opportunity to double down on strategic acquisitions. And it's served us well as we've gone into this year. This year, we're back to kind of standard around $3 billion, which is kind of the right percentage. So we'll communicate as we go. We always have that flexibility.\nAnd I think that's the strength, if you think about Accenture, is having a strong balance sheet and the flexibility to go after opportunities in the market that drive long-term growth. And that's how we think about the decisions about whether or not to do debt or not.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Head of US IT Services and Fintech Research, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "That's great color there. And then I wanted to ask about the consulting bookings, seeing nice growth and acceleration there. I'm wondering, and I know it's hard given the breadth of Accenture's customer base, but I'm wondering if you can help us maybe generalize what you're seeing in the consulting bookings and if there's a change there. And I guess I'm wondering if we're seeing a focus on cost control versus potential revenue generation or new technology evaluation or how it folds into AI.\nJust any color you could provide on what the tenor of those consulting bookings look like right now.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So maybe just keep in mind that what we're generally bringing to our clients are multi-service solutions. So you might do, as we talked about, we're doing managed services in security. And that requires industry consulting as a part of it to make sure that we're doing all the work. A lot of the reinvention is a lot of process that. So I think I would anchor on there really are two themes that at least when they come to us: they want cost efficiency.\nEvery industry wants a cost efficiency now. And they're looking for growth, or other outcomes, speed to market. So you heard a lot when we talked about what we're doing with CaixaBank. That was both speed to market as well as efficiencies.\nAnd so that's one of the things that we focus on. And that really gives us; it's our unique differentiation because we've got things like Song that's everything about customer, and we can put to that. We understand the industry. So the twin themes here is cost efficiency and growth.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Head of US IT Services and Fintech Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Good morning. Many thanks and happy holidays to everyone. My first question I wanted to ask is around pricing dynamics. And you've indicated that the macro backdrop's fairly steady. You're getting share through skills. And I wanted to ask specifically about some of the legacy areas such as application maintenance, maybe the BPO work.\nOne of your competitors has suggested that pricing is pretty challenging because there aren't enough deals and a lot of folks chasing those deals. But could you specifically address what you're seeing as pricing dynamics during the quarter? Any changes?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nIt's a very competitive market, which is what we've been seeing every quarter. We did see lower pricing across the business, which has been pretty consistent. What I would say is, which makes sense, right? You're in a constrained as we said, the clients have constrained spending, particularly on small deals. So you'd expect it to be constrained. What I would say, though, that AMS, Application Managed Services, is not legacy if you do it the way we do it, right? So what we offer to our clients is we have the talent, the full-stack engineers, the GenAI. We have a platform called GenWizard.\nAnd so clients are coming to us not to say, \"Hey, can you take off my old applications?\" They're coming to us to modernize while taking costs down. And you see that in what the work we're doing; it's very advanced in how we're doing it. And so basically, we call it run to the new, right? It's like have us help you run your applications in order to rotate to the New. So we see this as a critical way that we are at the heart of their business in modernizing their digital core. It's not legacy. Same thing with our Operations business.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Okay. That makes a ton of sense. Thank you, Julie.\nMy follow-up question is, in some of our recent discussions, and to be fair, with software companies, have suggested that Europe's softened in the last 30, 45 days, which makes sense if you just read the newspapers about what's going on in Europe. But have you guys seen any change in the dynamics underpinning Europe and/or changed the perspective that you may have as it relates to European demand over the next 12 months? And that's it for me. Many thanks again and happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks. Well, so our view of European demand over the next 12 months is baked into the rise of our guidance, right? And we're all reading the same papers. Europe is definitely more. Middle East is obviously different. Europe is definitely in a more challenging environment. And you see that with our growth rate there on a relative basis as well.\nBut we feel very good about we have an excellent business in EMEA. We're very relevant to our clients. And so we feel good about our demand environment. And that's fully reflected in the raise and guidance that we just gave you.Thank you. We have the next person.\n\nKatie O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our final question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. I wanted to ask on the service line, sir. Can you comment on performance across strategy consulting, tech services, and Operations?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. All strong this quarter.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Bryan, the thing that I would add to that is we did see broad-based growth.\nIf you look at it from a consulting and a managed services type of work perspective, we had mid-single-digit growth in consulting and 11% growth in managed services. As you think about the rate that we have for the year, which is 4% to 7%, underneath that, we see consulting now in the mid-single-digit range growth and managed services in the mid-to-high range growth.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Then a follow-up here on the workforce and contract profitability. So you noted most headcount was added across India. Can you just comment on what you're seeing there as far as wage inflation dynamics, just given most services companies and GCCs have been leaning in, and particularly amid the competitive pricing environment? Just talk about the levers you have here to mitigate gross margin pressure.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I'll start, Bryan.\nNo real change in terms of the market dynamics of what we see reflected around wage inflation. Of course, we are always paying market-relevant pay based upon the skills and the locations of our people. We continue to see that the same. Then as it relates to pricing, as Julie mentioned, it continues to be highly competitive. At the same time, as you know of us, right, we're managing it. We're focused on pricing as well as on our differentiation. We're focused on cost and delivery efficiencies in our business and how we operate.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nAll right. Understood. Happy holidays.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Bryan. Well, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, and all of our people for what you do every single day. I wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season.\nThank you for joining us today. We look forward to being back here in a quarter. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results.

Thank you to our 750,000 people around the world who work every day to deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Before we get into the quarter, I want to thank KC, who's been an excellent partner for these last five years, and our three other extraordinary leaders who are stepping down in the next two quarters: Jean-Marc, Ellen, and Paul. Each have given over 36 years of service and demonstrated strong stewardship in developing outstanding successors, including Angie, who you all know from her former role as Head of Investor Relations, who will succeed KC on 1 December. As always, we are executing a smooth leadership\ntransition to the next generation with our strong bench of great leaders. Now, onto the quarter. I am pleased this quarter to bring to life yet again the resilience and agility of our business, as our actions to remain laser-focused on our clients' needs and quickly adapt to market conditions can be seen in our results, which are building a foundation for stronger growth as we go into Q4 and next fiscal year. As you know, this fiscal year, our clients' spending developed differently than we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year, and these conditions continue, with clients prioritizing large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue more slowly, while limiting discretionary\nspending, particularly in smaller projects, with delays in decision-making and a slower pace of spending as well. In response, we have moved quickly to adjust by leveraging our unique strengths, our end-to-end services, including deep industry and functional expertise that enable these large-scale transformations or what we call reinventions.\nWe are also leveraging our deep technology expertise, ecosystem partnerships, and our learning machine and culture that gives us the agility to shift to new areas of demand, including, for example, GenAI, while continuing to invest at scale for future growth. Here is how these strengths and our strategy are demonstrating results three quarters into the fiscal year. With our clients prioritizing large-scale transformations, we have accelerated our strategy to be the reinvention partner of our clients. Our success is reflected in our bookings of $21.1 billion, including another 23 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, bringing the total of such clients with\nthese bookings to 92, year-to-date, seven more than last year at this time. This focus on being the reinvention partner is an important part of our strategy to return to stronger growth.\nAs we enter next year, as this work ramps, the revenue from these large-scale bookings is expected to continue to layer in throughout the year, and we are also well-positioned to capture increases in discretionary spend when it comes back because of the strategic positioning these deals bring at our clients. We also have leaned into the new area of growth, GenAI, which is comprised of smaller projects, as our clients primarily are in experimentation mode. In this quarter, we hit two important milestones. With over $900 million in new GenAI bookings this quarter, we now have $2 billion in GenAI sales year-to-date, and we have also achieved $500 million in revenue year-to-date. This\ncompares to approximately $300 million in sales, and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI in FY 2023. Leading in GenAI positions us to help our clients take the actions needed to reinvent and to benefit from GenAI, which frequently means large-scale transformations. We are also taking an early lead with an eye toward long-term leadership in this critical technology, which is still in the early stages of maturity and adoption, despite its rapid evolution. We have built our expertise in making strategic acquisitions over the last decade, leveraging a strong balance sheet, and we have used this expertise to expand into new growth areas, scale in hot areas, and\ngeographies, and continue to build strength in our industry and functional consulting. We deployed $2.3 billion of capital across our geographic markets in Q3 across 12 acquisitions, bringing the total number of acquisitions to 35, with invested capital of $5.2 billion year-to-date as compared to $2.5 billion for the entire FY 2023.\nAs a learning organization and talent creator, we continue to invest in our people, with approximately 13 million training hours this quarter. This averages 19 hours per person, representing an increase predominantly due to GenAI, as we continue to prepare our workforce for the infusion of GenAI across our business in the coming years. We also continue to steadily increase our data and AI workforce, reaching approximately 55,000 skilled data and AI practitioners against our goal of doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 by the end of FY 2026. We continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly\ntraded competitors, which is how we calculate market share, with revenues of $16.5 billion for the quarter of 1.4% in local currency and slightly above the midpoint of our FX-adjusted range.\nWe expanded Adjusted Operating Margin by 10 basis points and delivered Free Cash Flow of $3 billion. I want to congratulate our 97,000 people we have promoted around the world through 1 June, including 702 to Managing Director and 64 to Senior Managing Director, reflecting our commitment to providing vibrant career paths. We are recognized as a top 10 place to work in 10 countries, representing more than 70% of our people: number two in Argentina, Brazil, and the Philippines. Number four in Singapore. Number five in Costa Rica, Finland, and Indonesia. Number seven in the US. And number 10 in Chile on the Great Place to Work list of best workplaces. And number\ntwo on Business Today's best companies to work for in India. In recognition of our strong brand, we are proud to earn the 20th position on Kantar BrandZ' prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list, our highest rank to date, with an 11% increase in brand value to $81.9 billion. Our scale across strategy, consulting, technology, and operations, and our breadth and depth across industries and functions make us uniquely capable of helping our clients reinvent using technology, data, AI, and new ways of working. Before turning to KC, I want to give a little more color on our acquisitions this quarter, which yet again demonstrate the strategic importance of both our ability to\ninvest and our expertise in identifying, attracting, and integrating great companies joining Accenture. Let's start with new areas of growth. We completed our acquisition of Udacity to scale our technology learning and training services and to help our clients reskill and upskill their people.\nUdacity is a critical part of our LearnVantage digital learning platform, which we announced last quarter as a new area of growth for the future. Building on our expertise in customer-focused consulting, we invested to help drive our clients' growth agendas. We acquired Unlimited, an award-winning customer engagement agency with a deep understanding of human behavior, as evidenced by its proprietary human understanding lab and AI-powered data insights platform. We acquired The Lumery in Australia, a marketing technology consultancy that helps leading organizations deliver seamless customer experiences and transform their marketing services. It provides industry\nand platform consulting services, including marketing, advisory, and planning implementation across entire technology stacks, operational excellence, and simplification. We closed our acquisition of GemSeek in Bulgaria, a leading customer experience analytics provider helping global businesses understand customers through insights, analytics, and AI-powered predictive models.\nWe closed Mindcurv, a global cloud-native digital experience and data analytics company specializing in composable software, digital engineering, and commerce services. Now, let's turn to scaling in hot industries. We acquired Cognosante, a provider of innovative technology solutions for US federal health, defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies. With this acquisition, Federal Services is creating a new federal health portfolio for its business. We invested in Customer Management IT and SirfinPA, which will provide the public sector with technology, support, and justice and public safety in Italy. We see public service and, in particular, health, intelligence, and\ndefense as highly strategic industry-focused areas globally for the next several years. We invested in Teamexpat, focusing on testing integration for lithography systems in the semiconductor industry, another attractive industry segment. Our investment in Flo Group, a leading European consultancy and Oracle business partner who specializes in global supply chain logistics, is helping us scale in supply chain, also a major growth area. Finally, we're scaling in attractive geographic markets. We acquired CLIMB, a technology-based consultancy based in Japan, where we continue to experience very strong revenue growth. Over to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie. Thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our Q3 results, which were in line with our expectations and reflect continued investment at scale. We continue to serve as a trusted partner for our clients while running our business with rigor and discipline. Now, let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 1.4% local currency, with mid-single-digit growth or higher in seven of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, high-tech, life sciences, energy, utility, and health. We also continue to see improvement in our CMT industry group. We continue to take market share. As a reminder, we assess market\ngrowth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market.\nWe use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted Operating Margin was 16.4%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q3 last year, and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered Free Cash Flow of $3 billion and returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $5.2 billion across 35 acquisitions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new\nbookings. New bookings were $21.1 billion for the quarter, representing 22% growth in US dollars and 26% growth in local currency, with an overall Book-to-Bill of 1.3. Consulting bookings were $9.3 billion, with a Book-to-Bill of 1.1. Managed Services bookings were $11.8 billion, with a Book-to-Bill of 1.5.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.5 billion, a 1% decline in US dollars and a 1.4% increase in local currency, and slightly above the midpoint of our FX-adjusted guidance range, as the FX headwind was approximately 2% compared to the 1% headwind estimated at the beginning of the quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a decline of 3% in US dollars and a decline of 1% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $8 billion, up 2% in US dollars and up 4% local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services, strategy, and consulting grew low single digits, and operations was flat. Turning to\nour geographic markets. In North America, revenue grew 1% local currency, led by growth in public service, partially offset by a decline in banking and capital markets. In EMEA, revenues declined 2% local currency, with growth in public service, offset by declines in banking and capital markets, and communications and media. Revenue growth in Italy was offset by a decline in France. In growth markets, revenue grew 8% local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, and industrial. Revenue growth was driven by Argentina and Japan, partially offset by a decline in Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.4%, consistent with\nthe same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6%, compared to 10.5% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.3%, compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q3 of FY 2024 and FY 2023, we recorded $77 million and $347 million in costs associated with our Business Optimization Actions, respectively. These costs decreased operating margin by 40 basis points and EPS by $0.08 this quarter and operating margin by 210 basis points and EPS by $0.42 in Q3 of last year. In Q3 of last year, we also recognized a gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which\nimpacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting an Adjusted Operating Margin of 16.4%, an increase of 10 basis points from Adjusted Operating Margin in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.13, compared with an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.19 in the third quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 43 days, compared to 43 days last quarter and\n42 days in the third quarter of last year. Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.1 billion and net of property and equipment additions of $124 million. Our cash balance at 31 May was $5.5 billion, compared with $9 billion at 31 August. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $1.4 billion, an average price of $320.41 per share. As of 31 May, we had approximately $3.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $811 million. This represents a 15%\nincrease over last year. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on 15 August, a 15% increase over last year. In closing, we feel good about our results in Q3 and are now working hard to deliver Q4. We remain focused on capturing growth opportunities while continuing to invest in our business for long-term market leadership. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, KC. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more of the same in terms of the demand environment. Now, let me give a little context on how we're executing our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice and why we're uniquely positioned to be helping our clients on AI. It is important to remember that while there is a near universal recognition now of the importance of AI, which is the heart of reinvention, the ability to use GenAI at scale varies widely with clients on a continuum, with those which have strong digital cores genuinely seeking to move more quickly, while most clients are coming to the realization of the investments needed to truly implement AI across the\nenterprise, starting with a strong digital core from migrating applications and data to the cloud, building a new cognitive layer, implementing modern ERP and applications across the enterprise to a strong security layer. Nearly all clients are finding it difficult to scale GenAI projects because the AI technology is a small part of what is needed.\nTo reinvent using technology, data, and AI, you must also change your processes and ways of working, reskill and upskill your people, and build new capabilities around responsible AI, all with a deep understanding of industry, function, and technology to unlock the value. And many clients need to first find more efficiencies to enable scaled investment in their digital cores and all these capabilities, particularly in data foundations. In short, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to more aggressively go after cost, build the digital core, and truly change the ways they work, which creates significant opportunity for us. And this is why clients are coming to us.\nWe are able to help our clients with this AI rotation because of our broad services across Strategy and Consulting, technology and operations, as well as everything customer through Song and digital manufacturing and engineering through Industry X, and our relevance across the functions of the enterprises and 13 industries. Our privileged position in the technology ecosystem has never been more important. We are working closely with our ecosystem partners to help our clients understand the right data and AI backbone that is needed and how to achieve tangible business value. Now, let me give you a few examples of the complex work of reinvention and\nbuilding a digital core. We are partnering with Currys, a leading European technology retailer, to unlock new growth and cost savings by accelerating its adoption of new technologies. First, we will move their operations from a legacy data center to a new cloud platform using pre-built and customized solutions to create a powerful digital core. This unified data foundation allows us to deploy automation and generative AI in key growth areas such as repair centers, customer service, e-commerce, procurement, and in-store experiences, delivering faster, more efficient services to their customers. The move to a new platform supports the company's sustainability goals, reducing energy\nconsumption by transitioning to a more efficient cloud infrastructure. Now, Currys employees will be empowered to serve their customers better by offering high-touch experiences both online and in stores. We're working with Independence Health Group, IHG, a leading health organization headquartered in southeastern Pennsylvania, on a transformation journey to modernize end-to-end operations, improving the way they serve current and future generations of customers.\nWe will help migrate nearly two million members to a new digital-first platform expected to drive immediate improvements in existing business processes. This will lay the foundation to leverage advanced technology and generative AI to proactively manage members' health. We are also helping reskill and retrain their operations staff, creating opportunities for employee development. With this reinvention, Independence continues its ongoing efforts to increase service quality, improve experiences, and enable better health outcomes, positioning them for new areas of growth in the rapidly changing healthcare landscape. Digital core work also requires deep industry\nexpertise as we work with our clients to design the right tech, data, and AI to reinvent their enterprise and their industry. We are helping Macy's, an iconic American retailer, with a technology modernization effort. As a strategic technology execution partner, we will migrate their mainframe systems to a cloud platform, a move that will enhance their operational efficiency and scalability. This will allow Macy's to be more agile and enable growth. We are helping the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the regulatory body responsible for the country's banking and insurance sector, with a digital transformation to strengthen the financial system's stability and contribute to growth,\ninnovation, and diversification in the sector in line with the UAE's national vision. Our program will deliver advanced analytics along with AI-driven automation to improve supervisory capabilities and streamline activities for licensed financial institutions by creating best-in-class processes to support regulatory compliance. We will also modernize the bank's enterprise data management by implementing a single unified portal to provide a holistic view of the financial services ecosystem, all of which will enhance the UAE's position as a global financial center. We are partnering with Virgin Media O2, a leading carrier services provider in the UK, to support regional businesses to\nrealize the promise of 5G, opening new revenue streams and stimulating growth in the telco market. We will bring to market solutions built on our edge orchestration platform, which combines edge computing, data and AI, GenAI, and embedded security. This will enable use cases such as quality inspection, safe workplace management, and behavior monitoring to improve operations and customer experience. Whether it's enabling safe communication on building sites, creating a fan experience while handling crowds in busy venues, or supporting vital devices and clinician workflow in healthcare, Virgin Media O2 can now offer businesses a range of flexible, secure, and\naffordable solutions that boost efficiency, growth, and performance. With our Managed Services and customer operations, we can work together with Virgin Media O2 to scale this growth. Security is a critical part of reinvention in the Digital Core. We saw continued very strong digital double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. We are partnering with the US Navy to enhance its cybersecurity operations with cutting-edge capabilities that will strengthen its data security posture and support mission readiness. More than ever, data and information are critically important to national security.\nOur solution sets are configured to provide defensive cyber operations across US Navy networks to help safeguard digital assets and mission operations. Together, we will help ensure the US Navy can combat evolving cyber threats, protect our sailors at sea, and defend American interests around the world. Once clients have a strong foundation, they can explore new opportunities to drive growth and efficiencies with GenAI. We are helping a leading global food and beverage company who already built a strong digital core as part of its reinvention journey to now leverage the power of generative AI to create new value. Together, we developed the digital shelf console pilot, a GenAI\nengine that accelerates content creation for e-commerce and optimizes it to drive sales. The engine empowers marketers to audit and customize content at scale, expected to reduce time to deliver one year's worth of content to just eight working days and save costs of up to 80% quickly and effectively. Once they scale, this enables the company to produce more targeted content with significant time and cost efficiency, increase sales, and transform customer experiences. We have partnered with National Australia Bank, one of the country's largest financial institutions, to strategically implement and scale generative AI to create material value at speed, enhance\nrelationship-driven customer service, and drive operational efficiencies. We worked on a methodical build of a secure and robust GenAI platform built within the bank's existing strategic data platform with the creation of 200 generative AI use cases in backlog. To date, over 20 use cases have been tested across the bank, with eight of these enterprise-grade pilots underway and a number of those scaling and already delivering value. We also co-created a methodology for delivering GenAI projects from experiments to scalable deployment, ensuring each stage delivers tangible business benefits. While doing so, National Australia Bank and Accenture are putting safety at the core of\nthe approach through responsible AI and risk policies alongside developing in-house AI expertise and literacy. One of the areas of richest opportunities for our clients is customer experience transformation, which uses the unique capabilities of Song across creative customer insights and deep technology expertise. Song grew mid-single digits this quarter. We are helping Saudia Airlines, the national flag carrier of Saudi Arabia, to launch an innovative digital platform to transform the traveler's experience. Powered by GenAI, the platform will provide a one-stop solution enabling customers to seamlessly plan their journeys, book flights, and modify their trips in just a few words, all\nwhile providing a personalized and conversational experience. The platform is continuously evolving and will integrate more services over time. This modernization will support Saudia Airlines' vision of redefining the standards of travel in a digital world. We continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. Industry X grew high single digits in Q3. We are supporting a large Asia-Pacific automobile manufacturer on their reinvention towards software-defined vehicles. We will help accelerate software development and create a software center of excellence to optimize quality, cost pressures, and delivery times. This center of excellence will\nmanage four key work streams: advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle infotainment, electrical and electronics, and powertrain. By leveraging our expertise and strategic partnerships, we are empowering them to strengthen and evolve its in-vehicle software, providing advanced functions and services throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. This enables the company to drive innovation, enhance driver and passenger experiences, and realize the full potential of software-defined vehicles. We will continue to leverage all of our strengths to manage the current macro conditions and constrained spending while investing in leadership for the future. Back to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.05 billion to 16.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about -2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be -0.7% compared to fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution\napproaching 3%. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. For Adjusted Operating Margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2024 to be 15.5%, a 10 basis points expansion of fiscal 2023 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023.\nWe now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.85 to $12, or 2 to 3% growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to 9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and Free Cash Flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to 9.3 billion. Our Free Cash Flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong Free Cash Flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our\nshareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question in the follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much. And congrats to KC and Angie. I'm excited for both of you guys. I just wanted to ask upfront just for Julie, maybe you mentioned stronger growth next year. Hoping you could just elaborate on that at a high level. I know there's a lot of moving pieces. On one hand, you have a big backlog, a lot of large deals. You have strong inorganic growth. But on the other hand, the sector is struggling with this weak discretionary spend, and there's uncertainty with global elections in the second half of the year. So just I know you can't give formal guidance until next year. I know consensus is at what, 6%? Can you just give us maybe just some high-level considerations that are\nworth underlining as we're recasting our outlook for next year? Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. And thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. So let's just anchor on our strategy for growth and what you're seeing in three quarters into the year. Because obviously, expectations at the beginning of this year were different in terms of how things develop with spending. So what did we do? We leaned into what clients need. And they need these reinventions. They need these big, large-scale transformations. And so what you've seen us do is you got to go with what the clients need, and that's what they're buying. And so we have accelerated our leaning into these large transformation deals, which is why you see that we have seven more than last year, at this time, of clients with\nbookings of over $100 million. Now, these convert to revenue more slowly, but as we're accelerating, you know that they ramp up and they will start to layer in. And we are very uniquely positioned in this market to be able to do these large-scale transformations because they require the combination of services. Everything from the ability to help them move faster through our Managed Services, our industry expertise. Everyone wants to do that with the eye towards GenAI. So even though the transformations are often in preparation for GenAI, they want to work with the partners who really understand GenAI. And so how do we get there faster? And so as you think about the\nreinvention strategy, that's a strategy we've been executing for a couple of years. And we uniquely can lean in. And you're seeing the results of that this quarter with the acceleration, compared to last year, of clients with that level of bookings. And those, of course, then ramp next year. The second is our leaning into where we are seeing growth in smaller deals. Because remember, the discretionary spending is constrained, overall spending constrained, and particularly in smaller projects. But what did we do?\nWe see GenAI is the new growth. We have an incredible ability to pivot our people. You can see the specialists in data and AI growing. We started at 40,000. We're at 55,000 now against our goal of 80,000 by the end of 2026. We're also training our people. You saw that big increase because we're preparing our people. You're now doing a transformation. It may not be GenAI, but you have to understand GenAI. And so we're uniquely able to train our people at scale to understand GenAI. And how is that translating? We'll look at our bookings this quarter now getting to $2 billion three quarters into the year as compared to $300 million last year and $500 million in revenue.\nSo starting to be meaningful in terms of the numbers. We were at $100 million for all of last year. So we expect to continue to lean into GenAI. And what it's doing is very interesting from where we were, say, three quarters ago. It's acting as the catalyst to understand what you have to do. So I'll finish here, and then I'll just, of course, mention our ability to invest in inorganic. But right now, from a perspective of the pull-through, we're still reprioritizing. But every other GenAI project now is leading to some data project because people are understanding, \"Hey, this is a great technology, and I'm not ready.\" So we feel really good about being very well-positioned as spending increases when\nit does increase because of what we're doing. And then finally, remember, we invest in acquisitions to drive organic growth. So it's all about future growth. I gave a lot in the script today to just help bring to life just how strategic our ability to invest is as we think about future growth. Not trying to comment at all on FY 2025. We'll call it like we see it. We also want to be clear that our strategy is working and these deals will ramp up.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll just add just in terms of how we feel just within this fiscal year. We're very pleased with where we landed in Q3. When you look to Q4, we do have, and you see that in our growth rate, a clear uptick in our growth rate for the fourth quarter.\nI think importantly included in that is the expectation that our consulting type of work in Q4, Tien-Tsin Huang, will return to growth, and that we haven't had growth in consulting type of work since Q2 of last year.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood. No, thank you both for that. I'll be less wordy with my follow-up. Just on the inorganic piece, can this pace continue?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nI'll let Julie talk about add on here. But in terms of our, let's talk about capital allocation. We've always said this. We have the ability, and I think it's a differentiator of ours, to be able to invest and approach the market whenever we see something that we want to execute. And that remains unchanged. And you've seen us do this over all the different business cycles. Importantly, when we do that, we're able to continue all parts of our capital allocation in terms of share buybacks and dividends as well. From a financial standpoint, we have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to continue to flex up and down as we see fit from a capital allocation standpoint, Tien-Tsin.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah, Tien-Tsin. I think we'll make the decision as we go into next year as to what level we want to drive for next year. I think we'll comment next quarter.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, that's perfect. I know you've been able to amplify the growth of what you bought, so that's why I asked. Thank you.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Koning\n\nResearch Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much.One thing I noticed, debt was up to $1.6 billion or so sequentially. It was the highest. Really, in 20 years, you've almost had no debt. And you have a lot of cash. So I guess, what's the strategy around borrowing money now? And maybe it's just geographic cash positions too.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. That's a great question. So in terms of our cash, you said that we started the year at $9 billion, and now we're a little bit, we're about $5.5 billion. And we do have some debt. It's very small, as you mentioned, for a company of our size. We do have a. We had a credit facility that we put in right during the pandemic. And we continue to have a credit facility. It's about $5.5 billion. It's a five-year credit facility. What you just see, Dave, is that we're just exercising some of that credit facility, kind of normal treasury operations.\n\nDave Koning\n\nResearch Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. And maybe just as a follow-up, margins this year up at the lower end of kind of normal. And certainly, scale, just the growth this year being a little slower, maybe the acquisitions. And just as we kind of look forward, the margin puts and takes, how should we think that with acquisition spending being a little higher, does the next few quarters remain kind of putting a little pressure on margins? Or how should we think of just the moving parts of margins going forward?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah, sure. So I'll just obviously keep my comments to this year, to 2024. And maybe I'll just point out where we are and what we are continuing to assume. So we stated last quarter that we'd be at 10 basis points of operating margin expansion. We reconfirmed that, Dave, for the full year again this quarter. We feel confident in our ability to do that. So if you look at we run our business to operating margin. If you look at gross margin and overall what we've been saying on pricing. Just importantly, when we talk about pricing, we mean the margin on the work that we sell. What I think is really important for us is that we've been able to operate our business with rigor and discipline in how we run\nourselves in efficient operations of Accenture and be our own best credential as we absorb kind of higher selling costs, which you would expect. We're looking at our record $60 billion of bookings, and also the continued pressure on pricing that we've had across our business. So with that, we feel really good. And if you look at it, we grew 1% in Q1. As an example, we were able to do 20 basis points of margin expansion. We grew 1% this quarter, and we were able to do 10 basis points of margin expansion. So we feel good about the way we run our business with rigor and discipline.\n\nDave Koning\n\nResearch Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thanks. And nice bookings.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. And congrats, KC. Great run at Accenture. You were awesome. So I want to ask on Managed Services on the bookings, the $11.8 billion. That was an outsized number. How much of that is new bookings versus renewals? And maybe give us some flavor on what caused that spike in growth.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about the numbers. In terms of, it is a record bookings for Managed Services. As Julie's been and as we've been talking, it is obviously based on the larger transformational deals that we're doing. While those larger transformational deals, just to be clear, Bryan, they do have both consulting and outsourcing, excuse me, Managed Services type of work with them. They do have, as you would expect, a larger portion of Managed Services type of work. So when you see what we were able to do this year, we're already at 92.7, seven more than last year. And we did have a very strong Managed Services booking, as you noted, in Q3.\nWe don't really do a breakout in terms of expansions or new. But we always have a healthy mix, I would say, of both. That's what we strive to over rolling four quarters in our business always. And no difference there.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And just maybe a little color, Bryan, as you think about this idea of reinvention, Virgin Media O2 is a great example because there, right, we have a combination where using our edge platform to provide help O2 provides Virgin Media O2 to provide these new services. And at the same time, we're supporting it with our customer operations, supporting their growth so that they can scale. And right now, clients, of course, they're looking for growth. They're also looking for transformation and efficiency. The other thing I'd say is this is a great example of how we're embracing GenAI.\nYou've heard us talk in the past about ourc, which helps in our Managed Services. That's become GenWizard. And we're seeing that our early embracing of using GenAI, where it's ready to be used, has been a real differentiator in our technology Managed Services. So we're very focused on helping our clients move faster using our expertise and leverage our digital investments in order for them to transform and reinvent faster. And you're seeing that focus.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. And just a follow-up, just looking at some of the dimensions breakout. When I look at operations being flat, just any callouts for that? I know it was negative last quarter, so it's turned a little bit here. But just trying to understand the growth there and the prospects. Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. No, we're really pleased that it ticked up this quarter. And it's a very strategic part of our business. Think about it really as sort of two ways, right? So we remain number one in our industry in finance and accounting. And we're embracing, again, GenAI there to help differentiate our platform. And so there's a focus that we're seeing in our clients as they're saying, \"Okay, we really understand how much more we need to digitize. And we need to do that in the enterprise.\" They're excited about our ability over time. Again, it's very early days still in GenAI over time to help build our Synapse platform. We're building our Synapse platform. We're building in GenAI. And that helps them have\nless to build in their enterprise side by partnering with us. And so that's, we think, a really great differentiator. And then we continue to diversify into areas that are in the core of our business, core of our industries for our clients, whether it's claims and underwriting and insurance, or supply chain for consumer goods and industrial, or core banking in the financial services. So we feel really good about the business and kind of continue in its continued prospects.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRod Bourgeois\n\nHead of Research, DeepDive Equity Research\n\nHey, guys. And very best wishes to KC as well. Julie, you mentioned that the demand environment is sort of more of the same. At the same time, it appears you've seen some growth momentum in certain key areas. I'm particularly interested in the growth improvement in the CMT vertical and in Strategy and Consulting. Can you talk about what's enabling those growth improvements and a sense of the outlooks for CMT and S&C? Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo really want to compliment our entire team on the work that they're doing with our clients in CMT. So as we've been talking about that for now for a little while, and you start to see things like the Virgin Media O2 deal. So our teams are working with our clients on what do they need. And they're focused on getting rid of technology debt because that's critical in order to use some of these new technologies. They're focused on using the new technologies. So we have a number of clients that, while it's still small, are working on GenAI. And then being very focused on efficiencies. And then finally, network. So really across the board, what I would say is the industry was\nchallenged. We have been just focused on going to where they need help. You're seeing that result in our results. Then on Strategy and Consulting, again, it's all about being focused on what do our clients need. We've pivoted many more people, for example, toward cost and strategy. Cost takeout's a big theme, particularly for our strategy. We're seeing a lot of growth still in things like implementing modern ERP platforms with the focus on the digital core. Again, at Accenture, it's not just technology, right? It's about where the number one player with all of these technology ecosystem players. But our clients want to do it faster. They need the industry expertise. You saw a\nnumber of examples in the script about how we're putting in these platforms. We're doing so within an industry context. So I would say cost takeout and move the cloud data platforms wrapped around with industry and functional expertise. That's where we're seeing the growth. We just continue to remain laser-focused on more people, more focus working with the clients on what they need to buy.\n\nRod Bourgeois\n\nHead of Research, DeepDive Equity Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for that. You're seeing revenue mix incrementally shift into Managed Services. I'm curious if you think some of that mix shift towards Managed Services is due to secular forces, or are you purely seeing that mix shift as just a cyclical phenomenon?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I think it's in terms of what the real driver is; it's the larger deals that have a little bit of both in those both components of secular and cyclical in what you're talking about. So it really is just based on the larger deals.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo just think about Accenture as very uniquely positioned in this market. Clients are prioritizing large-scale transformations. And doing those and getting the efficiencies and moving faster, Managed Services is a highly strategic component of being able to do that. And this is where Accenture, with such scale in both strategy and both consulting type of work with Managed Services, is really able to lean into what our clients buying now.\n\nRod Bourgeois",
    "content2": "Head of Research, DeepDive Equity Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. And congrats, KC, and the other leaders on the retirements and appointments. First question I wanted to ask on the consulting existing revenue-based performance. Can you just talk about how base business runoff kind of progressed within the -1% local currency performance? I heard your comment on the Q4 consulting returning to growth. I'm trying to understand if that's a reflection of sustainable stabilization potential here and really gauge whether you're reaching a point where the new consulting bookings conversion should more than offset the existing base runoff moving ahead.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So, Bryan, in terms of what we'll talk about is really what I just mentioned on Q4, I guess. I understand what you mean by a base runoff. We don't really think of it that way. We kind of look at it as maybe our terms would be, what do we have booked in backlog? And what have we already and what's new coming in from new sales? Just kind of going with those two points, the way we evaluate and we talk about it, Bryan, is from a year-over-year basis, looking at both the components of what we've already sold for the next quarter, and then what we see in our pipeline and how we see those sales will convert to revenue. That's how we kind of assess where we think that we will be overall.\nAnd again, very pleased that consulting, we do feel that and see that it will return to growth. And I think it's a milestone that we haven't had in a number of quarters. So we're pleased with that. And we'll comment on anything else for next year or next year, I mean, in September.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. And then bookings obviously very solid here. Can you just comment on pipeline, and any bookings expectations worth calling out for Q4?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Overall, we feel good about our pipeline. And we don't have guidance to next quarter bookings. But we feel good.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Wanted to follow up on the acquisition activity. It's obviously been really robust, providing a lot of good opportunities. Can you give us any sense collectively across the acquisitions you've been doing and maybe what you are looking at in terms of what the growth rates of those businesses are generally or collectively when you do the acquisitions? And I know there's a target to accelerate those. How the growth rates tend to change as those companies are absorbed into Accenture, even if directionally?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, I think in terms of make sure I'm answering your question is when we look overall at our acquisitions, they all come with they're typically higher growth business cases that we have from the companies that we buy. We have a base case that comes with the organization. We assess that growth rate. Then we obviously put in pretty significant synergy cases that are, without going through kind of metrics, a pretty high bar for those acquisitions to deliver to, along with a broader Accenture. That's why integration is so important in what we do because it's not just having great business case. That is maybe half of what you need to do. But the key really is on how you integrate to\ndeliver to that. We have a very strong track record. So what you'll see is you can just maybe get the sense. To your question is, look at how many we've done over the last five years. You can see how we've been able to continue to grow our business throughout that time. It is really continuing to fuel our organic growth.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Then, quickly, one of the areas where you've leaned in on and was mentioned in the prepared remarks is the government and healthcare sector, really strong growth there, obviously. How should we be thinking about that as a long-term or medium-term potential grower in that segment? How are you thinking about the investment needed to continue to drive that? Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks. Yeah. No, we feel really good about that vertical. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation that's going on in public service. You see health as a big driver. Defense is a big driver. There's a lot of infrastructure support, whether it's IRA in the US or what the EU has been doing as well. Of course, a lot of the digital transformation hasn't happened in the public service and health. So we see that now being the time. You're seeing that in the results. We feel very confident. We think about the investment like we do all our industries. I mean, remember, we have 13 industry groups. Diversification is a key part of both our resilience and our growth strategy. At any given time, we're\ninvesting differently depending on the growth trajectory. As we called out this quarter, we've been investing significantly in public service because we see the next several years this being a big growth area. We're making those investments now.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question. And then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi. Many thanks. And first, KC and Paul, special congratulations as you make the transition. I wanted to ask a question. And I'll just make it concurrently in the interest of time. And Julie, I think I'll direct this to you. Number one, on BPO, one of your competitors just talked pretty openly about pricing's been under pretty material duress as of late. And I wondered if you would echo that. And I'm really curious as to why. Why do you think pricing has been under duress? And how do you think about impacting future growth? And then the second area that I wanted to ask about is Song. Thank you for the comment on mid-single-digit growth. I'm really interested how you think GenAI will\nimpact your digital agency over the next 12 to 24 months. The reason I asked the question is we also spend a lot of time with companies like Adobe that have significant generative AI is going to have a significant impact on digital agencies. Some of the agencies are talking about seat reductions because of the value associated with generative AI. I'm just wondering if you could comment on how you think generative AI will impact the growth potential of Song. That's it for me. Many thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. KC, why don't you quickly comment on pricing? Then I'll do Song.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nKeith, I would say just in terms of pricing, and we've been commenting on this for quite some time, you are correct in that we've had overall in our entire business continued pricing pressure. So, I mean, that's the way I would reflect on that statement on your question before I hand it over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. It's overall. It's a tight market. So that's what you normally see. On Song, here's where we are so unique because our business is not an agency business, right? The agencies are part of an incredibly differentiated value proposition where you have creative, technology, and digital, and by the way, Managed Services. And so we see this as a huge opportunity because we are embracing it as fast as possible to help our clients get value. But we put it together with all of these other services. So we were happy to see the uptick in growth this quarter with Song. And long-term, we really think it's great. And remember, this is our playbook, right? We embrace technology. We've done\nit in every wave. We've done it when we did Managed Services. Remember in 2015, we had Synapse and myWizard. Our business is to help our clients be more efficient and grow. That is what we do. And we use technology and how we deliver it. And we help them use technology and how they operate. And so we see GenAI as yet another way that we're going to embrace it. We're going to be fast. And we're going to help. We're going to do what we do for clients. And that is a very exciting opportunity. So we feel really good about our Song business. Great. So thanks, everyone, for the questions and the time today. In closing, I want to, again, as always, thank all of our shareholders for your\ncontinued trust and support, and all of our people for what you're doing for our clients and for each other every day. Thanks so much for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Your conference will begin momentarily. Please continue to hold. Your conference will begin momentarily. Please continue to hold.\nGood morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's Q2 Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. If you have a question at any time during the call, please press one, then zero. If you should require assistance during the call, please press star, then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Katie O'Conor. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director, Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you'll hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the Q2. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the Q3 and full fiscal year 2024.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.\nDuring our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining, and thank you to our 742,000 people around the world who work every day to deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I'm pleased with our performance in an uncertain macro. Our results highlight the benefit of the deep trust our clients have in us, our capabilities to do the most complex work at the heart of their businesses, the privileged position we hold within the ecosystem, and our ability to invest for the next waves of growth.\nWe continue to see momentum in the quarter on how we are executing on our strategy to be the trusted reinvention partner of our clients, with a record 39 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. These large transformational wins position us to capture more growth as spending increases.\nWe also had over $600 million in new GenAI bookings, taking us to $1.1 billion in GenAI sales the first half of the fiscal year, expanding our early lead in GenAI, which is core to our clients' reinvention. We now have over 53,000 skilled data and AI practitioners against our goal of doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 by the end of fiscal year 2026.\nWe are laser-focused on the needs of our clients, and this focus is reflected in our bookings of $21.6 billion, representing our second-highest quarter on record. This included $10 billion of bookings in North America, our highest ever. We continue to take market share with revenues of $15.8 billion for the quarter, flat compared to last year and slightly above the midpoint of our range.\nAs we turn the page on the calendar year, we saw another turn of the dial on constraining spending by our clients, including spending on our services, particularly in parts of EMEA and North America. This was evident in the composition of our new bookings, which came in differently than expected. We see clients continuing to prioritize investing in large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue more slowly, while further limiting discretionary spending, particularly in smaller projects.\nWe also saw continued delays in decision-making and a slower pace of spending. We are pleased that despite these conditions, our focused efforts to return to growth resulted in North America and CMT showing improvement over last quarter. We are running our business with rigor and discipline, and we remain on track with the business optimization actions we announced last year to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS growth of 3%. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas, with $2.1 billion of capital deployed across our geographic markets in Q2 in 11 acquisitions, bringing the total investment in acquisitions to $2.9 billion in H1 across a total of 23 acquisitions. We also continue to invest in learning for our people, with approximately 10 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 14 hours per person.\nIn recognition of the 360-degree value we create, we are proud that we earned the number one position in our industry for the 11th year in a row and number 33 overall on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. We ranked number one in our industry and number three overall on the JUST Capital CNBC list of America's most just companies.\nWe have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 17th year in a row. An important part of our growth strategy is to use our strong balance sheet to invest in order to scale higher growth areas and expand into new growth areas. We have a strong track record of delivering on this strategy. Here are some highlights from the quarter.\nIn North America, we invested in supply chain, an area with significant reinvention ahead, with the additions of Insight Sourcing, Impendi, and 6point6. We acquired Navisite to help clients across multiple cloud providers, enterprise applications, and digital technologies modernize their digital core. In Song, we acquired Work & Co to help our clients drive growth by designing and bringing digital brand strategies to market and operationalizing world-class digital products at scale.\nIn EMEA, we are investing to help clients build their digital core and drive growth. In the UK, we invested in 6point6, which will help our clients transform their digital capabilities and modernize their legacy systems. We also acquired in the UK Redkite, with its full-stack data expertise that will help our clients accelerate their performance with data-driven intelligence and AI.\nIn Germany, we added Vocatus, which will accelerate our clients' growth strategies using behavioral economics modeling to develop pricing strategy and sales concepts for B2B and B2C models. Similarly, in growth markets, our acquisitions position us to drive our clients' growth agendas by expanding our capabilities in marketing and customer experience with Rabbit's Tale in Thailand and Jixie in Singapore, helping clients in Indonesia capitalize on their fast-growing digital economy. Our ability to invest to fuel our organic growth is a competitive advantage.\nAs our clients continue to transform, we announced earlier this month that we will invest $1 billion over the next three years in Accenture LearnVantage, which will provide comprehensive technology learning and training services to help our clients reskill and upskill their people. Our investment includes the acquisition of Udacity, a digital education pioneer, which we expect to close by the summer. Once closed, we will have revenue in the zone of $100 million annually.\nThese services are highly strategic, and they enhance our position as a reinvention partner of choice because talent is at the top of the agenda for CEOs. For example, we are helping Merck, a global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, launch a groundbreaking Generative AI training program for their employees to create world-class digital leaders.\nAs a renowned thought leader in the biopharmaceutical market, Merck has long led the way in investing in its people and helping them build the skills and expertise needed to develop breakthrough therapies. Digital, data, analytics, and AI play a pivotal role in discovering, developing, manufacturing, and providing access for patients to medicines and vaccines. By once again investing in its people, Merck will be able to continue delivering on its promise to use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. Over to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie. Thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the Q2, with our second-highest quarter of new bookings. We continue to invest at scale to strengthen our leadership position while delivering value for our shareholders. Now, let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter.\nRevenues were flat in local currency, with mid-single-digit growth or higher in six of our 13 industries, including public service, life science, utilities, energy, health, and high tech. While our CMT industry group improved this quarter, we continue to see pressure, as expected. We continue to take market share. As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market.\nWe use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted operating margin of 13.7% decreased 10 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Year-to-date operating margin is flat.\nThis includes continued significant investments in our people and in our business. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.77, reflecting 3% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2 billion and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. In the first half of the year, we have invested $2.9 billion in acquisitions across 23 transactions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings.\nNew bookings were $21.6 billion for the quarter, representing a 2% decline in both US dollar and local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.4. Consulting bookings were $10.5 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed services bookings were $11.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, flat in both US dollars and in local currency, and were slightly above the midpoint of our guided range.\nConsulting revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a decline of 3% in both US dollars and local currency. Managed service revenues were $7.8 billion, up 3% in both US dollars and local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew low single digits, and operations, strategy, and consulting declined low single digits. Turning to our geographic markets.\nIn North America, revenue was flat in local currency, with growth in public service offset by declines in banking and capital markets, software and platforms, and communications and media. In EMEA, revenues declined 2% in local currency, with growth in public service offset by declines in communications and media, and banking and capital markets. Revenue growth in Italy was offset by declines in the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland. In growth markets, revenue grew 6% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrial, public service, and chemicals and natural resources.\nRevenue growth was driven by Japan and Argentina, partially offset by declines in Australia and Brazil. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 30.9%, compared with 30.6% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.3%, compared to 9.9% for the Q2 last year.\nGeneral administrative expense was 6.9%, compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q2 of FY 2024 and FY 2023, we recorded $115 million and $244 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, respectively. These costs decreased operating margin by 70 basis points, and EPS by $0.14 this quarter, and operating margin by 150 basis points, and EPS by $0.30 in Q2 of last year.\nThe following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion in the Q2, reflecting an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%, a decrease of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the Q2 of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.4% for the Q2 last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.77, compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.69 in the Q2 last year. Days sales outstanding were 43 days, compared to 49 days last quarter and 42 days in the Q2 of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $110 million.\nOur cash balance at 29 February 2024 was $5.1 billion, compared with $9 billion at 31 August 2023. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the Q2, we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $352.35 per share. As of 29 February 2024, we had approximately $4.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.\nAlso, in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $813 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on 15 May, a 15% increase over last year. In closing, we remain laser-focused on capturing growth opportunities in the market and delivering value for our clients. As you know and expect of us, we will operate with rigor and discipline while continuing to invest for long-term market leadership. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Casey. Let me give a little more color on the demand environment. While all strategies continue to lead to technology and reinvention, our clients are navigating an uncertain macro environment due to economic, geopolitical, and industry-specific conditions. In response, we're seeing them thoughtfully prioritize larger transformations, building out their digital core to partnering to improve productivity, to free up more investment capacity, to a focus on growth and other initiatives with near-term ROI.\nOur focus on being at the center of our clients' business, doing their most complex transformational work, provides us with resiliency over time, as demonstrated by the fact that our top 100 clients have been clients for over 10 years. There is now near-universal recognition of the importance of AI, which is the heart of reinvention.\nThe ability to use AI at scale, however, varies widely, with clients on a continuum, with those which have strong digital cores generally seeking to move more quickly, while most clients are coming to grips with the investments needed to truly implement AI across the enterprise. Nearly all are finding it difficult to scale because the AI technology is a small part of what is needed.\nTo reinvent using technology, data, and AI, you must have the right digital core, change your processes and ways of working, reskill and upskill your people, and build new capabilities around responsible AI, all with a deep understanding of industry and function in order to unlock the value. Many clients need to first find more efficiency to enable scaled investment in all these capabilities, particularly in their data foundations.\nWe are able to help our clients with this AI rotation because of our broad services across strategy and consulting, technology and operations, as well as everything customer through Song and digital manufacturing and engineering through Industry X, and our relevance across the functions of the enterprises in 13 industries. Our privileged position in the technology ecosystem has perhaps never been more important.\nGenerative AI is rapidly evolving and still in the early stages of maturity and adoption. We are working closely with our ecosystem partners to help our clients understand the right data and AI backbone that is needed and how to achieve tangible business value. I'll now bring to life the complex work we are doing at the heart of our clients' businesses.\nBuilding on the back of a long-trusted partnership, we are working with Mondel?z International, a world leader in snacking, with well-known brands like Oreo, belVita, and Cadbury to continue to drive growth and be an industry leader. Having laid the foundations of a strong shared services model powered by leading technology platforms and a data and AI foundation, we are now working on an ambitious reinvention of their digital core.\nWe will design and implement a single cloud-based platform while also modernizing the finance function and transforming their supply chain planning and warehouse management capabilities. This will enable faster availability of products for customers, driving more sales growth and maximum profitability. This new digital core will also allow Mondel?z to further reinvent how they satisfy customers through the adoption of new technologies like generative AI. Cloud continues to be the foundation of the digital core.\nOur cloud business grew high single digit this quarter as clients do work across the cloud continuum, from migration to modernization to new business models to working at the intelligent edge. For example, we're helping Riyadh Air, a digitally native airline based in Saudi Arabia, become the world's first fully cloud-based airline. We will equip the brand new airline with a cloud-only infrastructure, enhanced cybersecurity, and AI-driven operations.\nOur capabilities will ensure that Riyadh Air's digital core is future-proof and remains legacy-free, enabling the airline to use cutting-edge technologies such as cloud, data, and AI to scale quickly and deliver a seamless and more personalized travel experience for its customers and employees. This will also help the company scale as it plans to operate over 100 destinations by 2030.\nWe are partnering with Belden, a global networking solution organization, on a cloud transformation program that will help them become a platform business, unlocking the power of edge, data, and AI to drive new business opportunities and enhance the customer experience. This platform will be powered by edge-to-cloud technology, allowing them to collect and analyze real-time data from industrial environments and improve operational efficiencies.\nThis will provide valuable data-driven insights to Belden and to their clients in industries where real-time insights are crucial. This reinvention will enable them to break down operational technology silos, allowing them to become a key player in the digital twin domain. We will also help enable this new service in the market. This strategic partnership will support Belden's reinvention from a products company into a data engineering and insights company that leverages the power of platforms.\nWe are focused on helping our clients leverage the power of AI quickly, generating tangible business value, leveraging our investment in differentiated tools that accelerate results. Our AI Navigator has helped clients across industries outline their value case, AI architecture, and AI solutions. Our recently announced AI Switchboard is already helping clients with the complex new need for integration across LLM models.\nFor example, one of the largest entertainment companies is currently testing the Switchboard to compare how the same prompt would be interpreted by different models and how they perform before deciding on which model to use. Ultimately, an enterprise-wide AI rotation requires a strong data foundation. We are working with Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications and technology company, on a radical simplification and modernization of its data ecosystem, accelerating its efforts to become AI-powered.\nWe are modernizing and consolidating over 50 disparate enterprise data sources into a small integrated set, forming Telstra's governed and secure data and AI core, allowing Telstra to rapidly scale bespoke generative AI capabilities in the future. Our work will also support the company's efforts to develop responsible, ethical, and secure market-leading AI frameworks while helping their teams provide quicker, more effective, and more personalized customer interactions.\nOne of the areas of richest opportunities for our clients is customer experience transformation, including with Generative AI, which uses the unique capabilities of Song across creative customer insights and deep technology expertise. Song grew low single digits this quarter. We continue to help clients reimagine marketing to drive growth. We're helping ExxonMobil, an energy supermajor, transform and optimize its end-to-end fuels marketing operations to drive future growth.\nWith our global capabilities, our managed services will leverage our Synapse platform to drive automation and deliver measurable efficiencies across the fuels marketing business. We are strengthening our partnership with Best Buy, a leading consumer electronics retailer, across multiple fronts to reimagine the customer experience, optimize costs, and drive growth. By leveraging data and Generative AI, we are helping to transform their context in our operations and improve customer and employee experience.\nWe are also pleased to have entered into an agreement with Best Buy for lifecycle management of our own Accenture devices in North America and are creating a joint offering of end-to-end field service device support for clients. We have already applied this new offering to a major TV provider, marking our first entry into this new market. These strategic initiatives underscore our commitment to helping Best Buy achieve superior customer experiences, operational efficiencies, and growth.\nSecurity is essential to reinvention, moving beyond IT to protecting the core assets of the business and evolving the critical role of security as technologies change. We saw very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. We are working with one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the United States to integrate their operational technology into a seamless, unified cybersecurity solution.\nTogether, we will enhance their security capabilities by implementing advanced monitoring and response, vulnerability management, and security automation. This will help reduce the risk of cyber events in their grid environment, protecting critical infrastructure serving tens of millions of people. We continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. Industry X grew double digits in Q2.\nWe're working with Indo Count Industries Limited, a global leader in the home textile space, on digital transformation to simplify operations, support its ambitious growth plans, and maximize e-commerce opportunities. We will build a cloud-enabled digital core powered by data and analytics that will help standardize, digitize, and automate processes and operations. From supply chain to logistics to manufacturing, the new platform will enable more efficient inventory management, quality standardization, optimal energy consumption, and better customer experiences.\nTogether, we will reinvent their operations and help expand their business in India, the Middle East, North America, the UK, and Europe. We continue our support for corporate green transformation by promoting carbon footprint compliance through the calculation and visualization of greenhouse gas emissions. To create a market where consumers can choose environmentally conscious products and services, a system to visualize the carbon footprint of each product is necessary.\nFor example, we're assisting Matsumoto Precision, a precision machine parts processing company based in Japan, to gain more detailed insights into the sustainability of their production and achieve their decarbonization goal. We implemented a solution through our manufacturing platform that uses individual manufacturing performance information to record and report the CO2 emission on a per-product basis. This will allow Matsumoto Precision to enhance their understanding of the environmental impact of their business and contribute more effectively to the realization of a decarbonized society. Back to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the Q3 of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.25 to 16.85 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about -1% compared to the Q3 of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated -1% to 3%+ growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3 growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution approaching 3%.\nWe continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. For adjusted operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2024 to be 15.5%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal 2023 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5. This compares to an effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023.\nWe now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.97 to 12.20, or 3% to 5 growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 to 9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 to 9.3 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director, Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press one, then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one, zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one, then zero at this time. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. Good morning to all of you. Julie, just a big picture, maybe too simple of a question, but just curious to get your thoughts on where we are in the cycle for IT services spend because we've been seeing sector softness for quite some time now. Accenture has done well. You've had very large deal activity come through. Short-term cycle stuff is always a little pressured, as you said. Where are we in terms of seeing maybe things bottoming or short-cycle discretionary spend returning?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, Tien-Tsin, I think it's hard to predict at this point anything other than what we see right now, right? What's different than 90 days ago? Well, as we said in December, we really get visibility into our clients' budgets in January. We say that every year, right?\nAs the calendar year, we turn the page, what we saw was a further tightening of spending at our clients, and that affects our services, and particularly on the smaller projects. From a sort of trend perspective, right, 90 days ago, we didn't see the same level. Now you've kind of turned the dial a little bit more, constraints, and that's where we see the budgets being set for calendar year 2024, right?\nAs you said, though, in this environment, we're taking market share, and we're seeing building momentum on our strategy to be the reinvention partner with a record 39 clients with bookings over $100 million. What does that tell you, right? The clients understand the importance of the technology-led transformation, right? The fundamentals remain the same, right? There's a lot more reinvention ahead.\nWhen you look at where is cloud, right, both migration and modernization, we say about 80% of the opportunity is ahead, right? Data and AI, about 90% of the opportunity is ahead. Replatforming and cloud-based platforms, about 65% of that opportunity ahead based on who has actually adopted the more modern platforms. Security, well, I think security can be kind of forever ahead, but at least 65% ahead.\nThat's before you get to thinking about areas like digital manufacturing, engineering services, where that technology has only been coming online even in the last couple of years, sort of the modern technology. Of course, customer also extraordinarily early days. Where we really focus on is meeting clients where they are today, right? That's prioritize the large transformational deals and then be positioned to capture the spending when it increases.\nWe see sort of the industry as being very strong because all clients have to get there. They need to get to the technology transformation. They need to get to reinvention. That's why you're seeing, even as the constraints, you're seeing that early interest in GenAI. I mean, $1 billion sales in the first six months of the year, that is the fastest we have ever built sales in an emerging technology. What it tells you is that clients understand the importance of AI, that they're going to have to reinvent every part of the enterprise. That's exactly where everything we've done for the last decades at Accenture, right?\nBeing the company that can go from strategy to build to operations, deep in industry and functional expertise, because of strategy and consulting all comes together for this moment to be the partner for reinvention across the enterprise, not just to build the technology, but to use it to reinvent. That's exactly what you see in these results, which is why I'm super confident about the industry and in the future.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. No, and I'm confident that Accenture will be there to catch all that, like you said. Maybe it's my follow-up with the GenAI bookings. Any trends on deal size and confidence that some of these early bookings will convert to become a part of this whole large $100 million+ deal activity across, or pull through from GenAI, if that question makes sense?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nA couple of things, right? What you see in our resilience is that we are doing these bookings over $100 million, and that's what kind of layers that. That just gives you that base, right, of resilience during this period. As we said, we've seen further constraint on the smaller projects. That's why you've got the updated guidance, right? The base of these larger deals, we feel really good about from a resilience perspective.\nThen you know how this is, right? You're at the client. You're at the heart of their business. You're really doing the strategic work. That's what all these large deals represent. Then as spending increases, you catch the pent-up demand. That's kind of how we see it, and that's how we've run it in the past. By the way, of course, as you know, we're really investing inorganically to capture more growth, which you also start to see in particular at the back end of our fiscal year. Thanks, Tien-Tsin Huang.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. KC, if Accenture does 1% constant currency in Q3, that's kind of the midpoint of the range. I guess the implied midpoint for Q4 is a ramp up to 6% constant currency. What kind of visibility do you have going into a number of the midpoint like that in Q4?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hi, Brian. Thanks for your question. You're right. Obviously, your math is correct. That would be what our guidance would say. In terms of visibility, it's really no different than what we have any time in the past in this part of the year for our full-year guidance. Obviously, we are not forecasting the whole year. We just have the back half of the year. There's no difference in visibility as it relates to what we've done any other time of the year, any other year this time. We do our same analysis and outlook to provide you with our guidance of the Q1 to Q3.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Got it. Then, Julie, just thinking about clients needing to update their data in order to leverage AI and scale, why isn't that translating to stronger demand in the business? You would think that everybody would turn around and spend considerably on short-term to get that ramp up in order to get AI to leverage it, but it doesn't quite translate. I'm just trying to figure out the disconnect there.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. There's two things. First of all, it's about prioritization, right? They're overall constrained on spending, right? You make choices, right, as opposed to it being additive. They're not able to allocate extra budget. They're prioritizing their budget. You're seeing more of a substitution right now as opposed to, Hey, we need to do this. Let's add to the budget. That's tied to the uncertain macro that's putting people constrained. I had one banker say it's like corporates have put themselves on a diet given the macro, right? The second thing, Bryan, is you have to remember that you can't just jump to the great data foundation, right? You need to be in the cloud. You've got to have modern platforms.\nWhat you should read into the higher clients doing these higher bookings, right, is that they're doing the big transformations oftentimes to be ready to put in the data foundation, right? There's only still 40% of workloads that are in the cloud. Roughly 20% of those haven't been modernized, right? Many of our clients haven't put in the platforms. If you don't have the major ERP platforms that are modern, you don't create a data foundation to fuel GenAI in isolation. You've got to build the digital core, and as we've said, there's a lot more to go. That's what's driving these larger complex transformations.\nPeople don't like to do these big transformations in the sense of they're big, they're hard, they're complicated, and they need to do them in order to ultimately be able to use the AI, not just in a part of the business or as a proof of concept, but really to transform and get the value they now see. Again, you can't jump to AI. You've got to put all the pieces, and a lot of clients aren't there yet, which is our opportunity.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Bryan. Thanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the questions around particularly AI, etc. I recognize everybody's kind of at different stages. How should we think about first the timeline in terms of preparing and getting ready to implement new solutions, etc., and then moving into full implementation and how we should think about that affecting Accenture's business? Like you mentioned, you've talked about some record bookings or the number of new customers over 100 million, how that will ramp in the timeframe.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Well, so maybe just let me just start with the strategy around capturing the growth opportunity from GenAI, right? This is the same playbook that we have used in every wave of new technology evolution, right? When we went from mainframe to client server, then to cloud and software as a service, and then to RPA and AI-driven automation when you saw things like myWizard and Synapse, right? We have the same strategy.\nThe strategy starts with, we want to be the first mover to help our clients use the technology. That's why, what we're doing with our investments of $3 billion to create solutions for them. You see that coming through with our sales in Generative AI, which, as I said earlier, are the fastest we've ever seen in sort of these new technologies, because there's a lot of interest, and we're the leader. We want to be the first mover in helping our clients use it. The second part of our strategy is to be the first mover in using the technology itself to serve our clients, right? We did that with the digital, with AI automation, with all of our platforms.\nWhat that does, it's a proven formula because if we invest big to be early and be the first mover, right, then we're positioned to capture all the opportunity with our clients because they need to adopt it and transform. As I just went through, that requires a lot, the digital core. Then you've got to actually use it to change new ways of working, right, to upskill your talent, right, and build new capabilities like responsible AI. When we are able to be the first mover, which we are already starting now to use GenAI and how we deliver, that enhances our competitive position, right? It makes us more differentiated.\nOf course, it also then allows our clients over time, the more we use the GenAI, to achieve the results they need at a lower cost, which frees up their investment capacity to do the massive reinvention. Of course, we are then best positioned to be their partner as they reinvest in using the tech and AI to reimagine their enterprise. That use of AI, because remember, as you think about the growth, right, you've got a lot of a digital core that's got to be built, right?\nYou can't jump that step, right? It's not a magic technology, right? Then as you build it, you then have to go function by function to change the ways you work to actually get the productivity and the growth. We really see this as being kind of the next decade of what our clients are going to be focused on, and we're positioning ourselves to be their partner and be the first mover in both places.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll take the layering-in question on the larger deals and talk a little bit about how that's going to work for the back half of the year as it relates to guidance. We have the larger deals that were terrific, right, in our Q2 and our whole first half of the year. You're right, they do layer in slower than the smaller deals, and we see pressure in the volume of our smaller deals. That's why we have the 1 to 3 guidance for the full year. Now, we do feel good about delivering to this guidance and what that means for H2.\nIt really is for a few reasons that we've talked about before, but let me just kind of reiterate. The first is that our competitive advantage is that we have the ability to invest. You saw us do that in H1, and Julie talked about that, with investing more in acquisitions this year in the first half than we did all of last year. That's really important because that drives inorganic growth. Again, we do that really to fuel organic growth. We see that coming online in the back half of the year. The second thing is that we have done these larger transformation deals, but also the ones from the previous years. We see that continuing to benefit us as it relates to revenue as they will layer on in the back half of the year.\nThat really just speaks to the resilience of our strategy, both in terms of what Julie has talked about, being where our clients need us, and our inorganic strategy to continue to benefit, to pivot to scale in new areas of growth. That's how that all kind of comes together in terms of revenue conversion from those larger deals and when they come online, James. Maybe I'll just also add what that means from a type of work for the entire year. What we now see from the context of Q1 to Q3 is our consulting type of work probably will be about flattish. We see our managed services growing to about mid-single-digit growth for the year.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color to both of you. Quickly, KC, just in terms of that investment, how do we think about how that affects the margin expansion? I mean, typically, when you're doing acquisitions, there's a little bit of time before you can start to get people to the same type of trajectory as Accenture's margin expansion. Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about that impacting as well.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYes. Thanks for that. Well, first of all, I just want to point out that I'm really pleased with our profitability in the first half of the year and the outlook for our profitability for the full year. Margin is flat, but we have EPS growth for the first half of the year, profit growth of 5%. That really just points to the rigor and discipline that we continue to operate our business in.\nWell, really importantly, what Julie talked about, all the investments we're making in our business and our people continue, right? As you look at the back half of the year, we now see the 10 basis points expansion is where we see it. Again, very important, continue to have high levels of investment in our people and our business. In EPS, we see for the whole year at about 3% to 5.\nOne thing I will point out just to help all of you, we did benefit from the first half of the year in our EPS with higher non-operating income, which makes a lot of sense on interest income on our higher cash balance. The first half, you see that our cash went from $9 to $5. Still great cash. No concerns. We'll continue with our capital allocation strategy.\nJust as you model on the back half of the year, you'll see that, not surprisingly, with lower cash, we'll have lower interest income. Just as you're working through your EPS modeling for the first half and the second half, that's something that you might want to consider.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. Julie, I'm curious, just based on your conversations with leaders, what might be the catalysts here to have clients release spending programs and kind of lean back into shorter cycle work? Just as economic data generally holds up, are we just in a slower for longer backdrop? Or I'm just kind of hoping that you can share some color on how you're thinking about a recovery internally here and what enterprises really are watching and waiting for.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nI think there's going to be a couple of dynamics, right? Remember, they just set budgets. We're kind of assuming these are the budgets for their calendar year. We see, in general, most of this constraint is tied to the uncertain macro. Those are the kind of things. They've set budgets, and they've got uncertain macro.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Just a reminder that everything that we're talking about in terms of giving guidance, I know all of you know this, but just as a reminder, our fiscal year ends in August, right? It's a little bit over halfway through the calendar year.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Okay. That makes sense. Then as it relates to GenAI, just kind of the revolutionary versus evolutionary kind of questioning here, just given how much work needs to be done for most clients to really do anything with large language models, how do we interpret that as a driver of your growth? Meaning, does GenAI enable you to essentially drive a higher level of growth when spending does become more normal? Or should we think about this more as a next tech wave that enables comparable levels of normalized growth just because of how long this might all take for large enterprises to get there?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWhat I'd say is this is more about we think of this as prior technology waves, right? Each one's been a little bit faster, right, in terms of that. Especially when you look at kind of where our clients are on the continuum of building out that digital core, there's a lot to go, and you really need that to fully realize it. We see this as more like our prior kind of the way these things have evolved in the past. Right now, that's what we see.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much. I guess my question, are you seeing your clients probably having much lower attrition, just like every company has low employee attrition right now? Are you seeing them take their own employees, their own IT employees, and just do more internally right now? Is that a little bit of just the demand issue right now?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWe certainly are seeing, obviously, our clients have invested in more technology internally at our advice, right? We've said to them during the pandemic, with technology being so important, they should be building up their technology. Sure, there are clients. A lot of our clients, not all of it, because it really depends on your positioning. Some of our clients, that's really not the differentiator, right?\nThey want a smaller IT, and they've got others who built it up, and it really depends on where they are. Sure, I mean, we certainly got clients doing more in-house as part of it. We've got other clients outsourcing more, right? It's really all over the map because it's very company-specific as to what makes sense for their strategy.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Okay. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up for KC. The tax rate, clearly, you lowered guidance just on the tax rate itself. Is that something one-off to this year, or is that something now that just seems more normalized?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. There's really four things that every year are the same that really influence the tax rate. It just really is how those things come together. The geographic mix of income, any settlements from previous years, any increase that we need to do on prior year tax liabilities, and lastly, the impact of our equity on our tax rate. Those four things really are confluences that are the same every year. Depending on how they fall, that's going to influence where we land on our tax rate. This year, we saw them favorably in aggregate, so we were able to keep our two-point range but drop it by 1%.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Well, thank you, guys.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I have a really big picture question. I'm curious, Julie, how you feel about Accenture's role in the broader context of technology like software and cloud. I realize in your prior, very thoughtful answer about technology architectures, that was a great structure, as was your innovation session back on 16 February. It does seem like other parts of tech are doing better than services. I'm just interested in your perspective on services in the context of broader tech spending.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture",
    "content2": "Yeah. No. Absolutely. It's a great question, right? Services are where you can dial back more easily than when you're signing up for licenses for technology that you need, right? You'd imagine, and which is what we're seeing, that when you're constraining overall spending, right, your discretionary spending, you go to service providers where you're saying, Wait, I can pause for that. I can wait for that. At the same time, you've got in other parts of it, like with software, where you've got to, if it's things you really need to invest in, and you've got different licenses.\nIt's really not different than other cycles is services have a bigger opportunity to say, It's a little more discretionary. Let's wait. Even if I've bought the licenses, I'm going to wait to actually incur the cost because a lot of times the cost of the services can be significantly higher than the software licenses, right, because you've got all the change that you've got to do and all of that around.\nAgain, we don't see anything sort of different than when you've got an uncertain macro. You look around for your discretionary spending, and you cut back. That's why, of course, you're seeing still the big transformations happening because it's not discretionary, and they've really got to replatform in that. It's like nothing mysterious about it is kind of what I consider kind of normal in this kind of a macro.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThat's right. I think just as a reminder, even with all of that, we still have the record spend with us, right, with $40 billion of bookings for the first half of the year.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nYep. Those are great points.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. I'll drop back in the queue.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you, Julie. Thanks, KC. Thanks.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director, Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you. Hi, Julie. Hi, KC. Going back to, hey, going back to the question of bookings, are clients actually revisiting existing bookings, ones that they signed maybe last year and in our times prior, relooking at them using the lens of applying sort of rapidly evolving GenAI capabilities? To what extent is that happening? Then that kind of then implies, obviously, can we use those past bookings and backlog as an indicator of future growth and how soon that can layer in?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I'll take that just maybe more just the financial kind of mechanical part of it. We have not seen a change in us working the work that's already been contracted, what we would call our backlog. What we talked about was really spending on new sales, new services, and their smaller projects. That's the dynamic that we have factored into our guidance for the year.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGot it. Then the other question was on LearnVantage and Udacity. I thought that was a particularly interesting deal. If you could walk us through maybe the mechanics of that deal? Every company's investing in talent here. This seems to be a bit different approach, maybe. Could you just talk about the rationale, the downstream impact, and so on?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Thank you because I'm super passionate about what we're doing with LearnVantage because it is so critical for our clients. Talent is the number one agenda item for CEOs, right? The number one. When you think about what reinvention means, the clients have to do an AI rotation, and they have to do a talent rotation, right? What LearnVantage does is it, first and foremost, provides the ability for everything from the board to the C-suite, to business users, to the technologists to get the technology training they need to make the right decisions on AI, for example, right, to be able to become deeper in the new technologies.\nIt really goes from the board to the technologist. With Udacity, what we're able to provide is essentially the same approach Accenture uses, right? We spend over $1 billion ourselves. You saw our latest average 14 hours per employee. We use learning science to learn and do. Most of our clients aren't able to do that.\nThe big differentiator for us in the market here is that we Accenture know when you train someone, we have to then put them on a job, and they have to get paid to do something. They are work-ready. We're bringing that expertise now at scale to our clients. What Udacity does is the same thing. They use experts, mentors. They have real project work that they then coach people on.\nIt's that same sort of approach of learn and do. Our clients don't have all the work that we do. Udacity has created this ability. It's coupled then with Accenture's deep understanding of what it takes to train and be work-ready. We're really excited about it. Our clients are excited about it. They've been coming to us. We've been doing this learning.\nThis enables us now to do it at scale. Again, we want to be the reinvention partner. The more that we can fill all of the needs of our clients around that, the better position that we will be. We see LearnVantage is highly, highly strategic. By the way, we have a managed service today to actually manage the learning services that companies are now doing internally, which we also expect to grow. We're investing and expect to grow, so very excited.\nThen finally, we all have the responsibility as corporates to bring our people along the journey. When people worry about things like AI and displacement, right, we feel that our ability to bring proven upskilling expertise to help our clients be able to bring their people is really, really important. It's important for our communities. It's important to their boards. We all should consider it really important because it's the right thing to do.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGot it.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you very much. Okay. Great. Thanks, everyone. In closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, all of our people for what you do every day, and to assure you that we are working every day to continue to earn that trust. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect"

Please continue to hold.\nThank you all for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's Q1 Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. If you wish to ask a question, please press one, then zero, now on your phone. If you should require assistance during the call, please press star, then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our Q1 Fiscal 2024 Earnings announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Connor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC McClure will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the Q1. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC McClure provides our business outlook for the Q2 and full fiscal year 2024.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at accenture.com.\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thanks to our 743,000 people around the world for their incredible dedication and commitment every day, which is how we are able to consistently deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I am pleased that we delivered on our commitments this quarter while continuing to invest significantly in strategic areas to drive the next waves of growth, including extending our early leadership in Generative AI. And we did so against a macro backdrop that continues to be challenging. Starting with our financial results, our bookings were $18.4 billion, representing 12% growth in local currency. We had 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in the quarter, and over half were in North America, representing the trust our clients have in us to be at the center of their major programs, spending, and ongoing reinvention.\nWe delivered revenues of $16.2 billion for the quarter at the top end of our FX-adjusted range, representing 1% growth in local currency. We continued to take market share. As expected, we continue to see lower discretionary spend, which particularly impacts our consulting type of work, as well as slower decision-making, and our CMT industry group continues to be challenged. We remain on track with the business optimization actions we announced in March to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience. Finally, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6% while continuing to invest in our business and our people. Turning now to our investments, we closed 12 acquisitions this quarter for a total of $788 million in strategic areas across our geographic markets.\nIn North America, we are continuing to build out our new growth area of capital projects, an $88 billion addressable market in North America, which we entered in August with the acquisition of Answer Advisory. In Q1, we added Comtech, a consulting and program management company for infrastructure projects in Canada. We also invested in the next digital frontier with our supply chain acquisition of the Shelby Group. We expanded our cloud capabilities with the acquisitions of Ocelot Consulting and Incapsulate, and we invested in digital marketing in the healthcare industry with the acquisition of ConcentricLife. In EMEA, we expanded our cybersecurity capabilities with the acquisition of Innotec in Spain, enhanced our business process services in the insurance industry with the acquisition of ON Service Group in Germany, and invested in digital healthcare and talent with the acquisitions of Nautilus Consulting and The Storytellers in the UK.\nFinally, in growth markets, we are focused on the cloud opportunity with the acquisition of Solnet in New Zealand, along with cybersecurity with the acquisition of MNEMO in Mexico, and on digital marketing services with the Song acquisition of Signal in Japan. Our ability to invest at scale to fuel our organic growth is a competitive advantage. For example, in EMEA, we are focusing on pivoting our CMT business. We are investing with Vodafone to create a strategic partnership to commercialize its market-leading shared services operations and unlock new sources of growth and efficiency, enhance speed to market, and new customer opportunities for their operating companies and partner markets. Together, we plan to create a new data and AI-driven shared services model and a scaled, commercially driven, and more efficient organization with higher quality services and enhanced speed to market for its portfolio of offerings.\nThe new unit will utilize Accenture's world-class technology, transformation, and managed services such as its digital solutions and platforms, and deep AI expertise. It will also tap into our well-known learning capabilities to continuously create new skilling and career paths for its people. This move speaks to Vodafone's ambition to work in new ways, reduce structural complexity, reinvent their company, and the industry. Of course, we continue to invest in learning for our people with approximately eight million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 12 hours per person. Turning to Generative AI, our growth and investments, we continue to take an early leadership position in GenAI, which will be an important part of the reinvention of our clients in the next decade. Last quarter, we shared that we had sold approximately 300 projects with $300 million in sales in all of FY 2023.\nDemand continued to accelerate in Q1 with over $450 million in GenAI sales. As you know, we are investing $3 billion in AI over three years. For many of our clients, 2023 was a year of Generative AI experimentation. We are now focusing on helping our clients in 2024 realize value at scale. We're excited about the recent launch of our specialized services to help companies customize and manage foundation models. We're seeing that the true value of Generative AI is to deliver on personalization and business relevance. This is driven by context and accuracy. Data readiness, along with foundation model choices and customization, are some of the most important steps and decisions that companies will make in the next year as they pursue value. Our clients are going to use an array of models to achieve their business objectives.\nOur proprietary Switchboard allows the user to select a combination of models to address business context or factors like cost or accuracy. We will offer rigorous training and certification programs to organizations using these new services to customize and scale GenAI solutions and transform every link in their value chain. We are also investing in AI acquisitions. For example, we recently announced our intent to acquire Ammagamma, an Italy-based firm that helps companies advance their uses of AI and Generative AI technologies. With this acquisition, we will add 90 experienced AI professionals, many specializing in Generative AI, along with the expertise that includes engineering, mathematics, economics, historians, philosophers, and designers who will join our growing network of professionals in our Advanced Center for AI.\nWe are progressing towards our goal of doubling our deeply skilled data and AI practitioners from 40,000 to 80,000, with an additional 5,000 practitioners as of Q1. Finally, a few additional highlights of the 360-degree value that we created this quarter. We recently achieved our highest brand value ranking to date on Interbrand's prestigious Best Global Brands list, increasing to $21.3 billion and ranking number 30. We jumped from number 17 to number 10 on the 2023 World's Best Workplaces list by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This recognition is particularly noteworthy because it is based on feedback from our people. We were recognized for the 7th year in a row on the Wall Street Journal list of best managed companies for excellence in customer satisfaction, employee engagement, and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength.\nAnd we also received the top score for social responsibility and are among the top 10 for customer satisfaction. We continue to lead in our ability to attract people with different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different lived experiences. Our success is reflected in the top score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index in the US for the 16th consecutive year for leading equitable workplace policies, practices, and benefits for LGBTQ+ people. And today, we're proud to present an update to our 360-degree value reporting experience, which is available on our website because we believe that transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress. Over to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which were in line with our expectations and include continued investments at scale to strengthen our position as a leader in the market. Once again, our results illustrate our ability to manage our business with rigor and discipline and deliver value for our shareholders. So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 1% local currency with mid-single-digit growth or higher in five of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, utilities, health, and energy. As expected, we saw continued pressure in our CMT industry group, and we continue to take market share.\nAs a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market. We use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of any significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.27, reflecting 6% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points over Q1 last year, and includes significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $430 million and returned $2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $788 million in acquisitions across 12 transactions in the quarter.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $18.4 billion for the quarter, representing 14% growth in US dollars and 12% growth in local currency with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $8.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed Services bookings were $9.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Turning now to revenues, revenues for the quarter were $16.2 billion, a 3% increase in US dollars and 1% local currency, and we're at the top end of our guided range, adjusted for a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately 1.5% compared to the 2.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat in US dollars, and a decline of 2% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $7.8 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 5% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew mid-single digits, operations was flat, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits. Turning to our geographic markets, in North America, revenue declined 1% local currency. Growth was led by public service, offset by declines in communications and media, software and platforms, and banking and capital markets. Before I continue, I want to highlight that for this fiscal year 2024, we have reorganized our geographic segments. Europe is now EMEA and includes the Middle East and Africa, which were previously included in growth markets. The reclassification for prior years can be found in our investor relations website. In EMEA, revenues grew 2% local currency, led by growth in public service and banking and capital markets, partially offset by decline in communications and media.\nRevenue growth was driven by Italy, Austria, and France, partially offset by a decline in the United Kingdom. In growth markets, we delivered 5% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in chemicals and natural resources, public service, and banking and capital markets. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.6% compared to 32.9% for the Q1 last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5%, compared with 9.8% for the Q1 last year. General and administrative expense was 6.4%, compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q1, we recorded $140 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 90 basis points and EPS by $0.17. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the Q1, reflecting a 16.7% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in Q1 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%, compared with an effective tax rate of 23.3% for the Q1 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.27, compared with diluted EPS of $3.08 in the Q1 last year. Days sales outstanding were 49 days, compared to 42 days last quarter and 48 days in the Q1 of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $430 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $499 million and operating equipment additions of $69 million. Our cash balance at 30 November was $7.1 billion, compared with $9 billion at 31 August.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the Q1, we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $311.90 per share. At 30 November, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $810 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on 15 February, a 15% increase over last year.\nSo, in closing, we remain committed to delivering on our long-standing financial objectives, growing faster than the market and taking share, generating modest margin expansion and stronger earnings, while at the same time investing at scale for our long-term market leadership, generating strong Free Cash Flow, and returning a significant portion of that cash to shareholders. And now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, KC. As we begin our Q2, we remain laser-focused on creating value for our clients. The pace of spending continues to be impacted by the macro environment. Our business in the UK, in particular, in Q1, saw even greater challenges than we expected last quarter. The fundamentals of our industry remain unchanged. All strategies continue to lead to technology, and companies need to reinvent every part of their enterprise using tech, data, and AI to optimize operations and accelerate growth. To do so, they must build a Digital Core. Strategy and consulting, which brings our deep industry and functional expertise, is critical to how we differentiate by helping our clients ensure they drive business value from their Digital Core.\nWe are continuing to see significant demand in areas like cloud migration and modernization, modern ERP and data and AI, including GenAI, platforms, and security, all of which represent areas of great opportunity. It is still early with more Digital Core to be built in the future than has been done to date. Let me bring to light the significant opportunities still ahead with examples from the quarter. Our cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong double-digit growth, reflecting the ongoing significant market opportunity. We estimate only 40% of enterprise workloads are in the cloud, of which only 20% or so are modernized, and 80% opportunity remaining. Clients are continuing to prioritize the Digital Core, as evidenced by strong demand for cloud migration. We're working with a leading insurance provider to continue their cloud transformation.\nTogether, we are migrating hundreds of applications to a cloud-based platform, enabling the company to exit their data centers by 2025. To date, we have migrated more than half of their apps to the cloud. This is not just a migration. We are modernizing applications and accelerating automation to integrate disparate data more easily from acquisitions and help the company move into new markets. We are helping reshape their organizational mindset, drive cultural change, and find new ways of working, including the creation of a new IT service model to lead complex transformations with agility and speed. This transformation will reduce legacy complexity and technical debt, enable more cost-effective back-office operations, and drive growth and innovation, ultimately helping the company provide more affordable and personalized insurance solutions for families and businesses.\nFor those clients who have made significant progress on their migration, they are investing to modernize and innovate across the cloud continuum, extending cloud to the edge, unlocking greater value with more opportunities still ahead. For example, we recently announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with McDonald's to help execute their technology strategy and leverage the company's scale to unlock greater speed and efficiency for customers, restaurant teams, and employees. This new work supports McDonald's ambition to connect restaurants worldwide with cloud technology and apply Generative AI solutions across McDonald's platforms. Accenture also will support the acceleration of automation innovation and the enhancement of the digital capabilities of McDonald's employees. Accenture's deep understanding of the McDonald's business, industry, and technology will help unlock opportunities in their ongoing digital investments as McDonald's reinvents the customer experience and stays ahead of their customers' changing needs.\nTurning to data and AI, we estimate that less than 10% of companies have matured data and AI capabilities. This is a critical part of building the Digital Core, and we see this embedded in our larger transformations in work focused on data and AI modernization, and in the opportunities of Generative AI. We help leaders such as BBVA, a global financial services group, to stay ahead of the curve by continuing to reinvent its business model with GenAI. For example, we are building a GenAI-powered financial coach assistant to help them disrupt customer centricity in the banking industry while they reinvent their Digital Core to also become even more efficient. This work is a continuation of our ongoing GenAI implementation, which is transforming BBVA's operations and digital marketing and is helping employees be more productive.\nThanks to its strong Digital Core, BBVA can continue to reinvent across their enterprise by applying GenAI. We are also helping a global hospitality group to support its content production capability and marketing communications across its hotel brands, tailoring content to guests' evolving needs. This new data-driven content supply chain model will create personalized, flexible, and efficient marketing communications content across every customer touchpoint. Spanning both physical and digital communications, the service will be available to all marketing professionals, enabling content production management from its initial brief to performance measurement and content optimization. This will increase the effectiveness of its digital marketing programs, drive more traffic to its branded website, and deliver exceptional customer experiences, all while reducing costs. Platforms are a core component of the Digital Core and are critical to our clients' transformations. We estimate 60% of the opportunity is still ahead as clients upgrade their core platforms.\nWe are working with OCBC Group, a Singapore-based multinational banking and financial services corporation, on a two-year transformation journey to modernize their human resources organization. We will shift key HR functions such as hiring, talent management, and career development to the cloud and create a next-generation HR operating model with enhanced capabilities. Together, we will drive operational efficiency with a strategic focus on future talent readiness, employee experience, and AI-driven decision-making. By providing a scalable framework to meet evolving business needs, we'll free up HR capacity to provide high-value advisory work and empower business and HR leaders with analytics and insights to facilitate better talent decisions. Security is also essential to a Digital Core, and we continue to see very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter.\nWhile the opportunity to continue to grow and expand, we estimate that currently only 36% of business leaders are confident that their organizations are cyber-resilient, representing at least 64% of untapped potential. An example of our important work with our clients to build secure organizations is Fortrea, a global contract research organization of about 19,000 people that provides clinical trial and research services for life sciences companies in more than 90 countries. We're working with Fortrea to deliver database outcomes and health-related insights, which require adherence to regional and local industry and government regulations. As they continue to grow and enter new markets, they need a partner to ensure that their cybersecurity program remains resilient and compliant with security best practices. We will co-create, architect, and operate a series of global cybersecurity services and capabilities through our managed services.\nOur partnership will help Fortrea grow its business, utilizing flexible risk and security strategies. We are focused on helping clients reimagine marketing and their customer experience to drive growth. Strong demand continues to remain strong with double-digit growth in Q1. We are collaborating with PEUGEOT, a French automotive brand, to lead strategic and creative direction for its global communications. The partnership supports PEUGEOT's ambition to engage a younger audience and become a leader in the electric vehicle market. Accenture Song will manage global communications across all traditional and digital media channels. The first campaign will be a full 360 integrated launch of the all-new electric fastback SUV E-3008, in early 2024. Finally, we continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. We estimate that only 5% of enterprises have scaled mature digital capabilities across their organizations. Industry X grew strong double digits in Q1.\nWe are working with a leading German multinational car manufacturer to engineer the next generation of infotainment system. Using our deep industry expertise and software engineering capabilities, we will support the implementation of a new flexible platform that enables the next level of in-car experience with cutting-edge customer features while minimizing complexity and maximizing the software we use across hardware generations. We're working with a global food manufacturer on a total enterprise reinvention strategy to modernize its supply chain, reduce operating costs, and position it for the future. We will transform key supply chain processes such as planning, procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. AI and intelligent automation will optimize end-to-end supply chain operations and achieve greater efficiency and agility. We'll also help the company leverage data for better decision-making and implement portfolio optimization to ensure the right assets are focused on for investment to maximize returns and minimize risks.\nThis self-funded program is expected to generate significant productivity gains, with ongoing savings fueling further capability builds and bottom-line growth. Back to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the Q2 of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.4 to 16 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 0.5% compared to the Q2 of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated -2% to +2% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2023.\nFor the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect our revenue to be in the range of 2 to 5 growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, with the inorganic contribution now expected to be more than 2. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. The following guidance for full year 2024 excludes these impacts. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2024 to be 15.5 to 15.7%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2023 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023.\nWe continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.97 to 12.32, or 3 to 6% growth over adjusted fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 to 9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 to 9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, KC.\nI would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Happy holidays. I just wanted to start with a question on the revenue guidance for Q2.\nThe midpoint there would suggest a point of deceleration, but we do have an easier comparison, and there was a return to positive growth in consulting booking. So just hoping you can help us reconcile that and then maybe comment on the second half re-acceleration that is continuing to be implied in the guide, maybe slightly steeper than previously thought. Thank you.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah, great. Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays to you too. So let me first start in terms of our guidance. I'll first start with Q1. And as you heard us say, we were really pleased with our Q1 performance. And as you stated, our Q2 guidance is the same as Q1. And maybe a couple of things that I'll point out compared to what we thought 90 days ago.\nAs Julie mentioned, we do see some differences in EMEA, particularly in the UK, where we're focused on repositioning the business back to growth, and that's going to take some time. But Jason, what is the same is that we are still operating in an environment, which is the same that we described last quarter, where the discretionary spend and the decision-making is slow. And so right now, as you expect, and you know that we do this every year, we're talking to our clients right now about their 2024 budgets. And so that's all, again, to be expected. When we look forward into H2 2024, to start with just what the math is, we continue to see higher growth in the back half of the year. That's going to start with higher growth in Q3.\nOur confidence in our H2 increased growth is really based on a few things, again, reiterating what we talked about at the beginning of the year versus our results in Q1. So we're confident, again, that we were able to deliver across the board as we expected in the Q1. And also, then, as Julie mentioned quite a bit, we made a lot of investments in our business in the quarter, and that's helping us pivot to higher growth areas. In addition to that, as we talked about last quarter, the same remains. We do have our revenue positioned in the back half of our year from these larger transformation deals. So that has not changed. We continue to see that. And then we just need to continue to layer in our new sales as we get closer to the back half of the year.\nSo we're really very pleased to reiterate the 2 to 5% revenue guidance that we had at the beginning of the year.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Just as a quick follow-up, what should we expect in terms of Q2 bookings for consulting and managed services year-over-year? I know managed services has a particularly tough comp. Thanks again.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So, Jason, I know I've been giving color and basically guiding for future quarter bookings, but as you know really well covering us for so long, bookings can really be lumpy. So I'm not going to give that color anymore. Going forward. What I would say is the best way to think about demand for our business is the revenue guide that we give. And we give revenue guidance for the Q2 as well as our 2 to 5% for the full year.\nAnd obviously, we'll continue to do that. I would just put in that we do feel good about our pipeline. We have a very solid pipeline.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nPerfect. Yeah. I just want to follow up to Jason's question just with the bookings, which was better than expected, and your large-scale backlog is quite large now. Just the visibility and the timeliness of those conversions. Have you seen any signs of push-out or delays or that thing? Just trying to understand the conversion potential.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So maybe just a couple of things on that. So I think conversion can be really mainly impacted by the mix, right? So the mix of deals that we have.\nSo let's just start with overall, we haven't seen any change in the conversion based on the mix of work. So strategy and consulting, which converts faster. Then you know with operations, there's been no change within those different parts of our business, no change in the conversion. What we have talked about, and we've been consistent, that there's really been no change over the last 90 days in our discretionary spend environment, and that is consistent with our expectations. And we haven't been reliant, and we're not reliant on a change in that macro to get to our full year guidance. So what does that mean? Hopefully, you guys can hear me. There's a little trouble on the line. Okay. That is, as we have lower discretionary spend, that does impact the conversions, Tien-Tsin, as you know, but we have factored that all into our guidance.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nUnderstood, KC. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up. I know you've been really busy with acquisitions, and Julie listed a bunch of them. Is there a change here in the rhythm of acquisitions or your appetite? It sounds like the revenue contribution is up a notch, but up a little bit. But you tell me. I didn't know if there was a change in your thinking here on deals. Thanks.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, I'm going to maybe give a little bit of color now. I'll certainly hand it over to Julie. Just more from a financial perspective, I think, and as you know this really well, but our competitive advantage really is our investment capacity that allows us to pivot to higher areas of growth. We can do that and invest through every cycle, and you've seen us do that.\nAnd I really think that is clearly a differentiator for us. You see that with our strong start this quarter. Julie talked about the 12 acquisitions, $800 million of spend, and we have five more that we've announced for Q2. All of that, and we're reconfirming op margin expansion of 10 to 30 basis points. I think it's important to see that in terms of our strategy, we're continuing to do this to really fuel organic growth. And lastly, I think one of the parts that really distinguishes us is our capital allocation framework, which is durable yet flexible. So we're able to flex up and do inorganic to the degrees that we see that we'd like to, while at the same time continuing to increase our return to our shareholders. So I think it's really, really great.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Yeah.\nAnd there's no change in the strategies in the sense of we're still trying to we're still investing to either scale in hot areas or add new types of skills. So you see that we're executing in capital projects like we described, right? In August, we did the, yeah, in August, we did the Answer Advisory. We just added Canada. And then, of course, adding the niche skills and consulting and whether it's industry or functional. So no change in strategy. But I would reiterate that it is really a huge competitive advantage for us that we can invest across the cycles. You saw that we did that in the first year after the pandemic where we significantly increased, and again, always to drive organic growth and position ourselves for those next waves. So you're going to see the AI acquisitions.\nYou saw health in the UK, another great area of growth, capital projects. So think about our strength here is how we accelerate pivoting to growth. And then I'll just add, Tien-tsin Huang, that you heard me mention in guidance that we are going to do now more than 2% inorganic contribution for this year.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. No, I'm sure you'll amplify the growth of what you buy. Just wanted to check on that. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. And congratulations on the performance. Happy holidays from me. I wanted to ask about, as you have conversations with your clients with regards to budget and spending priorities into next year, if you can comment, first of all, on that.\nAnd then it's only a couple of quarters since GenAI took hold, but it's a fast-moving technology, and I want to inquire into whether the nature of those discussions has changed, become more meaningful, gone past proofs of concept, and so on.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. And happy holidays to you too. Great questions. So first, with respect to, on your first point around what's happening in the market on client budgets, what I would say is that we're having lots of discussions that are pretty similar to what we've been talking about, which is how do you prioritize in a more cautionary environment. So we'll really know how that will play out in January, as always, because this is when they finalize.\nBut what I'd say is it's the consistent theme I've been talking about, which is in a cautionary environment, in a tough macro, we're helping clients prioritize. And they're in the things that we talked about in the script again today, things like building the Digital Core. It's using the technology to drive both growth and cost. And I would just say on the macro side, right, is that our clients recognize you cannot cut yourself to growth. And if you think about the examples that I used in today's script, most of them were both cost and growth, right? Because that is what our clients are focused on, is how are they going to grow revenue despite whatever the environment is. And that, of course, is our unique capabilities to be able to do both.\nWith respect to Gen AI, so first of all, I just want to say $450 million in sales this quarter. We're very pleased with it. I mean, it demonstrates we are leading here. All of last year, it was $300 million. And to your point, the conversations are changing. You have examples like BBVA, which we talked about earlier in my script, where we're starting to use it at scale. Our clients want to get out of proofs of concept to material value, and we're super well-positioned. Why? GenAI is not Plug and Play. It is not just technology. In fact, it's closer to any other technology. Think about cloud. That's farther away from the heart of the business. In order to scale, you have to deeply understand the technology, which is still rapidly changing, and the business value. And this is Accenture's leadership position, right?\nWe have strategy, we have consulting, deep industry and functional expertise. We're the biggest partner with every major player. We're working with them at a product level, and we can bring those two things together. So think of 2024 as being the shift for our clients from experimentation to scale, and we believe we're the best position to lead that shift to value.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nUnderstood. Understood. I want to ask also about operations performance. It did decelerate meaningfully. I think it was high single-digit growth, and now it's flat. Is that also a reflection you mentioned just now, maybe a pivot from cost savings to revenue generation maybe is beginning? Is that what's happening, or are there other factors in here?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe just in terms of the quarter performance, operations came in as expected.\nAs we talked about at the beginning of the year, Ashwin, we do have some impacts in CMT that impact operations. And so we'll see that growth may fluctuate as we go throughout the year. That's part, though, of our overall guidance for the full year of managed services continuing to be mid-single-digit to high-single-digit growth for the year.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And in fact, I would say it's the opposite. Operations, which was impacted, by the way, by CMT, for example, look, it's going to build similar to the way Accenture is going to build over the course of the year. Actually, the sweet spot of operations is that it does both cost and growth. So the BBVA example includes operations. Fortrea includes operations. So our managed services are highly strategic because they are typically able to do both. Think about IT transformation.\nOur managed services are as much about modernizing. So an IT modernized tech is what drives growth. So we really see our strength being that our managed services are strategic. And one of the reasons is that we do them in the context of understanding the industry and the function. So we're not back office. We're bringing that strategy and consulting expertise to make sure that it isn't just a cost play. And that's an important differentiator for us.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGot it. Thank you both.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. I wanted to start on some of the expectations around shorter cycle and discretionary work within S&C and SI. Do you have a sense of stabilization forming there, or cuts still occurring in those areas?\nMaybe can you give us a sense on how you expect consulting to do in Q2?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So look, as KC said earlier, we're operating the same environment we have for the last few quarters, right? Discretionary spend is down, and we're right in the middle of the budget cycle. So next quarter, we'll have a much better view of what's there. But as you look around in the environment, there aren't a lot of green shoots on the economic side. And obviously, the volatility on the geopolitical side continues. And so as KC said, we're not planning right now for a change in the macro, which means that we're not planning for a change in discretionary spending. We just don't see that being meaningfully different as we go into 2024. And obviously, we'll update you.\nBut that's why when you think about the question earlier on revenue conversion, our level of smaller deals is just down. It's going to stay down for a while, which means that how revenue is going to how sales are going to bleed into revenue is going to be consistent with what we've been seeing. So. And then you want to comment.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Just in terms of Bryan on the overall growth, there's no change from what we said at the beginning of the year in terms of our full-year outlook for consulting type of work. We see low single-digit positive growth for the full year. That's in our Q2 to 5. And Q1 came in as we expected, which was -2.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then just a clarification around the M&A.\nSo first, I don't know if you mentioned M&A in Q1, the contribution to growth. And we're saying greater than 2% for the full year. Just to be clear, that's just a rounding around 2%, or are we upwards of 3%? Thanks.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Yeah. So we're saying more than 2% for the full year, and it can fluctuate by quarter. So we really just stick to our guidance for the overall year.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nRight. And if we get close to 3%, we'll talk about that. But right now, it's more than 2%. Right. Because we gave you guidance to it's down definitely more than 2%. And remember, we only do deals that we think are good deals. So what we see right now is a lot of good deals that is going to get us to above 2%. And if that we have a lot of financial flexibility. So if that changes, we'll update if it gets above 3.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nSame to you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Guys. Thanks so much. One thing I noticed, gross margin growth year-over-year expansion. Gross margin was the strongest in about nine quarters or so. Is that just lower attrition, offshore shift? Maybe walk through why that's gotten nicely better.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Dave. Thanks for the question. So as you know, we run our business for operating margin, which we did 20 basis point expansion this quarter. And I will mention that if I didn't already, that the 10 to 30 that we have for the year, we might see more variability as we go throughout the quarters. But now back to gross margin. You're right.\nWe did see expansion this quarter, but it's really hard to look at that in isolation. And why is that? Well, there's various things that can go in and out of gross margin in terms of increase or decrease spend. So for example, one would be acquisitions. There's a lot of some of the investment acquisitions; some of that spend will go into gross margin, and that can be lumpy as we go throughout. As you know, it also depends on where people spend their time. So for example, you saw that, yes, we had improvement in gross margin, but then we also had increased sales and marketing costs, which is a result of people spending more time out in the market selling to create the $18.4 billion in sales that we have.\nSo that's why, again, we look at those components, but really, at the end of the day, we always continue to run our business top margin.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGotcha. Thanks for that. And then maybe as a follow-up just to Jason's question at the beginning on the back-end loaded growth, if I just put in normal sequential patterns in Q3 and Q4, I get to about 2% constant currency. So the low-end to guide. Is there a scenario given bookings were really good this quarter that it actually the progression sequentially in the back half of the year is better than normal, and then that gets to the better parts of the guidance range for revenue?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So I think, obviously, what you're just talking about is a bit of the math.\nWhat I would choose is give you the year-over-year way we look at it in terms of our guidance, right? So we had 1% growth this quarter with strong bookings, right? 1% revenue growth with strong bookings. We see Q2 shaping up the same way year-over-year. And again, just reinforcing that we do see fuel in our sequential growth in the back half of the year based on the transformation deals that we have signed. That's no different than what we talked about at the beginning of the year. We've layered in then the sales that we expect as we go throughout. And there's no difference to how we're doing our range. That gets us to the 2 to 5% range.\nI would say at the top end of our range, again, as we said last quarter, just when you said guidance, that to get to the top end of our guidance range, you would see S&C reconnecting with growth would be one thing that we'd see. And you would probably also see the mid to high single digits that we've been referencing consistently in managed services be more like high single digits. So hopefully that helps, Dave.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Nice job.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the clarification on the UK market in particular. I know the economy has been weak there for a couple of years, and I know it's been a callout for the quarter.\nWhat exactly happened in the UK, and then what's the outlook for that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. In the UK, as you said, it has been challenged for a couple of years. We have a big banking capital markets business there, and we're really trying to pivot to more growth there in other areas. That's why you saw the acquisitions that we did, for example, this quarter. What we're seeing is that it's just taking longer than we anticipated to really move into the other areas. Banking capital markets, which we've talked about, have been more challenged, particularly in the UK. So it's really about how long it's taking us to pivot. We think it's going to take some time.\nSo I'm not going to call exactly when, but we do think it's going to take some time, and it's taking more time than we anticipated going into the fiscal year. So we've got a good team. We're on it. And again, this is where you're going to see us do more acquisitions to diversify our business there as we reposition that.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe just also, Bryan, just for context, it's about 6% of our overall business, a little bit more than $4 billion that we have in the UK.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank",
    "content2": "Got it. No, that's helpful. And then KC, just to make sure we understand the comments on the margins, given the movement in acquisitions and the pickup in acquisitions, there could be some fluctuations in given quarters. So you're not going to have it perfectly in the range of 10 to 30 per quarter.\nAny quarters to call out in particular where it could fall below the range given the ramp of acquisitions and the ramp of investments? Thanks.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. No, I don't want to really guide to the quarter because 10 basis points or 20 basis points on a quarter, that's spend, Bryan, as you know. That's big and small in terms of the dollar amount that we're talking about. So we're going to guide overall to the full year of 10 to 30 for the full year. And I just wanted to point out that we might have some periods where it's just a little bit more variable than what you've seen us do over the years.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys.\nJust want to touch on headcount growth. I mean, I think it's still a bit decelerating. And so what are the expectations going forward? I mean, just given the backdrop of an acceleration on the revenue in the second half of the year. And then, Julie, maybe we could just touch on the linearity of the business one more time. Just if we could revisit the mix of the business you're seeing now and the revenue per head you'd expect, or maybe just directionally, what you'd anticipate based on the mix we're seeing and what demand is for?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYep. So thanks for that, Darrin. So I'll talk about, in terms of our people, in terms of number of people we have. First, I'll start with, as you know, managing supply demand is really our core competency.\nYou can see that in our ability to manage our utilization at high levels. I'll just point out that for the last 13 quarters, our utilization has been 91% or higher. We hire for the skills that we need, and we hire where we need them. What you're pointing out is that we had about a 1% increase year-over-year in our headcount, as well as about a 1% sequentially. That's in line with how we see revenue going for the rest of the year. So there's really no change there. As it relates to the revenue per head and the non-linearity, I mean, we do have automation. We do have value-based projects. So while there still is obviously a connection to the amount of people that we have, we have been able to break that.\nThere are parts where we were able to not fully disconnect, but not completely rely on headcount to drive revenue.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And Darrin, and in terms of just demand, right? So I'd anchor to, first of all, we're seeing demand for transformational deals. So in an environment like this, the thing that I look at most is, are we continuing to have our clients do more than $100 million of bookings, right? Which is, in our industry, we are a real standout here. And what does that mean? That means that we continue to be at the heart of where clients are spending to do material transformations. That's where you want to be so that you're positioned when inevitably discretionary spending, the pace goes back up, the macro changes, you want to be at the heart. So at times like this, that's what I'm really looking at.\nAnd that's where you're seeing. I will tell you, this is one of the most exciting times in the market. You just take what we are announcing today on McDonald's. I talked about it in the script, right? Incredible company, technology-driven. We've been their longtime partner, just expanded the partnership to take it all the way to the edge and reinvent their restaurants and their crew experience. This is going to be really cutting work at the edge because that's where we're starting to see the leaders in cloud go, and we're leading there. Those are the kinds of things that then you see how they're going to expand. There's so much opportunity still in these big areas of cloud, of data and AI. I mean, but cloud itself, yes, we've done a lot of migration.\nThere's still more migration to go, but even more importantly, you got to take it all the way to the edge. So from a demand perspective, we continue to see the transformations that move the needle for cost and growth, and that's what we're expecting. From a mix perspective, we're not seeing a big change between managed services and consulting. The mix we're seeing is that in this environment, you're seeing less of the smaller deals, which convert to revenue faster, and more on the larger deals. And that's been around for a while, and that's what you're going to continue to see. And we are laser-focused on making sure we are winning in the reinvention, the transformation, and at the same time, massively pivoting to GenAI, right?\nOur clients have so much work to do to be able to use GenAI, but you can see the momentum in our business, right, from that change from $300 million of all of last year to $450 million in a quarter. I'll just remind you, that's not the pull-through. That's not data. We are very pure because we really want to be sharing with all of you where GenAI is in the market. We're pretty excited about where we are today and what's ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful. Look, you guys have obviously managed well through what was a softer discretionary demand environment. My question would be, if we thought about what a normalized run rate of revenues on really S&C would be if we just said today's a normal, no longer softer discretionary environment, where do you think the difference is?\nI mean, I know it's probably hard to give an exact or precise estimate, but how much upside is there when we get that back?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, we have a really strong strategy and consulting business, and so we're very positive about that business growing. But beyond that, I think, Darrin, we're not going to start to predict growth rates. But in the meantime, it is a huge differentiator. Nobody has that combination that we have, and that is what is driving the resilience of our business to be at the core of our client's agenda. Thanks so much, Darrin.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nI want to just ask a couple of follow-up questions to those that have already been asked. First, on the inorganic contribution, appreciate that it's going to be better than 2%. Can you talk a little bit about whether that increased activity is now how you would balance that increased activity between just better valuations and more opportunities from a purely financial perspective in the market versus it sounds like some of the acquisitions you're doing, you're trying to push into new strategic areas, and just wondering how you're balancing those strategic imperatives versus perhaps a little better valuations.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, I wouldn't say that this activity is because of better valuations, right?\nAt any given time, when we look at the market, right, and we see where are the growth opportunities, we want to move quickly, and we look at organic versus inorganic ways of moving quickly. We never do anything purely inorganic, right, or purely organic. And so think about our acquisitions as being matched to what is the opportunity in the market and what's the best way to capture that growth quickly, right? And so the strategy of categories is the same, right? So there are new areas that we want to go into, like capital markets. That's an investment decision. We go into a certain number of those. We're executing now with rigor. We went and bought Answer Advisory. Now we bought the next one in Canada, right? So that's just about it's a great growth area, and we're trying to pivot.\nThe best way to do that, to build something that we don't have already organically, is to make some inorganic acquisitions, and then that becomes organic growth, and we're able to kick in our recruiting machine. If you think about the UK, health is a great area. We just bought a health company, right? So you look at the market and you say, \"If I want to diversify, what's the fastest way to diversify into new areas?\" That's where often inorganic can help us do that through these niche acquisitions, consulting, and industry. Then you've got just massive opportunities like cloud and security, where you saw some of those acquisitions, and supply chain, and that's all about both adding phenomenal talent quickly and scaling to go after a market that's today, right? So that's how we think about it. It's extremely rigorous.\nWe always have a decision: what's the best way to get there organically or inorganically? And inorganic is always about acceleration and driving organic growth. So it's very consistent. We've been doing it in a very disciplined way. And in these kinds of environments, we believe the companies that invest win. And that is why we do actions like we did last year to increase our business resilience and enable us to be really well-positioned to invest when others are not.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great color. I appreciate that. And similarly, just on bookings activity and AI contribution, there are clear acceleration in the AI level of activity, etc. When you're talking to clients and that thing, how are they thinking about AI budget allocation versus other initiatives, etc. right now?\nAre they looking at it as, \"Hey, this is an incremental investment that we need to be making given the pace of changing technology\"? Or are they trying to really use that spend or have that spend be to offset some other projects maybe that they're going to curtail a little bit sooner? Just trying to think about, as that continues to build, how we should think about it being incremental versus substitutive within a lot of the budgets.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nRight now, we're seeing a lot of reprioritization, right? Because, I mean, obviously, the market's growing. We're growing. The market's growing. So spending in technology is increasing. It's not increasing as fast as it was increasing a couple of years ago, right? So spending on technology is increasing. But within that, you're seeing more prioritization.\nAnd our research, everybody's research is saying, \"Hey, more spending on AI.\" For lots of companies, it's also more spending mostly on building that Digital Core because many companies don't have the data estates in order. They're not on the cloud. They don't have the data in order to use the GenAI. So think of it as a real focus on building a Digital Core to enable as well. So market's still growing. It's more about prioritization of where that spending's going. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. So in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, and all of our people for what you do every single day. And I wish everyone a happy and a healthy holiday season. Thank you for joining today.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference.\nYou may now disconnect. We're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Welcome to the Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder: Today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nThank you, operator. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.\nAs the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.\nOn today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Katie and everyone joining us. And thank you to the approximately 733,000 Accenture people who have worked hard to be at the center of our clients' business across our fiscal year '23.\nOur laser focus on creating 360-degree value for our clients and all our stakeholders is reflected in our overall strong results for the year. With record bookings of $72 billion, we had a record 106 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in FY '23, up from 100 last year. We now have 300 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships, an increase of [ 33 ] from last year, demonstrating yet again the depth and breadth of our capabilities and the trust our clients have in us. We delivered revenues of $64 billion for the year, representing 8% growth in local currency, while continuing to take market share. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 9% while continuing to significantly invest in our business and our people, with capital deployed of over $2.5 billion across 25 acquisitions; $1.3 billion in R&D, assets, platforms and industry solutions; and $1.1 billion invested in the training and development of our people. And we generated free cash flow of $9 billion, allowing us to return over $7 billion of cash to shareholders. And we are delivering a little ahead of schedule on our business optimization actions we announced in March to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience.\nWe also continued to attract, retain and inspire outstanding people through our talent strategy. We're making progress toward our commitment to net zero by 2025, and we invested in our communities to help ensure we have vibrant places where we work and live. I will give more detail a little later in the call.\nTaking a step back. Coming off 2 fiscal years of double-digit growth and a truly extraordinary FY '22, we are very pleased with our FY '23 results and the moves we have made to optimize our business. We are also rapidly taking an early leadership position in gen AI, which will be an important part of the reinvention of our clients in the next decade. Last quarter, we shared that we had sold 100 projects with roughly $100 million in sales over the prior 4 months. Demand accelerated in Q4 with another approximately $200 million in gen AI sales, to bring our total to over $300 million for the year. We also are embracing the use of gen AI in our own delivery of services and the way we work across Accenture.\nAs we reflect on how our market has developed over the last year: We and our clients have had to navigate a macro environment that is tougher than we anticipated at the beginning of FY '23. While it's played out differently across markets and industries, we have seen greater caution globally with lower discretionary spend; slower decision-making; and in particular for us, a significant impact from the challenges the comm, media and tech industries have faced. For example, in Q4, where we grew 4% in local currency, if we exclude CMT, we grew 7% globally, 6% in North America, 9% in Europe and 8% in Growth Markets. Against that backdrop, as we enter FY '24, we remain laser-focused on creating value for our clients. While the pace of spending has changed, the fundamentals have not. All strategies continue to lead to technology; and companies will need to reinvent every part of their enterprise using tech, data and AI to optimize operations and accelerate growth. To do so, they must build a digital core. We are continuing to see significant demand in areas like cloud migration and modernization, modern ERP and data and AI and the emergence of gen AI in particular, all of which represent areas of great opportunity. And it's still early.\nFor example, we estimate that only 40% of workloads are in the cloud today. Only 1/3 of clients have modernized their ERP platforms and less than 10% have what we define as mature data and AI capabilities. We believe helping build a strong digital core and then using it to reinvent will be the drivers of our growth. Our ability to advise, shape and deliver value-led transformation leveraging the breadth of our services and industry expertise, from strategy and consulting to technology, to our managed services across industries and geographic markets, along with our privileged position with our ecosystem partners, is what makes Accenture unique. And you can see this unique positioning in the number of our Diamond clients and clients who turn to us for large-scale transformation.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.\nWe were pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which were within our guided range and aligned to our expectations, completing another strong year for Accenture. Our results reflect the diversity of our business and once again illustrate our ability to run our business with discipline and deliver significant value for our shareholders.\nSo let me begin by summarizing a few highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 4% local currency, driven by high single or double-digit growth in 5 of our 13 industries. As we called out last quarter, we expected increased pressure in our CMT industry group; and we saw declines of 12% local currency this quarter. As Julie mentioned, excluding CMT, our business grew 7% globally.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.71, reflecting 4% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, an increase of 20 basis points over Q4 last year, and includes significant -- continued significant investments in our people in our business. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.2 billion, driven by very strong DSO management.\nNow let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $16.6 billion for the quarter, a 10% decline in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1. Consulting bookings were $8.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Managed services bookings were $8.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16 billion, a 4% increase in both U.S. dollar and local currency representing continued market share gains. Now as a reminder: We assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly 2,000 of our closest global public company competitors, which represent about 1/3 of our addressable market. We use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results and theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of our -- of their last publicly available results on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.2 billion, a decline of 2% in both U.S. dollar and local currency. Managed services revenues were $7.8 billion, up 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services grew mid-single digits. Operations grew high single digits, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 1% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, health and utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in communications and media, software and platforms, banking, capital markets and high tech. In Europe, revenues grew 7% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrial and public service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency driven by growth in chemicals and natural resources, industrial and energy. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.4% compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.8% compared with 10.2% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.7% compared to 7.1% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q4 we recorded $472 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 290 basis points and EPS by $0.56 and also impacted our tax rate. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.9% adjusted operating margin and an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in Q4 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 24.6% for the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.71 compared with EPS of $2.60 in the fourth quarter last year.\nDays service outstanding were 42 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 43 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.2 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $180 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $9 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31 last year.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.2 million shares for $1 billion at an average price of $312.35 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share, for a total of $706 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on November 15, a 15% increase over last year; and approved $4 billion of additional share repurchase authority.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to summarize the year, as we've navigated a challenging macro environment and successfully executed our business to deliver or exceed all aspects of our original guidance that we provided last September on an adjusted basis. We delivered $72.2 billion in new bookings, reflecting 5% growth in local currency; revenue of $64.1 billion for the year, reflecting strong growth of 8% in local currency and reflecting continued market share gains. Before I continue: For the full year, we recorded $1.1 billion in costs associated with business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 170 basis points and EPS by $1.28. We also recognized a gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results: adjusted operating margin of 15.4%, a 20 basis point expansion over FY '22.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $11.67, reflecting 9% growth over FY '22 EPS. Free cash flow of $9 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a very strong free cash flow-to-net income ratio of 1.3. And with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $7.2 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $2.5 billion across 25 acquisitions.\nIn closing. We remain committed to delivering on our enduring shareholder value propositions while creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, our people, our shareholders, partners and our communities.\nAnd now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC.\nLet me now bring to life for you the demand we saw from our clients this quarter as they build their digital core and reinvent. We saw this demand across markets and industries. Our cloud momentum continued with very strong double-digit growth in Q4 as clients prioritized building a strong and secure foundation for reinvention. We're partnering with a multinational financial services company on a cloud-based transformation to deliver enhanced, personalized and secure customer experiences; and to increase employee productivity. Together, we're developing an integrated hosting strategy that unifies their hybrid multi-cloud landscape and lays the foundation for their digital transformation over the next decade. This partnership enables innovative solutions across all bank functions and is backed by a trusted and secure foundation that supports advanced workloads and complex AI and data solutions. Working from a compliant cloud platform will safeguard the customer data, privacy and financial assets, positioning the organization to stand out for its innovation and customer focus.\nAnd we are supporting a U.S.-based energy company on a total enterprise reinvention strategy to unify different technologies and business processes around a common digital core. We'll help leading the deployment of a cloud-based IT platform that integrates customer management, finance, HR, supply chains, asset management and operations, improving the ability to assess and optimize operational performance. We also are helping manage and integrate the responsibilities and activities of the vendors involved in the project, standardize data from legacy applications and enable company employees to understand and manage the new processes and technologies. Data-driven decision-making will be improved, allowing the company to cultivate better collaboration within their business, helping them operate more efficiently and better serve their customers.\nWe are partnering with Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan to accelerate their path to becoming a world-class bottler and data-driven organization. The partnership includes establishing an innovative joint venture of significant scale of approximately 870 people that will accelerate transforming their digital core, optimizing their enterprise operations, leveraging the power of cloud, data and AI to increase the value delivered from their core business functions. In support of their broader strategic business plan, Accenture will provide specialized talent; industry expertise; and leading-edge technology, automation and managed services to help Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan adopt a strategy of continuous enterprise reinvention.\nData and AI are an important part of building the digital core. And we see that work both embedded in our larger transformations, as you just heard, and in work focused on data and AI modernization. Accenture Federal Services is helping the Defense Health Agency operate and enhance the joint medical common operating picture platform. By implementing data synchronization across multiple network domains and near real-time collaboration and information sharing, we will provide a comprehensive picture into Department of Defense medical assets. This increases visibility into unit health, equipment and supplies; and allows for faster and more informed decision-making. We are a strategic partner for the Saudi Data & AI Authority to boost the kingdom's transformation to a data-driven economy and help the kingdom become a world leader in generation and deployment of AI technology. We're working closely with SDAIA to support cutting-edge research, promote digital innovation in public life and boost national capabilities and talent. We're especially pleased with the double-digit growth we have in the Middle East, a small but growing part of our business.\nSecurity is essential to a digital core, and we had very strong double-digit growth in our security business in Q4. We're working with a major energy network in the U.K. on the transformation of its cybersecurity systems. We will provide an entire managed service for their cybersecurity capability, including migration to a more powerful security platform, continuous and active threat monitoring and response services as well as security tools management. Our solutions will help provide improved security, reduce exposure to potential global security threats and ultimately better safeguard the safe delivery of gas to millions of U.K. homes and businesses. As clients continued to reimagine and [ prioritize ] the customer experience, [indiscernible] delivered strong double-digit growth in Q4.\nWe are helping smart Europe, maker of the next generation of smart vehicles, products and services of the iconic brand from Smart Automobile company [indiscernible], a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and Geely. We are helping them reinvent car shopping by creating an ecosystem that supports a seamless, fully digital-driven buying experience. By putting data at the core, the system allows personalization of the customer journey, makes recommendations based on real-time data and includes enhanced offerings such as extended insurance coverage. It will help smart Europe reposition its brand and support the launch of its intelligent, fully electrical car lines.\nWe also continue to see demand for our supply chain and Industry X capabilities, the next digital frontier, which grew strong double digits in Q4. In Industry X, we are partnering with a global chemical and materials company on a digital transformation of their manufacturing core and commercial capabilities. Through our Industry X capabilities, we have built a unified connected worker platform for operators, maintenance technicians and job planners, along with a cloud-based data lake, to help generate insight from disparate sources of manufacturing data. The program is already live in dozens of manufacturing sites and is expected to create significant revenue growth over the next few years for our client. And in supply chain, we have partnered with a large global food and beverage conglomerate to strengthen supply chain resilience so consumers have continued access to their products in stores and online. By creating a digital twin of its supply chain, we will develop stress test models to help identify supply disruptions with the highest risk before they occur. Across these examples, you can see our unique capabilities of both being a technology powerhouse, along with our industry and functional expertise from strategy and consulting to technology, to managing services -- managed services, to help our clients reinvent.\nNow let's turn to generative AI. As a reminder: Last quarter, we announced a $3 billion investment in AI. While still in the early stages, gen AI technology is maturing rapidly, and we believe it will be a significant source of value for us and our clients over time. We now have about 300 projects. And I want to share a little color on how this demand is coming through. We have projects across all our industries, with banking, public service, consumer goods and utilities leading in activity. Clients are doing a variety of different types of work, from strategy and use case implementations; to tech enablement; to scaling; to model customization, tuning and training; to talent and responsible AI. For example, we're working with a multinational telcom company, Telefonica Brasil, also known as Vivo, to deliver a generative AI solution that helps its agents respond quicker to landlords' queries about property rental contracts for network towers. The application quickly reads landlords' queries and proposes a set of actions to help fulfill requests, reducing the time it takes agents to respond. It also structures the response with a set of relevant answers to increase the response quality and ensure all queries are answered in a helpful manner. The solution has already reduced agent response time by 30% and increased the user experience score by 66%.\nSome of the key ingredients of our success in gen AI are, first, ecosystem partnerships. As always, we are starting with deep relationships and leadership in the ecosystem from the hyperscalers to the model builders, to the start-ups and academics. It is important to emphasize that we are early in the maturity of gen AI for enterprise; and our depth, experience and insight on these [indiscernible] is essential to guiding our clients. Second, talent. We start with a deep technical knowledge and understanding of AI and gen AI and blend that with our industry and functional expertise to know how to reinvent across the enterprise, including processes and operating models, bringing together the depth and breadth of our expertise. And that is where Accenture is different, building the bridge from as is to the future. And we have already trained approximately 600,000 of our people in the fundamentals of AI. Now with generative AI, the pace and impact is growing rapidly. And we are now taking a further step to equip more than 250,000 people; and using new AI tools equitably, sustainably and without bias. And with investments in our AI academy focused on deep AI and gen AI specialization, we are also progressing towards our goal of doubling our deeply skilled data and AI practitioners from 40,000 to 80,000.\nThird, responsible AI is essential. At Accenture, we have an industry-leading responsible AI compliance program which is embedded in how we use and deliver AI. And we're using the experience and lessons learned by us to help our clients build out their own responsible AI program, which is necessary to address the risks and get the full value from AI. Finally, we are embracing gen AI across our services, developing new cutting-edge tools and solutions, [ embedding ] gen AI in the way we work. Our approach takes into account where the technology is today, the need to deploy it responsibly and the recognition that we do work in highly complex environments. While all companies want to explore and understand gen AI, what we find is that clients who are more mature digitally want to go faster, while others would like to test the waters with proofs of concepts and synthetic data. And others prefer to wait until they have built more of their modern digital core. The extent and pace of this generative AI progression will become more clear over the coming quarters as the technology and the market continue to mature and progress.\nNow turning to our people, who have made all of this happen. Core to our success is our ability to attract and retain and inspire our outstanding talent. Essential to our success is our robust talent strategy and, in particular, our ability to attract diverse talent and our Net Better Off approach to retaining our great talent. We continue to lead in our ability to attract people with different backgrounds, different perspectives and different lived experiences. These differences ensure that we have and attract the cognitive diversity to deliver a variety of perspectives, observations and insights which are critical to drive the innovation needed to reinvent. Our success is reflected in our being the top-scoring company on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the second year in a row. And we also earned the #1 position on the Refinitiv global diversity and inclusion index for the fourth time in 6 years. This index ranks over 15,000 organizations globally and identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces.\nOur talent strategy includes inspiring and retaining our best talent through our Net Better Off approach. We want our people to feel they are net better off for working at Accenture. This strategy has 4 dimensions focusing on people feeling healthy and well physically, emotionally and financially; feeling connected with a sense of belonging; feeling their work has purpose; and filing -- feeling they are continuing to build market-relevant skills. This year, for example, our people participated in approximately 40 million training hours. And we were a recipient of the Brandon Hall gold award for best benefits, wellness and well-being programs.\nBuilding on our long-standing commitment to the environment, we are pleased to have hit a significant milestone on our path to net zero, [ approaching ] 100% renewable electricity across all of our Accenture offices. I will wrap up with a comment on our work in communities. Vibrant communities are important to our business success, and therefore, we continue to prioritize creating value in these communities around the world. For example, Accenture is helping to welcome refugees, recognizing how they enrich our communities with their courage, strength and talent. In June 2023, on World Refugee Day, we committed to partner with organizations to help skill and support an estimated 16,000 refugee job seekers and migrants and to hire 100 refugees in Europe over the next 3 years.\nBack to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie.\nNow let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter fiscal '24, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.85 billion to $16.45 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately positive 2.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23 and reflects an estimated negative 2% to positive 2% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '24, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be flat compared to fiscal '23.\nFor the full fiscal '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 2% to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal '23, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 2%. We expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal '24 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. The following guidance for full year fiscal 2024 excludes these impacts.\nFor adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year '24 to be 15.5% to 15.7%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '23 results. We expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '23. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '24 to be in the range of $11.97 to $12.32 or 3% to 6% growth over adjusted fiscal '23 results.\nFor the full fiscal '24, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow-to-net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nAnd with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nThanks, KC. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?",

Welcome to Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O’Conor\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks, everyone joining us today, on our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market position before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the call.\nDuring our call today, we will reinforce certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Katie, and thank you to everyone joining today, and thank you to our people around the world for their dedication and commitment, which is how we are able to consistently deliver 360 degree value for all our stakeholders, our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities.\nTurning to the quarter, I will start with the financials. While the macro environment continues to be uncertain overall, in Q3, we delivered solid revenue and sales with very strong profitability and very strong free cash flow while continuing to significantly invest in our business. Now getting into the highlights, we had bookings of $17.2 billion, including 26 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, bringing the total year-to-date to 85, which is 11 more than the same time last year. We delivered revenues of $16.6 billion, representing 5% growth with North America growing 2%, Europe at 7% and growth markets at 9%, all in local currency, bringing us to [ $481 ] billion of revenue at 10% growth fiscal year-to-date.\nRevenues were impacted by lower-than-expected small deal sales, especially in strategy and consulting and systems integration, and lower-than-expected results in the communications, media and high-tech industry group for the quarter. Excluding CMT, our business grew 8% globally, 7% in North America, 9% in Europe and 10% in Growth Markets in local currency. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points, grew adjusted EPS 14% over last year and delivered free cash flow of $3.1 billion. And over the past 11 quarters, we have operated at 91% or higher utilization, leveraging our digital enterprise to connect our sales, staffing, hiring and skill needs to make proactive real-time decisions.\nWe are on track with the business optimization actions to lower costs in fiscal 2024 and beyond while continuing to significantly invest in our business with 5 acquisitions in strategic areas this quarter, bringing the total investment in acquisitions year-to-date to $1.3 billion. We invested in cloud, data and AI with the acquisition of NextEra in North America, Objectivity in the U.K. and [ Einer ] in Norway. We also invested in sustainability with the acquisition of [ Greendomes ] in Brazil and in modern ERP services with Foreign Digital in Australia. We continue to take market share, growing about 2x the market.\nNow turning to other aspects of the 360 degree value we delivered in the quarter. We continue to invest in learning for our people with 9 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 13 hours per person, giving them the skills to grow as our clients' needs evolve. We're incredibly pleased that we're recognized as a top 10 places to work in 7 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Mexico, the Philippines and U.S.. Collectively, these countries represent nearly 70% of our people.\nVibrant communities are important for our business success, and digital skilling helps ensure vibrant communities thrive. In collaboration with L'Oreal and our NGO partner, Chambo Foundation, we are supporting women in India to build digital literacy skills alongside the technical skills needed to access jobs in the beauty industry. Together, we have collectively created sustainable livelihoods for 2,500 women across 10 states in India, accelerating quality, delivering social impact in the community and continuing our commitment to embed diversity and inclusion in everything we do.\nFinally, this year, we are proud to earn the #22 position on BrandZ's prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list [indiscernible] today. Over to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our third quarter results. and we are on track to deliver or exceed all aspects of our guidance provided in September on an adjusted basis.\nNow let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 5% local currency, driven by single or double-digit growth in 7 of our 13 industries. While we've been highlighting the pressures in our CMT Industry group all year, this quarter, the revenue was lower than expected with a decline of 8% in local currency. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.19, reflecting 14% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, an increase of 20 basis points over Q3 last year, and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.1 billion and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $1.3 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 20 transactions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $17.2 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 4% in local currency with overall book-to-bill of 1.0. We were very pleased with our 26 clients with quarterly bookings over $100 million. Consulting bookings were $8.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Managed services were $8.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.6 billion, a 3% increase in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2.5% compared to the approximately 3.5% headwind provided in our business outlook last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.7 billion, a decline of 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% local currency. We see the same level of Consulting decline in Q4. Managed Services revenues were $7.9 billion, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services grew high single digits. Operations grew double digits, and we expect high single-digit growth in Q4. Strategy and Consulting declined high single digits this quarter, and we see declines continuing in Q4. Regarding our market share, we extended our leadership position with growth estimated to be about 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Now as a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly 2 dozen of our closest global public company competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market. We used a consistent methodology to compare our financial results and theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 2% in local currency driven by growth in Public Service for our U.S. federal business, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in Communications and Media, High-tech, Software and Platforms and Banking and Capital Markets. In Europe, revenue grew 7% local currency, led by growth in Banking and Capital Markets, Industrial and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, Germany and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service, Chemicals and Natural Resources and Banking and Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.4% compared with 32.9% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.3% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.5% compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year.\nBefore I continue, I want to note that in Q3, we recorded $347 million in costs associated with the business optimization actions we announced last quarter, which decreased operating margin by 210 basis points and EPS by $0.42. This quarter, we also recognized a gain in our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter and adjusted 16.3% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.19 and compared with diluted EPS of $2.79 in the third quarter last year. Days source outstanding were 42 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 44 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.3 billion net of property and equipment additions of $142 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $8.5 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares for $789 million at an average price of [ $269.65 ] per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $708 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on August, a 15% increase over last year.\nSo in closing, we remain committed to delivering on our long-standing financial objectives, growing faster than the market and taking share, generating modest margin expansion and stronger earnings while, at the same time, investing at scale for long-term market leadership, generating strong free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders.\nNow let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. As we look at demand in our larger deals, we continue to see 2 common themes that I've highlighted before. First, the rapid rise of generative AI interest among our clients highlights yet again that all strategies lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. And second, companies remain focused on total enterprise reinvention as they execute compressed transformation to achieve lower costs, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster.\nNow let me give you more color on the quarter to bring this to life. Starting with the digital core, our cloud momentum continues with very strong double-digit growth in Q3 as clients priorities building a strong and secure foundation for reinvention. We have been working with ENI, a global energy company, for more than 30 years. Now we are helping them as they continue our hybrid cloud transformation and embark on a total enterprise reinvention strategy with a focus on sustainability, digital transformation and security. We are managing their IT infrastructure and telecommunications integration and helping implement new operating models, all hosted in the ENI &I green data center, one of the largest data bunkers in the industry to securely hold the company's data. The ENI green data center houses one of the most powerful nongovernmental supercomputers in the world. enabling the highest use of data across the value chain from exploration and production to the energy of the future. New operating models will help exploit the full value of data, AI and cybersecurity for faster adoption of new business processes. This transformation is the first step toward creating a secure digital core that will accelerate ENI's energy transition, drive innovation in AI and R&D and build even greater resilience.\nClients are also working with us to do multifaceted compressed transformation that utilize all of our deep industry and functional expertise in our SNC services, along with our outstanding technology services. We are helping DuPont, a global multi-industrial specialty products company, with a compressed transformation to standardize their finance processes and achieve operational excellence. Building on our trusted relationship of over 35 years, we are now supporting our client with its strategic pivot to innovation-based growth across electronics, sustainable water and protection solutions, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. We've been supporting their transformation to an agile cloud-based IT infrastructure to maximize data access, drive efficiency and modernize their landscape. Our work with DuPont is focused on achieving greater resilience, reducing costs and increasing revenue growth and shaping its portfolio through M&A with industry-leading innovation for long-term success.\nThese companies expanding their digital footprint and cyber risk widening security continues to rise in importance as a fundamental part of the digital core with very strong double-digit growth in Q3. We are working with a food and beverage company to strengthen their cybersecurity and prevent vulnerabilities along the supply chain. Building on previous operations transformation work, we are now providing managed security services, which will cover perimeter security, detection and response as well as threat intelligence and monitoring dark web activities. We also will provide day-to-day identity, data and privacy management, helping provide a holistic security approach for our client.\nWe're helping a global universal bank future-proof their cryptographic landscape and corresponding risks for over 1,000 applications, procedures and data. Based on the analysis, we will develop and implement an end-to-end mitigation strategy, including evaluation of solution vendor strategies, mitigation principles as well as change management procedures. We will also design and implement post-quantum methods and new architecture blueprints, which will help scale the solution, all to help the bank achieve post-quantum computing readiness.\nOur Managed Services continued to grow double digits in Q3, demonstrating the relevance of our approach to run, digitize and transform our clients' operations. We're providing a global health care and insurance company with managed services to help run its complex claims and membership processes. As part of our long-standing relationship with the company, we will improve the efficiency and quality of these tasks and simplify the customer journey, ensuring members can easily access the support they need when they need it. Its employees will now have more time to focus on boosting customer satisfaction by better serving its millions of customers around the world. A new cost solution has also been introduced to determine fair and accurate pricing for the company when purchasing services and products from vendors to reduce costs across the business.\nWe recently worked with a major media brand to launch a streaming platform that will help attract new subscribers, expanding their content portfolio and power-targeted broadcasting and advertising offerings, all while lowering costs. We helped engineer aspects of the new platform from the content supply chain to the player experience, ensuring that customers have a seamless viewing experience across all devices and platforms and enabling the company to use data insights to continually enhance its platform. We delivered the program as part of a managed services arrangement, demonstrating the industry and engineering innovation that we bring to help clients reinvent their business with cloud, data and AI.\nAs clients continue to reimagine and prioritize customer experience, Song experienced strong double-digit growth again in Q3. We are partnering with Virgin Media O2, a British media and telecommunications company, to reimagine their customer experience. Accenture Song will design a new, more predictive and personalized customer journey, enabled by an AI-powered cloud-based digital core. Customer care journeys will be omnichannel, combining customer calls, chat and instant messaging to increase first-time resolution and upselling, leading to greater customer satisfaction. We also will deploy our managed services capabilities to support contact center activity using AI to provide timely agent assistance and route calls intelligently to drive precision and reduce call volume. Our work will help build brand loyalty supporting Virgin Media O2's mission to be a more customer-first business.\nWe see continued demand for our Industry X capabilities, which grew strong double digit. We are working with one of the world's leading consumer products companies on a transformation of its manufacturing practices to achieve energy savings. We are developing a comprehensive program to collect and analyze energy consumption data from their production plans and use data-driven analytics to identify energy savings and greenhouse gas reduction opportunities. We are also helping to track energy efficiency gain to [ deliver ] value through operational improvements in the manufacturing process.\nAs clients progress on their total enterprise reinvestment journeys, [ talent is ] at the forefront. we are working with an international consumer goods and services provider in the European market on a digital transformation of its core human resources organization and talent acquisition processes. We will design and implement an approach that includes program management, process design, training and development and additional services. Together, we will create greater efficiencies in the human resources function, leading to a data-driven culture focused on better employee experiences.\nNow stepping back, our strategy is to be at the center of our clients' business to help them continuously reinvent themselves to reach new levels of performance and to set themselves apart as leaders in their industries. And our clients are at different starting points. All are interested in AI, and particularly, generative AI. But most recognize the work ahead of them to get their data, people and processes ready for AI. To reinvent requires a strong modern digital core. And as they embark on this journey, clients are looking to us for our unmatched global scale, deep industry and functional knowledge, breadth of services from strategy and consulting to technology to managed services.\nWith that context, I want to turn to generative AI and AI more broadly. No previous technology wave has captured the intention of leaders and the general public as fast as gen AI. We are now embarking on the age of AI, and companies will need to reinvent how they operate with AI at the core. And it is also early. Think of it as the cloud over a decade ago. Foundation models and products based on them are still maturing with many products announced but fewer at the general availability stage and ready for wide deployment. And with our position as the largest partner with most of the major technology companies, we are at the center of helping our clients navigate their choices in the evolving landscape.\nWe've been investing in AI for years. And so while it is early days, we see generative AI as a key piece of the digital core and a big catalyst for even bigger and bolder total enterprise reinvention going forward. In fact, in a survey of global executives that we completed just last week, 97% of executives said gen AI will be transformative to their company and industry. and 67% of organizations are planning to increase their level of spending in technology are prioritizing investments in data and AI.\nOur approach to AI is clear. Just as we have successfully done with cloud, we are investing to take an early lead and position for the opportunity ahead. Last week, we announced a $3 billion investment in AI, a big step to accelerate our clients' reinvention journey, which includes us doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 strong, including the expansion of our center for advanced AI that today has over 1,600 generative AI experts bringing new assets such as our AI navigator for enterprise to life and developing new GenAI-powered industry solutions. And across this all, we are leading with responsible AI to be the most trusted source in helping our clients mitigate the risks as they drive value.\nAnd this isn't just about tomorrow. We have sold over 100 generative AI products -- projects over the last 4 months. Let me give you a flavor of these across a few industries. We are working with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, a Japan-based subsidiary of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, to improve customer service by using generative AI and simplify operations for accident response. The generative AI solution will draw from the company's knowledge base, including policy causes and related laws and regulations, which will generate appropriate response plans in a timely manner, dramatically improving the accuracy and speed of explanations to customers.\nWe're working with a global broadcast company to explore how generative AI can be used to drive audience engagement and growth through deeper and more personalized customer experiences. Together, we recently launched testing that leverages generative AI and large language models to explore how we can automatically create content for the company's customer-facing platforms. The content will help enhance engagement, grow the consumer base across new coverage areas and channels. We believe it will demonstrate how generative AI can be used to create content at scale for a wide variety of experiences and events.\nWe are working with [ Linda Basel ] Industries, a leader in the chemicals industry, to increase its enterprise data and analytic capabilities and help unlock new value. we will develop a strategic data-led digital transformation program across multiple parts of the business and embed new capabilities in areas like sustainability, customer data, digital manufacturing and generative AI to drive insightful and predictive decision-making.\nCompanies are coming to us for help with the strategy in the business case to understand how and where to apply AI, and gen AI specifically, to get their digital core in shape, to help assess which ecosystem partners and models to use, to rewire their processes to be AI-driven, to upgrade and reskill their talent with new ways of working and to navigate the risks and challenges responsibly. In short, we believe clients need our full range of services, and we are well positioned to be the leading trusted AI partner for the enterprise as they move from exploration to experimentation to reinvention.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie. Now turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.75 billion to $16.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which assumes an inorganic contribution of about 2%.\nWe continue to expect business optimization costs of $800 million in fiscal '23 to reduce EPS by $0.96. The gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies will increase EPS by $0.38. Our guidance for full year '23 excludes these impacts. For adjusted op margin, we now expect fiscal year '23 to be 15.4%, a 20 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.52 to $11.63 or 8% to 9% growth over fiscal '22 results.\nFor the full fiscal '23, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion. We now expect property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1,2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O’Conor\n\nThanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to 1 question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?",

As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Katie, and thank you to everyone joining today, and thank you to our 738,000 people around the globe for your incredible work and commitment to our clients, which has resulted in our delivering another strong quarter of financial results and the broader 360-degree value we continue to create for all our stakeholders.\nLet me share a few highlights and value we created in our continued disciplined execution. I'm very pleased with our record bookings for Q2 at $22.1 billion, our highest ever including 35 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, our second highest quarter on record for such bookings, representing the continued trust that our clients have in us. We delivered revenues of $15.8 billion, representing 9% growth in local currency, bringing us to $31.6 billion of revenue at 12% growth through H1, and we continued gaining market share, growing approximately 2x the market.\nWe continued our inorganic investments with 6 acquisitions in strategic areas, including cloud with the acquisition of SKS in Europe, which will expand our specialized technology, consulting and regulatory capabilities, enabling us to better serve our financial services clients; security with the acquisition of Morphus in Brazil, a cyber defense risk management, cyber threat intelligence service provider; and supply chain with the acquisition of Inspirage in the U.S., which will enhance our technology capabilities to accelerate innovation for clients through emerging technologies such as touchless supply chain and digital twins.\nWe also continued our investment in our people with 10.3 million training hours, a 12% increase year-over-year. We are optimizing our business to lower costs in fiscal year 2024 and beyond, while continuing to invest in our business and our people to capture the significant growth opportunities ahead. KC will be giving you more detail on these actions.\nFinally, we believe our focus on creating 360-degree value differentiates us in our market. We earned the #1 position in our industry for the 10th year in a row and #32 overall on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. We ranked #1 in our industry and #4 overall on the Just Capital list of America's most just companies. And we have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 16th year in a row.\nI'm very pleased that our results demonstrate once again that our strategy to be the execution partner of choice for transformation, lead in the 5 forces and have a diverse business across markets, industries and services continues to allow us to lead and take market share. And in a world in which all strategies lead to technology, we have distinguished ourselves and our impact in the market.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, setting a new bookings record at $22.1 billion, $2.5 billion higher than our previous record set in Q2 of last year with consulting bookings close to matching our previous record. We delivered revenue growth for the quarter at the top end of our guided range as we continue to deliver on our shareholder value proposition.\nBefore I summarize results for the quarter, let me spend a moment on the business optimization actions we are taking to reduce costs for fiscal '24 and beyond, which includes streamlining operations, transforming our non-billable corporate functions and consolidating office space.\nWe estimate cost of $1.5 billion through fiscal year 2024, of which we expect to incur approximately $800 million in FY '23 and $700 million in FY '24, comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in severance and $300 million for the consolidation of office space. These actions are expected to impact roughly 2.5% or 19,000 of our current workforce, of which over half are non-billable corporate functions and include over 800 of our more than 10,000 leaders across our markets and services. Nearly half of the 19,000 people will depart by the end of fiscal year '23.\nNow let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 9% local currency, driven by broad-based growth across all markets with more than half of our 13 industries growing double digits. We also continue to extend our leadership position with growth estimated to be about 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies.\nIn Q2, we recorded $244 million in costs associated with the business optimization actions, which impacted operating margin by 150 basis points and EPS by $0.30. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.69, reflecting 6% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin of 13.8% increased 10 basis points, with 20 basis point expansion year-to-date and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 15 transactions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $22.1 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 17% in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.4. Consulting bookings were $10.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed service bookings were also a record at $11.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.5. We were very pleased with the strength of our new bookings, which were broad-based, delivering a very strong book-to-bill across all of our geographic markets and across our services with a book-to-bill of 1.5 in operations, 1.4 in technology and 1.3 in strategy and consulting.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, a 5% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, and we're at the top end of our range, adjusting for a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 4% compared to the 5% provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, a decline of 1% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 4% in local currency. Managed services revenue were $7.5 billion, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services and operations grew double digits, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 5% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, health and utilities. These increases were partially offset by a decline in communications and media and high tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\nIn Europe, revenues grew 12% in local currency, led by growth in industrial, banking and capital markets and public service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France.\nIn growth markets, we delivered 14% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in banking and capital markets, chemical and natural resources and public service. Revenue growth was led by Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.6% compared with 30.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.9% compared to 9.4% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.8% compared to 7% for the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an adjusted 13.8% operating margin, an increase of 10% -- 10 basis points from operating margin in the second quarter of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 19.2% for the second quarter last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.69 compared with diluted EPS of $2.54 in the second quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 42 days compared to 48 days last quarter and 41 days in the second quarter of last year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion compared to approximately $400 million last quarter, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.3 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $108 million. Our cash balance of -- at February 28 was $6.2 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31st.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.1 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $273.55 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $708 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on May 15, a 15% increase over last year.\nFinally, turning to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. We are partnering with Save the Children to connect with new audiences and invigorate donors through fundraising and creative campaign excellence. So the halfway point of fiscal '23, we are pleased with our results.\nNow let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. I will start with the overall demand environment, which is more of the same. We believe that the ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the macro environment is making it even clearer to clients that they need to change more, not less. And that 2 of the 5 key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade, the need for total enterprise reinvention and the ability to access, create and unlock the potential of talent are critical to succeed in the near, medium and long term.\nWe see 2 common themes. First, all strategies continue to lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. This is reflected in the latest market estimates, which are down slightly but are still hovering around 5%. And second, companies remain focused on executing compressed transformations to achieve lower cost, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster.\nWe remain laser focused on pivoting to our clients' changing needs and being relevant across the enterprise from the front line to core operations to corporate functions. Our ability to advise, shape and deliver value-led transformation, leveraging the breadth of our services from strategy and consulting to our strategic managed services across all industries and geographic markets is what differentiates Accenture.\nNow I will give you more color on the quarter and in particular, how total enterprise reinvention and talent are critical to our clients. For example, we are helping Shionogi & Co., Ltd., a Japanese pharmaceutical company with a compressed transformation to improve its business process efficiency and create a more agile organization. We will enter into a joint venture with the company that will provide a managed services capability to oversee back-office functions such as human resources, finance and accounting, public relations, facility management, procurement and marketing.\nThe joint venture will also be charged with the management of the pharmacovigilance function from safety management operations to post marketing operations to regulatory compliance. As part of this transformation, we will upscale over 400 employees, enabling them to play a greater role in the growth and development of the wider business, hence demonstrating the value of all our services from strategy and consulting, our deep industry knowledge to technology and operations coming together to enable the clients transformation.\nI would like to take a moment to recognize Egawa-san, our Head of the Japan market unit and our extraordinary people in Japan for how they are consistently creating value for our clients with double-digit revenue growth for each of the past 5 years.\nAs clients focus on building their digital core with a modern cloud-based infrastructure, our cloud business continues to grow very strong double digits. For example, we are working with the state of Missouri to replace its legacy applications and infrastructure with a modern ERP in the cloud, introducing new capabilities in finance, supply chain management, human capital management, payroll and budgeting.\nAs the current ERP system no longer fully meets the business needs of the state, they are looking for a modern system that is efficient, scalable and flexible, all delivered by a best-in-class implementation partner. This compressed transformation, one of the earliest and most complex ERP implementations for any state will help reduce operating expenses, provide opportunities for upskilling and improve customer experience and services.\nWe are partnering with minority and women-owned businesses on this transformation, and we will bring in apprentices, the program's life cycle part of our shared commitment with the state of Missouri to foster diversity and inclusion.\nWith our cloud-first strategy, our approach has been to help clients migrate to the cloud and then partner with them on their journey to grow and innovate in the cloud. Our cloud growth is driven by both migration and clients who are moving forward on this journey, such as Enel, one of our largest utilities clients who's taken their mass migration to cloud a few years ago to the next level, changing their operating model, tools and talent and largely automating IT operations. We are now helping them accelerate the modernization of their application landscape, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, support a significant acquisition and divestment agenda and pivot to platform-based business model for integrated retail delivery beyond meter services, grid and renewable energy.\nUsing cloud as their operating systems is helping this market leader manage increasing levels of complexity by bringing together data, AI and applications to optimize their operations and accelerate growth.\nA strong and secure digital core also is essential to total enterprise reinvention. We're seeing continued very strong demand for our security services, which experienced another quarter of very strong double-digit growth. We're working with Empresas CMPC SA, a Chilean pulp and paper company, and a cybersecurity transformation of their plant operations. We will implement a security program across its 48 industrial sites focused on threat detection, management and response as well as governance and workforce training.\nThrough our global and local industrial capabilities, we will help strengthen the company's cybersecurity expenses through continuous monitoring of its physical locations and equipment.\nWe continue to lead in managed services, which experienced strong growth again this quarter at 16%. Managed services are strategic for our clients because they enable clients to move faster, leveraging our digital platform expertise and talent as well as delivering cost efficiencies. And our clients are turning to Accenture because of the depth and breadth of our industry, functional and technology expertise that we bring together into the transformation journey.\nOur approach to managed services is to both run and transform, and run and modernize. We deliver cost savings as table stakes. For example, we are partnering with the U.K.'s Department for Work and Pensions, which is responsible for welfare pensions and child maintenance policy to modernize its legacy systems, eliminating backlogs and delivering a better experience for citizens and employees. We developed a cloud-based intelligent optimization platform that combines robotic process automation, AI, analytics and machine learning to provide bots-as-a-service to create the equivalent of a virtual workforce available 24/7.\nWith routine tests now automated, the organization has already saved 2.4 million human hours, which can be reallocated to more complex higher-value tasks.\nLet me pause to thank our global H&PS colleagues for their amazing contributions as evidenced by 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.\nAs our clients continue to prioritize cost optimization as well as growth in [ landscape ], Song is more relevant than ever. In Song, which grew strong double digits this quarter, clients are focused on more capital-efficient growth that creates efficiency, drive short-term growth and optimizes existing assets with clear outcomes and shorter time horizons to keep up with the pace of change with customers and technology.\nWe've moved quickly to help clients seize new opportunities in contact centers, not only for enhanced customer service, but also customer acquisition and growth. We are working with a global biopharmaceutical leader in North America to reinvent digital marketing at scale. Driven by data and using technologies integrated with SynOps, the company will be able to create, produce and deliver consistent world-class content that informs and educates health care providers and patient communities around the world, helping to deliver innovative health services.\nWe are working with the Prada Group, the Italian luxury fashion player, to offer its customers an entirely new customization experience through an online 3D configurator. Accenture Song created a digital twin of Prada's iconic show called Americas Cup, which allows shoppers to fully customize it for material to color to trim across the overlay, lining, sole and other parts. With more than 50 million possible configurations, more than any web platform could handle, this innovative approach allows customers to see high resolution 3D models of their custom builds with the same quality and fidelity as a physical show. Song solution to online product customization is fully scalable to the cloud. It gives Prada the flexibility to apply the same strategy to other products, ensuring the outstanding experience that their shoppers expect.\nAs I continue to move across the enterprise, industries and markets, I want to also highlight Industry X, which grew very strong double digits again this quarter, and which we believe is the next digital frontier where our digital engineering capabilities are advancing sustainability services. For example, we are working with Recharge Industries, a battery research and production company in Australia, to help design and engineer one of the world's largest lithium-ion battery facilities. Once built, the facility will generate up to 30-gigawatt hours of storage capacity per year.\nFinally, moving to the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution. We've talked about the importance of artificial intelligence in building the digital core for our clients. While generative AI has recently burst into the popular imagination, at Accenture, we've been working with the technology from its earliest stages and are already applying it at clients.\nFor example, we're working with a multinational bank to transform how it manages high volumes of post-trade processing e-mails every day. We are leveraging a generative AI solution as it is built to understand the context of e-mails with high accuracy. It automatically routes large numbers of e-mails, daily to relevant teams and draft responses with recommended actions and related information. Our work will help reduce manual effort and risk, boost worker efficiency and improve interactions with customers.\nAnd finally, on that note, we will release our Tech Vision 2023 on March 30th. The fourth and fifth key forces of change we have identified for the next decade are the metaverse and ongoing tech revolution. And this year's Tech Vision is particularly relevant and actionable as our clients face a rapidly changing landscape in which generative AI, metaverse, cloud, science, tech and other technologies are driving more opportunities for change and reinvention. This year's vision will explore how these technologies and more are blending the physical world and the virtual world into a shared reality, creating a huge opportunity for our clients and for Accenture.\nNow turning to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.7 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 3.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 3% to 7% growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which assumes an inorganic contribution of 2%. We expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal '23 GAAP operating margin by 120 basis points and EPS by $0.96. We expect our anticipated gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies to impact EPS by $0.39. Our guidance for full year fiscal '23 excludes these impacts.\nFor adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year '23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. We expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.41 to $11.63, or 7% to 9% growth over fiscal '22 results. For the full fiscal '23, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, $300 million higher than our previous guidance.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so we can take your questions.

Over to you KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, where we continue to drive growth across markets, services and industries to extend our leadership position in the market. We ran our business with rigor and discipline and expanded operating margin while investing at scale, and we continue to deliver on our shareholder value proposition to both our financial results and by creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders.\nLet me begin by summarizing a few key highlights across our 3 financial imperatives from the quarter. Revenues grew 15% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of about 9.5% compared to the 8.5% provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact in the quarter, we were approximately $150 million above our guided range with double-digit growth across all of our markets and industry groups, with 10 of the 13 industries growing double digits and 3 high single digits.\nWe continue to take market share with growth estimated to be more than 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin was 16.5% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business, including acquisitions. We delivered very strong EPS of $3.08, up 11%, while absorbing a substantial FX headwind. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $397 million and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $686 million in acquisitions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $6.2 billion for the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1 and growth of 6% in local currency. Consulting bookings were $8.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1. Managed Services bookings, which we formally refer to as Outsourcing, were $8.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition, we continue to see improved pricing on our new bookings, which refer to contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.7 billion, a 5% increase in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, up 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $7.3 billion, up 11% in U.S. dollars and 20% local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services grew strong double digits, Operations grew double digits and, as expected, Strategy & Consulting grew low single digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 11% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, consumer Retail and Travel Services, Industrial and Health. In Europe, revenues grew 17% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and high single-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services.\nLooking closer to the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 19% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service, and Chemicals & Natural Resources. From a country perspective, gross markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.8% compared with 9.7% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.6% compared to 6.9% for the same quarter last year.

This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on February 15, a 15% increase over last year.\nFinally, turning to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. We are extremely proud to be recognized as 1 of the 7 company all stars on the Wall Street Journal Management Top 250 List for Excellence in customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength, and we also received the top score for social responsibility overall.\nIn summary, we were pleased with our results in the first quarter, and we're off to a strong start for the year. And now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, KC. We remain laser-focused on staying close to our clients, advising them how to navigate the macro, providing the right solutions to enable compressed transformations and adjusting to their changing needs. Let me give some further color on what we're seeing in the market and how we see the demand environment shaping up.\nOver the last quarter, as we can all read, the economic estimates for 2023 continue to decline. While the latest industry estimates for 2023's technology spending continue to show robust growth of 5% or so, we will see how the market evolves as clients finalize 2023 budgets.\nSo what does today's market mean for our clients? We believe that the current macro is making it even clearer to clients that they need to change more, not less, and that 2 of the 5 key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade: the need for total enterprise reinvention enabled by tech data and AI; and the ability to access, create and unlock the potential of talent, are critical to succeed in the near, medium and long term.\nWe see this continuing across industries and markets with 2 common themes. First, all strategies continue to lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. And second, companies remain focused on executing compressed transformation to achieve lower costs, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster.\nWhat does this mean for Accenture? Our strategy positions us for continued industry leadership because we have a unique set of strengths that our clients need to navigate today and succeed tomorrow. We are able to do so because of our deep strategy and consulting expertise across industries, allowing us to be a trusted adviser during different economic cycles as we bring the expertise, coupled with the real-life practical experience they need.\nOur ability to help clients achieve total enterprise reinvention through our depth across the enterprise, from the frontline to core operations to corporate functions, as well as our ability to advise our clients shape and deliver value-led transformations, and through our breadth of services, from strategy and consulting to our strategic managed services, which help clients digitize faster, access talent and lower costs. And our global footprint allows us to act at scale and with speed.\nTogether, this positions us as the compressed transformation partner of choice, as you can see, and yet another strong quarter of clients who selected us for work of more than $100 million this quarter. I am pleased to see how quickly we are pivoting to meet the evolving needs of our clients. We have seen a higher level of sales and pipeline coming from cost-focused initiatives, often also including growth or capability enhancements.\nWe are leveraging our breadth of services, deep-client and ecosystem relationships and industry and functional expertise to help our clients and Accenture shift to the highest value opportunities. Our track record of delivery at speed and scale over many years with clients -- remember, 99 of our top 100 clients have been with us for over 10 years, this gives our clients confidence that by partnering with us, they will deliver on their commitments.\nInvestments in our assets and solutions such as myWizard and SynOps, which underlie both strategy and consulting, technology and operations managed services, as well as our delivery of compressed transformation, enables us to differentiate with our insights and services. Our ability to invest in acquisitions helps us to expand our relevance across the enterprise from building a digital core with Sentia and Albert, to optimizing upper duration to achieve agility, efficiency and resilience with Pilatus, to accelerating their growth agendas with RAMP, and our substantial investment in the skills of our people allows us to pivot to new areas of demand to be an attractive destination for top talent.\nNow let's turn to the quarter. To bring to life this demand environment across the 5 key forces of change for our clients: total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution, which in turn drag our growth. First, total enterprise reinvention. We continue to help our clients achieve a new performance frontier by building their digital core, optimizing operations and accelerating growth, leveraging cloud, data and AI and new ways of working.\nWe are helping Roche, a Swiss multinational health care company specializing in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, with a total enterprise reinvention, building a digital infrastructure to match changing business needs. Using data integration, we have changed the way tumor boards are organized and conducted, empowering counter teams to be more efficient and effective in determining next steps for cancer care. And we have built a digital ecosystem that will create innovative products and solutions to drive diabetes care.\nNow as part of one of the largest ERP modernizations in the world, we are working together to deploy a digital backbone that will unify and harmonize nearly 700 business processes for more than 100,000 end users. The integrated platform will simplify the system landscape and connect activities across the value chain from R&D and manufacturing to patient treatment. Cloud, a $26 billion business in FY '22 grew 48%, with even stronger growth in Cloud First and continues to grow very strong double digits. In fact, we believe that the cloud continuum will become the new operative system for the future enterprise.\nMigrating to the cloud to drive efficiencies is just the first step. As we anticipated with our Cloud First strategy and investments, we are seeing our clients make significant investments to modernize, improve and innovate in the cloud, leveraging data and AI to drive new business value.\nFor example, Accenture Federal Services is partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a U.S. federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, to accelerate its migration to the cloud across the enterprise and modernize its IT portfolio. Through this work, we will also help to achieve CDC's mission to protect people from health, safety and security threats by supporting the development of integrated, real-time public health data and surveillance systems.\nAs our clients build their digital core, security continues to be more important than ever, as reflected in our very strong double-digit growth in Q1. We are expanding our cybersecurity footprint for a large health care network in Brazil to elevate their cybersecurity posture to a new hot level of preparedness. We are growing the organization's security profile with a cyber as a service solution that will enhance the cyber readiness of their infrastructure and operations.\nThis new project not only consolidates the work that up to 4 different providers typically do, it also is the largest cybersecurity contract ever signed in Brazil by any provider. High demand for our strategic Managed Services, reflecting $7.3 billion in revenue and 20% growth in the quarter, demonstrates the importance of these services to our client strategies as it enables clients to move faster, leveraging our digital platform's expertise and talent.\nOur Managed Services are differentiated by our ability to bring in our deep expertise from across the enterprise, including Song, which grew double digits in the first quarter. For example, we're expanding our partnership with Allianz, an Italian and main bank of Allianz Group, to continue the bank's digital transformation with a new platform in the cloud, a modern IT architecture and a new operating model. Our Song team is helping to create a new customer mobile app to improve customer experience. And our end-to-end managed services capabilities, tailored to the financial services industry, will help the bank grow and scale its position in the market, ensure regulatory compliance and lower total cost of ownership.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our industry edge capabilities, digitizing engineering and manufacturing, which we see as the next digital frontier with continued very strong double-digit growth in Q1. We are helping Celanese, a global chemical and specialty materials company on their digital transformation journey that will increase their manufacturing production resiliency, productivity and predictability of plant operations.\nWe're teaming with Ecosystem Partners to design and implement a scalable digital twin platform at one of their largest manufacturing facilities, which plans to increase revenues through increased plant output, reduce costs through improved productivity, product quality and equipment reliability and improve overall safety in the workplace. We also are supporting an enterprise cloud transformation to provide a scalable platform for future enterprise growth and innovation.\nNext, talent. Our clients continue to look at-- look to us to access, create and unlocked talent as a critical element of their transformation. We're helping a global chemical manufacturer with an end-to-end IT transformation as part of their multiyear digital journey. The company faces increasing IT costs, aging assets and tools and overreliance on contractors. We're implementing a full Managed Services model that will help modernize its IT, and this digital transformation includes a talent transformation. Together, we will upskill their people and data cloud and AI through our Accenture Academy so that everyone grows together, helping the company leapfrog its competitors with innovative industry-leading solutions.\nNow, sustainability. We continue to prioritize embedding sustainability into our clients' digital transformation and on providing a direct sustainability service. For example, we are expanding our partnership with the European Multinational Aerospace Corporation to help improve their environmental and social impact across the enterprise. In recent years, we have worked together to digitize the company's supply chain and manufacturing operations using a digital twin to improve productivity and reduce waste.\nNow we are working together to advance their sustainability agenda. We're supporting their aviation decarbonization road map, from accelerating the use of sustainable aviation fuel to helping design low-emissions aircraft. We are finding new ways to help make the supply chain more transparent and ethical, helping the company replace hazardous materials from the product life cycle with safer, greener alternatives. And we are outlining a strategy to help them meet its net zero targets and internally foster a culture that is focused on sustainability.\nFinally, the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution. While still in the early innings, we believe the metaverse will not only change how people work, but it will also profoundly change every part of every business, from how we interact with customers, what products and services they offer, how they are made and distributed, how you engage with your people from employee onboarding to personal productivity.\nWe're partnering with NTT DOCOMO, a Japanese mobile operator to speed up the adoption of Web3, a new blockchain-based version of the Internet that promises a digital economy with greater social impact. We will develop and grow a secure technology platform for Web3, which will enable new products, services and community building. Training will ensure that Web3 engineers and business leaders collaborate with organizations effectively and securely on the platform.\nNTT DoCoMo's work on societal issues will now expand with the use of Web3, helping companies and governments transform social infrastructures and provide solutions that would improve people's lives. We continue to invest ahead of our clients' teams to the future, with a keen focus on innovation and the ongoing tech revolution. Back to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie. Turning now to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 6% to 10% growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 5% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we continue to expect our revenue to be in the range of 8% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which continue to assume an inorganic contribution of about 2.5%.\nFor operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. I mentioned last quarter, we may see more variability in quarters as we go throughout fiscal year '23, and that's playing out as we expected, with contraction in the second quarter expected and potentially overall for H1. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22.\nFor earnings per share, based on the change to FX, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.52 or 5% to 8% growth over fiscal '22 results. Full fiscal '23, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $800 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1%.\nFinally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. And with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O’Conor\n\nThanks, KC. (Operator Instructions) Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Angie Park. Please go ahead.\n\nAngie Park\n\nMD & Head of IR, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal 2022 Earnings Announcement.\nAs the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.\nDuring our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com.\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Angie, and everyone joining us today. And thank you to our 721,000 people around the globe for delivering a truly extraordinary year. We measure our success by both our financial results and the broader 360-degree value we create for all our stakeholders: Our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Strong financial results allow us to deliver more 360-degree value.\nLet me share a few highlights of this extraordinary year. In FY '22, we delivered record bookings of $72 billion. As our clients continue to execute compressed transformations, we had 100 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million compared to 72 last fiscal year. We delivered revenues of $62 billion, representing a record 26% growth in local currency, adding $11 billion in revenue for the year. We continue to take significant market share, growing more than 2x the market.\nOur financial results reflect our commitment to creating value for our clients every day, which is why they are turning to us as their trusted partner across the enterprise. We now have 267 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships, compared to 229 last fiscal year. We expanded operating margin by 10 basis points and had EPS growth of 22% over adjusted FY '21 EPS, demonstrating our ability to grow profitably and at scale.\nWe achieved this profitable growth while continuing to invest significantly in our business and people with $3.4 billion deployed across 38 acquisitions that are well balanced across markets, services and strategic priorities; $1.1 billion invested in R&D assets, platforms and industry solutions, including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8,300; and $1.1 billion invested in the training and development of our people to grow the skills needed to serve our clients.\nWe continue to offer an employee value proposition that includes providing vibrant career paths and opportunities for our people with approximately 157,000 promotions and over 40 million training hours while expanding our workforce by almost 100,000 and achieving 47% women as we continue our progress towards gender parity by 2025. We believe our unwavering commitment to diversity, broadly defined, and inclusion is an essential element of our ability to deliver market-leading financial results because our diversity and inclusiveness makes us smarter, more innovative and more attractive to top talent.\nWe achieved over 85% renewable electricity powering our offices and centers around the world, on our way to 100% by 2023.\nWe prioritize creating value around the world and the communities where we work and live, both through investments and job creation and through our direct support of meaningful local initiatives, including our apprenticeship programs in the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Latin America; and our growing partnership with Youth Business International, which will help an additional estimated 240,000 young entrepreneurs, ages 18 to 35, build skills and success in a digital future on top of the 370,000 young entrepreneurs already supported through this partnership in many different communities throughout the world.\nThis year, we are proud to achieve our highest brand value and rank to date on BrandZ's prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list, increasing 28% to over $82 billion and ranking #26.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes another outstanding year for Accenture. Once again, our results continue to provide strong validation of our leadership position in the marketplace, the relevance of our services to our clients and our ability to consistently deliver on our shareholder value proposition, including both our financial results and creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders.\nSo let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter across our 3 financial imperatives. Revenue grew 22.4% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth across all markets, services and industries. We once again extended our leadership position with growth estimated to be more than 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin was 14.7%, an increase of 10 basis points for the quarter. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.60, which represents 18% growth compared to EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.6 billion, driven by superior DSO management.\nNow let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $18.4 billion for the quarter, our second highest ever, with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Outsourcing bookings of $9.9 billion were a record with a book-to-bill of 1.4. We were very pleased with our strong bookings this quarter, which reflects 22% growth in U.S. dollars and 31% growth in local currency, including 26 clients with bookings over $100 million in the quarter.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.4 billion, a 15% increase in U.S. dollars and 22.4% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 14% in U.S. dollars and 22% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $7.1 billion, up 16% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services grew very strong double digits, operations grew strong double digits and strategy and consulting grew double digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 18% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service; Software & Platforms; and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services.\nIn Europe, revenues grew 26% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Industrial; Banking & Capital Markets; and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Looking closer at the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, The U.K., Italy and France.\nIn growth markets, we delivered 26% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Banking & Capital markets; Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services; and Public Service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 33.3% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 11.3% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 7.1% compared to 7.4% for the same quarter last year.\nOperating income was $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with Q4 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.60 compared with EPS of $2.20 in the fourth quarter last year.\nDays service outstanding were 43 days compared to 44 days last quarter and 38 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.6 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.8 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $177 million. Our cash balance of August 31 was $7.9 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31 last year.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.1 million shares for $605 million at an average price of $293.23 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $614 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on November 15, a 15% increase over last year; and approved $3 billion of additional share repurchase authority.\nNow I would like to take a moment to summarize our outstanding year. We were extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal year '22, greatly exceeding almost all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last September. We delivered 7.1 -- $71.7 billion in new bookings, reflecting 21% growth in U.S. dollars, hitting 100 clients with quarterly bookings of $100 million, which positions us well as we begin FY '23.\nWe added significant scale with a record $11 billion in incremental revenue, almost double what we added in fiscal '21. Revenue of $61.6 billion for the year reflects growth of 26% in local currency. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects a 10 basis point expansion over FY '21. We were extremely pleased that we were able to deliver within our original guided range, particularly with the continued significant investment in our business and people, including higher wages.\nEarnings per share were $10.71, reflecting 22% growth over adjusted FY '21 EPS, which is our highest growth in over a decade, reinforcing our ability to grow at scale profitably. As a reminder, we adjusted earnings last year to exclude gains on an investment. Free cash flow of $8.8 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.3.\nAnd with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $6.6 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $3.4 billion across 38 acquisitions.\nIn addition to these excellent financial results, let me turn to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. Through our partnership with Save the Children, we are preparing young people for a more sustainable and exclusive future by skilling an estimated 70,000 people to drive social and environmental change. For more information on the 360-degree value we are creating, please go to the Accenture 360-degree Value Reporting Experience, which reflects new information each quarter.\nSo again, FY '22 was a truly extraordinary year, and we are now focused on delivering in fiscal '23. And now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. We succeed by being close to our clients. Understanding and anticipating their needs, helping them from strategy to execution with the best solutions for their businesses, whether for growth, cost optimization or both and resilience. And it all starts with technology. With the breadth and depth of our existing capabilities, combined with our incredible learning organization, we are able to pivot as necessary, positioning us to serve our clients' changing needs and capture new market opportunities, all while being laser-focused on our own operational excellence.\nI will give some color on the demand we are seeing. First of all, against the backdrop of the current macroeconomic environment, we delivered $18.4 billion in new bookings in Q4, a year-over-year increase of 31% in local currency.\nWhile industries and markets are being affected differently, there are 2 common themes. All strategies lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security, which are fundamental to a strong digital core. Our cloud business is now $26 billion and grew 48%, with Cloud First being the biggest driver of the growth.\nCompanies are also seeking to execute compressed transformations, the second theme. These mean bold programs on accelerated time frames often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at the same time. Managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platform and talent, and they are turning to Accenture because of our excellence across the enterprise. We are unmatched in terms of breadth and depth of capabilities and industry coverage.\nWe continue to see a growing number of companies embrace the need to harness the 5 key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade: Total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the Metaverse continuum and the ongoing tech revolution, which in turn will fuel our growth. Let me bring this demand to life.\nFirst, total enterprise reinvention. We are helping our clients transform every part of their business with technology, from building a digital core to optimizing operations; to achieve agility, efficiency and resilience; to accelerating their growth agendas. While it is still early stages, there are leading companies that have begun systematically transforming multiple parts of their enterprise, from moving to the cloud and adopting new ways of working to digitizing manufacturing, to reimagining shared services, to creating entirely new business models.\nUnilever, one of the world's largest consumer goods companies, is an example of a company that is leading in total enterprise reinvention. Together, we are setting a new industry standard by reinventing technology delivery with cutting-edge automation, delivering cloud migration at scale, the largest ERP migration to the cloud in the industry and shifting to technology solutions that support their growth strategy. They have changed their business model from a matrix structure to being organized around 5 distinct business groups. Each business group is fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth and profit delivery globally.\nNow we are helping them build a B2B marketplace that will help millions of small retailers in emerging markets grow their business and create what the company calls shared prosperity. We helped launch in 7 markets in just 12 months, implemented a cloud-native, scalable commerce platform powered by data and advanced analytics. And we are managing front-end, back-office operations and campaigns delivered in partnership with the Accenture Song team.\nBecause across our industries, we are as relevant to the boardroom, to the CFO to the business unit leader, to the GM of the factory, and we understand the connections across the enterprise, we are uniquely positioned to help our clients as they seek to often simultaneously drive growth, efficiency, cost reduction and increased resilience.\nFor example, we are helping Lupin Limited, a global pharmaceutical company, become an intelligent enterprise by enabling its data-driven transformation journey. A new digital platform will unlock enterprise data to increase efficiencies, and decision-makers will now have real-time visibility into integrated data across 100 countries and 15 manufacturing and research facilities. This consolidated view of global business operations and performance will help the company navigate supply chain disruptions and accelerate product innovation and speed to market while supporting the company's mission to provide affordable health care to people around the world.\nWe see continued demand for our Industry X capabilities, which are all about digitizing engineering and manufacturing. This is the next digital frontier. Industry X revenues grew 38% in FY '22 to total $7 billion.\nWe are helping EDF, a French multinational utility company, digitize the construction of a nuclear power station that will provide low-carbon energy for more than 6 million U.K. homes. As part of a total enterprise reinvention, our Industry X team transformed EDF's digital construction processes by creating a global digital factory model on a secure cloud infrastructure, driving cost efficiency.\nConstruction methods that used to be paper- and blueprint-based will be digitized, and AI will consolidate parts information from millions of pages of supplier guides. Digital dashboards will provide real-time data visibility across all systems, and digital twins will help identify areas for automation across power plants, all of which drive safety, efficiency and quality. We are leveraging our expertise of nuclear construction on our cutting-edge cloud, digital and AI capabilities to help EDF deliver on one of the largest capital projects in Europe and accelerate its mission, helping Britain achieve net zero.\nAnd our operation services, now a $9 billion business with 19% growth in FY '22, are fundamental to total enterprise reinvention for our clients because they help our clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce cost.\nFor example, we are collaborating with one of the world's largest commercial vehicle manufacturers to develop an independent finance operation, leveraging our deep functional expertise in finance and accounting. With our managed services, we will implement a new platform underpinned by SynOps. Automation, data and analytics will drive and provide real-time decisions while digitizing processes to improve efficiency and user experience, all leading to significant cost reductions, better decision-making and savings.\nAnd as our clients build their digital core, security continues to be more important than ever. With over $6 billion in revenue and 45% growth, our integrated security capabilities, from identity, to threat intelligence, to manage security services, to incident response, are critical as our clients respond to increasing risk as the security landscape widens.\nWe are working with an Asian multinational conglomerate to deliver a comprehensive managed security services, security operations center, a holistic security solution to detect, monitor and respond to global security threats 24/7. We will also manage tools to continuously monitor end-user devices to detect and respond to cyber threats, like ransomware and malware, and will perform regular threat-hunting activities to detect new cyber hacking techniques. This will provide its business units with timely detection and defense against cyber attacks, deliver threat intel for proactive defense, reduce false alarms by 90% and minimize emergency incidents to less than 1% of total incidents.\nMoving from total enterprise reinvention to the other 5 forces. Next, talent. Our clients look to us to help them access, create and unlock the potential of talent.\nWe collaborated with Sky, one of Europe's leading media and entertainment companies, to modernize its employee experience and human resources operations in the era of hybrid working. By migrating to a Software-as-a-Service multi-platform human capital management solution, all in the cloud, employees will be empowered with anytime, anywhere self-service solutions and access to real-time data and dashboards across all markets in one place. The solution supports all people management functions; from recruiting and onboarding; to performance management and learning; as well as compensation, benefits and payroll integration. Employees have the full picture of their work experience at their fingertips, helping them to build their careers and perform at even higher levels.\nNow sustainability. With $1 billion in revenues in FY '22, we continue to believe clients will increasingly need our sustainability services in the decade to come.\nWe collaborated with Swisscom, Switzerland's #1 firm for communications, IT and entertainment, on a climate strategy to reduce the company's emissions and help its customers reduce their emissions by 1 million tons of carbon by 2025, equal to 2% of Switzerland's total carbon emissions, by leveraging technology such as cloud, data, AI, 5G and IoT. These technologies will address faster and higher capacity data transmission with remote management and control of connected devices.\nWe are also helping the company explore strategies to incorporate technologies within the emerging Scope 4 classification that can help further reduce carbon emissions from customers, allowing Swisscom to positively impact the planet and provide their customers with a larger number of green products and services to choose from.\nMoving to the Metaverse and the ongoing tech revolutions. We continue to invest ahead of our clients' needs and have more than a decade of experience and leadership in Metaverse-related capabilities. In fact, we expect to onboard over 150,000 new joiners using Accenture's Nth Floor. And we use our experience and expertise to help our clients as we believe the Metaverse continuum provides greater possibilities in the wave of digital transformation, and it is still early days.\nFor example, we are helping Tokyu Land Corporation, a Japanese leading leasing, construction and retail real estate company, leverage the Metaverse to transform the customer experience through digital twin technology, leveraging computer-generated imagery to recreate walk-throughs of its condominiums online to greatly improve its in-person model room tour. Customers will be able to visualize a property online, including different home equipment options, and the company will attract more buyers and increase sales while reducing marketing costs and the environmental impact of the construction, operation and removal of the model room. Into the future, we will help create continuous touch points with customers throughout the real estate life cycle and develop new collaborative digital businesses, such as purchasing furniture and home appliances and ordering renovation services.\nAnd with our continued focus on innovation on the ongoing tech revolution, we continue to invest in our business for the future. For example, in Q4, we invested in Pixxel, a leader in cutting-edge earth imaging space technology.\nBack to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately negative 8.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 10% to 14% growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 6% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 2.5%.\nFor operating margin, we expect fiscal year '23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.09 to $11.41 or 4% to 7% growth over fiscal '22 results.\nFor the full fiscal '23, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $800 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1.\nFinally, we expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?\n\nAngie Park\n\nMD & Head of IR, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, KC. (Operator Instructions) Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?"

Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Angie, and thank you, everyone, for joining. And thank you to our 710,000 people around the globe for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in delivering another very strong quarter of financial results and creating significant 360-degree value beyond our financials for all our stakeholders.\nHere are a few highlights of the 360-degree value we created this quarter. Starting with our people, we continue to invest their skills, and they completed 10.6 million training hours, which averages to 16 hours per person this quarter.\nWe're incredibly pleased to be recognized as a top 10 Great Place to Work for 2022 in countries representing 76% of our people: Argentina, Brazil, France, India, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, U.K. and the United States. Specifically on the U.S. list, we are particularly proud that Accenture jumped 38 spots in 1 year to rank #6. Overall, this is the 14th consecutive year that Accenture has been recognized by Great Place to Work.\nAlso of particular note, in India, not only were we ranked #10 by Great Place to Work, Business Today recognized India -- Accenture in India as #4 of the best companies to work for, marking our 11th consecutive year on the list. All of these recognitions reflect a tangible demonstration of our commitment to our people.\nThe strong demand for our people and services and trust from our clients are once again seen in our strong bookings of $17 billion, which represents 15% growth in local currency. Compressed transformation continues, with another 18 clients with bookings over $100 million, bringing the total year-to-date to 74, which is 20 more than the same time last year. We had revenue growth of 27% in local currency continuing to take significant market share, growing nearly 3x the market while delivering margin expansion of 10 basis points.\nOur ongoing investment in our communities was reflected this quarter in how we are leveraging our expertise in digital learning and collaboration, partnering with UNICEF's Generation Unlimited on the new Passport to Earning platform program to equip 10 million young people, ages 15 to 24, with digital skills across 10 countries to prepare them for work. This program went live this quarter in India, the first and largest country of the 10.\nAs always -- well, as always, we are staying close to our clients and our ecosystem partners to help them succeed today and to anticipate the needs of the future. And our very strong financial results this quarter reinforce the trust our clients and partners have in our ability to do so.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call.\nWe delivered very strong overall results in the third quarter, reflecting very strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business as well as continued operating margin expansion as we continue to invest at scale in our business and our people. We continue to lead the industry with these results, demonstrating the relevance of our services and our trusted client and ecosystem partnerships. We continue to deliver on our shareholder value proposition, including both our financial results and creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders.\nLet me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter across our 3 financial imperatives. Revenues grew 27% in local currency and were above the top end of our guided range, driven once again by broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries, with all 13 industries growing double digits. We once again extended our leadership position, adding an incremental $9 billion in revenues year-to-date, with growth estimated to be nearly 3x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies.\nOperating margin of 16.1% for the quarter was an increase of 10 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business. We delivered EPS of $2.79, which represents 16% growth over fiscal '21 results and includes $0.15 or 6% negative impact related to the disposition of our business in Russia.\nFinally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.9 billion and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We have made investments of $2.2 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 27 transactions year-to-date. And we now expect to invest about $2.5 billion in acquisitions this year, with another $1 billion that we expect to close in Q1 given required regulatory approvals.\nWith that, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $17 billion for the quarter and overall book-to-bill 1.0. Consulting bookings were $9.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which represent our second highest ever and were aligned to our expectations. Our bookings reflect 15% growth in local currency and 18 clients with bookings over $100 million. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong pipeline.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.2 billion, a 22% increase in U.S. dollars and 27% local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of 5% compared to the 4% headwind provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact, we were $160 million above our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 24% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $7.1 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and consulting and technology services both grew very strong double digits and operations grew strong double digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 23% local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services; Public Service; Software & Platforms; and Communications & Media.\nIn Europe, revenues grew 30% local currency, led by double-digit growth in Industrial; Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services; and Banking & Capital Markets. Looking closer at the countries. Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, the U.K., France and Italy.\nIn Growth Markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services; Banking & Capital Markets; and Public Service. From a country perspective, Growth Markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared with 33.2% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.3% compared with 10.6% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.5% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.6 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16.1% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with Q3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.79, including a $0.15 or 6% negative impact related to the disposition of our business in Russia, compared with diluted EPS of $2.40 in the third quarter last year.\nDays service outstanding were 44 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 36 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $195 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $6.7 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.1 million shares for $972 million at an average price of $313.43 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $614 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on August 15, a 10% increase over last year.\nFinally, turning to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. We were very pleased to be ranked #13 on 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States report, which recognizes outstanding ESG transparency and performance against the Russell 1000, which are the largest companies in the U.S. equity market. For more information on the 360-degree value we are creating, go to Accenture's 360-degree value reporting experience, which reflects new information each quarter.\nSo in summary, we are extremely pleased with our results to date and are now very focused on Q4 and closing out another very strong year.\nNow let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. As we shared at our recent Investor and Analyst Day, we believe there are 5 forces that our clients must harness over the next decade that -- and that, in turn, will drive our growth: Total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the Metaverse continuum and the ongoing tech revolution.\nToday, we continue to see strong demand across our markets, services and industries, which is being driven primarily by 2 of these 5 forces: Total enterprise reinvention, which involves transformation of every part of every business, leveraging technology with new ways of working and engaging with customers and employees and new opportunities for growth; and talent, which requires every business to be able to access talent, be a talent creator, not just a talent consumer and to unlock the potential of their people.\nCompressed transformation continues, with our clients seeking to execute bold programs in accelerated time frames, often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at the same time, when in the past, they may have taken a more sequential approach. This desire for speed with strong execution is driving our growth as clients partner with us because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities, the insights that come from our scale, global footprint and our deep functional industry and cross-industry expertise. And they partner with us because they trust us and because we are trusted partners with a technology ecosystem which are also critical to our clients' transformation.\nWhile the current macroeconomic environment affects industries and markets differently, the common theme across our clients is that all strategies, whether for growth, cost or resilience, lead to technology, particularly cloud data and AI, and our clients turn to us to be able to effectively use technology to achieve their goals.\nLet me bring this demand environment to life. We help our clients execute total enterprise reinvention by helping them build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth. Cloud, data and AI are fundamental to a strong digital core.\nWe are working with The Clorox Company, a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of home care, household and health and beauty products for consumers, as well as products and technologies for professional customers. The company is undertaking a broad digital transformation that will touch every aspect of the enterprise. We will help the company modernize business processes, streamline their operating model, leverage advanced data and analytic insights and establish a future-ready technology foundation to deliver new levels of customer and consumer experiences, accelerate go-to-market activities and enable a more agile and resilient supply chain so they can lead and shape the consumer goods industry.\nWe are helping New Look, a global fashion retailer, migrate its existing e-commerce platform to the cloud and strengthen its technology foundation to enable a seamless experience across stores, online, mobile and social media. AI and machine learning will create greater efficiency, increase sales and provide the flexibility to scale for growth and overcome industry disruption. The company is committed to infusing sustainability into their transformation road map, using innovation as an accelerator toward their own 2040 sustainability targets, all of which promises to keep the company in step with the store of the future, the speed of the fashion industry and the demands of their stakeholders.\nAnd as we build the digital cores of our clients, security is more important than ever. Our integrated capabilities, from identity to threat intelligence to managed security services to incident response, are critical as our clients respond to increasing risk and expand their digital footprint.\nWe are helping a large health care services provider assess their cybersecurity and business resilience levels. With much of their growth coming through mergers and acquisitions, technology and security have become more challenging to manage with multiple security providers, data centers and environments. We helped design a cloud strategy and secured their backups in the cloud with an end-to-end cybersecurity approach that will provide flexibility as they continue to acquire more companies. We are also providing a managed security service, from cyber resilience to threat intelligence, to monitor their infrastructure and their security products, improving their ability to protect against future attacks.\nOur clients value our unique combination of capabilities, from strategy and consulting to technology to managed services, because it enables us to deliver holistic solutions and expands their access to digital talent.\nWe are helping Infinera Holdings, a Japan-based infrastructure construction services company, digitally transform operations in finance and HR through a data-driven approach. Through our managed services capabilities and our SynOps platform, we will help the company shift to intelligent operations by standardizing and automating key business processes, driving efficiency and productivity, reducing operating costs and providing greater opportunity for their people to focus on high value and strategic growth areas, such as business design and digital experience.\nShifting to the next digital frontier in the enterprise. Our Industry X capabilities are digitizing engineering and manufacturing to reimagine the products our clients make and how they make them, and to build a greater resiliency, productivity and sustainability.\nWe are partnering with a German multinational corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles to develop an in-car software platform that will power the central intelligence unit for personalized driver interaction, information, convenience functions and entertainment. The platform provides a continuous flow of customer data to the automaker, enabling it to enhance vehicle functionality and create the superior customer experience that the automaker is renowned for.\nWe are helping Albras, the largest producer of primary aluminum in Brazil, to increase its productivity, energy efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions by creating a new smelter control system operated over a new IoT architecture that utilizes cloud platforms for data storage and machine learning. Data insights will enable better visibility of gas emissions around the clock, allowing operations to be proactively managed, leading to increased energy efficiency and operational safety as well as additional sustainability strategies to reduce their carbon footprint.\nSustainability, 1 of the 5 forces shaping the next decade, continues to be a growing priority area for our clients. And they value our ability to help them achieve their sustainability goals as part of their larger transformations, such as the Albras example, and directly as part of sustainability-focused engagements, such as the work we are doing for Pos Malaysia's Berhad, the national operator running Malaysia's largest post and parcel delivery network.\nWe are helping Pos Malaysia Berhad to embrace a data-driven approach to reducing emissions, cutting waste and upgrading its employees' digital skills. Best-in-class solutions for environmental, social and governance benchmarking plus the sustainability implementation road map and a skills for the future program will lead to dramatic reductions in direct waste in Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, along with rapid progress on workforce upskilling.\nWe continue to build our capabilities in this area both organically and inorganically. We are pleased that this quarter, we announced 3 new sustainability acquisitions: Greenfish, akzente and Avieco, extending our reach and enhancing our ability to deliver deep skills and expertise to clients in ESG measurement and nonfinancial reporting, net zero strategy and regulation and real-time data analytics.\nOur unmatched ability to access, create and unlock talent is valued by our clients as a key component of their compressed transformations, such as Pos Malaysia Berhad. In other cases, we help provide our clients access to talent through our managed services, and we help them become talent creators by having their shared services groups join Accenture, where they can benefit from our ability to transform, upskill and provide new career pathways.\nFor example, we are working with BNL, a leading Italian banking group and subsidiary at BNP Paribas, on a compressed transformation, just 18 months from start to finish, that will leverage our SynOps platform, maximize our client's existing talent and reduce total cost of ownership. We will consolidate data to provide deeper analytic insights and a better customer experience with tailored services and faster fulfillment times for customer requests.\nAs part of this transformation, more than 500 people from their team will move to Accenture, where we will leverage their industry-specific skills while also providing opportunities for professional development, enabling BNL to focus on strategic growth and benefit from this upskilling.\nWe also do work with our clients that is primarily focused on their talent agenda. For example, we're collaborating with a large utility who is creating thousands of clean energy jobs in areas like renewable electricity generation, energy-saving homes and buildings and sustainable transportation. They are doing so for unemployed, underemployed and low to middle income residents.\nWe are developing a recruitment, employment and tracking platform that matches people's skills with available positions, leveraging AI and market insights. This solution reduces hiring time, improves the candidate experience and unlocks talent potential to create jobs for the underrepresented residents who need the most.\nWe are uniquely positioned to help our clients drive cost efficiencies and their growth agenda. As you may have seen, Accenture Interactive will now go to market as Accenture Song to reflect the fundamental change in the way companies must engage with customers and the incredible speed at which they need to operate and innovate. Song is uniquely operating at the intersection of creativity, technology and intelligence to help our clients reinvent connections and meaningful experiences, including sales, commerce, marketing, new business platforms and the Metaverse continuum.\nWe are helping a North American multibrand retailer scale their digital business and accelerate growth while reducing operational costs up to $100 million over the next 5 years. Together, we are designing and implementing a new multiproduct platform to improve the customer experience and enable the use of data and insights to drive increased engagement and better business performance overall.\nWhile still very early, we are seeing our clients look to take advantage of the Metaverse, another of the 5 forces. For example, we are collaborating with an international property developer, MQDC, to develop their business model and design their customer experience in the Metaverse.\nAs you can tell, this continues to be an exciting time for Accenture as the depth and breadth of our business allows us to help our clients with innovative and impactful work.\nBack to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie. Turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 8% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 20% to 24% growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year '22, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of roughly 5%.\nFor operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21.\nFor earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.61 to $10.70 or 21% to 22% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. This guidance range reflects a negative $0.14 impact from the updated FX guidance, partially offset by the increase in revenue guidance.\nFor the full fiscal '22, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.\nFinally, we continue to expect to return at least $6.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie?\n\nAngie Park\n\nMD & Head of IR, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, KC. (Operator Instructions) Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?"

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAngie Park\n\nMD & Head of IR, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.\nOn today's call, you will here from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.\nDuring our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Angie, and thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by honoring the incredible bravery of the Ukrainian people in the face of the unlawful invasion by Russia and extending our deep sympathy and concern over the horrific losses of life. While these words don't feel adequate to capture what is happening, we are taking actions to help in the small ways we can, which I will share more about later in the call.\nTurning now to the quarter. I will start by thanking our almost 700,000 people around the world for your incredible dedication and work to create 360-degree value for our clients and all our stakeholders. Thank you to our clients who are making bold moves to transform and putting their trust in us to help them. Finally, thank you to our technology ecosystem partners we work with every day to innovate and create more value for our clients.\nNow a few highlights from the quarter. We had record bookings of almost $20 billion and continued improved pricing, which refers to contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell across the business with 36 clients with bookings over $100 million. We had record revenue growth of 28% in local currency, bringing total revenue added through H1 to $6.2 billion, which is what we added in all of FY '21. And our EPS grew 25% year-over-year with flat operating margin and continued significant investment in our business and our people.\nOur workforce grew by 24,000 people, demonstrating again our ability to attract top talent at the scale needed by our clients. We were the top scoring company on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index out of more than 400 organizations globally. We were recognized in Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies for the 15th year in a row and by JUST Capital for the sixth consecutive year. Our people completed another 9.2 million training hours this quarter. And we continue to gain market share, growing more than 3x the market.\nWith such an exceptional quarter, I would like to particularly recognize and thank the incredibly strong delivery teams that underlie these results. Our clients know that our commitments are backed by the outstanding work our people do every day, working side-by-side with them from shaping the future to building the best systems and platforms to creating amazing new experiences and brands to running critical functions for our clients and everything in between.\nBefore handing over to KC, let me pause to reflect on the current macro environment. It was almost exactly 2 years ago that we did earnings only 8 days after the pandemic was declared. Then, as now, the world faced incredible uncertainty. We are all watching the events unfold in Ukraine, and there are many potential scenarios which are difficult to predict.\nWhile the circumstances are very different, our focus is the same: on the well-being of our people, serving our clients and staying close to their evolving needs and helping our communities. We emerged from the pandemic an even stronger and more relevant company, and we will use this strength to successfully navigate this environment and fulfill these same 3 goals.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations with record new bookings of almost $20 billion, $2.8 billion higher than our previous record set last quarter. Our results reflect very strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, which reinforce the relevance of our offerings and capabilities in the market to deliver value for our clients.\nWe had a very strong Q2 and first half of the year. While we know the environment is uncertain given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, we always call it as we see it. And based on the best information we have today, we are increasing key elements of our full year guidance, which I will cover in more detail later in our call.\nNow let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 28% local currency, increasing $3 billion over Q2 last year and nearly $300 million above the top end of our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industries growing double digits. We also continued to extend our leadership position with growth estimated to be more than 3x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly-traded companies.\nWe delivered EPS in the quarter of $2.54, reflecting 25% growth over adjusted EPS last year. And operating margin of 13.7% was consistent with Q2 of last year. And 10 basis points expansion year-to-date reflects continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2 billion and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We have made investments of $1.8 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 21 transactions in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect to invest approximately $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year.\nWith that, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were a record at $19.6 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 22% in USD over a very strong Q2 last year, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.3. Consulting bookings were $10.9 billion, a record high, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Outsourcing bookings were also a record at $8.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. We were very pleased with our new bookings, which were driven by both Technology Services and Strategy and Consulting as well as 36 clients with bookings over $100 million.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15 billion, a 24% increase in U.S. dollars and 28% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 29% in U.S. dollars and 34% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.7 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Strategy and Consulting, Technology Services and Operations all grew very strong double digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 26% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Software & Platforms, Consumer Goods, Retail & Services -- Travel Services and Public Service. In Europe, revenues grew 31% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets.\nLooking closer at the countries. Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Germany, France and Italy. In Growth Markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. From a country perspective, Growth Markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.1% compared with 29.7% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.4%, consistent with the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 7% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, consistent with Q2 last year.\nBefore I continue, as a reminder, we recognized an investment gain in Q2 last year, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.21. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.2% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.5% for the second quarter last year.\nDiluted earnings per share were $2.54 compared with an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 in the second quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 41 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 34 days in the second quarter of last year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.2 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $165 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $5.5 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.6 million shares for $1.7 billion at an average price of $369.19 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $4.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.\nAlso in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $617 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on May 13, a 10% increase over last year. So at the halfway point of fiscal '22, we have delivered very strong results.\nNow let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. Let's begin with the demand environment. We are experiencing double-digit growth in all parts of our business across all markets, industries and services. All our growth priorities, Applied Intelligence, cloud, Industry X, Intelligent Operations, Intelligent Platform Services, Interactive Security and Transformational Change Management all are growing double digits. Many of our clients are taking on bold transformation programs, often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at an accelerated time frame, which we call compressed transformation, as they recognize the need to transform every part of their enterprise with technology, data and AI and new ways of working.\nWhat is also clear is that the sheer speed at which an enterprise now needs to move and the breadth of the expertise required to transform demands partnerships. For example, our wide range of managed services from intelligent operations to application development and maintenance to cloud, infrastructure and security, our strategic capabilities that enable our clients to digitize faster, access hard-to-hire talent, transform more quickly due to our deep expertise and achieve outcomes from greater efficiency to improved customer satisfaction to enhance security to faster development to higher growth. Our managed services are unique because they combine our strong strategy and consulting capabilities to anticipate and shape the future and be at the cutting-edge of industry, function and technology. We also see our clients looking for partners who can create 360-degree value, upskilling our people, focusing on enhancing diversity and building in sustainability, which is our focus.\nStepping back, when you think about the extraordinary growth we are experiencing and how we navigated the pandemic, we believe our commitment to create 360-degree value for all our stakeholders and our unmatched diversity of people, services, industries, functions, markets, ecosystem partners and investments, together with our leadership and technology, have made us both relevant to the world's largest companies and resilient.\nI will now bring to life how we are partnering with our clients with a snapshot of the range of solutions we are bringing across industries and across the enterprise. Let's start with enterprise functions. In chemicals and natural resources, we are expanding our relationship with a leading chemical manufacturer to carve out one of their business units serving the automotive industry to better focus on sustainable solutions. As part of this carve-out, we will build the backbone of this new entity with a cloud-based infrastructure, ERP platforms and intelligent operations managed services for technology, HR and finance, all in just over 1 year. This compressed transformation will create new value, reduce operating costs by up to 30%, enhance portfolio flexibility and enable future growth in new areas.\nIn consumer goods and services, we are working with a large multinational personal care corporation to build an integrated digital core with standardized processes, IT enterprise platforms and instant access to consolidated data in the cloud, which will enable a more efficient and flexible supply chain and digital order processing. This will provide more time to sell, reduce human error, create a better customer experience and deliver a stronger bottom line. We will also streamline financial operations, leading to greater agility and cost benefits to remain competitive in any environment and delight their consumers.\nNow I will turn to our solutions helping transform the core operations of our clients. In High Tech, we are supporting Airbus, a leading aircraft manufacturer in several areas of their business, including digital design, manufacturing and services. With our acquisition of umlaut, we're also helping Airbus engineering and manufacturing teams to develop the new A350F. At the same time, we will also onboard and manage training for new frontline employees using a realistic digital twin pilot, optimizing onboarding time and significantly reducing the learning curve of shop floor workers without disturbing production.\nIn Banking & Capital Markets, we are helping BBVA, a global financial services firm, synchronize and speed up its digital journey. With the power of analytics, AI and automation, we will create an intelligent data-driven banking operation with greater agility and productivity, lowering costs by up to 30% by leveraging our strategic managed services, improving their customer experience and becoming an integral part of their talent strategy to provide new growth opportunities, upskilling and security opportunities. This builds on our work with this digital leader that spans over 25 years, including international expansion, capital market strategy and digital sales and services.\nIn Health, we are helping Highmark Health, a national blended health organization to make Health care more personalized and proactive through the power of technology and data.

Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nThe call dropped.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nHas the call dropped?\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nNo, I think it's still going.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Chairman, Accenture Plc\n\nSorry about that, everyone. I just want to make sure, I confirm that we're good. Apologies. If you can hear me, we heard the call apparently drop. We're good. Okay.\nSo let's go back to we're helping our clients put sustainability in their core. We are helping a leading steel and mining company move to low-carbon steelmaking and employ decarbonization technologies. As an end-to-end partner supporting the company's ambitious decarbonization program, we will help standardize and implement the technical solution among its sites.\nI would now like to briefly comment on how Accenture as a company and our people have mobilized to support our Ukrainian colleagues and provide humanitarian aid. When people ask me what makes Accenture special. Our actions like these are what come to mind. While we do not have operations or people who work in the Ukraine, we have many Ukrainians who work for us, particularly in Poland. For their extended families who are in Ukraine, we quickly put in place Ukrainian language telehealth and other remote support services. And for those family members who are leaving Ukraine, we are providing the settlement assistance.\nI also am proud of our people who have volunteered to drive refugees from the border to help get them settled. With a decade of experience helping refugees, we knew that not-for-profit organizations operating in Ukraine and the border countries providing humanitary relief would have an initial immediate need for cash. We are currently donating $5 million in cash to these organizations.\nIn addition, our people have donated nearly $1.5 million in our employee giving program, and we are providing 100% match funding. Our people also have sprung into action to anticipate the next needs of refugees. In Poland, we are piloting the first addition of an Accenture Academy for women refugees from Ukraine to build their technology skills starting in cybersecurity.\nFinally, as we've shared, we are discontinuing our business in Russia. We are working to support our nearly 2,300 employees there, and we want to thank them for their dedication and commitment to Accenture over the years.\nBack to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie. Before I get into our business outlook, I would like to provide some context as events are rapidly evolving and there's significant amount of uncertainty. Our third quarter and full year guidance does not include any assumption for a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope.\nNow let me turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.7 billion to $16.15 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 4 compared to the third quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 22% to 26% growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year '22, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 24% to 26% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of about 5%.\nFor operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion of our fiscal '21 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21.\nFor earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.61 to $10.81 or 21% to 23% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.\nFinally, we now expect to return at least $6.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?"

As the Operator mentioned, I'm Alexia Quadrani, Executive Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results.

We'll include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com.\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Alexia and everyone, for joining this morning. Apologies in advance for my voice. I am getting over a seasonal cold, and my voice is not quite cooperating. And really wanted to start today by thanking our nearly 784,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and your commitment to our clients, which enabled us to deliver another strong quarter. Let me begin by sharing that we are very proud to have earned the number four spot on the Great Place to Work list of the world's best workplaces, our highest ever ranking on this prestigious list. This recognition reflects our strategy to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled Great Place to Work for reinventors. It is especially meaningful because it is based on feedback from our people worldwide. Our ability to attract and retain great talent is one of our most important competitive advantages.\nBefore handing over to Angie, I will briefly highlight the value we delivered this quarter, the importance of our partnership strategy, and this quarter's strategic acquisitions. We are very pleased with our results as we continue executing our strategy to help our clients reinvent every part of their enterprise, reflected in our bookings of $20.9 billion, including 33 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. We delivered revenue of $18.7 billion, growing 5% in local currency at the top of our guided range, with broad-based growth across markets and both types of work. We continue to strengthen our competitive position by taking significant market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share.\nAdjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points year over year, and we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 10% compared to Q1 last year. We continue to invest significantly to execute our talent strategy to rotate our workforce. We have nearly reached our goal of 80,000 AI and data professionals, and our people participated in approximately 8 million training hours this quarter, with a significant focus on building advanced AI technology and industry skills. Advanced AI is increasingly embedded in our large transformation programs, either enabling future enterprise use or being implemented directly as part of our solutions. Our strong leadership in advanced AI is a clear competitive advantage as clients select us to help them capture the value of this technology now and over time, and to build the readiness required to adopt it effectively across the enterprise. Momentum in the adoption of enterprise AI continues.\nOur advanced AI bookings this quarter were $2.2 billion, nearly doubling from Q1 last year and also up from Q4. Revenue reached another milestone this quarter at approximately $1.1 billion. As we think about the advanced AI opportunity ahead, as you know, we were the first in our industry to share our bookings and revenue from advanced AI, which we define as GenAI, Agentic AI, and Physical AI, and does not include Data, Classical AI, or RPA. We introduced the metrics in Q3 FY 2023 just months after GenAI burst onto the scene, initially to size the reality of the opportunity and to demonstrate our early leadership. At that time, bookings were about $100 million across roughly 100 projects, and revenue was immaterial. We have measured it consistently since that time. To date, we have now delivered approximately $11.5 billion in bookings across 11,000 projects with revenue of $4.8 billion.\nThis will be the last quarter in which we share these specific metrics. The demand for AI is both real and rapidly maturing. We've now reached a point where advanced AI is being embedded in some way across nearly everything we do, and many of our clients are focusing on moving beyond standalone proofs of concept or initiatives. We're shifting to more scaled end-to-end solutions that integrate multiple forms of AI, and it has become less meaningful to isolate the data specifically for advanced AI as it does not reflect how the demand is evolving on the ground, the full scope of our AI work, or the value we're creating. Now, turning to our partnership strategy. Our partnership strategy is grounded in client demand. Demand for reinvention remains strong, with our clients continuing to prioritize larger transformational programs focused on building their Digital Core and driving both efficiency and growth.\nTechnology is front and center for every client, and the 60% of our revenue in Q1 from work we do with our top 10 ecosystem partners continues to outpace our overall growth. Given the importance of the broader technology ecosystem to our clients, we plan to continue providing insight into the role our top partners play in our growth by maintaining the metric we introduced at the end of FY25, the percentage of our revenue tied to work with our top 10 ecosystem partners and its growth relative to our overall growth as it provides a clear view into our largest, most important partnerships. We also plan to continue to share our partnership strategy and how we're growing new businesses with an expanded group of partners. Most of our clients operate with a network of ecosystem partners to meet their enterprise needs.\nThey rely on us to help integrate those partners and expect us to be the leader with the most relevant players across their enterprises, including new and emerging players. As a result, it is important that in addition to our top 10, we work with a broad set of partners that play important roles across enterprises. Many of these support specific functions such as digital manufacturing, product and engineering, core banking and insurance, supply chain, and finance, while others are helping clients advance their AI and data capabilities. Our partnerships are critical to our clients reinventing all parts of their enterprises. Together, they represent meaningful opportunities for growth and further strengthen our ability to deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions.\nOver the past year, in response to client demand, we've been expanding and, in some cases, forming new partnerships with emerging AI and data companies, and we will play a key role in helping our clients use these technologies, including creating new solutions and integrating and leveraging the synergies with their existing ecosystems. These evolving partnerships, which are laid out in our earnings presentation, are a significant competitive advantage for us. Turning now to our strategic acquisitions. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement to acquire a 65% majority stake in DLB Associates, a US-based leader in AI data center engineering and consulting in the rapidly growing data center professional services market, an estimated $12 billion addressable market expected to double by 2030. Along with our FY25 acquisition of UK-based Soben, this meaningfully expands our capital projects capabilities and presence in the high-growth data center consulting market.\nIt also positions us to capture growth not only through the work we do with helping our clients use AI, our primary business, but also in the opportunity created by the companies building the infrastructure to power AI. This quarter, we also invested $374 million primarily in six strategic acquisitions. We're scaling our capabilities with Sipal, Integrated Product Support Business in Italy, which brings deep defense and aerospace engineering experience expertise for mission-critical programs, and Total eBiz Solutions in Southeast Asia, which adds AI, cloud, and digital workplace innovation that strengthens Avanade's position in the region. We're scaling new growth areas with NeuraFlash in the US, a Salesforce and advanced AI leader whose agentic solutions expand our reach into the mid-market. Aidemy in Japan, which enhances LearnVantage with AI learning and reskilling capabilities to help clients build AI-ready workforces. And Deco in the UK.\nand Ranger Data in the US, which strengthen our Palantir and advanced AI capabilities. In summary, we are pleased with how we delivered a quarter and continue to strengthen our foundation for long-term growth. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, with revenue at the top of our guided range, as well as strong adjusted margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth, and free cash flow. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to be the reinvention partner for our clients. We continue to invest for long-term market leadership while delivering significant value for our shareholders. Now, let me summarize a few highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 5% in local currency, reflecting nearly 4% organic growth, and were broad-based across geographic markets and types of work. Excluding the 1% impact from our Federal business, our revenues grew approximately 6% in local currency in Q1.\nAdjusted operating margin was 17%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to Q1 results last year, and continues to include significant investments in our business and our people. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.94, which represents 10% growth compared to EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $1.5 billion and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through accelerated repurchases and dividends this quarter. We also invested $374 million, primarily attributed to the six acquisitions in the quarter. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $20.9 billion for the quarter, representing 12% growth in US dollars and 10% growth in local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $9.9 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed services bookings were $11.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.2.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $18.7 billion, at the top of our guided range, reflecting a 6% increase in US dollars and 5% in local currency, and a foreign exchange impact of 1.4%. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9.4 billion, at 4% in US dollars and 3% in local currency. Managed services revenues were $9.3 billion, at 8% in US dollars and 7% in local currency, driven by high single-digit growth in technology managed services, which include application managed services and infrastructure managed services, and mid-single-digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets. In the Americas, revenue grew 4% in local currency. Excluding the 2% impact from our Federal business, Americas grew 6% in local currency in the quarter. Growth was led by banking and capital markets, industrials, and software and platforms, partially offset by a decline in public service.\nRevenue growth was driven by the United States. In EMEA, we delivered 4% growth in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, insurance, and life sciences. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Italy. In Asia-Pacific, revenue grew 9% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, communications and media, and public service. Revenue growth was led by Japan and Australia. Before I move on, I want to briefly update you on the business optimization actions we initiated last quarter and completed in Q1 as part of executing our talent strategy. This quarter, we recorded $308 million in costs, primarily related to employee severance, bringing the total for these actions over the past six months to $923 million. Our business optimization costs impacted operating margin, tax rate, and EPS. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nNow, moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.1%, compared with 32.9% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10%, compared with 10.2% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.1%, compared to 6% for the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating income was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 17% adjusted operating margin, at 30 basis points compared with results in Q1 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%, compared with an effective tax rate of 21.6% for the first quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.94, compared with diluted EPS of $3.59 in the first quarter last year, reflecting 10% growth. Days sales outstanding were 51 days, compared to 47 days last quarter and 50 days in the first quarter of last year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.7 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $157 million. Our cash balance at 30 November 2023 was $9.6 billion, compared with $11.5 billion at 31 August 2023. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we accelerated our share buybacks and repurchased or redeemed 9.5 million shares for $2.3 billion, at an average price of $245.32 per share. Also, in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.63 per share, a 10% increase over last year for a total of $1 billion. So, in summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are focused on delivering Q2 in the year. Before I turn it back to Julie, let me provide an update on our commercial models.\nOur large base of fixed-price work continues to grow and is a strong foundation for how we believe our commercial models will continue to evolve. In FY25, about 60% of our work was fixed-price, which is up about 10 points over the last three years. This reflects the increasing role of our proprietary platforms over a long period of time and clients wanting greater certainty in cost and delivery. This is where our scale, experience, and strong financials matter. And now, back to you, Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, clients continue to prioritize their most strategic and large-scale transformational programs, which convert to revenue more slowly but position us at the center of their reinvention agendas. The pace of overall spending and discretionary spend in our market is at the same levels we have seen over the last year. We are delivering strong results and taking market share in this environment because reinvention is critical to our clients, and our clients know we deliver real reinvention with real outcomes. Let me turn to four strategic growth areas that are essential for enterprises to use technology, AI, and data to achieve these outcomes. First, the Digital Core. Cloud, data, and platform modernization remain foundational to every reinvention. When companies tell us they want to use AI, they quickly realize that AI is only as powerful as the data underneath it.\nMost organizations have mountains of data spread across systems, stored in different formats, often unreliable or incomplete. Before AI can create value, underlying data and the processes connected to it need to be simplified, cleaned, connected, and properly governed. We help clients manage all their data wherever it may be and turn it into something they can access and use to make decisions, train models, and uncover insights. We modernize their data platforms and make sure the data flows securely and consistently across the business so people can trust it and use it with confidence. We also use AI to improve data quality at scale. In the age of AI, data isn't just an input; it's the advantage. That's why we continue to see at least one out of every two advanced AI projects lead to a data project, and we're the partner that helps our clients unlock it.\nFor example, Essity, a global leader in hygiene and health, is making advanced AI, including agentic AI, core to how they run their business, starting with procurement and finance, setting the foundation for company-wide reinvention. We are helping Essity build a cloud-based data and AI platform that combines Accenture's deep industry and functional expertise with our ability to scale advanced AI. We're starting in high-volume parts of the business, processing hundreds of thousands of purchase orders a year. The opportunity for double-digit productivity gains is strong. This foundation positions Essity to move decisively beyond pilots and reinvent end-to-end processes, unlocking new pathways to value and long-term growth. Security remains one of our fastest-growing businesses, growing very strong double digits this quarter. As cloud, data, and AI connect more of the enterprise, the threat landscape expands quickly. We are using AI to detect threats earlier, respond faster, and simplify complex environments.\nCompanies cannot scale AI unless they can do so safely, and this continues to be an important growth engine. Building on our long-standing relationship, we are partnering with one of Saudi Arabia's leading financial institutions to build a robust internal cyber defense capability that is designed to protect the bank, meet rising regulatory expectations, and enable the launch of modern, sustainable digital services. We help the bank move from limited visibility to a far more advanced security position, expanding threat detection, reducing incident response times, and are helping to improve their national cyber maturity scores. We are also helping the bank achieve the full regulatory audit readiness, a critical requirement for trust and future growth. Now, with Accenture's deep cybersecurity expertise, we will bring in specialized talent, strengthen governance, and help with upskilling to accelerate their progress.\nWith the stronger foundation and the internal capability to maintain it, the bank can now introduce new services with far greater confidence and is well-positioned for its next phase of innovation. Accenture Song grew mid-single digits this quarter. Song continues to help B2B and B2C clients drive growth by improving how they connect with and shape the customer's experience, the marketing that first reaches them, the website or store where they buy, the service when they need help, and the digital products they use every day by bringing together design, creative, data, technology, and industry expertise to reinvent marketing, commerce, service, and digital products. One example is our partnership with Virgin Media O2, one of the UK's leading telecom providers, where we didn't just modernize technology, we worked together to transform the entire customer experience and how work gets done.\nBy rebuilding their digital core and embedding advanced AI, nearly 10,500 service agents now work on a unified cloud platform with connected data and workflows. More than 300 customer journeys have been redesigned, simplifying processes and bringing the full customer context into a single view. These changes are helping agents resolve issues faster and more accurately, contributing to a 35% increase in Net Promoter scores in some areas and same-day resolution, improving from approximately 65% two years ago to nearly 90% today. A cultural shift is also underway, upskilling teams to enhance their customer-first mindset, turning service calls into opportunities to improve customer loyalty and trust. This kind of change takes strategy, process, and talent working in sync, with Accenture Song bringing it all together to design experiences that resonate at scale so that Virgin Media O2 can drive innovation and set a new benchmark for customer service excellence.\nWe also continue to grow in the core value chain of many industries through our Industry X offerings, growing mid-single digits this quarter. Manufacturing and engineering remain early in their digital transformation journeys. Digital twins, predictive analytics, robotics, and other AI-enabled technologies are creating new levels of efficiency and resilience. Those same strengths are now propelling our capital projects work, where clients need us to design, build, and commission critical infrastructure and extend Accenture deeper into their core value chains. Take North America's transit sector. Agencies are facing mounting pressure to modernize aging infrastructure and meet growing ridership needs, efforts that require delivering multi-year, multi-billion-dollar capital programs. Partnering with one of the largest public transit agencies, we're applying our infrastructure and capital projects expertise to help transform how these critical programs are managed, spanning a vast network of subway stations, maintenance facilities, bus garages, and administrative offices.\nBy bringing together multiple data sources across their construction portfolio, we are helping to enable more informed decision-making, supported by rigorous project controls, advanced scheduling, cost and risk management, and safety and financial oversight to improve efficiency, transparency, and forecasting, just as we do in manufacturing. As a result, the agency is strengthening its daily transit operations and supporting safer, more reliable service for millions of riders. Now, let me share how we're seeing demand evolve with the work we're doing in advanced AI. It is early innings, which means there is significant opportunity ahead. Technology is rapidly evolving. While enterprise adoption at scale is nascent, demand continues to grow, and IDC estimates that the total addressable market for advanced AI is expected to grow more than 40% through 2029, from roughly $20 billion today to over $70 billion. We are seeing a steady increase in demand.\nOver the last nine quarters, we've seen about 100 incremental clients initiate advanced AI projects with us each quarter. But most have a lot of work to do before they will be able to scale across the enterprise, and it is still a relatively small part of our client base, over 1,300 clients to date out of 9,000. So we see lots of opportunity to help those who have initiated and to expand in our existing clients, as well as attract new clients. Clients increasingly understand that advanced AI is not a quick fix. Adopting it successfully requires foundational work to deliver P&L impact and other critical outcomes. This is why our clients and the broader ecosystem are turning to us to help bridge the gap between powerful technology and achieving real, measurable results. The real opportunity is not proving AI works. It is making it work everywhere.\nScaling AI means working with all forms of AI and means embedding it across critical processes so it transforms outcomes. For example, we are partnering with Bristol Myers Squibb, a global biopharmaceutical leader, to transform how therapies move from discovery to market by embedding AI at scale across the organization. Drawing on its deep life sciences experience, BMS is using AI to accelerate innovation and expand its impact for patients. We are also establishing early leadership in agentic AI, with the scale of our deployments working across the ecosystem. We have built an extensive library of over 3,000 reusable agents, reflecting our deep industry and functional expertise. These agents have been used in real client environments, giving us a unique foundation of proven solutions to help clients move faster and with more confidence. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect revenues to be in the range of $17.35 to 18 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately positive 3.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Our Q2 guidance reflects an estimated 1 to 5% growth in local currency, including about a 1% impact from our Federal business. For the full fiscal 2026, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume that the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately positive 2% compared to fiscal 2025. For the full fiscal 2026, we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of 2 to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2025, including an estimated 1% impact from our Federal business.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange, our revenue is expected to be an estimated 3% to 6%. This year, we continue to expect an inorganic contribution of about 1.5%, and we continue to expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year, with the potential to do more. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2026 to be 15.7% to 15.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2025 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2025. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2026 to be in the range of $13.52 to $13.90, or 5% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal 2025 results.\nDue to slightly higher business optimization costs in the quarter, which were $58 million above our original Q1 estimates, we now expect GAAP EPS of $13.12 to 13.50. For the full Fiscal 2026, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $10.8 to 11.5 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow to be in the range of $9.8 to 10.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. We continue to expect to return at least $9.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of $1 billion, or 12%, from Fiscal 2025. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.63 per share to be paid on 13 February, a 10% increase over last year.\nWe remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash generated to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Alexia.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that each keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Once again, if you have a question, please press star then one. One moment, please, for your first question. Today's first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks so much. Julie, I appreciate your comments on scaling AI and how it's not a quick fix. So I did want to ask, or maybe comment, that we've noticed a bit of a shift in how people view the consulting industry's role in AI. Do you agree with this, Julie? And if so, why now? What's driving the change? And are you seeing any impact on business activity as a result of that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes, we're absolutely seeing the shift. And it's really because of what we've been saying for a while, right? Enterprise AI is fundamentally different than consumer AI. Consumer AI adoption is instant, right? In the enterprise, you can't adopt it unless you have the right security. You've done the right work around processes, and most companies have fragmented and siloed processes. You have to have the right data, and most companies have mountains of data with a lot of issues in the data. And we call it they have process debt, they have data debt, and of course, they need a modern Digital Core. And that's why so many companies are still early in the journey. Our clients are convinced AI is going to be a very important part of their future, and it's going to allow them to unlock brand new value.\nThat's why they're coming to us, because now they want to actually get there. That's the foundational work that's driving our business. Then when you look at our bigger deals over the last quarter, for example, you see that advanced AI is a bigger part of those deals. But you also see that it's both growth and cost, because clients are not only fixated on the productivity side. You cannot cut your way to growth. In this market, they need to find more growth. This is where our strength really comes in. That's why we're delivering strong quarters, right? We have great momentum this quarter because we can help them on the growth agenda and the cost agenda. We're so critical with our ecosystem partners. We understand where the technology is and where it's going.\nYou saw that again this quarter with our growth, with our top 10 ecosystem partners outpacing overall, and then, of course, some exciting new partnerships.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Perfect. And sort of a related question. You mentioned the partners. I'll ask around these AI partnerships. You have a bunch of Anthropic, OpenAI, Snowflake, etc. Just how might these partnerships on the AI front be different than other tech ecosystem partnerships in terms of how we think about time and productivity or investments to certify personnel, to scale it up, etc.? Just your thoughts on that and how quickly might these AI partners get to the top 10 on the partner front? Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, first of all, the partnerships really demonstrate our talent advantage. So we've got decades of experience in being able to learn new technologies, skill people. Who else could have hundreds of thousands of people helping our biggest partnerships continue to grow incredibly well and be able to dedicate and commit 30,000 people here, etc.? So, excuse me, I think that's a really important part of what you're seeing with us in our growth and our ability to grow into new areas is that we've got this foundation of great talent and the ability to upskill. And look, we're expanding in these partnerships because of what we see in client demand. But our clients have an ecosystem of partners.\nThe role that we play is to be, we really try to be number one with all of the partners so that we can help our clients integrate and use these new technologies with their existing ecosystem, which is absolutely critical to them. Lots of excitement. The market is expanding, and we're going to grow with that market.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Sorry about that. And our next question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thank you, guys. Good morning. I actually wanted to pick up where Tien-tsin Huang just left off. I was curious, as a follow-up regarding these big partnerships in the AI world, when do they start moving the needle on revenue, in your view? It's obviously critical to lay the foundation right now, but is this a next 12-month dynamic where we can start to see it showing up in the P&L, perhaps? Or is it longer dated? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nJason, what I would say is these partnerships are part of an ecosystem for our clients. And so I think more about the market itself, right? So our enterprise adoption is dependent on clients. These partnerships are all about enterprise adoption. So I would focus more on how the market and enterprise adoption is going, as opposed to specifically because we can scale as fast as needed. And our expectations there are reflected in our guidance.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. Understood. Then I wanted to pick up on your comments about the increased adoption of the fixed price work, because I think it ties in with a trend we've been seeing in your numbers where revenue growth is outpacing headcount growth pretty materially and consistently. Do you feel like that trend is sustainable? And what's really driving that? Because we've all been talking about nonlinear revenue growth for a very long time, and it seems like Accenture is now actually starting to see it.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Jason. Good morning. It's Angie. Let me take that.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nWe're really pleased with our revenue per person this quarter, which did grow 7%, which is really primarily driven by our talent rotation. We're now hiring, as we shared with you last quarter, we're hiring for the new skill. And that'll go up and down really based upon when we bring people in.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nAnd Jason, just to add on, though, you're right. The sort of revenue and headcount, that sort of breakage has been going on, though, for a long time. It really goes back all the way to the introduction of RPA. So we'd expect that to continue. But it's not tied exactly, as Angie said, to what's happening quarter to quarter.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nRight.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much. I want to follow up on a couple of things that have been said by Tien-tsin Huang and Jason Kupferberg. First, back on AI and those bookings, I appreciate that AI is becoming integral to all of your engagements. And so maybe defining specific bookings, etc., on a go-forward basis makes sense. But how should we think about the mix between what we could think of as proof-of-concept type engagements versus going into full production? And any color you can give on the types of projects that are moving to production, whether that be by industry or type, etc.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Great question. So first of all, one of the things that I think is important to understand is that people have moved ahead away from just thinking about models, right? It's about models embedded in solutions. And most of the solutions involve different kinds of AI, right? So if you have classical AI or RPA that is 100% accurate, right, depending on what you're using, you really have to understand all of that. And that's what the clients are looking to us for, is to bring them more solutions, which is why our partnerships are really important. And our understanding of the industry and the function is so important.\nSo if you're doing something in banking, which is one of the industries where there's a lot going on in advanced AI, know your customer and compliance, the solution they're looking for, you have to understand the actual compliance, how it works across the bank. And that's really the importance now of you're seeing that people get that these are about solutions. It's about really understanding operations. And that's what we're bringing. If you look at sort of where things are scaling into production, customer, so a lot of customer service, and I gave one of the examples today on the call with Virgin Media O2, you're also seeing areas like finance and procurement. And so these are areas where you've got good technology readiness. We have a lot of depth of understanding here. And you can move relatively quickly because it's using a lot of usually pretty good data.\nWe see a lot of value coming and being embedded in the core value chain, the grid and utilities, right, pharma, and R&D. But those are the harder areas to crack. And so it's still pretty early in terms of scaling, but that kind of gives you a flavor for it. And so any of the industries that have a lot of customer service, there banking has been one of the lighthouses, insurance to some extent already. But one of the things I tell my clients is that in every industry, unlike prior waves of technology, there are leaders in every industry who already had strong digital cores who are leapfrogging. It's very different than cloud, where you had some industries, like say energy, lagging behind for quite some time. It's quite different this time.\nThat really plays to our strengths because we have that diversity of industry expertise. Our clients look to us to really bring it across the board.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned and talked a little bit about the revenue per head and the evolution there. One of the questions that we get from investors a lot is around pricing, particularly on a like-for-like basis, and how that may be evolving, and how we should think about the puts and takes there, especially as it relates to your margins and margin growth objectives. Thanks.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I think hi, Jim. How are you? Hi, James. So as it relates to pricing, so just overall, I think you have to look at it in totality. So as you think about our pricing, one of the things, and we've been seeing it's early, but we're seeing pricing improve in several parts of our business. And as you look, one of the things that we're super pleased about is that our contract profitability, we're starting to see some of that improved pricing show up in the P&L, and we saw that this quarter. So we were really pleased with that. It's really about balancing those components.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Bryan Keane at Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nHead of North America Payments Processors and IT Services Research, Citi\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Wanted to ask about discretionary spend. We're all waiting around for a while here for that to come back. I'd just be curious to know how you're thinking about that heading into next year, conversations with clients, and should we be hopeful that discretionary spend comes back and the turn in the calendar year?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nAll right, Bryan. I'm not waiting around for it to come back, okay? So just to be clear, we have not been waiting around for it to come back. So I know you guys are, but we're delivering our results despite it because we really, at this point, we haven't seen a change in the market. And when you look around, we're all reading the same thing. We saw what came out in the US this week on jobs. There isn't some catalyst out there where we're saying, \"That's the catalyst that's going to change confidence or change industries.\" And look, we work across industries. Every industry right now has got a different set of challenges with a lot of these big macro trends. And so we're not having conversations today that would suggest that there's a big going to be a change in discretionary spending.\nBut what the conversations we are having, though, is CEOs who are just like Accenture; they're very resolute that they have to deliver results despite the market. And that's why we're focused on pivoting the way they're spending. We're focused on doing the large transformational deals and then being at the center so that when we hopefully do get tailwinds, we're there to really benefit from them. But we're not seeing a catalyst. We'd love to hear it if you guys are in the external environment. And our conversations haven't changed, but people are—they're going to deliver despite that.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nHead of North America Payments Processors and IT Services Research, Citi\n\nGot it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, that 60% of work being fixed price is above industry norms. And you guys have been working on that forever. And that's pushed up 10 points in the last three years. How do we think about the, as AI becomes a bigger piece of that, can that number get up to 70% or 80%? And just a little bit of how that pricing works with productivity, how do you pass on some savings and keep it yourselves? Thanks so much.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Well, one of the things that I think as you think about our positioning in the market is that these fixed-price deals really are about our clients having confidence that we can deliver outcomes. And to do that, you've got to have our scale, our experience, our strong financials. And so we see that it is a real competitive advantage in this market where clients cannot simply experiment. They can't take a flyer. They have to know that when they're investing with a partner, they're going to deliver results. And that's why we feel the market now continues. We're taking market share because of that. So I can't predict exactly. I mean, I think commercial models are going to continue. We believe they're going to continue to evolve. And we've got a really strong foundation for that.\nWe are starting to see more focus on trying to get to outcome-based. So I think more to come in the models. But it really strengthens. It speaks to the underlying strength of our business. And then with respect to pricing and passing it along to our clients, remember, this has been a business model for the industry, really all the way going back to the introduction of technology and RPA, right, where we're signing contracts that depend on our use of more technology over time to provide productivity. And so that's still the commercial model of the industry right now.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nHead of North America Payments Processors and IT Services Research, Citi\n\nGot it. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Bryan Bergin at TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thank you. Wanted to ask on the growth side. So just really the moving parts as you consider the Fiscal 2026 growth outlook from here. So you're from the 2 to 5 after a solid Q1 at the top end. Q2 looks largely as expected. Yet the Federal headwinds are actually a bit less than the prior range. So it sounds like demand's broadly consistent. So the question is, what may have precluded a low-end raise, just considering that low-end raise had deterioration assumed before? Just curious, is there anything incremental there or just ongoing uncertainty, and just prudent approach, just given this early in the fiscal year?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Bryan. Good morning. So look, as we think about, we just had a really strong print in Q1. We had strong bookings two quarters in a row. We can see the backlog from our large deals. We've got a solid pipe. And so our 2 to 5 really reflects what we see going for the remainder of the fiscal year. We got three quarters left, and it's our best view. And we were really pleased that Federal came in a bit better than what we had anticipated, which is the strength of the work that they do.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Understood. My follow-up's on Song. I heard the mid-single-digit growth. That sounds consistent here, which is good. Wanted to dig in, and I appreciate the detail you gave in the slides. Can you just talk about the implications for Song growth? Just looking ahead, just considering recent advances in models like Sora. There's a perception that enterprises can do more of this themselves or just the cost of such services, we'll see material deflation. How do you navigate that type of a backdrop going forward?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Sora is a great example of something we embrace and are helping our clients embrace because what Sora does is help them accelerate production. And so it's like a really good tool, but it's just a tool, right? So what Accenture does is say, \"How do you use these tools to actually get productivity differently, to, more importantly, create the right new products and the new experience?\" And that's why one of the things I was mentioning earlier was that if you look kind of at our largest deals this quarter, a big proportion of them have customer and customer service in it because clients need growth. And the tools are just a productivity piece. They're not what you can do to, \"How do you actually respond to social media sentiment in an hour?\" right, which is what we can do in our operations around marketing, for example.\nSo we see Song as critical because, again, can't cut your way to growth. The market's not getting better overall for our clients. They're really turning to us to find the new ways and to help them use these tools in the meantime to get more productivity.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nMakes sense. Thanks and happy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Darren Peller at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys. Julie, what does the revenue opportunity look like at a client that has done all of the Digital Core work required to get effectively leveraging AI as much as you'd like to see? And then maybe just a quick follow-on would be just around managed service opportunity and what that looks like. Really trying to get a sense if you have any customers that are really at that stage that you can give us examples of where there is a net increase to revenue and the opportunities you have in different services that could help a client out that has the Digital Core ready.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture",
    "content2": "Darren, it's a great question. What we're seeing is it's really expanding our work. So think about you've built the Digital Core. Of course, just keep in mind there's still a lot to do in the Digital Core because there's so much new opportunities and new ways of thinking about data, for example, than if you built your data foundation a few years ago. So there's still a fair amount of work to do, even if you've got a pretty modernized Digital Core. But the real work, and this is why I think it's so important to understand how you adopt AI, is that you have to then change the processes. You have to upskill your talent, right? One of the things I talk to CEOs a lot about is that if someone comes to you and says, \"Here's how we do something today.\nNow we're going to use AI,\" and there isn't a big change, then they're not going to get value. Most of the work today has been around sort of isolated areas. It hasn't been across the enterprise. So what you're seeing is we talked a little bit also about this last quarter, this inflection point where you've got now clients saying to us, \"Okay, we have to do this across the enterprise. How do we think differently? How do we put marketing, sales, and service together?\" They used to be in different functions. What does that mean then for the use of AI? So the actual rewiring is a huge amount of work.\nAnd remember, the technology today, it's great in some parts of the enterprise, but if you think about manufacturing or engineering, where we've been investing for decades, it's still early in the digitization journey, even for those who have a core. So we have lots of great examples. And that's why I talk about to our clients, \"Look, where people have already invested a lot, they're investing with us now to try to leapfrog.\" And that's where we are so different because we're tech, but we have the industry, the functional, the process, and the change management, which is what unlocks the enterprise AI. So we really see a big opportunity over the next decade.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. That's really helpful. Just very quickly, following the business optimization, what is your headcount? What should we expect from headcount or your headcount strategy for the remainder of the year now? Thanks again, guys, and happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Darren.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Darren. I'll take that. So as it relates to our headcount, look, we expect to - we're doing our talent rotation, and we expect to increase our headcount throughout the year in the US and in Europe. So you should see that come through for the remainder of the year.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh at UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin McVeigh\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Congratulations on the results. I think you'd mentioned that advanced AI is 1,300 of your 9,000 clients, and that implies about 14% versus the 6% revenue and 9% bookings. Should we use that in terms of a leading indicator or goalpost of what the revenue and bookings should scale? And if that's the case, any sense of that 14%, how that scales over time, just as we're thinking about the adoption rate?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThe way I would really just think about it, so it's not meant to be some new metric in that way. What it's really showing is just how rapidly it's moving: 100 clients initiating a quarter, and that it's at the same time really, really early, right, when you think of our whole client base. But I wouldn't start now creating kind of a new metric in that. It's just too early to start drawing those correlations. But I'm trying to give some insight into kind of where is the market right now.\n\nKevin McVeigh\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThat's super helpful. And then, just real quick, the 17.3% margin, I mean, I went back. I think that's the highest Q1 you've ever had. Is that a function of the efficiencies and, again, the fixed pricing? And how should we think about the margin trajectory of the business, maybe a little bit longer term, to the extent you can comment on that?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hey, Kevin. We're really pleased with the 30 basis points of op margin expansion that we posted this quarter, which was in line with our expectations. And certainly, our operating margin is affected by the level of investments that we do throughout the year. And so we're really pleased that we're reconfirming the 10 to 30 basis points for the full year. As it relates to EPS, I do want to make one point. Really pleased with the 10% growth that we posted this quarter, strong operational results, op margin expansion, as well as gains on investments. But there's one thing that I do. There's two things that I want to call out as it relates to Q2 specifically for your awareness and how we're thinking about it.\nFirst is that we expect our tax rate in Q2 to be above our full-year guided range due to the tax impact of equity compensation. And then second is that we had higher gains on investments in Q2 of last year, and we don't expect the same for this year. But importantly, there's no change to our overall adjusted, our full-year guidance for adjusted op margin, tax, or EPS. This is really timing.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you. Operator, we have time for one more question. Then Julie can wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our final question comes from David Koning at Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much. The Health and Public Services growth was sequentially, I think, up 7%, the strongest, or I think the second strongest in 12 years, so very, very good. Is a lot of that just the Federal spending headwind dissipating from Q4 into Q1? Was that a lot of it, or is it just underlying health and Federal spending just getting better than normal?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, David. Good morning. So as it relates to our health and public service, really, we saw strength in, we told you about Federal, and we know that, and that came in better than we expected. And then the second component is the strength that we're seeing in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Really strong, well-positioned in terms of that business for us.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nKeep in mind, that's where we've been investing over the last few years, including in acquisitions, and you're seeing that those investments pay off.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHappy holidays. Thank you, everyone. In closing, I want to thank our shareholders for your continued trust and support. I want to thank all of the people who do this work every day, all of our reinventors around the world. I hope everyone has a very safe and happy holiday season. Thank you for joining today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

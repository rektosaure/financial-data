Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s Q1 fiscal 2026 conference call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, NIKE\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s first quarter fiscal 2026 results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill, and EVP and CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.\nWe will start with prepared remarks and then open the call for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thank you for your cooperation on this, and I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul. It's great to be here with everyone today. Before we begin, I want to start with a thank you. I want to thank my NIKE, Inc. teammates around the world. Because of their passion, commitment, and determination, we made tangible progress from where we were 11 months ago, driven by our win-now actions that focused our team on our culture, product, brand marketing, marketplace, and our ground game. This quarter, our win-now actions drove momentum in the areas we prioritized first: running, North America, and wholesale partners. It showed that we're making the right choices. Consumers are responding. We're getting some wins under our belt. What you can't see in the results is the effort that I've seen in our stores, distribution centers, and offices around the world.\nSince my return, not a day has gone by that I haven't asked each of my teammates to commit themselves fully to building a better NIKE. That takes a lot of work. And this quarter, in particular, we asked even more from our teams as we realigned approximately 8,000 teammates to our Sport Offense, which I will explain shortly. It's a massive achievement for everyone involved. What I want this audience to know is that our teams also understand how much we still must do to meet our full potential. Because the truth is, NIKE's journey back to greatness has only just begun. There is significant work ahead, especially in the areas of sportswear, Greater China, and NIKE Direct. And as I said to the team, progress won't be perfectly linear, but the direction is.\nOn our last call, I said it was time to turn the page, and I believe this quarter reflects the many ways we're doing just that. As you've heard me say, it's imperative to bring our entire organization closer to the athletes we serve. That's why the Sport Offense is going to be so critical to our success. This new formation and ways of working will align our three brands, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse, into more nimble, focused teams by sport. We'll gain sharper insights to fuel innovation and storytelling and connect with the communities of each sport in more meaningful ways. Collectively, we'll have a better coordinated attack with each brand forming a distinct identity and delivering a clear intention to serve different consumers. In the marketplace, organizing by sport gives us a much clearer point of view.\nThe House of Innovation in New York is a great example where we redesign a retail experience by sport. I walked the floors in early September, and we're now able to take a consumer into a world of Jordan, a world of NIKE running, or a world of NIKE global football. It's an immersive sport experience, and the refresh has already led to double-digit revenue increases. That clarity works in small-format doors as well. We recently redesigned our South Congress store in Austin to focus only on running and training, and sales have significantly increased. Ultimately, the Sport Offense will maximize NIKE, Inc.'s complete portfolio. It is designed to drive growth across all our dimensions. We believe the opportunity to serve so many athletes across sports with three distinct brands in retail channels at every price point is an advantage that no one else has in our industry.\nNow, let's take a deeper look into where we're driving progress. Our running business gives us an early window into the kind of impact we expect out of the Sport Offense. Our running team moved fastest into our new formation and was the first to get sharper on the insights of their athletes. It turns out runners mostly want three things from their running shoes: big cushioning, stability, or an everyday shoe that returns energy. In response, we've moved with a sense of urgency and completely redesigned the Vomero, the Structure, and the Pegasus to solve for these three insights, integrating our industry-leading innovation platforms like Nike Air, Flyknit, ZoomX, and ReactX. Having a consistent structure of silos and price points allows us to introduce at least one new major running footwear style each season. Our running business continues to be a strong proof point of progress.\nWe're getting back to delivering a relentless flow of innovation that serves real athlete needs, and we're pulling it all the way through the marketplace in consumer-friendly ways. The early results have been positive, with NIKE running growing over 20% this quarter. Our opportunity is to quickly seize the benefits of a Sport Offense and apply them to more sport and sport culture, including global football, basketball, training, and sportswear. I will remind you that each sport is in a different stage of development. Our global football team is preparing for the energy of the 2026 World Cup and is ready to move forward. We will utilize the world's biggest sports stage to debut an exciting new apparel innovation platform that will later be leveraged across other sports. And we will connect with a younger consumer by launching several football streetwear collections.\nAs we're doing in running, football boots are also fueled by three silos at multiple price points, addressing the needs of three different styles of play. This quarter, we relaunched the revamped Phantom GX with great sell-through, and we'll follow that up with a new Tiempo in Q3 and a new Mercurial in Q4. And finally, we reset the football brand identity this quarter with our Scary Good campaign. From a football innovation and brand standpoint, we're ready to go. In the marketplace, we're moving quickly to improve our position to tell football innovation stories in more inspiring ways at point of sale. The longer-term vision is for the impact of the Sport Offense to be felt far beyond the traditional sports where we currently compete. We now have dedicated teams to bring our creativity to additional market opportunities.\nThese are spaces for us to take design risks, to be innovative, and to be irreverent, which is so important to our brand's DNA. NIKE ACG, for example, has brought an athletic, youthful approach to outdoor product for nearly 30 years. As more people stay active outdoors, we will invest in NIKE ACG to address the opportunity. This quarter, we launched an elite ACG race team who have helped us make high-performance outdoor product. Together, we just revealed some exciting innovation: a breathable apparel innovation platform called Radical Air and a trail-tuned super shoe with the ACG UltraFly. ACG professional racer Caleb Olson wore both innovations in his victory at the Western States 100 race, finishing with the second-fastest time in the history of the race. Our new partnership with SKIMS is another opportunity to bring something unexpected to a new consumer.\nNIKE's innovation expertise and SKIMS' dedication to inclusive apparel has the potential to create performance training products with a very different look. We debuted the product line last week with 58 silhouettes, and early consumer response was very strong. The opportunity exists to create more dimension around the most established sports as well. Look at this year's US Open of Tennis as an example. Over the course of the three-week tournament, we celebrated the wins and encore looks of Alcaraz and Sabalenka. We designed custom dresses for Naomi's incredible comeback and for Sharapova's induction into the Tennis Hall of Fame. We excited sneaker fans with a retro launch of Agassi Tech Challenge sneakers, and we brought it all together in New York's House of Innovation in an immersive tennis experience.\nIn the past 10 months alone, as part of our Win-Now Actions, we've activated 12 sport takeover moments that connected the inspiring performances of our athletes and teams to commercial assortments in the marketplace. This quarter, that included the England Women's National Team winning the European Championship, Sinner's Wimbledon title, Scotty's Open Championship title, and Chelsea FC winning the Club World Cup. Sport and the world's greatest moments will always be NIKE's runway. And only we can bring it all together across three brands, so many sports, performance, and lifestyle. This is NIKE maximizing the full power of our portfolio. While the sports performance teams are finding a higher gear, our sportswear teams have work to do to get sharper on the consumers we're serving. We see it in our results. Our business continues to decline.\nContinuing to build a clear product construct in sportswear, as we're doing in our performance sports, remains a priority. We do have pockets of strength, especially in our deep vault of look-of-running footwear, but we are still in the process of putting our largest classic franchises into a healthier position for the NIKE, Jordan, and Converse brands. Air Force 1 is stabilizing. Air Jordan 1 inventory levels are returning to health. The Dunk continues to be managed aggressively down in all geos, and the Chuck Taylor is in the early stages of a global market reset. With Converse, we just put new leadership in place, and we're going to take aggressive actions to better position the brand for profitable growth in the future. Of the priority win-now actions, elevating the full marketplace is in the early innings.\nThe positive is that North America, where we invested first, took some big steps forward this quarter. The team continues to give more consumers access to the brand in more premium environments. We reset over 1,300 running spaces in the quarter, from Dicks to Nordstrom to Heartbreak Hill. We are also pleased with the launch of the NIKE brand store on Amazon, where we are driving stronger engagement and sales than anticipated. While our North America teams are setting the tone, we're still far from our ultimate goal of elevating an integrated marketplace: digital and physical, wholesale, and NIKE Direct in all geographies. Greater China, as I mentioned on the last call, is facing structural challenges in the marketplace. Our business was down 10% for the quarter. Seasonal sell-through continues to underperform our plans, requiring larger investments to keep the marketplace clean.\nMy leadership team and I were in China a few weeks ago. We traveled to three cities, spending time with our Greater China leadership team, consumers, and our partners. We are even more committed to the opportunity for growth in China. They are a nation that's passionate for the games of basketball and global football, and a nation that is embracing a healthy lifestyle through running and training. When we lead with exciting innovations like the Vomero 18 or the Jordan Game Shoe, or have athletes like Ja and LeBron visit key markets, we drive traffic and demand. It is even more clear that our path to winning in China is through sport. Our team is moving with urgency to develop consistent plans across all sports and refresh some of our retail environments into distinct sport experiences.\nWith over 5,000 monobrand stores in China, this will take investment, and it will take time. Globally, NIKE Digital is still working to find solid ground. We made the strategic decision to become less reliant on classic franchises and pull back on our promotions for the long-term health of our brands and marketplaces in all geographies. Organic traffic has flowed. We are working to find the right assortment and marketing mix to consistently bring consumers back to our digital ecosystem. For a company our size, with three brands that serve consumers in nearly 190 countries, not all sports, channels, or countries will recover on the same timelines. I spent a lot of time reflecting on the last several months. What keeps me grounded is every time I return from a major sporting event, meeting with athletes, or being in the marketplace.\nI'm even more convinced that the Win-Now Actions are absolutely the right focus for our teams. With that said, we're also realistic that we are turning our business around in the face of a cautious consumer, tariff uncertainty, and teams that are still settling into the Sport Offense. We know we have a lot left to prove. What gives me confidence is that through the Sport Offense, we're hyper-focused on the athlete. The creative ideas keep coming, and we're covering a lot of ground in the marketplace. Like I said at the start, the NIKE team. This team, we have a lot of fight in us. I look forward to what we're about to do together. Thank you, and I'll pass it to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE\n\nThanks, Elliott, and hello to everyone on the call.\nNinety days ago, I said the Q4 of fiscal 2025 would reflect the largest financial impact from our win-now actions, and that we expected the headwinds to revenue and gross margin to begin to moderate from there. At the end of our Q1, we're encouraged by the progress that we have made, as reflected in our results, and yet we still have much work to do. Today, I will review our financial results. Then I will highlight the progress we have made with our win-now actions across the geographies. Last, I will provide guidance for Q2, as well as some additional insights to bring shape to our near-term financial performance. I'll begin with our financial results. This quarter, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct was down 5%, with NIKE Digital declining 12%, and NIKE stores down 1%.\nWholesale grew 5%. Gross margins declined 320 basis points to 42.2% on a reported basis due to higher wholesale discounts, higher discounts in our NIKE factory stores, increased product costs, including new tariffs, and channel mix headwinds. SG&A was down 1% on a reported basis. This was driven by lower brand marketing expense, reflecting prior year investment around key sports moments, partially offset by higher sports marketing expense. Operating overhead was flat compared to the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 21.1% compared to 19.6% for the same period last year, primarily due to decreased benefit from stock-based compensation. Earnings per share was $0.49. Inventory decreased 2% versus the prior year, as we have made steady progress on our plans for a healthy marketplace by the end of the first half of fiscal 2026.\nAs I shared last quarter, and as you just heard from Elliott, our geographies are at different stages of progress against our Win-Now Actions, and business recovery is trending on different timelines. Therefore, I will focus my geography remarks on the specific context and insights of our Win-Now progress. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 4%. NIKE Direct declined 3%, with NIKE Digital down 10% and NIKE stores flat. Wholesale grew 11%. EBIT declined 7% on a reported basis. North America is building momentum through sustained brand activity across sport, leveraging our leading portfolio of sports marketing assets. North America is furthest ahead in taking steps to elevate and transform the marketplace for future growth. Running, training, and basketball each delivered double-digit growth.\nSportswear grew in the quarter, but there is still work to do, with momentum in apparel and looks of running footwear while managing a 30% decline in our classic footwear franchises. As it relates to the North America marketplace, wholesale returned to growth in the quarter, partially due to shipment timing in the prior year, as well as higher liquidation volume to value channels. Additionally, the strategic actions taken to expand distribution and reach new consumer segments contributed to growth and are showing initial promise. Headway was also made in repositioning NIKE Digital, reducing the number of days of site-wide promotion by more than 50, and lowering markdown rates, as well as increasing share of demand at full price. On inventory, North America drove continued progress through the Q1. Units declined versus the prior year, while dollars were flat, primarily due to new US tariffs.\nCloseout mix is approaching normalized levels. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 1%. NIKE Direct declined 6%, with NIKE Digital down 13% and NIKE stores up 1%. Wholesale grew 4%. EBIT declined 7% on a reported basis. EMEA has largely cleaned the marketplace, even as promotional activity has increased across the industry. NIKE's momentum is building in sport and with our wholesale partners. EMEA is furthest ahead in repositioning NIKE Digital to a full-price business. However, traffic and demand remain soft. In Q1, our performance business continued to build momentum, driven by double-digit growth in running and low single-digit growth in global football, and training footwear. Sportswear declined low single digits, as headwinds in our classic footwear franchises more than offset growth in apparel, and new dimensions of footwear. Over the last 90 days, we've seen promotional activity increase in key countries across EMEA.\nIn order to stay aligned with our partners and manage marketplace inventory, we selectively leveraged additional discounts on NIKE Direct. With respect to inventory, EMEA closed the quarter with units down mid-single digits versus the prior year and a normalized level of closeout mix. In Greater China, Q1 revenue declined 10%. NIKE Direct declined 12%, with NIKE Digital down 27% and NIKE stores down 4%. Wholesale declined 9%. EBIT declined 25% on a reported basis. Greater China created energy with consumers in the quarter through new product innovation and NIKE athlete activations on the ground with Ja, Sabrina, and LeBron. Aggressive marketplace actions have reduced owned and partner inventory. However, store traffic and in-season sell-through continue to be a headwind. Running is a bright spot in China, growing high single digits in the quarter with strong consumer response to new innovations such as the PEG Premium and the Vomero 18.\nIn the marketplace, traffic declined versus the prior year in both NIKE-owned and partner stores, resulting in lower in-season sell-through rates. Digital remains a highly promotional marketplace in Greater China, with consumer shopping moments extending longer on local platforms with deeper discounts. Inventory was down 11% versus the prior year. However, closeout mix remains elevated. Our priority in Greater China is to improve seasonal sell-through trends by refreshing store concepts around sport, creating greater brand distinction at retail with more productive merchandising assortments, and reducing the mix of aged inventory with our partners. In APLA, Q1 revenue grew 1%. NIKE Direct declined 6%, with NIKE Digital down 8% and NIKE stores down 5%. Wholesale grew 6%. EBIT declined 13% on a reported basis. APLA continues to deliver mixed results across countries, with pockets of elevated inventory requiring higher levels of promotional activity and proactive management of supply in the marketplace.\nIn the quarter, performance dimensions delivered strong growth, led by double-digit growth in running and high single-digit growth in training. This momentum was offset by low single-digit declines in our sportswear business. In the marketplace, NIKE Digital delivered sequential improvement in markdown rates across all territories. Inventory across APLA grew high single digits this quarter, and so we are taking additional actions to rebalance inventory levels with retail sales trends in certain countries and tighten buys on NIKE Direct. Next, I will spend a moment to provide an update on tariffs. Last quarter, I shared that the newly issued tariffs represented a meaningful cost headwind for NIKE, since the new reciprocal tariffs are stacked on top of the mid-teens rate NIKE already paid on imports.\nAnd I also outlined the actions we are taking in response, balancing impact on the consumer, our partners, our win-now actions, as well as the long-term positioning of our brands in the marketplace. Since our last earnings call, new reciprocal tariff rates have been increased for certain countries. And so, with the new rates in effect today, we now estimate the gross incremental cost to NIKE on an annualized basis to be approximately $1.5 billion, up from the $1 billion we shared 90 days ago. Given the magnitude and timing of the most recent rate increases, we now expect the net headwind in fiscal 2026 to increase from approximately 75 basis points to 120 basis points to gross margin. We continue to evaluate and implement the actions I described last quarter to mitigate these new costs over time.\nWe are monitoring developments closely, and I remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths, our scale, and the deep experience of our leadership team to navigate through this disruption. Now, I will turn to our second quarter guidance. As Elliott said, we are operating in a dynamic environment, both for consumers and our global business. We remain focused on what we can control, principally, to make forward progress on our win-now actions and to activate our sport offense for the long-term health of our brands. Our outlook reflects our best assessment of these factors based on the data that we have available today. We expect Q2 revenues to be down low single digits, including one point of benefit from foreign exchange. We expect Q2 gross margins to be down approximately 300 to 375 basis points, including a net headwind of 175 basis points from the new incremental tariffs.\nWe expect Q2 SG&A dollars to be up high single digits, with an acceleration of Demand Creation investment and low single-digit increase in operating overhead. We expect other expense, net of interest income, to be an expense of $10 to 20 million in the second quarter. We expect the tax rate for the second quarter and the full year to be in the low 20% range due to anticipated changes in earnings mix. Finally, with an additional 90 days of execution against our Win-Now Actions, I'll close with some insights that should bring shape to NIKE's financial performance for the balance of fiscal 2026. We see momentum building with our wholesale partners. Our spring order book is up versus the prior year, with growth led by sport. As a result, we expect wholesale revenue to return to modest growth for fiscal 2026.\nAt the same time, we continue taking steps to reposition NIKE Digital as a full-price business. Organic traffic continues to decline double digits, with a business in the prior year that was more concentrated on classic footwear franchises and sneaker launch, as well as a higher mix of off-price sales. Traffic comps will remain under pressure, and so we do not expect NIKE Direct to return to growth for fiscal 2026. As it relates to our operating segments, we expect North America will continue to lead our global recovery, while Greater China will require more time due to the unique marketplace dynamics Elliott and I have outlined. Converse is under new leadership and resetting its marketplace and brand. Therefore, we expect revenue and gross margin headwinds from Greater China and Converse to continue throughout fiscal 2026.\nWe have made steady progress on our plans for a healthy marketplace by the end of the first half, and so we expect to begin to see a modest headwind to revenue across both wholesale and NIKE Direct as we lap aggressive clearance activity in the prior year. Foreign exchange has become a tailwind to reported revenue, but we expect minimal benefit to gross margin in fiscal 2026 due to our hedged positions entering the year. We continue to expect SG&A to grow low single digits in fiscal 2026. Our Win-Now Actions contain investment to reignite growth in the business, particularly in Demand Creation, as well as rebuilding both our Sport and Commercial Offense. Overall, there are several puts and takes across different dimensions of our portfolio.\nWe are encouraged with how we have started the year, but progress won't be linear, and there is still work to do to return to driving consistent, sustainable, and profitable long-term growth. With that, I'll pass the call back to Elliott.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThanks, Matt. I'm going to close it out with some perspective on a special sport moment from the quarter that I believe represents the power of a unified team with a singular mission. In late July, I was at the final of the UEFA Women's European Championships in Basel, Switzerland. Defending champion England had already lived through an emotional roller coaster throughout the tournament. They lost their opener to France. They came back from a two-goal deficit to beat Sweden and scored in the final minute of extra time to beat Italy in the semifinal.\nNow they face Spain in the final, who beat them in the last World Cup final. I was sitting with the FA, the governing body of football in England. For the third straight knockout match, the Lionesses started slow. They were on their heels instead of attacking. They went into halftime down one-nil. We began to question if they had anything left in the tank. But coming out of the half, something clicked. Coach Sarina Wiegman made the right substitutions as she had all tournament. Chloe Kelly came off the bench and pace picked up instantly. Hannah Hampton made several key saves. Lauren Hemp was flying all over the pitch, and everyone contributed. England's pressure led to the equalizer in regulation, and after a draw in extra time, Chloe proved to be clutch one more time to score the winning penalty kick in the shootout. The crowd erupted.\nHer country erupted. And there they were, champions of Europe once again, delivering England's first major football trophy on foreign soil. The NIKE London team took that insight and built a campaign around the importance of home that stretched from billboards to T-shirts to the airplane that brought them back to their awaiting fans. The national pride for the Lionesses was everywhere. NIKE was right there with them. When I talk to my team about passion, commitment, and determination, we don't have to look much further than England. It's a group that embraces their roles, an experienced coaching staff who adapts in the moment, players who refuse to give up. I mean, I found out later that Lucy Bronze played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia. A fractured tibia, that's resilience. That is a team that knows what it takes to make a comeback.\nWe were all inspired here at NIKE, and you can be assured we're taking their lessons to heart. We're unified under the Sport Offense, and we're clear on what it will take to win and on the size of the prize ahead. With that, I'll open it up to questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you are in the queue and would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. Please ensure that your phone is not on mute when called upon. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Your first question comes from Michael Benetti with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Benetti\n\nResearch Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for all the detail today. Congrats on the last quarter. Nice to see all the progress.\nElliott, if you look at the spring order book and Matt said it's positive, can you help us think about that within the context of the holiday book that you said was positive last quarter? Maybe just qualitatively, even what's incremental in the build and composition of spring so we can track the progress out of season. And then last quarter, Matt, you said there was a commitment to returning to double-digit margins over time. Obviously, I'm sure you're looking at the historical levels as a goal. It was a helpful backstop. How are you thinking about the medium-term margin levels you can target and maybe some of the phases of recovery, and the inputs we should look at as you start that journey?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nMichael, thanks for the question. Here's what I'd start with. Let me start first with product.\nI think what we're doing a great job is, we're getting back to leading with a sharp focus on sport. We're making certain we leverage the entire portfolio, and you can see that whether how we're approaching performance and sportswear. NIKE running, I think, gives us our best example of where we're having some success. We did just announce that we grew over 20% in the quarter. So great success in running. Our teams are taking that offense and the learnings that we have in running, and we're applying it to other parts of our business. We're running that playbook against global football, training, basketball, etc. We do have work still to do in sportswear, but I think the team is getting much sharper on the consumers that we're serving there. So I'm really excited and encouraged by the work that we've done around the product.\nWe've continued to work really hard from a brand marketing perspective. And then ultimately, clearly, we got to pay it off like you're asking in the marketplace. And I think the team's doing a really nice job of elevating and growing the entire marketplace. And so our goal is to serve consumers wherever and however they choose to shop across multiple channels: specialty sporting goods, athletic specialty, department store, family footwear, and NIKE Direct. And I think, again, the teams are seeing the power of running the complete offense across the entire marketplace. And North America, again, is our best example where we've seen growth there. Overall, our partners are gaining trust in us, and it shows our spring order book is up year over year.\nso excited with the progress that we're making from a product perspective, a marketing and positioning perspective, and then how we're paying it off in a more thoughtful and integrated marketplace.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE\n\nHey, Michael, I would just add that the other dimension we provided last quarter is that North America and APLA order book is offsetting the headwinds that we have in Greater China. We continue to see that trend carry through into the spring order book as well. As it relates to our margins, the way I think about it is that fiscal year 2026, our margins and the pressure on our margins are really reflective of three dynamics. We've got short-term product and channel mix headwinds. We've got the transitory impact from our Win-Now Actions, and we've got the newly implemented tariffs and the impact that that's having on our business in fiscal year 2026.\nGiven the progress that we're making, the steady progress on exiting the first half with a healthy marketplace, we do expect the benefit from less inventory clearance to start to take shape in our margins in the second half of this year. But I would say that our outlook for margins for 2026 overall have moderated. And that's because of the new tariff rates and the impact that that has on our business this fiscal 2026 before all of the actions that we're taking are able to annualize, as well as some of the headwinds that I referenced related to the timeline to return to profitable growth in Greater China and Converse. As I look longer term, I think that we continue to believe that double-digit margins are something that are achievable.\nWe look no further than our history, different size of business, different mix of business, different shape of business, different geography mix, different product mix. I think we're getting clearer on what the path to getting back to double-digit margins looks like. It starts with reigniting organic growth. It requires us to see significant improvement in the full-price mix of our business, which the Win-Now Actions that we're putting into place are setting us on stronger footing to do. Then lastly, as we return to organic growth, we will drive operating leverage on our supply chain costs, on our retail overhead, and on our general operating overhead. While the new tariffs are creating near-term pressure on our margins, we have outlined the actions that we're taking there to address it over time.\nWhile it's going to take us a little bit of time, we're confident that the Win-Now Actions are the right things to move us in this direction.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peral Datania with RBC.Your line is open.\n\nPeral Datania\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nOkay. Thank you very much for taking my question. Apologies if there's any background noise. I was just wondering if you could give any update as to how September has progressed because we're seeing mixed indicators out there in the marketplace, and potentially some evidence that there was a bit of pull forward in terms of consumer demand into the back-to-school period in August, which would have benefited your Q1. I'm just curious about how you're seeing the current marketplace in September trading, if possible. Thank you very much.\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Here's what I'd say.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE\n\nThere's no question that the environment in which we're working in and operating in is dynamic. My message to our team is to continue to control what we can control. I'm confident that our teams in product and brand marketing and the marketplace are. We're closely monitoring our consumers around the world. We're watching for signals. We're staying close with our partners, and we're looking at it, even reading, of course, our own door and digital performance across geos and countries and cities. It is dynamic. I just keep telling the team, remain focused on inspiring through sport because when we do line up innovative product and emotional storytelling across the integrated marketplace, consumers respond. I mean, there's some great examples this quarter, even into September. When we did the launch around running Vomero and the Vomero Plus, we had good sell-throughs.\nThe work we did around the US Open, on the ground, and emotional storytelling, we had good sell-through. Like LeBron in China, when we do that, the consumer shows up. So yes, it's a dynamic environment. We're keeping our teams focused on the win-now actions, and really, that's our fastest path back to growth. To hit on the timing element, you mentioned pull forwards. I guess what I'd say is that our performance in the first quarter didn't have anything to do with pull forwards. I referenced wholesale growth in North America. Wholesale was up 11%. One of the factors in the quarter was the amount of the fall season that we shipped in Q1 versus what we shipped in Q1 of the prior year. So that did create a timing benefit year on year.\nAs we look ahead to Q2, we guided revenue down low single digits. I'd say that there are probably two drivers to that that are most significant. One is, NIKE Digital is facing a more significant headwind in Q2 because we started the Win-Now Actions following the holiday season last year, and we significantly cut back on the amount of promotional activity that we were doing in the channel. As we're lapping that this year, there's going to be a bigger headwind in Q2 than we had in Q1. Then secondarily, we're only planning for one point of FX benefit in Q2, whereas we saw two points of FX benefit in Q1. Hopefully, that helps provide a little bit of dimension on some of the seasonality.\nThe last thing I would say related to the seasonality or the comparisons is that the actions that we're taking on the Dunk that Elliott and I both referenced are more significant in Q2. So that's also creating a quarter-over-quarter comparison, if you will, as you compare Q1 to Q2. There was a lot of Dunk business in Q2 of last year, and we're managing that franchise back, as Elliott mentioned, and feel great about our plans.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nThanks, and congrats on the progress. So Elliott, maybe could you help elaborate on some of the early wins under your belt that you cited, notably the return to growth in North America and the material acceleration in running?And with that, I guess, could you speak to the structural foundation that you've now built that you believe is the key to expanding the strategy to other parts of the portfolio?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah. Matt, let me start. You really have to think about it at a high level in two parts. First part is the Win-Now. Those are the actions that we put in place, the focus that we gave our team within the first 60 days. And then the second part is what we just activated in early September, which is what we're calling the Sport Offense. And I'm going to try to outline the two, but you got to think about them both together. Let me start first with Win-Now. You know the priorities there, but we put five priorities out there, putting the athlete at the center of everything we do.\nIt comes down to innovative, coveted product. It's about telling emotional, inspiring stories. It's about paying it off in an integrated marketplace and then activating our ground game. And we're seeing signals that it's working. First and foremost, in running, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, up 20%. Our wholesale partners, we have growth there. Spring order book is up, and then North America. So that's where we're seeing some great success. Feel good about the brand impact our team is doing around sport moments, brand launches, brand campaigns, some of our key product launches, etc. So good success against the Win-Now Actions. With that said, we still have work to do in some parts of our business that we've touched on. And we've got plans in place against China, our Nike Direct digital commerce business, and our sportswear business.\nSo that's what the teams are working on from a win-now perspective. When you think about the sport offense, and this is rather than us being organized by men's, women's, kids, we flipped the entire organization in early September to be aligned on the product creation side and the brand marketing side by brand, by sport, and by country and account, wholesale and direct, digital, and physical. And the whole idea is that those small cross-functional teams gain the insights from the athletes or the consumers that they serve in each segment. And then that will help us drive and make us more competitive and have stronger consumer connectivity. And again, there's no question in my mind that putting sport and the athlete back at the center of everything that we do puts us back on offense.\nAnd again, while we have some great things underway through our priority sports and the efforts to elevate the marketplace, we still have a lot of work to do. But what inspires me most is our teams. They're embracing the change, and we're ready for the challenge.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Elliott, as you contemplate the traffic headwinds you're seeing today in NIKE Digital, how much of the pressure is attributable to the strategic reduction in promotion versus other factors? And as you look ahead, what are the most important milestones we should be watching for to return that business to profitable growth?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nBrooke, thanks for the question. I'm going to step up above just a little bit for a second on the NIKE Direct digital business.\nWhat I'm challenging, and Matt and I and the entire leadership team are challenging our teams to do is to elevate and grow the entire marketplace, not just Nike Direct digital commerce. We need to be and serve consumers wherever and however they choose to shop for our brands. Really, it starts with what I just touched on, the relentless flow of innovative product across all three brands and all sports and in every channel of business in which we do business, especially sporting goods, athletics, specialty department stores, family footwear, and Nike Direct, because being sharp on the consumers we're serving in each location, digital or physical, wholesale and direct, that drives consumer right assortments in the right depth. We are elevating the presentations at point of sale, and that drives profitable growth for Nike and for our partners.\nAnd again, we're seeing some really good successes of that in North America. EMEA is coming and APLA. So again, I'm excited about the team and the way we are elevating the entire marketplace. And again, in terms of Nike Direct digital commerce, Matt, do you want to hit on anything?\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE\n\nSure. I referenced and have been referencing for a couple of quarters now that we expected the organic traffic to be down double digits. And that's primarily because of the actions that we've taken to reposition the business in fiscal year 2026. We highlighted this quarter that we've made progress across all of our geographies. We've reduced promo days. We've improved the markdown rates. We've reduced the classic share of business. We've reduced the launch share of business. And we've pulled back on paid media as it was largely driving bottom-of-funnel traffic to our platforms.\nEMEA and North America started first, Brooke, and they're the furthest ahead. APLA is making progress, and Elliott and I both referenced that Greater China marketplace is structurally different. So the dynamics there are different from a digital perspective. I think that the progress that we're making is real. And I think one of the ways that you can measure that progress is looking at the momentum we're actually building with our wholesale partners because we needed to reposition digital alongside our partners and stop competing with our partners in order to be able to start building momentum on wholesale. And we're starting to see the early indicators and the early signals of that success alongside a strong product pipeline. So it's going to take us more time, as we both highlighted.\nWe don't expect direct to return to growth in this fiscal year, but we do believe that direct should be a healthy part of our business in the future, and it should be a more profitable part of our business in the future as we reposition it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nSenior Retail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could focus on China for a minute. Can you talk about the strategies that you're using to turn the digital business and then also the cost and timeline of the store refresh?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYes. Lorraine, thanks for the question. Let me start maybe a little bit bigger picture on China really quickly. We believe in the long-term opportunity in China. I said it in my prepared remarks. It starts with us leading with sport.\nWe see that sport continues to grow, as a tailwind in that country, and we think it'll unlock further growth. We were just there, Matt and I, and the leadership team, and we left with an even stronger belief in the future of the market. We're confident that the Win-Now Actions that we're putting in place will help us return the market over time back to growth. But as Matt said, this year, we've got some work to do. You've already touched on it. There are structural differences in the marketplace, and that's why really China's on a different timeline. But here's how we think about winning in that marketplace. When we lead with sport and starting with innovative product, running, training, basketball, especially outdoor basketball and football, and when we supplement that assortment with our Geo Express Lane, which is our local-for-local product, we are seeing good results there.\nWhen we tell better stories, not only utilizing our global assets, but our local athletes, that also is paying dividends. We're elevating the overall marketplace. As you pointed out, the digital marketplace is promotional, those big consumer moments, 11/11, etc. We're working to find the right path forward for our digital business. The physical marketplace is a model brand. We're testing and resetting new consumer concepts, but we've got to be stronger operationally in those physical doors with the right assortments, the right depth, stronger presentation, and service. That's how we're going to get back to driving sell-through. Again, as I touched on, when we do it right, it does resonate. We had some really good successes in running this quarter and then some basketball successes around Jordan LeBron.\nSo overall, we're definitely in a bit of a turnaround, but Matt and I have been actively involved in some of those turnarounds before. Our teams are focused, moving with urgency. They're taking the right actions to clean up the marketplace, elevating overall NIKE brand and digital. We've got quarter-by-quarter plans in place to elevate the overall integrated marketplace.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE\n\nOn cost and timeline, Lorraine, I would just say that we've made some significant investments in the China marketplace over the last three quarters in order to clean up inventory and set the business up for a foundation of success. When I look at our inventory being down, NIKE's inventory being down 11% versus the prior year, I think we're seeing the fruit of that, and we feel good about where marketplace inventory levels are as well.\nThe challenge is what Elliott highlighted, which is that while we can invest to keep the marketplace clean and healthy, it's an expensive operating model if sell-throughs don't improve to the levels that we need to see on a season-in and season-out basis. So all of the actions that Elliott referenced are really our focus on trying to improve sell-through to create brand distinction in that marketplace, which will result in or should result in greater profitability. But in the near term, we think it's going to take time. So that's why we believe that China will continue to be a headwind on the top line and on margin for the balance of fiscal year 2026. Last quarter, we referenced a few pilots that we were working on and that our teams were working on.\nAnd we had a chance to see them when we were in China a few weeks ago. We're actually encouraged by the progress that the teams are making on these initial store pilots, but there's a little bit more work that needs to be done because while they're outperforming the broader fleet, we'd like to see them do a little better before we start to scale with our partners. And we've got great relationships with our partners in that marketplace. And so we're confident that once we get these pilots performing the way that we want to, both we and our partners are prepared to invest to turn the business in the direction that we want to head.\nThe next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and congrats on the momentum with the turnaround.Matt, inventory down 2% on the balance sheet, which I think would imply units down even further. How would you characterize inventory in the wholesale channel and the timing of when wholesale discounts, which I think have been a pretty sizeable headwind on gross margin, when will they begin to fade?\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer, NIKE",
    "content2": "John, I'd say that we feel really good about where we landed on inventory this quarter. Units were down in North America, EMEA, and in Greater China. We did see an increase in units in APLA, and that's the area where we're going to focus. But we're pleased with the progress that we've made and the actions that we put into place to exit Q2 and enter the second half in a healthy position.\nI think that we would expect, or we do expect, that we should start to see some gross margin benefit in the second half from lapping these aggressive actions. We are expecting to see improvement within the wholesale channel. I think our partner's inventory we feel really good about. And what I keep saying is that the best indicator of that is the forward-looking order book because our partners and we have a plan together as we've been driving sell-through, as we've been investing to move through inventory and get ourselves to a healthy place.\nAnd that's ultimately so that we can create capacity in our partners open to buy for the newness and the innovation and the things that our teams are most excited about, particularly on the performance side of the business, but also some new things that we've got coming on the sportswear side, like the Ava Rover and some of the other products that we've started to see some momentum with there. So I think overall, we feel really good about the progress that we're making there. I'll remind you that there are some other headwinds to gross margin in the second half that are going to mute this, and I referenced those earlier on the call. But as it relates specifically to the way that we're managing the marketplace, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on the plan that we set.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nOkay, How about if I just close it out really quickly with just some comments? We are more confident than ever that our Win-Now Actions are the right path forward. In Q1, we saw progress in the areas that we prioritized first, running, North America, and wholesale. We're in the early stages, and our comeback will take time, and our progress won't be linear, especially in the areas such as sportswear, Nike Direct, Greater China, and Converse. We are going to accelerate the Win-Now Actions by activating our Sport Offense that I spent some time speaking to. As a reminder, we are organizing ourselves into smaller cross-functional teams by brand and by sport, by country, and by channel: wholesale and direct, digital and physical. Our teams are energized, they're inspired, and they're ready to compete.\nWe're getting back to leveraging NIKE, Inc.'s unmatched portfolio of brands, sports, and countries to drive deeper consumer connections and profitable, sustainable growth. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."

For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, NIKE\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2025 Q4 Results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO Elliott Hill; and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.\nWe will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thank you for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO Elliott Hill.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello, everyone. I'll kick it off with a reflection on Faith Kipyegon's attempt to run the mile in under four minutes today, called Breaking 4. While she crossed the line at a personal best of 4:06, today's attempt will always represent more than the pursuit of a specific singular time. We're super proud of Faith, our teams, and everyone who supported her, and we were all inspired by her effort. The Breaking 4 journey will live on as a symbol of courage and ambition. You have to dare to try, and I deeply admire the monumental effort. What it showed is that no other brand offers athletes the depth of expertise that we can. No other brand dreams as big as we can. And more than anything, no other brand inspires 8 billion potential athletes to believe.\nFaith's historic attempt comes at a unique moment for NIKE and our consumers as the sportswear industry continues to operate under geopolitical volatility and tariff uncertainty. Specifically to our business, the results we're reporting today in Q4 and in FY2025 are not up to the NIKE standard. But as we said 90 days ago, the work we're doing to reposition the business through our Win Now actions is having an impact. From here, we expect our business results to improve. It's time to turn the page. Just look at the pace of change we've embraced and the progress we've made over the last eight months.\nIt all started on 14 October, my first day back at NIKE, with an all-employee meeting and a declaration to our teammates that we are a sport and a growth company and that we will put the athlete at the center of everything that we do and every decision that we make. In December, we aligned our teams against the five Win Now actions: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and our ground game, with a sharp focus on five key sports, three key countries, and five key cities. We also set out to aggressively rightsize three very important franchises: Air Force 1, Dunk, and the AJ1, and to return NIKE Digital to a premium destination. With our teams executing against our actions, I flattened my leadership structure and made changes to 11 of my 15 direct reports.\nWe pulled the lever we could pull the fastest, investing heavily in big sport moments and key product launches to win back our brand voice. That energy has ignited NIKE's performance product with consumers, which is helping us to better balance our portfolio. Reclaiming our voice in sports has turned out to be the jumpstart we needed for our team culture too. I see the fight in our teams. We believe and we're competing. A sharp sport point of view and a less promotional NIKE marketplace is helping us gain the confidence of wholesale partners. I'm personally meeting with our partners to reaffirm that we're prioritizing and investing in their businesses. We're also strategically adding more points of distribution to be in the path of a wider range of consumers.\nNIKE Direct is showing early signs of being a more premium destination, especially when tied to a sport moment, a key product launch, or a NIKE-created on-the-ground activation. To accelerate our Win Now actions, the next step is to realign into dedicated cross-functional teams by sport. We're organizing into a sport offense to have deeper relationships with the athletes we serve, to gain better insights, to drive sport-specific innovation, telling inspiring stories, and differentiating ourselves in the marketplace. Instead of a men's, women's, and kids' construct, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel, and accessories for the specific athletes they serve. These sport-obsessed teams will create greater dimension and distinction for our three brands, will make us more competitive, and will accelerate our growth.\nWe'll pay it off in an integrated marketplace of our own design. We'll invest in NIKE Direct digitally and physically, and thoughtfully segment wholesale partners to serve sport-specific consumers across channels and up and down price points. Strategically, sharper marketplace segmentation in a sport offense allows us to deliver unique assortments and storytelling opportunities across different channels and partners to better serve our consumers and to help drive profitable, sustainable growth for our partners. We're already moving on a number of these fronts. To better serve wholesale partners, we're in the process of hiring retail marketing, visual merchandising, and account management teammates. And in NIKE Direct, we're getting into the rhythm of lining up against sport moments and key product launches. Two wholesale partnership examples this quarter were with DICK's through our 24/7 Training Collection and with JD through the Air Max 95.\nThe result: elevated presentations, better consumer connections, and increased sell-throughs. Earlier this month, our NIKE LA door at The Grove was home base for a highly successful global After Dark run series. Hosting thousands of women runners in LA created energy throughout the week. The day before the race, we captured our best sales day at The Grove in three years. At the conclusion of the inspiring French Open finals, NIKE Digital posted the pre, during, and post-game looks of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner with a 30% bump in day-to-day sell-through. Consumer right, sport-led assortments, in-the-moment storytelling, and elevated presentations in a segmented and differentiated marketplace, these are some of the many ways we will compete: brand by brand, sport by sport, geo by geo. The truth is, we're in a fight in every sport we're in, and each sport has different competitors.\nAs we begin to align our iconic brands by sport, we'll have a closer line of sight so we can develop targeted plans to match up against each one of them. We're approaching every opportunity with an athlete mindset, passion, commitment, and determination. Our teams are also making strong progress in expanding our distribution with strategic partners. I'll focus briefly on North America, who in this quarter led a Gen Z-targeted experience with Urban Outfitters, becoming the number one brand in select doors on the opening weekend. We entered over 200 women's-led doors, including boutiques like Aritzia. We hosted 30 running specialty accounts from around the world at the NIKE campus for a four-day immersion in our upcoming running innovations. We leveraged two of our iconic brands, NIKE and Jordan, to create meaningful product activation with key city specialty partners along the I-95 corridor.\nFinally, we announced a new partnership with Amazon. This fall, they'll carry a select assortment of footwear, apparel, and accessories, and NIKE will have a featured brand store on the platform focused on running, training, basketball, and sportswear. The NIKE integrated marketplace is beginning to take shape. Along with the NIKE Direct, these partners will play an important role in serving a wider range of consumers. This is NIKE at its best, leveraging our portfolio of brands and sport-led product offerings across multiple channels and up and down price points. Q4 was also filled with a number of sport moments for NIKE, Jordan, and Converse. All three brands showed up with louder brand statements to leverage the emotion of epic storylines.\nAt the Golf Majors with Rory and Scottie, with A'ja to kick off a new WNBA season, at the Champions League final with PSG and Inter Milan, with Shai for both his MVP and the Thunder's NBA Championship, and at Roland-Garros with Alcaraz and Sinner. All of that is in 90 days. It's a reminder of the strength of NIKE's athlete relationship and our brand's far-reaching influence across all sports. Shifting to our product portfolio, we made progress this quarter in rebalancing sportswear and performance. We're getting back to executing our formula more consistently to create innovative and coveted product, accelerate demand through emotional storytelling, and then scale at an unmatched level to meet the growing demand in the marketplace. Take NIKE Running as an example, which grew high single digits overall for the quarter.\nThe energy was led by Vomero 18, which in just over 90 days has already become a $100 million+ franchise with strong sell-through. In basketball, our women's business expanded more than 50% this fiscal year, proving that product demand is catching up to the spike in energy surrounding the women's game. The biggest basketball headline this quarter was the retail release of A'ja Wilson's signature collection and her first shoe, the A'One. It showed how effective we are when we line everything up for a thoughtful journey closely planned with the athlete. The first launch sold out in three minutes on NIKE Digital in North America and will double the amount of A'ja pairs in coming seasons.\nIn sportswear, the look of running footwear saw continued strength through products like P-6000, Vomero 5, and Shox, and we're reintroducing the Air Max 95 to a new generation of consumers through a more thoughtful seeding journey of high-energy driving models through different channels, account by account, and through early adopters like athletes and creative partners in our key cities. While we have a ways to go to return to a truly diversified sportswear lineup at scale, I'm pleased with the progress the team is making. I'll close by saying a few words on fiscal 2026. As we put the Sport Offense in place, we're building a full pipeline of innovative product and driving momentum in the marketplace. I see a clear path to recovery ahead.\nA strong signal of our progress is the momentum we're seeing in NIKE performance product, which we expect to continue throughout fiscal year 2026. In running, our 9-box footwear lineup will continue to deliver new innovation. We'll approach basketball through multiple dimensions, and we'll build on apparel opportunities in training, golf, and tennis that span the spectrum of sport and style. In global football, the stage is set for an intense World Cup battle. We're prepared with an upgrade of all three football boot silos in a 12-month window. Our kits look phenomenal and will debut an exciting apparel innovation that'll scale across multiple sports. The early feedback to the product pipeline from our wholesale partners at our engagements meetings has been positive. For example, our order book is improving sequentially with our holiday orders up.\nWe're finding a better balance with our portfolio of sport performance and new dimensions of sportswear expected to offset the declines in our classic franchise with wholesale partners. As I step back and look at the overall progress against our Win Now Actions by geography, momentum and confidence are building in North America and EMEA. APLA's progress varies by individual country. In China, it will take longer due to the unique characteristics of the marketplace. We've been operating in China for over four decades, and our teams know what is required to return to growth. We're executing our plans and trending in the right direction, but a full recovery will take time. I believe we have everything we need to win, and we are ready for the new fiscal year.\nWe're laser-focused on what we can control, inspiring, and innovating for the eight billion consumers we have the privilege to serve. We know what it'll take to set off the next wave of growth for NIKE. From here, it's on us to get back to executing at the level we expect. Like Faith Kipyegon, our entire team is ready to run towards something bigger and is committed to writing the next great chapter for our beloved company. From here, I'll pass it to Matt.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nThanks, Elliott, and hello to everyone on the call. In fiscal 2025, we reclaimed our identity through sport and implemented the Win Now actions to reposition our brands and business for future growth. While in line with our expectations, we are not pleased with our financial performance.\nHowever, as I said last quarter, the Q4 reflected the largest financial impact from our Win Now actions. We expect the headwinds to revenue and gross margin to begin to moderate from here. Today, I will review our financial results, highlighting progress made against our Win Now actions. Then, I will explain our approach to the newly issued tariffs. Last, I will provide guidance for the Q1 of fiscal 2026, as well as additional insight for how we expect Win Now to shape our financial performance over the next fiscal year. I'll begin with our financial results. For the Q4, revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and down 11% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct was down 14%, with NIKE Digital declining 26% and NIKE stores increasing 2%. Wholesale was down 9%.\nGross margins declined 440 basis points to 40.3% on a reported basis due to higher wholesale discounts, higher discounts in our NIKE factory stores, supply chain cost deleverage, and channel mix headwinds. SG&A was up 1% on a reported basis. This was driven by increased investment in demand creation, up 15%, partially offset by a 3% decline in operating overhead. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% compared to 13.1% for the same period last year, due primarily to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation and one-time items. Earnings per share was $0.14. For the full year, revenue was down 10% on a reported basis and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Diluted earnings per share was $2.16. Inventory was flat versus the prior year and down 1% versus the prior quarter. Inventory remains elevated, but we are making progress.\nWe closed the year in line with our plans and remain on track to exit the first half of fiscal 2026 in a healthy and clean position. Now, let me go deeper into our performance over the last 90 days. As I shared last quarter, our geographies are at different stages of progress against our Win Now actions. As a result, business recovery is trending on different timelines. Today, I will focus my geography remarks on the specific context and insights of our Win Now progress. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 11%. NIKE Direct declined 14%, with NIKE Digital down 25% and NIKE stores up 3%. Wholesale declined 8%. EBIT declined 29% on a reported basis. North America made meaningful progress cleaning up the marketplace and repositioning NIKE Digital as a full-price model. Momentum is building in wholesale with newness in the product portfolio.\nSportswear declined in the quarter, driven by a near 40% reduction in our classic footwear franchises. Performance also declined. However, we saw strong sell-through for new products offered in running and training. North America inventory actions continued with higher sales-related returns and higher discounts to liquidate aged inventory. Inventory dollars and units increased due partially to investment to support new distribution, unfavorable shipment timing, and new tariffs. On Digital, we saw a meaningful improvement in markdown rates, as well as a higher share of demand at full price in the quarter. In EMEA, Q4 revenue declined 10%. NIKE Direct declined 19%, with NIKE Digital down 36% and NIKE stores up 5%. Wholesale declined 4%. EBIT declined 41% on a reported basis. EMEA is furthest along in cleaning up the marketplace and repositioning NIKE Digital within an integrated marketplace.\nThe team has demonstrated progress by delivering growth in key dimensions, key performance dimensions of our portfolio, and diversifying sportswear with new product journeys. In Q4, running and training delivered growth, offset by declines in our sportswear business. Within sportswear, we have taken meaningful steps forward to diversify our portfolio. In fact, sportswear grew overall in wholesale in Q4, and women's sportswear footwear returned to growth in the quarter.\nAs it relates to inventory in EMEA, we ended the quarter slightly ahead of our target, with inventory dollars flat and units down mid-single digits versus the prior year. NIKE Digital also delivered improvements in markdown rates, as well as a double-digit increase in the share of demand at full price. In Greater China, Q4 revenue declined 20%, largely in line with our plan. NIKE Direct declined 15%, with NIKE Digital down 31% and NIKE stores down 6%. Wholesale declined 24%.\nEBIT declined 45% on a reported basis. Greater China executed a deeper reset of inventory relative to our other geographies, with higher sales-related reserves, higher discounts, and supply reductions. Traffic remains challenged, and our priority is to refresh local monobrand store concepts and elevate brand presentation through sport. On product, we saw bright spots this quarter when we launched sport-led innovation like Vomero 18 or utilized our geography express lane to tell hyperlocal stories. Consumers continue to have strong reaction to brand activations in the marketplace.\nRunning returned to growth in the quarter, offset by declines in sportswear and Jordan. Inventory was down 11% versus the prior year, driven by aggressive actions to clean and reset the marketplace. Digital remains highly promotional across the marketplace, and we have taken initial steps to reposition our own platform with plans to extend our efforts to the broader ecosystem in fiscal 2026.\nOur priority in Greater China is to refresh the monobrand marketplace, creating greater brand distinction through sport-led consumer concepts and full-price growth. We have launched a pilot across select doors. However, our actions to energize and reset this marketplace will take time. In APLA, Q4 revenue declined 3%. NIKE Direct declined 1%, with NIKE Digital down 6% and NIKE stores up 4%. Wholesale declined 5%. EBIT declined 33% on a reported basis. APLA delivered mixed results across countries, with further work required to clean up inventory. The team has also taken initial steps to reposition NIKE Digital. In the Q4, our performance business returned to growth, driven by running and training. This momentum was more than offset by declines in sportswear and Jordan. Our teams took aggressive actions to clean up the marketplace and further tighten the buys on NIKE Digital. However, inventory remains elevated. Okay.\nLet me spend a few minutes talking through our approach to the newly issued tariffs. Over the past 50 years, NIKE has built a globally expansive supply chain that is responsive and resilient. We have strong relationships with our factory partners, and our leadership team is experienced in managing through disruption. NIKE has consistently been a top payer of US duties, with an average duty rate on footwear imported into the United States in the mid-teens range. Therefore, these tariffs represent a new and meaningful cost headwind, and we are taking actions that balance the consumer, our partners, our Win Now actions, as well as the long-term positioning of our brands in the marketplace. First, we will optimize our sourcing mix and allocate production differently across countries to mitigate the new cost headwind into the United States.\nDespite the current elevated tariffs for Chinese products imported into the United States, manufacturing capacity and capability in China remains important to our global source base. Currently, China represents roughly 16% of the footwear we import into the United States, and we expect this to reduce to the high single-digit range by the end of fiscal 2026, with supply from China reallocated to other countries around the world. Second, we are partnering with our suppliers and our retail partners to mitigate this structural cost increase in order to minimize the overall impact to the consumer. These partner arrangements will come into effect at different times throughout fiscal 2026. Third, as part of our regular approach to seasonal planning, we have implemented a surgical price increase in the United States, with phased implementation beginning in fall 2025. And last, we will evaluate corporate cost reduction as appropriate.\nHowever, our highest priority right now continues to be reigniting brand momentum through sport and stabilizing our business. With the new tariff rates in place today, we estimate a gross incremental cost increase to NIKE of approximately $1 billion. We intend to fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time as we implement and annualize the actions I've outlined. For fiscal 2026, we expect the financial impact net of the actions described earlier to be approximately 75 basis points to gross margin, with a greater impact in the first half. We will continue to monitor developments closely, and I am confident in our ability to lean on our strengths, our experience, and our scale to navigate through this disruption. Looking forward, we intend to continue to provide specific quarterly guidance during this period of transition.\nToday, I will also share some additional insights for how we expect our Win Now actions to shape elements of our financial performance throughout fiscal 2026. Momentum is building in our new product franchises. With the holiday order book in hand, we are beginning to see more clearly around the corner of our product portfolio transition. In fiscal 2025, we made significant progress managing down our classic footwear franchises, with year-over-year declines of more than 20%. In Q4, these declines accelerated to more than 30%, representing almost a $1 billion headwind to revenue. We also finished Q4 down approximately 10 points from the peak as a percent of our total footwear mix. We expect these headwinds to continue through first half 2026, with signals that the Air Force 1 is stabilizing while we plan for larger reductions for the Dunk.\nWe remain on track for a healthy and clean market by the end of the first half of fiscal 2026. Over the next two quarters, NIKE will continue liquidating excess inventory through our value stores and select value partners. In the second half, we then expect to see a modest headwind to revenue as we lap aggressive clearance activity in the prior year. We continue to expect digital traffic to be down double digits in fiscal 2026 as we reposition NIKE Digital as a full-price model and reduce the mix of our classic footwear franchises. At the same time, we see encouraging signals of progress in the marketplace with our wholesale partners. As Elliott said, our holiday order book is up versus the prior year, with growth in North America, EMEA, and APLA partially offset by Greater China. We expect SG&A to grow low single digits in fiscal 2026.\nWe are investing to reignite growth in the business, particularly demand creation and sports and commercial offense. At the same time, we recognize that SG&A has deleveraged relative to historical levels. We are focused on sales growth, with improving gross margins and disciplined expense management over time. We have moderated our share repurchases in the near term due to a more dynamic and uncertain environment, as well as the impact of the Win Now actions on our financial results. We have a strong balance sheet, and it remains a competitive advantage for our business. Overall, we are pleased with the progress our teams are making against our Win Now actions. As I said last quarter, these are the building blocks for NIKE to return to sustainable, profitable growth. Last, I'll finish with our Q1 guidance.\nWe will continue navigating through several factors that create uncertainty in this operating environment, including for the consumer. And so our outlook reflects our best assessment of these factors based on the data we have available today. We expect Q1 revenues to be down mid-single digits. We expect Q1 gross margins to be down approximately 350 to 425 basis points. This includes approximately 100 basis points negative impact due to the new tariffs based on the rates that are in place today. We expect Q1 SG&A dollars to be up low single digits. We expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to be $0 to 10 million in the Q1. And we expect the tax rate for the full year to be 19% to 20%, due primarily to anticipated changes in earnings mix. With that, I'll pass it back to Elliott.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nBefore taking questions, I want to share some final thoughts on another historic sports moment this past quarter: Rory McIlroy's Masters win. I was lucky enough to be at Augusta earlier that week, and I couldn't help but relate Rory's experience to NIKE's recent journey. To me, his final round performance was a masterclass on the power of the athlete mindset. And I've been asking my NIKE teammates to hold on to some of the lessons he taught us. For those of you that don't know, Rory has been chasing a Masters victory for 14 years. It would complete his career grand slam, the Holy Grail of golf, something only five others have ever accomplished. He was also battling a decade-long drought of winning a major. He's had his share of close calls, heartbreaks, and more than enough doubters. Sunday's final round at Augusta was no different.\nWhat made it so fun to watch was how aggressive Rory was playing. He was taking the shots that others wouldn't, putting the pressure on the rest of the field. But one time he did play it safe; he laid it up on the 13th and rolled it into Rae's Creek for a double bogey. Lesson learned. He played better when he was attacking. Despite another up-and-down round, the win was still in his grasp. All he needed to do was sink a five-foot putt on the 18th. He stepped up and missed wide left. He was heading to a playoff. His caddie, Harry Diamond, his lifelong friend, and biggest supporter, knew just what to say. You would have given your right arm to be in the playoff at the start of the week. And that was it. The mindset shift Rory needed. He didn't have to play a playoff.\nHe got to play a playoff. It was his for the taking. An amazing reminder for NIKE that no matter the situation we face, we're the leader in an exciting industry. It's a privilege to get to compete every day. With all of our advantages we have, we're in control of our own destiny here. Rory went back to the 18th, stuck his second shot four feet from the pen. This time, he sank the putt. Dead center. Rory finally had his green jacket and his career grand slam. We were all treated to one of the most memorable Sundays in golf for over a decade. His patience was tested, but he stayed the course. Whether it was Rory, Alcaraz, Shea, or Faith these past 90 days, we worked alongside some of the most mentally tough human beings on the planet.\nLately, I've been talking a lot about the athlete mindset. That special ability to keep believing, to keep competing. I'm asking my teammates at NIKE to do just that. To show up with passion, commitment, and determination, and to compete every day. I think we're on our way. We're ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, press star, then one on your telephone keypad. We kindly ask that you please limit your initial question to one. Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks. So Elliott, could you maybe elaborate on the accelerated actions under your Sport Offense realignment and maybe speak to the phasing of innovation into the back half of the year in FY2026? And then Matt, if you could just speak to the cadence of revenues this year or puts and takes to consider in terms of items impacting the Q1 revenues relative to the back half of the year?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nI'll take the first part of this around product, and what I will say. We will lead with a sharp focus on Sport. That's why we're moving to the sport offense. But before I dive deeply on product, I just want to make certain that we hit on the unmatched portfolio that we have with depth and dimension: three brands, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse. And what we're doing, Matthew, is we're organizing into sport-obsessed teams through our sport offense, which will drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands: performance, sportswear, men's, women's, kids, footwear, apparel, accessories, and up-and-down price points.\nWe will differentiate each brand by sport and create a moat which we believe will create sharper distinction and dimension. We do know, Matthew, when we focus on sport, we win. The best example that we have right now from a product perspective is our running, which is up high single digits. We have innovative and coveted products across our 9-box matrix that we've been talking a lot about: three silos, Pegasus, Vomero, Structure, times three price points. We also have trail and race. In terms of performance, Peg Premium, Vomero 18, our Swift and Stride apparel. They're all selling well at retail, and we're getting positive feedback from our partners. I mentioned it in my script that the Vomero has already become a $100 million-business with growth in all geos.\nAnd so in addition to what I just touched on, we have Vomero Plus and Vomero Premium coming, which both those shoes are beautiful shoes and incredibly innovative and distinctive. So best example is running, continuing on in our focused sports. Training would be next in line with momentum and sell-through in Metcon, and 24/7 apparel collection. In basketball, we've got signature athletes, Shai for Converse. I'm sure you guys saw Shai at the NBA finals with his gold shoe around his neck. Adding dimension to the men's or to NIKE basketball with Sabrina and A'ja, Tatum and Luka in Jordan. Best example in terms of performance this quarter was AJ1, and I hit that in the prepared remarks. Lined up beautiful product, storytelling, and it sold through at retail. Global football.\nTwo weeks ago, we had a summit with over 200 of our partners from around the world to share with them our World Cup offering. We have exciting innovation coming to the game across our three football silos: Mercurial, Tiempo, and Phantom. We have some really interesting innovation coming in our national team kits that we'll be able to leverage across other sports as we move forward. So feeling really good with our sport performance and with each season, it continues to get stronger. As it relates to sportswear, we continue, as you heard throughout the prepared remarks, the rightsize the Air Force 1, the AJ1, and the Dunk. But we do know that we've got to have a portfolio that extends beyond those large franchises in sportswear. We've got an Air. We will continue to leverage Air because it's a proprietary technology that we have.\nAir Max Muse for women and Air Max 95 are really good examples this quarter. And then we see those continuing throughout FY2026. Look at running, Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox doing well. And we will take the consumer somewhere new in 2026 with the Ava Rover and family. So in the end, it's going to take time to flow into the market, but we're confident in the product pipeline. It's getting stronger with each season.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nAnd Matt, I would just add that as Elliott said, we're pleased with the progress we're making on the Win Now actions. In the Q4 reflected the largest financial impact of our Win Now actions. And so our guidance for Q1 and revenue down mid-single digits; it's really reflective of a continuation of some of the trends that we see in Q4, such as the classics, our classic footwear franchises.\nWe expect to continue to see headwinds from the franchise management actions that we're taking there. We expect to continue to be liquidating excess inventory through our factory stores and through some value partners on the wholesale side. We expect digital traffic to be down as we spend less money on performance media and also manage our classic franchises. That's being offset in the Q1 by what I highlighted last quarter, which was our fall order book. We said last quarter that our fall order book almost offset the declines that we were managing in our classic footwear franchises. Now, with our holiday order book being up with North America, EMEA, and APLA only partially being offset by Greater China, and newness across performance and sportswear that Elliott just referenced offsetting our classic franchises, we're seeing improvement in the revenue trend.\nAs we look to the back half, I highlighted that we expect that the franchise management headwinds will heavily be focused on the first half, but we do expect our actions on the Dunk to continue throughout the full year. We expect Digital to continue to be a headwind for the full year as we reposition the channel. I highlighted that we expect a modest headwind to revenue as we lap aggressive clearance activity in the second half of the prior year. But we do expect to see continued momentum building with our wholesale partners. Momentum with our wholesale partners is indicative of us cleaning the channel and confidence in our product portfolio. It's two important elements of the building blocks of us returning to growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Good afternoon.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you for taking my questions. So I'm just going to put two questions together, if I could. They're actually relatively short. I mean, first off, with respect to the continued sort of, say, cleanup of the marketplace that you're telegraphing now through the first half of fiscal 2026, the question I have is, is that consistent with your prior plans, or have you found something new as you've continued to work on the business? Then the second question I have, with regard to tariffs, the way that you described it is to be an impact here in Q1, but then over time, you'll be able to mitigate that, I think it was $1 billion you said. Is that simply saying that it takes time for these mitigation efforts to take hold? Is that why we're expecting the Q1 impact? Thanks.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Brian. As it relates to inventory, we remain on track. No change relative to what we communicated 90 days ago. We remain on track for a healthy and clean marketplace by the end of first half of 2026. As I highlighted, North America and EMEA have made more progress. We've made significant progress managing down our classic footwear franchises, as I highlighted. So all I'm trying to say is that we will continue to be liquidating that extra inventory, but it's consistent with the plan that we had before. The quality of the inventory in the marketplace has improved relative to where we were 90 days ago.\nJust to reiterate something I said to Matt, the fact that our holiday order book is up, I think in wholesale also shows that the channel is getting clean, and our partners are investing behind the newness that we're bringing into the market. As far as your second question goes on tariffs, yeah, I think you summarized it well. Larger impact in Q1, primarily because as I laid out the four different actions that we're going to take to offset the $1 billion headwind, we're implementing those at different points in time throughout the fiscal year based on taking into consideration the consumer, the back-to-school holiday season, and the conversations we're having with both our suppliers and our retail partners.\nSo we're confident in our ability to fully mitigate these over time as these actions that we're talking about are fully implemented and annualized. But just within the confines of the fiscal year, it'll be a 75 basis point impact on our gross margin.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus on gross margin for a minute. Are you expecting the pressures to abate sequentially as the year progresses? And can you talk about the back half if there's an opportunity to return the gross margins to growth?\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Lorraine, taking all of the comments that we've made into consideration, we do expect our margins to remain under pressure in the first half of 2026 as we finish executing our Win Now actions. We expect that our first half to be impacted from the strategic actions we've outlined, but also the timing of the tariff implementation relative to the actions that we're implementing.\nBut we do expect that to moderate in the second half of the fiscal year. When I think about our 2026 margins, I sort of step back and think of three dynamics that we have. One, we've got short-term product and channel mix headwinds that we're going to navigate through the year as we manage our product portfolio and shift our marketplace portfolio towards our wholesale partners. We've got the transitory impact of the Win Now actions, which are largely impacting the first half of fiscal 2026. And then we've got the newly implemented tariffs. And I said that's a 75 basis point impact on the year. It's a 100 basis point impact in the Q1. And we expect to see those headwinds begin to moderate from there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Komp\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I want to follow up. There's obviously too many dynamics to think about guiding past Q1. But just given that wholesale is the largest driver of your business today and you are seeing the inflection in order growth, are there any scenarios where you could get back to total growth at any point in this year? Just trying to get a sense of how you're looking out on the horizon here.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nI'll take that, Jonathan. Let me start with what I would start with is I've been here now eight months, and I'm even more convinced that the path back to sustainable, profitable growth is through our Win Now actions and now implementing our sport offense. We're seeing signals that the actions are working. Our teams are energized, inspired, and competing. The actions are resonating with our partners.\nMatt already touched on the order book and the reaction we're getting from our partners. It's with our consumers. We're having good sell-through as well. We've walked through some signals. Inventory actions are back on track. We're elevating NIKE Digital, the user experience, less promotional, etc. We're having good brand impact during sport moments and product launches. The product pipeline, which I already hit on, we're feeling good about that. It gets better with each season. We're having improvement in our order book. Overall, what I would tell you is that each geo is in a bit different stage of executing those actions. North America and EMEA began executing them the earliest, and they are demonstrating the clearest progress. Matt hit on some of those financials. We're making good progress in APLA. It does, Jonathan, vary a little bit by country.\nThen in Greater China, we're still cleaning up the marketplace with the nuance of it being a monobrand marketplace. But we continue to work closely with the team to drive progress there. So we're seeing momentum. Matt's already hit it. In our holiday order book is up. And right now, just because of everything that's going on, we're going to take it 90 days at a time because we believe full recovery will take time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nManaging Director and Consumer Discretionary Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. It's nice to see the progress at wholesale. Elliott, I guess I'm going to start on that topic. Can you talk about the marketplace at a high level, kind of where DKS, Foot Locker, and JD kind of sit in that specialty retail, and then the segmentation with the newly added Amazon expansion of distribution? And then Matt, along the same lines, when did you start shipping or recognizing wholesale revenue? I know you're going to be on board there in late July. So just wondering how that revenue is, that part of the revenue wholesale order book being kind of having more visibility as we go into the back half of the addition of Amazon? Thank you very much.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nOkay. Adrian, our biggest competitive advantage is our ability to elevate and grow an entire marketplace. And again, we are challenging our teams to make certain that we're serving consumers wherever and however they choose to shop for our brands. I will say this. We do have an unbeatable footprint, 40,000 points of distribution, nearly 190 countries, digital, physical, wholesale, and direct.\nWhat we are doing, we are making certain we are moving across multiple channels, our own NIKE Direct channels, specialty, sporting goods, athletic specialty, department store, family footwear. As you know, each one of those channels and the partners that sit in each of those channels, they all serve different consumers. And so we, with this new flow of innovative product, we're segmenting and we're differentiating the marketplace. When we do that across wholesale partners to serve different consumers, that's how we drive growth and profitability. And again, it does start with our own NIKE Direct and elevating that, making it less promotional. But we are working closely with our partners across the entire marketplace, our three-year growth plans, translating that into annual plans and quarterly plans. And we continue to invest in elevating the presentation of our assortment.\nI'm feeling good about how the teams now are embracing, looking across the entire marketplace to serve different consumers at different points of distribution. In terms of Amazon, they serve a very focused consumer. We're using them as part of and partnering with them as part of to grow the overall integrated marketplace. We're excited about the partnership. You heard it in my script. We're working on the right assortments that will go in there. We'll have a featured brand store on the platform. We'll be offering footwear, apparel, and accessories through running, training, basketball, and sportswear.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nI would just add, Adrian, that as Elliott said, as we're serving consumers across the number of the examples that he gave in terms of how we've expanded distribution, we typically start small. We will go live on Amazon in Q1, but it's not a material needle mover.\nWhat I would say is that wholesale overall and the commentary around our order book, I think, is an important leading indicator of the progress our teams are making to transition our product portfolio and also get our business back to growth. There's obviously going to be some non-comp items, like I've highlighted the liquidation in the first half, the work we're doing in order to continue to work through our classic footwear franchises. But wholesale and the progress that we're making in wholesale, I think, is a strong indicator of the progress we're making in our Win Now actions.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Matt, you just talked about a modest headwind to the second half of 2026 revenues as you'll have promotions. Can you just talk about maybe what modest means and talk about the trade-off between boosting gross margin as you get back to full-price selling left those promotions versus what it means for unit volumes as you try to run a more full-price business? Thank you.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSure, Jay. What I was specifically referring to there is we started our Win Now actions as Elliott came back eight months ago. We highlighted them on our Q2 call. It set us on an accelerated path to change the trajectory that the company is on. One of the things that that required us to do was to move quickly to shift our product portfolio and address some of the aged inventory that was sitting in the marketplace.\nAnd so we started to move more aggressively with that through sales-related returns, through more discounts to our retail partners so that they could mark down that inventory and move it through, and as well as selling off-price product to our value partners. When we get into the second half of fiscal 2026, we expect to be in a clean marketplace, a healthy marketplace. And so that business in the second half will be more full-price. It will be more profitable. But there will be a revenue headwind from the compare to the higher level of off-price liquidation in the prior year.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. Elliott, I'm curious on your thoughts on the China marketplace and the opportunity to drive full recovery there over time. Understand that there's some unique characteristics of the marketplace that are making it a little bit more difficult to clean it up as quickly as the other geos. Can you talk about the timeline and the cadence of what we should see over the course of the next fiscal year as you look to return that to growth? And how are you thinking about the competitive and operating environment for the brand there today? Thank you.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThanks, Brooke. Let me start with making certain that you hear this, that we do believe in a long-term opportunity in China. There are some structural tailwinds which will continue to unlock further opportunity. And I think our biggest opportunity is from a brand perspective to inspire and invite the 1.3 billion consumers into the world of sport, the lifestyle of sport, and to fitness. That said, we're not happy with where we are.\nMatt went through the results. They are in line with what we planned. I want to make sure you guys hear that as well. We're confident in the Win Now actions. But as you've already pointed out, Brooke, China is on a bit of a different timeline. And part of it is because of the structural differences in the marketplace. It's monobrand. The good news is we've been operating in China for more than 40 years. We have deep relationships there. Matt and I have both been involved in turnarounds in China, and we're working closely with the team there. The team's focused on taking the right actions to clean up the marketplace, similar to what you've already seen in North America and EMEA, and now is taking place in APLA, cleaning up the big three, elevating Digital.\nThe key here is we're investing and testing some new retail concepts. At the same time, we are resetting some of our consumer-led concepts and existing doors. But we have work to do. The key to winning, and I am confident in saying, the key to winning is that we need to connect locally. We've got to elevate the consumer-led product concepts. Performance running, we touched on, is working there. But we also have some China-specific product through outdoor basketball, the S.T. Flare. And then we're leveraging our Geo Express Lane to create China-specific product. And you will see more of that from us as we move forward. And then it is getting the right consumer-led retail concepts in place. We've got a plan around renovating and upgrading throughout 2026, launching new concepts, and getting the right assortments, consumer-right assortments, and the right depth, presentation, and storytelling.\nThat's how you return to growth. You drive revenue and profits there. It's through driving productivity. And so we're doing it. The team's hustling. But here's what I'd say. The changes are going to take time. But we're focused on pulling the right levers to return to growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Perfect. Thanks so much. Maybe for Elliott or Matt, as you think about kind of once the smoke clears through this year, just structurally, is there any reason why this business should not be a double-digit margin business? Or maybe just high level, can you walk us through perhaps what's changed? And as you think about clearing these actions and those all getting behind you, if anything's really changed in the structural margin of the business longer term?\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nWell, Alex, we've consistently been a double-digit margin company over our history, regardless of the size of our business or the composition of our portfolio. So I think we believe that that is still a goal that's worthy of pursuing. I highlighted the actions that we've taken in 2026 associated with Win Now and the timing of them between the first half and the second half. We believe the Win Now actions are the right actions to reposition NIKE as a full-price brand in a healthy pool market. They're the right actions to reignite brand momentum and growth. So when I think about when I think about the longer term, our goal is to return to sustainable organic revenue growth and to see the recovery of these transitory impacts that we've been talking about as we've been repositioning the business.\nAnd with disciplined expense management, it should yield operating leverage as we return to growth. And so that's where we're focused.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nI think the only thing that I would add to it is our team's leadership team and teams around the world have embraced the Win Now actions. We believe by lining up against the sport offense, that'll further accelerate those actions. And over time, we absolutely have the ambition to get back to double-digit operating margins. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that will conclude our question and answer session and our call today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

Fiscal 2025 Q3 Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.Nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, NIKE\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike, Inc. Fiscal 2025 Q3 results. Joining us on today's call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill, and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nThese risks and uncertainties are detailed in Nike's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to Nike earnings press release or Nike website, investors.Nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by saying I'm proud of the progress we made against the key actions we committed to 90 days ago. While we met the expectations we set, we're not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better. For the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for Nike. We told inspiring athlete stories. We brought more energy to sport's biggest moments, and we introduced performance product across an integrated marketplace.\nWe delivered something new to the consumer week after week, and that's exactly the kind of sustained pace we need to strengthen our business. Last quarter, I shared my initial observations and where we need to focus. The last 90 days only reinforced my early assessment of the areas that are most important. Since our last call, I continue to meet with wholesale partners to discuss the distinct role each can play with Nike.\nI also had an incredibly inspiring trip to visit factory partners and Nike teammates in Asia to see how we're executing in our supply chain with a focus on production for our new innovation. Most importantly, I continue to spend meaningful time with our Nike teammates. We focused in two areas: strengthening our culture and committing to our top priorities.\nIn fact, right after my first call with you in December, we met with our teams and shared the five priority actions we outlined on the call with a sharp focus on five fields of play, three countries, and five cities. We call these strategic priorities Win Now. We have a clearer picture on our path forward, and despite the global economic uncertainty, I believe our priority actions will continue to drive progress. The first action is to ignite our winning culture. As I mentioned, our teams are building momentum. We're hustling and being opportunistic. The next action is shaping our brand for distinction. This is about lining up storytelling power of Nike to celebrate the passion and emotion of sport.\nIn February, I attended the Super Bowl and the NBA All-Star weekend to see firsthand the kind of impact we make when we line up all of our advantages towards one moment. Our third action is to accelerate a complete product portfolio. We're fully committed to creating a more breadth and depth season after season. While we added innovation across our five key fields of play this quarter, it's not enough to offset the continued headwinds of our classic franchises. Elevate and grow the marketplace.\nThe fourth action is a balanced approach where we're supporting wholesale partners to drive healthy growth and returning Nike Direct to a premium destination. We're in the early stages of repositioning Nike Digital, and we're restoring our sales organization and go-to-market processes. The final action, Win-on-the-Ground, is where we celebrate local athletes, make cultural connections, and support grassroots communities.\nA big reason for our running product success this quarter was the resources we put into building energy through the ground game. Of all the priority actions, we knew we could move quickest on investing in our brand. You saw that in several defining moments this quarter. I'll start with the Super Bowl in New Orleans. It was, of course. It starts with our close partnership with the NFL and our high-performance uniforms, cleats, and gloves that everyone sees on the field. Our product visibility goes well beyond four quarters.\nFrom Jalen Hurts, wearing his red and black unbannable Jordan cleats during warm-ups, to Kendrick's halftime show wearing Deion Sanders retros, and Serena Williams and SZA wearing Chuck Taylors, our three iconic brands were front and center. We, of course, also debuted So Win, our first Super Bowl ad in 27 years where we celebrated the winning mindset of the top athletes in the world. We also showed up on the ground in New Orleans to support flag football with a sharp focus on girls and a commitment to increasing their participation in the game.\nWe created pop-up retail spaces across the city with partners like Dick's, Sneaker Politics, and Hibbett, and built Nike and Jordan houses to connect with athletes, influencers, partners, and wholesale retailers. After the WIN, we followed up with strong, reactive campaigns. The Nike brand created \"It's Good to Be Green\" for the Eagles' WIN, and for Jalen's MVP, the Jordan brand aired its first Super Bowl ad in history, \"Love Hurts.\" That is how we create impact, and that is Nike being Nike.\nWe transitioned from one amazing weekend right into another for the NBA All-Star weekend in the Bay Area. Our brands, in one word, dominated. On both sides of the Bay, Nike, Jordan, and Converse owned performance and the culture of the game, connecting with young athletes and fans through unique experiences. Nike celebrated the future of basketball, hosting games with top high school prep stars.\nAt the Alameda Navy Yard, the Jordan Fam Fest celebrated the brand's biggest moments for its 40th anniversary with thousands of fans. Converse unveiled the first signature shoe for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Shai 1, designed by Shai himself as the new creative director for Converse basketball. His shoe will launch this fall. All told, Nike, Inc. lit up the marketplace on the ground. Our Nike San Francisco flagship store had its best commercial day in 10 years.\nAnd just down the street, we created energy and buzz with our wholesale partners, Foot Locker and Shoe Palace. One thing it was great to see: for the right product drops, like the Nike Black Label collection, the Kobe Protro, Jordan Retro 1s, and Jordan 4 Cements, the passion of sneaker culture is alive. I saw lines down the block all weekend.\nAn important part of our strategy moving forward will be to harness the full power of our portfolio of brands. We made significant progress in elevating the voices and distinct position of our brands at the Super Bowl and All-Star weekend. Shifting to product, we're beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on.\nBut our approach is simple: help consumers fall in love with something new from Nike, and that something is not replacing one icon for another. It's about building a supporting cast of multiple styles, some that are gaining traction with men and others with women. Segmenting and differentiating our wholesale partners across the integrated marketplace, investing in the presentation of our products at point of sale, digital, and physical, and having an intentional ground game in influential cities.\nAnd we will lead with performance, with a disciplined approach that balances product that's seeding with product that's scaling. Running was a standout field of play for the quarter, growing mid-single digits. The Pegasus 41 is continuing to drive healthy volume in all geos, and two innovations that have just begun to seed are the Pegasus Premium and the Vomero 18.\nThe Pegasus Premium is Nike bringing something totally unique to the market: a full visible Air Zoom unit that, for the first time, we sculpted to the foot so it springs back for better energy return. It's a great ride and a beautiful-looking shoe. Early seed pairs nearly sold out across the North America marketplace, and the Pegasus Premium will scale through fall 2025.\nThis quarter, we launched the Vomero 18, created for the everyday runner. We aligned the storytelling of the Vomero 18's big foam and maximum cushioning across over 1,800 doors in the integrated marketplace: RSG, sporting goods, Nike Direct. The results have been outstanding. We plan to build on the momentum and double the distribution of the Vomero 18 by mid-April, supported by a large-scale running campaign. You can expect new additions to the franchise to release in our next fiscal year.\nIn running, we're on the path to meeting our high standards of execution end-to-end. Turning to sportswear, our largest icons, Nike and Jordan streetwear, are in different states of transition. With Air Force 1, Dunk, and Air Jordan 1, it's about right-sizing, not sunsetting. Each franchise will always have a place in our stable of products. They're timeless staples with loyal fans. Our best example of healthy diversification in sportswear and footwear right now is our look of running.\nThe Vomero 5 doubled its revenue this quarter. Nike Shox has grown its revenue by over 10 times in the last three quarters. While in the seeding stage, recently released shoes like the Air Superfly and the LD-1000 are getting a lot of positive interest in the media and on social channels. Air Max, a brand in itself, is a platform that consumers expect us to reinvent.\nThis quarter, we brought fresh energy with the new Air Max Dn, which is resonating well with consumers in Japan, Korea, and women's silhouette in the Air Max Muse. Look for another new innovation platform with Air Max and FY26. Diversifying our sportswear apparel offense is equally important. We want to minimize our reliance on fleece and push the edges to build new businesses.\nThat doesn't have to fit neatly into the sportswear category either. This quarter's new 24/7 collection brings performance materials to high-style training apparel. The new impossibly soft and perfect stretch fabrics gave us the opportunity to tell a deep technical apparel story. The first month of sales in 24/7 have exceeded our expectations and we're ramping up capacity to meet the demand. We also made some noise with the announcement of a new brand this quarter, Nike SKIMS.\nTogether, we identified a consumer need in creating a new market of style-led product that sculpts and performs. Our first comprehensive collection launches next quarter in North America through both Nike and Skins direct channels, and we will scale globally over multiple seasons. The apparel space is ripe for fresh thinking, and I've asked our team to keep innovating across the spectrum of performance and style and to seek out white space in the market to complement our brands and product portfolio.\nOur responsibility is to grow the overall market, and one of the most powerful ways we do that is through a relentless flow of coveted and innovative products through our powerful brands in both performance and sportswear for men, women, and kids across footwear, apparel, and accessories and up and down price points.\nWe're moving with focus and urgency to get back into a rhythm of delivering across all dimensions. The final topic I'd like to discuss in detail is the integrated marketplace, where we create consumer-led experiences across Nike Direct or our wholesale partners, physical or digital. In the almost 190 countries in which we do business, we have over 40,000 points of distribution and a digital business with massive reach. Our footprint is an unbeatable competitive advantage.\nThat means that a lot of change is in motion because we want to be great at all touchpoints, and I'm playing an active role in this one, leveraging my years of experience and relationships in the marketplace. Here's where we're going to prioritize. First, I mentioned we're restoring our sales organization and go-to-market processes. Partnering with Nike must feel like a world-class experience.\nThat means building growth plans together, creating distinct consumer positions and consumer-right assortments, engaging way earlier in the process and asking for product feedback, delivering our assortments at the right time, right place, and at the right depth, educating their teams on new innovations, providing marketing support, and making certain their Nike presentation is premium so we capitalize on every sale opportunity. In Nike Direct, digital will feel the changes more quickly.\nWe're already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year's January and February to this year's, Nike digital in North America went from over 30 promotional days to zero. In our ecosystem, the consumer is already seeing a more elevated content and storytelling with a greater focus on our performance fields of play.\nNow that I've had the opportunity to visit our geographies, we're clear where we will focus to make an immediate impact. Through our Win Now strategic priorities, we'll start with three key countries: the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, and five key cities: New York, Los Angeles, London, Beijing, and Shanghai. We'll invest to make sure each has innovative and coveted products, a loud and proud, locally relevant brand voice, a consumer-led and balanced integrated marketplace, and passionate Nike teammates on the ground.\nEach country has unique dynamics and is in a different state of development. China, specifically, is where we're being the most proactive in cleaning up the marketplace, and we'll get back to inspiring the Chinese consumer in a more meaningful way. To close, our consumers and partners felt a different pace from Nike this quarter. We're off to a solid start.\nWhere we are making progress in our five priority actions, it's mostly through serving athletes through the lens of sport and performance. That's exactly where we want to be. The bottom line is we are looking for opportunity on all fronts. Now, it's up to us to be consistent. Some of the bigger shifts I have covered will take multiple seasons of excellent execution. Our teams are moving with focus and urgency, and are up to the challenge of writing the next great chapter for Nike. I'll pass it to Matt to provide initial thoughts on the building blocks to return to sustainable and profitable growth, and I'll be back to close out the call.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nThanks, Elliott, and hello to everyone on the call. The team is moving aggressively to reignite brand momentum through sport and stabilize our business. Our third-quarter financial results reflect the headwinds from the Win Now actions we identified for you last quarter. Today, I will review our Q3 results and provide context on the progress we have made. Then I will share additional insight for how we expect our Win Now actions to shape our business performance over the near term.\nThis quarter, revenues were down 9% on a reported basis and down 7% on a currency-neutral basis. The quarter benefited from strong holiday results in December, including a non-comp benefit from Cyber Monday, followed by double-digit declines in January and February. Nike Direct was down 10%, with Nike Digital declining 15% and Nike stores declining 2%. Wholesale was down 4%, largely due to declines in Greater China.\nGross margins declined 330 basis points to 41.5% on a reported basis due to higher markdowns on Nike Direct, higher wholesale discounts, inventory obsolescence, and product cost and channel mix headwinds. SG&A was down 8% on a reported basis, as increased investments in brand marketing and sports marketing were more than offset by declines in operating overhead.\nOur effective tax rate was 5.9% compared to 16.5% for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time tax benefit from US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses. Earnings per share was $0.54. Now, let me provide additional insight into our progress against our Win Now actions this quarter. Let's begin with our product portfolio.\nOur performance business grew in the Q3, led by improving brand and business momentum in training and running, with new product launches, strong sell-through of innovation, and a more complete offense across price points in footwear and apparel. This momentum is encouraging since these two sports represent our largest performance businesses. For Q3, this momentum was more than offset by declines in Nike sportswear and the Jordan Brand, led by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises.\nThese franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business, with a more pronounced impact on Nike Digital. Turning to our marketplace, our teams have taken the initial steps to reposition Nike Digital as a full-price business. We remained competitive and promotional in December, finishing with strong holiday results. However, in January and February, we significantly reduced days of promotion in North America and EMEA.\nThis resulted in a several percentage point improvement in demand at full price. With regards to wholesale, since Elliott has returned, we are working as closely with our partners as ever. We are creating confidence through the investments we are making in product engagement, commercial terms, and rebuilding the scale, talent, and capabilities of our sales organization.\nWithin our fall order book in North America, EMEA, and APLA, we see the declines in classic footwear franchises almost being offset by growth in performance dimensions of our portfolio, such as running, training, and basketball, as well as newness in sportswear. Now, let's talk about the health of our brands. Elliott mobilized our teams this quarter to go bigger and bolder in sports' biggest moments.\nAs a result, we supported several new product launches across all three brands and also delivered outsized brand impact with emotional storytelling in the air and on the ground in key cities, and you felt it. To support this action, demand creation expenses grew high single digits versus the prior year. Last, let's discuss inventory. Inventory declined 2% versus the prior year. As I said last quarter, inventory remains elevated across all geographies as we implemented our Win Now actions after inventory was purchased and in transit.\nWhile we are seeing some increases in customer cancellations, the larger driver of our inventory is the buys for Nike Direct. In addition, across the marketplace, we are beginning to see Air Force 1 inventory stabilize with current retail sales, while Air Jordan 1 and Dunk remain elevated with continued actions planned ahead. With that, let me turn to our operating segments.\nI will focus my commentary on the progress we have made in each of our geographies on our Win Now actions. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 4%. Nike Direct declined 10%, with Nike Digital down 12%, and Nike stores down 6%. Wholesale increased 3% due primarily to favorable shipment timing, and increased shipments to our value partners in the Q3. EBIT declined 21% on a reported basis.\nThroughout the quarter, we delivered bold and inspiring storytelling in key sports moments, as Elliott mentioned, which drove heat and energy for our brand. Training led performance growth this quarter, and running grew high single digits. In Q3, we hosted dozens of key partners for product engagement and future growth planning, including a summit for partners serving core price points.\nWe have taken initial steps to expand distribution to support our expanded core product offering, which is a meaningful market opportunity for Nike. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 6%. Nike Direct declined 12%, with Nike Digital down 25% and Nike stores up 9%. Wholesale declined 3%. EBIT declined 35% on a reported basis. In Q3, performance dimensions continued to build momentum, fueled by the Mercurial in global football and new product launches in running. We celebrated Vinicius Junior's Best FIFA Men's Player Award with a short video, \"Can't Stop the Dance,\" featuring the Chrome Mercurial, and we amplified the Pegasus Premium launch with a unique activation at the London Eye featuring Nike athletes.\nIn the marketplace, in addition to taking steps to reposition Nike Digital, we also started a journey with JD Sports, Sports Direct, and Snipes to elevate our brand at physical retail with improved product positioning and visual merchandising. In Greater China, Q3 revenue declined 15%. Nike Direct declined 11%, with Nike Digital down 20% and Nike stores down 6%.\nWholesale declined 18%. EBIT declined 42% on a reported basis. In Q3, traffic declined double digits, and retail sales underperformed our plan. While the macro environment is challenging, sport is growing in China, and we must accelerate our pace. The market continues to be promotional, especially in consumer moments and in the digital channel, and we are taking aggressive steps to clean up the marketplace, with the priority being the health of our partners. These steps had a negative impact on our revenue and gross margin this quarter.\nAt the same time, our team is focused on creating brand distinction through sport and serving consumers with new innovation and hyperlocal product. We saw strong consumer response to the Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 in running. In basketball, we launched the Year of the Mamba with strong growth in Kobe Protro. We continue to see locally designed Express Lane product resonate with strong sell-through of our Chinese New Year product.\nThe opportunity in Greater China continues to be significant for Nike, notwithstanding the highly competitive and fast-moving dynamics in this marketplace. Our brand remains strong, but our actions to energize the marketplace will take some time. In APLA, Q3 revenue declined 4%. Nike Direct declined 4%, with Nike Digital down 8% and Nike stores up 1%. Wholesale was down 4%. EBIT declined 27% on a reported basis.\nWhile we saw mixed performance across territories in APLA, Japan and Latin America each returned to growth this quarter. In Q3, we created energy on the ground in running communities. We launched the After Dark Tour with incredible response from female runners and executed disruptive race takeovers at the Hakone Ekiden in Japan, the Mumbai Marathon, and the Thailand Marathon. This fueled continued momentum in running with growth across footwear and apparel.\nNow, let's look forward. Elliott said earlier that we are even more confident that the five Win Now actions are the right moves to create better balance in our business and reignite brand momentum. As we begin to have greater clarity and confidence in the steps that we are taking, I will provide some additional thoughts on our path forward over the next several quarters. First, we are accelerating our product portfolio transition.\nWe expect sport performance dimensions to lead our growth, with a relentless flow of newness across each field of play. We are focused on increasing the contribution of newness as a percentage of our overall seasonal assortment, including new models, new colors, and new materials. At the same time, we are moving fast to right-size the contribution of our classic footwear franchises.\nIn regards to this transition, we are making progress. In the last quarter of this fiscal year, we expect our classic footwear franchises will be down by more than 10 points as a percent of our total footwear mix. We intend to drive this mix lower in fiscal 2026, with total units planned down double digits, with the most aggressive actions on the Dunk. Second, we are repositioning Nike Digital within an Integrated Marketplace.\nTo do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates, and shifting closeout liquidation to our Nike factory stores. Due to these actions, and as we continue to reduce investment in paid media, we expect digital traffic to be down double digits in fiscal 2026. Gradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. Third, we are cleaning up the marketplace. For Nike Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model.\nFor Nike factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory. For our wholesale partners, we are making investments in sales-related returns, reducing forward supply, and providing higher wholesale discounts to liquidate aged inventory. We expect these actions will continue through the first half of fiscal 2026.\nLast, when we get back to a steady flow of new product at scale, improve brand engagement, reposition our Nike Digital business to complement our wholesale partners, and return to a healthy and clean marketplace, we expect our wholesale business to return to growth. Each of our geographies have made varying levels of progress on each of these actions, and as a result, are working against different timelines. When taken all together, these are the building blocks for Nike to return to sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow, I'll turn to our Q4 guidance. Our second-half plan is in line with what we communicated last quarter, with some shifts occurring between Q3 and Q4. Looking ahead, we believe that the Q4 will reflect the largest impact from our Win Now actions, and that the headwinds to revenue and gross margin will begin to moderate from there.\nWe are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates, and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence. Our Q4 guidance includes our best assessment of these factors based on the data we have available to us today.\nWe expect Q4 revenues to be down in the mid-teens range, albeit at the low end. This includes several points of unfavorable shipment timing in North America, as well as two points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We expect Q4 gross margins to be down approximately 400 to 500 basis points, including restructuring charges during the same period last year. We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico.\nWe expect Q4 SG&A dollars to be up low to mid-single digits, including restructuring charges in the prior year. We will continue to tightly manage expenses while we increase investment to fuel our Win Now priorities, most notably demand creation. We expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to be $45 to 55 million for Q4, and we expect the tax rate for the full year to be in the mid-teens range.\nWe are focused on what we can control, and for Nike at this moment, serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum is what matters most. Our collective experience, as well as the early signals we are seeing with consumers, gives us confidence in the path ahead. With that, I'll turn it back over to Elliott.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Matt. I'll close by taking a minute to talk about my teammates at Nike. Look, it's been a tough couple of years. We've been through a lot of change, but what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. Nike Inc., is a sports company. We inspire through iconic brands and create innovative products for all athletes.\nIt may seem like an obvious direction, but we needed to say it out loud to reawaken the fire in our teams, and I have been unrelenting in that message. One of the things that makes it special to work at Nike is we invite athletes, coaches, and teams to our business meetings to spend time with our teammates. One conversation that stirred something up in me this quarter was with Coach Ryan Day, coach of the national champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nHe had an answer to the question that really connected with how I'm thinking about our team right now and the tone we're setting. The question to him was, \"How do you stay on the offense, and what's the key to keeping your program moving forward?\" His answer was that Ohio State applies pressure constantly in all three phases of the game, no matter who he's playing. Get vertical down the field on offense.\nPlay suffocating man coverage so no throw is easy. Go after punts and have his best athletes returning kicks. He just painted this picture of a team that is relentlessly pushing and challenging, being aggressive and making it uncomfortable to play against. I love that attitude, and that's how I think about Nike when we're at our best. Success for Nike has never been about protecting our turf. We force others to play our game.\nWe drive trends, grow markets, we lead. Coach Day made it clear that it takes complete buy-in to be a championship team. That's exactly what we're asking of our teammates right now: to keep up the intensity, to move with focus and urgency, to have passion and take pride in all that we do, and to win as a team. With that, I'll turn it over for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. If you are called in, excuse me, if you're called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device.\nWe ask that you please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one if you would like to join the queue, and your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Elliott, can you provide a timeline on when you think classic shoe inventories will be clean in the wholesale channel? Then same question for the direct channel as well.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThanks for the question, Lorraine. Before I dive too deeply into the specific question, I do want to start really quickly because I think it's important to set the tone here on the call for these types of questions that 90 days ago, we declared five actions to return to growth. What we'll say 90 days later, I'm even more convinced that these are the right actions to move our brand and business forward.\nThese Win Now actions really start with our culture, our product portfolio, which is a question that you're asking here, and I'll dive into that here in just a second, shaping our brand for distinction, elevating and growing the marketplace, and winning on the ground. What we did add to our teams after coming off the call was providing them a sharp focus on which sports. We have five sports: running, basketball, football, training, and sportswear.\nThree key countries I outlined for you, and then the five cities. So the teams are really rallying around this Win Now priorities and even calling it the 5-5-3-5. So now let me jump more specifically into product for you, and I will also start a little higher level before I dive into the specific question around the key franchises. We are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. That's why I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We're going to run that through all three brands: Nike, Jordan, Converse, across performance and sportswear, men's, women's, kids, footwear, apparel, accessories, and up and down price points. We're going to be sharper on specific sports.\nI've touched on those already, so I won't dive too deeply on those five sports, but we have set teams up against each of those sports, times, gender, and we have small teams, cross-functional teams, taking the insights from those sports and those consumers and driving innovative products. So I feel good about where the team is heading on the performance side of the business, and we're starting to see some great success, and I'm sure we'll hit on that here in a moment.\nWhat I'd say about franchise management, to answer your question specifically, is that we have decade-long experience of managing franchises. I will also say this: we had the three Air Force 1, Dunk, AJ1. They are still beloved silhouettes. So it's not about sunsetting these, it's about right-sizing them. We asked our teams to accelerate our actions, as Matt spoke to in his prepared remarks, of right-sizing that inventory so that we can get back to running that complete and balanced portfolio.\nAnd so we're confident that we're making the right moves from a performance perspective, and we're seeing some wins there, running, training that Matt touched on, and we're right-sizing the three key franchises. At the same time, starting to plant some newness in the sportswear side of our business with Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox. We touched on some of these: Superfly, Air Max Muse, and Air Max 95. So I feel like the teams are taking all the right actions against those key footwear franchises, right-sizing the inventory, and getting back to running a relentless flow of innovative and coveted products.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nHey, Lorraine, I'll just add that what I said in my prepared remarks was that we intend to drive, we've made really good progress over the past year. As Elliott came in, he challenged the teams to increase the pace at which we reduce the supply of those three franchises in the marketplace. As a result of that, it had some impact on our Q4 headwinds that we talked about, but it will continue to be a headwind in fiscal year 2026. By the time we exit Q4, we expect that we will have reduced the contribution of those franchises by 10 percentage points as a percent of our overall footwear mix, and we intend to drive that down more in fiscal year 2026.\nWhen I think about it through the lens of channels, what I would say to you is that on the Nike Direct side and the digital side in particular, we're already taking action, as Elliott and I both outlined, to reduce the number of promotional days and to reducing the discounts that we see in the marketplace. The challenge we have in the near term is that we were buying against a different plan. So we've tightened the buys against Nike Digital, but we really did that towards the end of summer and heading into fall. That inventory will not end up in the digital channel. We will directly transition it to our factory stores, and we will clean it in a value channel like we typically do as we clean up a season.\nOn the wholesale side, we're making investments, and I talked about us needing to use the first half of Fiscal 2026 in order to be able to clean up the marketplace. What I would tell you there is that the combination of the actions that we're taking in digital plus the actions that we've communicated and worked through with our partners, we're already starting to see fruit.\nWhat I mean by that is, one, inventory of Air Force 1 is beginning to stabilize with retail sales for Air Force 1. Secondly, when you look at the order book in wholesale for our partners in North America, EMEA, APLA, we're seeing growth in the performance dimensions of our business plus newness in sportswear almost offset the declines we're managing in the classic footwear franchises. That gives us a lot of confidence that our partners are coming behind us and that we are moving down the right path to effect the cleanup.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our next question, it comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nVP and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. Elliott, I was hoping to get your latest thoughts on innovation within Nike. How do you feel about the strength of your innovation team and the pipeline ahead, and how are you thinking about innovating into some of the sportswear franchises as we look into fiscal 2026? Thank you.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah. Thank you, Brooke. Let me first start on innovation. When we think about innovation, we think about it really in two forms. We have long-term, let's call it three to plus five years, and we have a dedicated team against that over at our LeBron James Nike Sport Research Lab. What I would say, I'm really confident in the team that we have there, and not only the team but the work that they are doing long-term, creating new innovation for our team.\nSo that's a little longer term. I spent a lot of time with John Hoke and his team over there and am excited about some of the products that are coming through the Nike Sport Research Lab. Shorter term and more near term, again, I touched on it in my first answer, and it's really coming back to driving newness and freshness against performance and sportswear, men's, women's, kids, footwear, apparel, and accessories, not just footwear. We've got some really interesting innovation coming from apparel.\nI touched on it briefly in my prepared remarks around 24/7. It comes out of our training line, but it is also viewed as sportswear, and there's some innovation there. I'm really pleased with the sell-through on 24/7 and the reorders that are coming on that from an apparel perspective. Then on a footwear perspective, we'll continue to right-size the three franchises that I touched on.\nWe still believe all three of them are meaningful products. Then you'll see us continue to invest in innovation around sportswear. I touched on some of those products: the Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox. Shox is having a really building momentum, Air Max 95, etc. I'll just close out here, Brooke. This week, we had our Spring 2026 product review where we bring all of our partners here to the campus to go through our Spring 2026 line.\nWhat I'll tell you is we are all excited about the products that are coming for Spring 2026. We're starting to see our Win Now focus on accelerating our product portfolio against these five sports: running, basketball, football, training, and sportswear, paying dividends. I'm really excited about the work I saw there. While I have you, I'll just add one other thing that I saw that I was excited about.\nWe are also working on elevating the marketplace, and the retail team's done some phenomenal work around elevating our presentation at both wholesale and physical retail. Excited about some of that work. So overall, I'm confident that our innovation pipeline is there, and we just now have to flow through it to get back to building the brand and the business.\n\nOperator\n\nTo our next question, it comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nAneesha Sherman\n\nVP and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you so much. Elliott, I just want to follow up on the comment that you just made about the Spring 2026 product review. Based on some of the comments earlier from Matt around performance growth almost offsetting classics declines, do you expect that inflection point to be in Spring 2026? I know you don't have the orders yet, but is that when you expect performance growth to more than offset classics and your total wholesale order book to grow?\nAnd then, Matt, a follow-up on your comments on gross margins. You talked about wholesale liquidations at H1. I know you're not giving margin guidance for next year, but are you generally expecting a gradual progression of gross margins through the year as some of those liquidations roll off and then you get a stronger order book in the second half? Thank you.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nWe're absolutely gaining confidence in the product pipeline. Into fall, Matt, I already touched on some of the order book on fall in North America, APLA, and EMEA. So definitely gaining confidence around the order book fall holiday and then, like I said, this sneak peek into 2026. The key here, though, is how quickly we can clean up the marketplace. That's why you see some of the results that we have in Q4 and then resetting both the digital and physical marketplaces to receive this innovation, making certain that we present it in the way that we believe we need to present the product at point of sale, digital, physical, so that we drive the sell-through.\nAnd so that's where we have the team's focus right now. The brand, I believe, we've already started to invest in. We did that early. I see product coming now, and that excites me, and so I feel good about that. Now we've got to reset the marketplace and make sure that we get the sell-through, and it's that sell-through that's going to continue to drive the order book and get us back to profitable, sustainable growth.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nYeah. I just would add that last quarter, we said that the Q4 was going to have the greatest impact from the Win Now actions that Elliott outlined. We continue to believe this is true, and it's on our plan. What we can also tell you is that we now expect Q4 to reflect the largest impact from these Win Now actions and that the headwinds to revenue and margin we expect to moderate from there.\nSo how I think you translate that, Aneesha, as you start to look forward, is we've tried to lay out each of these actions and the implications that they have as we start to think about heading into 2026. We expect that these headwinds will continue in 2026. As Elliott referenced, while we're going to have positive things beginning vis-à-vis greater full-price selling and digital, and we're going to have a clean and full-price order book with our wholesale partners, we are going to continue to be liquidating inventory.\nWe expect that that's going to take us several quarters to work through. The reason why we're confident in it is because we know we'll be liquidating it through the channels where we're used to liquidating that inventory. So we will continue to be transparent as we've got greater visibility as we get into fiscal 2026. We're still in the early days of executing against these partnerships. I'm sorry. We're still in the early days of executing against these priorities. We remain committed to providing guidance and financial updates every 90 days.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO. Your line is open.\n\nSimeon Siegel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO\n\nThanks. Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Elliott, I'm curious, how are you going to balance the promotional? Just as you think about the presentation and bringing out the promotions at the same time, that it's clear we can hear your excitement around the new product and your amplifying storytelling. Just from a consumer's perspective, how do you tell them this exciting story while still clearing the product?\nSo how are you going to protect that and maybe segment that? Then, Matt, it seems operating overhead versus demand creation trajectory flipped in recent years. So as you're re-embracing wholesale, as you're re-embracing elevating, any thoughts as to just the right level long-term of overhead versus demand creation as a rate of sales? Thanks, guys.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah. I think I'd be fairly brief here. Matt touched on some of the headwinds to the P&L, and one of them is us taking products. We're returning product from our wholesale partners. So we're bringing the product that's not selling out of the market, and then we will liquidate that through our value stores, Nike value stores, to make room for the new innovation. It's already starting to, and by the way, we're doing the same thing not only in the physical space, but we're also doing it, excuse me, we're doing it in the digital space as well.\nWe touched on how we've already moved Nike Direct digital to a full-price presentation, really elevating the assortment, the presentation, the user experience. So we're moving both digital and physical-owned and partnered retail floor sets to full price as quickly as possible, and then we'll use the value channels to move through the excess inventory. I think the last, I'll just kind of finish here. The best example of that is how we're going to reset running. We've had some great examples of Pegasus Premium this quarter, Vomero 18 this quarter, both new innovations with great storytelling, great presentation, and we've had wonderful sell-throughs on those.\nThen you'll see that Simeon continue to flow into fall and holiday of Q1, Q2 of 2026 with a full range of product and running across three different silos of running: Vomero, Peg, Structure, three different price points, trail running, and then, of course, our racing flats. That was one of the floor sets that I saw over at Spring 2026, and again, it looks amazing. So we're trying to get our marketplace to full price as quickly as possible and feel like the teams are moving with a sense of urgency.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nYeah. On the SG&A side, I've said for a couple of quarters that we continue to manage our expenses, and what I meant by that specifically was overhead tightly while we accelerate investment in demand creation. Our demand creation being up high single digits, 8% this quarter, is truly a reflection of Elliott coming in and challenging the team to elevate our storytelling with impact. It's the easiest lever for us to pull.\nThe team mobilized around the Super Bowl and the All-Star weekend, and the product launches for Peg and Vomero, but also the way that they executed on the ground those activities in the cities in which we were focused. As we look forward, I think we're going to continue to manage expenses tightly. I think that part of what you're seeing this quarter in the double-digit decline in operating overhead is some of the variable expense from direct coming down, flowing through the P&L.\nYou're also seeing the great work our teams have done from a productivity perspective in managing against some of the productivity goals that we had set several quarters ago. If you look at our operating overhead growth, excluding the restructuring impact in the prior year, it was down 3%. We are focused on ensuring that we invest behind our sales organizations, our key city teams on the one end, and on the other end, making sure that we've got the right resources in product and in innovation. So we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to try to do it while we manage expenses tightly as we look forward to returning to growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on wholesale here. Maybe for Elliott, as you've kind of returned to that channel and gotten back in the mix, I'm just curious, your biggest learnings there? Any surprises to the upside or downside versus how you've historically operated there with all your knowledge? Maybe then for Matt, you just mentioned wholesale discounts as a headwind, which should continue. Are historical wholesale margins still in view, or are those structurally lower? Just curious for your latest thoughts there. Thanks a lot.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thank you. Maybe a surprise. We were probably working too siloed, direct versus wholesale. Again, I think to really drive the potential of our brand, our revenue, and to meet consumers' needs, it's got to be integrated. It's got to be an aligned approach to both direct and wholesale, digital and physical. It all has to work together in a consistent ecosystem.\nAnd so I'm really driving hard this idea of an integrated consumer-led marketplace. Let the consumer decide where they want to choose to shop. Made two moves. Craig Williams and I, we have put in place two new leaders, one in Nike Direct, Shannon Glass, and then the other one in sales, Erica Bullard, both long-term industry veterans and Nike veterans. In fact, we even put them sitting next to each other up on our floor together.\nThey have offices right outside of one another, and they walk hand in hand and make it certain, literally almost physically. So I told them those two have got to walk together everywhere they go and make certain that we stay aligned. I think they're doing a tremendous job of really making certain that we have an integrated approach to the overall marketplace. So I'd say that's probably number one.\nNumber two, we just got out of a rhythm of working closely with our wholesale partners. That was a bit of a surprise. We are quickly getting back to we've got cross-functional teams. We're having key account planning meetings now with our wholesale partners. We're working through aligned growth plans. We're working on consumer-right assortments in the right depth.\nWe're working now to elevate the presentation of our brand. You know all too well when we have beautiful, innovative product and we elevate the presentation, it really helps sell through the product and marketing support. So again, I'm confident in the progress we're making. It's going to take time to build back all of the teams around the world. That's why we have the three key countries where we're trying to focus: United States, China, and the UK, so that our teams know where we're going to focus our investments and resources. So all in all, the wholesale partners, they want and need us to get back to be at Nike.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nAnd from a margin perspective, what I would say is that over the past several years, Alex, the profit pool in wholesale has been relatively volatile. There's been a lot of things that have happened with supply chain disruption, ocean freight rates moving, the supply-demand imbalances. As a result of that, we've all navigated through many things in order to be able to manage the profitability of the channel.\nI think one of the things that we did a couple of years ago as we were seeing a significant demand versus supply imbalance, meaning an incredible amount of demand and less supply, is we actually lowered our wholesale discount rates in order to offset other headwinds that we were dealing with from a freight and transportation perspective. So we are investing in commercial terms, but we're putting them back to historical levels. We believe that by doing that, we'll be competitive. It will enable us and our partners to have mutually profitable businesses and also have the capacity that we need in order to be able to invest in the presentation of our brand at retail, which is ultimately what wins at the end of the day.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nRandy Konik\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Thanks a lot. Good evening. I guess, Elliott, maybe give us some perspective. I think you spoke about a lot of things you're doing with urgency in China, but maybe give us a progress report on where you see the different geos from all these strategies you're undertaking. Give us some perspective of where you're furthest along, least furthest along. That'd be very helpful. Thanks.\n\nElliott?Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah. I think the key here, Randy, is as we think about our overall portfolio, is that we have 190 countries that all roll up to four different geographies. We're working closely with the leaders of each of the geos and countries to implement the Win Now strategy because, again, the strategy works no matter if you're in the United States or in Japan. It all goes back to putting the consumer at the center, right product, storytelling, marketplace.\nMatt, in his prepared remarks, touched on APLA, EMEA, and North America being where they are in terms of futures, performance, and looks of sportswear offsetting. We're, I think, making progress in each of those three geos. In terms of China, here's what I'd say about China. We remain committed to China. We see the long-term opportunity there. There's 1.3 billion consumers, and it's our opportunity.\nWhat we've always done there is to invite and inspire those 1.3 billion consumers into sport, fitness, and the lifestyle of sport. Our team's doing a good job there. We have also made some significant investments in China, whether it's around some of the big teams like the national basketball team, the track and field team, and the football team. We've made big investments there.\nWe've got now a product creation arm that we call Geo Express Lane in China. So overall, I think we've made the right investments. What I will say, I spent some time over there in December. I hadn't been over there in a while. The competition is a bit more aggressive than I had when I remembered it four and a half years ago. We've just got to accelerate our pace. Good news is we're starting still as the number one brand there. We're working closely with Angela and her team to implement these Win Now strategies. We're cleaning up the promotional marketplace just like we're doing everywhere to make room for new innovation.\nWe're getting back to elevating Nike Direct and Digital and then working closely with our two big partners to make certain that we're investing in consumer-led concepts with a focus on performance, running, training, basketball, Jordan, ACG, putting the right assortments, depth, presentation, all the things that I've talked a lot about. In the end, I believe we're taking all the right actions, and we're confident in the long-term opportunity in China.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nWhen you look at the financial performance for China in the quarter, what I tried to highlight was the amount of actions that we took in the quarter between marketplace returns, rebates, and also some investments that we're making to liquidate inventory. Given that it's a monobrand market, as Elliott mentioned, it's going to take us time to execute the Win Now in China.\nSo we went aggressive because the faster we can clean up the marketplace and create the capacity and the space to present the new product stories, the new product assortments that we're excited about that are coming, the quicker we're going to create energy with consumers. That's when we should see traffic start to improve, and we should start to build more momentum in that marketplace. So as we look at that, we just expect it's going to take us some time to be able to execute this.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session as well as today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

Welcome to Nike, Inc.'s Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Trussell, please. Go ahead, sir.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike, Inc.'s Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter results. Joining us on today's call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO Elliott Hill and our CFO Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nThese risks and uncertainties are detailed in Nike's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to Nike's earnings press release or Nike's website investors.nike.com for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.\nWe will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Elliott Hill.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThank you Paul. Hello everyone and happy holidays. In my first call, I want to start by saying how energized I am to be back at Nike working alongside my teammates. I look forward to the journey that lies ahead for all of us. When I retired in 2020 after 32 years, I continue to stay in touch with many of my teammates and cheered them on from the sidelines. Why? Because I have an irrational love for this company.\nI know Nike inside and out, take pride in what the brand stands for, and want to see the company succeed. In a moment where our team, brand, and business are being challenged, my singular focus is to help get us back on track to get back to winning. Today I'm going to share what I've seen and heard in my first two months. I will then outline some of the immediate moves we're making to reposition the business. I'll tell you this, we, the entire Nike team, feels the sense of urgency here.\nMy full leadership team and I went on the road the past few weeks to meet our teammates, partners, and consumers to get a firsthand view of our brand and business. We went to LA, New York, Amsterdam, London, Paris, Shanghai, Beijing. Together we walked the high streets and shopping malls of those cities to see how consumers are experiencing our brand at retail.\nI met with key wholesale partners in each geography, all of which I already know and have developed deep relationships with over the years. I met with the commissioners of the NFL, NBA, and WNBA, MLB, and NWSL, the heads of the top NCAA conferences, and teams like PSG and past and present athletes like MJ and Ronaldo to Sabrina, A'ja, and Erling.\nI visited our distribution centers in Memphis and Lockbourne and had calls with our top five manufacturing partners to understand the evolution of our supply chain as we've grown the business. It was important to me that I spent my first 60 days personally collecting these deep and direct insights across the board. Our partners are energized.\nThe people I talk with are rooting for a strong Nike because when Nike is at its best, we bring excitement. We invite consumers into the world of sport and sport culture, and when we do that, we help grow the overall marketplace that's good for consumers, that's good for our partners, and that's good for Nike. The consistent feedback we've heard is pretty simple. Let's see more of Nike being Nike. That starts with leveraging all the advantages that make us great.\nThree of the world's most iconic brands, a dominant roster of athletes, teams, and leagues, unmatched patented innovation, a deep catalog of products at every price point, teams positioned to serve consumers across 190 countries, a fully integrated marketplace across multiple channels, strong, long-standing relationships with leading suppliers and manufacturing partners, and, most importantly, passionate, highly talented, and committed teammates.\nLately we haven't been maximizing these strengths. From everything I heard and observed, there are clear themes about the recent state of our business and where we need to go. I'll start with a high, high level observation. We lost our obsession with sport. Moving forward, we will lead with sport and put the athlete at the center of every decision. The sharpness in each sport is what differentiates our brand and our business and fuels our culture.\nAnother observation is that the reliance on a handful of sportswear silhouettes is not who we are. We will get back to leveraging deep athlete insights to accelerate innovation, design, product creation, and storytelling. Sport is what authenticates our brand.\nI also see that we've shifted investments away from creating demand for our brand to capturing demand through performance marketing for our digital business. We will reinvest in our brands to create stories that inspire and emotionally connect with our consumers during important sports moments and critical product launches. When visiting our teams around the world, it was clear centralization has impacted the resources we have in key countries and key cities. We will rebalance resourcing and empowering our teams on the ground to win with the everyday athletes and influencers.\nMy last observation. Prioritizing Nike Digital revenue has impacted the health of our marketplaces. We will build back an integrated marketplace across Nike Direct and wholesale. Our marketplace will be consumer-led, putting our best product and presentation in the path of the consumer wherever they choose to shop. And ultimately with sports our North Star, we will re-energize our culture and identity. We believe we have one of the strongest mission statements of anyone, and that is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. To me, inviting 8 billion athletes into sport is a pretty powerful purpose.\nOne question I know you want to ask me is if we have the talent at Nike and are they motivated? The short answer to both is yes. I've grown more and more confident as I've traveled around the world and saw our teams engaging with each other, with our consumers, and with our partners. It's also been great to see how much expertise we've added since I've been away. In spaces like supply chain, product creation, technology, materials, sports science, you name it. Our talent is world class. Everywhere I've been, the teams are inspired and ready to go. I feel the optimism we will win and we will do it as a team.\nWhat our teams need right now is clear direction and focus. We built this company on the guiding principles of world-class management of product, brand, and marketplace. We create innovative and coveted products, tell emotional inspiring stories through our brand, and execute in a way that grows the entire marketplace, digital and physical, wholesale, and Nike Direct. My leadership team and I have already identified key near-term actions in each area, and we're going to move fast.\nFirst in product, we're getting sharper on specific sports. We're shifting into sport-led teams segmented by men's, women's, and kids, and we call each of them Fields of Play, and it is a segment-to-grow approach. Throughout our history, we've utilized inflection points to further segment our businesses to unlock the next wave of growth. We will do this by empowering more nimble cross-functional teams to assess the needs of sports-specific athletes by gender. The approach enables the teams to identify new opportunities, fuel innovation, and drive incremental growth by sport and by gender.\nBreadth and depth and how we orchestrate our complete product portfolio have always been strengths of Nike. We will return to the discipline of franchise management that I was a part of for so many years. We've already started managing the inventory in our marketplaces and will move faster to return to a full market for our largest classic footwear franchises.\nAt the same time, the team has been planting the seeds of the next franchises that will fuel growth in the quarter. Some of our most sought after products are franchises that are distinctly Nike, the Pegasus 41, Nike Shox, and the Kobe lineup, and we're building anticipation for what's ahead, unveiling the Vomero 18 and Pegasus Premium to passionate runners at The Running Event in my hometown a few weeks ago.\nThere's still work to do in rounding out the portfolio, but I'm really encouraged by the innovation coming from our Fields of Play in the next several seasons, especially in the high volume areas like running, training, sportswear, and core product, and the Jordan Brand lineup.\nTurning to the Nike brand, there are moments when we need to create impact that's felt around the world and day-to-day work that connects emotionally with local communities. We will deliver bold creative marketing that leverages our athletes in sport moments and drive the ground game authentically in neighborhoods. To do that, we're going to be much more intentional about investing to move the brand forward.\nWe're already moving in that direction. The marketing team delivered moments this quarter that got us back to owning the conversation in sport. From the Liberty's first WNBA Championship to the Dodgers World Series win to Saquon Barkley's reverse hurdle to city takeovers at the Berlin, Shanghai, New York City, and Chicago Marathons, we're also going to continue to be aggressive in sports marketing.\nIn just the last 60 days we've announced the re-signing of the NBA and the WNBA, the Brazil Football Confederation, FC Barcelona, and last week the NFL. We drive growth through sport's most iconic partners. Their athletes are the creative fuel for our brand. They power our innovation agenda, our brand voice, and our revenue.\nInspiring the consumer includes being part of the active communities who run, train, and compete locally. It's about showing up and building relationships every day, every day with athletes and influencers. My visits to the geos the past few weeks only reinforce my conviction that that we need to get back to empowering our teams in key countries and key cities.\nI know from my years of working in our geographies, they're the ones creating emotional consumer connections in their neighborhood. They're the ones identifying the insights that inform our offense. We will resource our key country and key city teams to create stronger consumer connections, build relationships with athletes, influencers, and partners, and unlock incremental growth for our brand and business.\nWe're optimistic about the actions that are already underway in product and brand. But we're still in the early innings of elevating the marketplace, both in Nike Direct and with our wholesale partners. What I've seen is traffic in Nike Direct, digital, and physical have softened because we've lacked newness in production and we're not delivering inspiring stories.\nThe result is we've become far too promotional. We've moved to a push model. Entering the year, our digital platforms were delivering roughly a 50-50 split of full price to promotional sales. The level of markdowns not only impacts our brand, but it also disrupts the overall marketplace and the profitability of our partners. We will return Nike Direct, digital, and physical to premium destinations that lead the sports industry. They'll elevate the consumer experience and be the ultimate representation of the Nike brand.\nIt's where we'll offer our most complete assortments, tell deep product stories, and share our passion for sports.\nBeing premium also means full price. We'll focus promotions during traditional retail moments, not at the consistent levels we are today. We will leverage Nike Value Stores to profitably move through any excess inventory.\nThe final action we prioritize is building back and earning the trust of our key wholesale partners. Some partners and channels feel we've turned our back on them, and we've stopped engaging consistently. I've connected with many of them directly: Ed and Lauren at Dick's, Regis and Mike at JD Sports, Mary at Foot Locker, Heinrich at the Deichmann Group, Michael at Sports Direct, Mr. Yu at Topsports, Mr. Yu and Mr. Wang from Pou Sheng, and Juan Carlos at Innovasport. They're all encouraged by our commitment to delivering new, innovative product, telling emotional and inspiring stories, and elevating Nike Direct. Their confidence is building in our product pipeline, and they welcome the closer collaboration as we invest more in their business.\nWe know our sales teams will have to earn every open-to-buy dollar. We are investing to make sure our partners feel supported. We will give them access to our best products in the breadth and depth they need, educate their teams on the latest Nike innovation, and provide them with the marketing support both in store and out of home. We will do more than just sell in our products. We will actively support mutually profitable sell-through. Simply put, we will win when our partners win.\nBefore I hand it off to Matt, I just wanted to say it's been an incredibly rewarding first two months. It feels great to be back with my Nike teammates. This isn't going to be easy, but we're ready for the challenge. After spending so much time with my team the past few weeks, I'm confident we are all aligned and focused on the areas that will make the most immediate impact. I'll list the near term priority actions again.\nIgnite our culture through a focus on obsessing sport and getting back to winning. Accelerate a complete product portfolio driven by athlete insights through sport-led fields of play. Increase investment in our brand to deliver big, bold marketing statements. Invest in and empower our teams in key countries, in key cities, to win the ground game.\nElevate the marketplace through a more premium Nike Direct, and an unwavering commitment to our wholesale partners.\nSome of these actions are already underway, and some need to move faster. I will continue to evaluate and assess what is needed. I recognize that some of these actions will have a negative impact on our near-term results.\nWe're taking the long term view here. We're making the decisions that are best for the health of our brand and business, decisions that will drive shareholder value. I strongly believe Nike's path to sustainable, profitable growth will be through sport, and with that I'll turn it over to Matt to cover some of the specific quarter results and our financial outlook before we take some questions.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Elliott, and hello to everyone on the call. To start, our Q2 financial performance largely met our expectations as we continue to make progress repositioning our business. Today I will focus my remarks on our recent performance and outlook.\nFirst, I will start by reviewing our Q2 financial results. I will go deeper into our performance in the quarter, including marketplace trends, portfolio highlights, and operating segments. Last, I will review our near term outlook, including the strategic actions introduced by Elliott to accelerate our pace in stabilizing the business and reigniting brand momentum.\nThis quarter, revenues were down 8% on a reported basis and down 9% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting ongoing headwinds from our franchise management actions. We continue to drive the biggest reductions to our classic footwear franchises on Nike Direct, which was down 14%, with Nike Digital declining 21% and Nike Stores declining 2%. Wholesale was down 4%.\nGross margins declined 100 basis points to 43.6% on a reported basis due to higher markdowns on Nike Direct, wholesale discounts to liquidate inventory, and channel mix headwinds, partially offset by lower product costs and strategic pricing actions. SG&A was down 3% on a reported basis while we increased investment in areas such as sports marketing. This was more than offset by lower wage-related expenses and timing shifts in other demand creation expenses. Earnings per share was $0.78.\nNow let me go deeper into the quarter's performance. Q2 marketplace trends largely reflected the challenges that Elliott outlined, with traffic and retail sales across the marketplace falling below our expectations, especially in September and October. In November, we saw momentum build, with digital and physical traffic inflecting positive, especially around the quarter's biggest consumer moments in North America. Black Friday week was our largest demand week ever on Nike Digital. With sales up double digits in Greater China, our 11.11 performance exceeded plan.\nHowever, on Nike Digital, our off-price mix was up high single digits versus the prior year, with performance marketing increasing over the same period. As Elliott said, Nike Digital has become a platform where we have been capturing demand and competing with our wholesale partners, rather than creating and growing demand for our brands. This is why we must elevate the consumer experience, grow organic traffic, and drive full-price demand.\nNext, inventory was flat versus the prior year as elevated supply in North America and Greater China was offset by declines. In EMEA and APLA. Footwear inventory declined, while apparel and accessories inventory increased to support marketplace growth.\nOn a year over year basis, these trends were partly driven by timing related factors. That said, inventory levels are higher than we would like, especially given recent sales trends on Nike Direct.Partner owned inventory declined versus the prior year.\nWe took some steps this quarter, and we plan to accelerate inventory actions in our second half to drive a return to a healthy marketplace. In particular, we are moving aggressively to reduce aged inventory, adjust supply with demand on Nike Digital, and ensure we have marketplace capacity for our newest product assortments.\nTurning to our portfolio, this quarter showed progress in key areas, especially as our teams get back on the offense in sport with consumers.\nOverall, our sport performance field of play grew year over year, offset by a double-digit decline in sportswear. In training, men's was up high teens, women's up high single digits, and kids up high single digits. In global football, men's grew low single digits and kids grew high teens. In basketball, women's grew strong double digits and kids grew low teens, and in running, men's was flat and women's up low to mid single digits.\nIn addition, we took another step forward, shifting our product portfolio by reducing the proportion of our business driven by our classic footwear franchises. For Q2, these franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business, and at a rate greater than the first quarter. As I said last call, we expect the impact of these shifts to continue for the next few quarters.\nWith that, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue was down 8%, Nike Direct declined 15%, with Nike Digital down 22% and Nike Stores down 3%. Wholesale declined 1%. EBIT declined 10% on a reported basis. Highlights in the quarter included growth in kids, with strong momentum in apparel and performance footwear. Men's and women's training drove strong growth, and in basketball, Ja grew double digits. Kobe became the market's largest signature franchise, with demand far exceeding available supply, and Sabrina 2 made a statement as the NBA's second most worn sneaker this season, behind only the Kobe 6.\nThroughout Q2 we positioned Nike as the brand of athletes around key sports moments. Our Winning Isn't for Everyone running campaign won Advertising Age's Best Ad of 2024, as our ground game built momentum at the Chicago and New York Marathons. As the NFL season got underway, our Kobe release drove our largest cleat shock drop in Nike history, and when the New York Liberty clinched the WNBA championship and my LA Dodgers won the World Series, our brand storytelling owned the moment.\nIn EMEA, Q2 revenue declined 10%, Nike Direct declined 20%, with Nike Digital down 32% and Nike Stores up 3%. Wholesale declined 4%, and EBIT declined 10%.On a reported basis.\nWe continue to build momentum in sport performance, led by strong growth in men's and kids global football. Men's and women's running returned to growth, and all three of our top performance franchises in EMEA, Mercurial, Pegasus, and Phantom, grew double digits.\nIn sportswear, we are seeing momentum from newer franchises, including Shox, Vomero 5, LD-1000, and P-6000. In addition, we moved first in EMEA to reposition Nike Digital as a premium platform. This quarter, full price realization improved with a strong double-digit decline in off-price sales. While we are seeing near-term traffic impact as we reduce promotional activity in paid media, we believe these shifts will. Elevate the total marketplace over time.\nIn Greater China, Q2 revenue declined 11%, Nike Direct declined 7%, with Nike Digital down 4% and Nike Stores down 8%. Wholesale was down 15%. EBIT declined 27% on a reported basis. In Q2, we experienced another quarter of retail traffic declines in a difficult macro environment. This quarter also required higher markdown activity to drive sell-through in inventory velocity, which negatively affected gross margins. In a competitive environment, Nike's focus is on serving consumers with product innovation and brand inspiration, and fueling the growth of sport.In China.\nThis quarter, Ja 2 launched with strong sell-through, Pegasus 41 topped sales in women's running, and new ACG apparel releases created social buzz. We also continue to see strong full-price demand with lower markdowns and higher margins for our locally designed Express Lane products. This fall, more than 250,000 runners joined us for the Shanghai Marathon. In addition, we hosted marathoner Eliud Kipchoge for community events, school visits, and a run along the Great Wall to inspire the next generation of runners in China.\nWhile near term conditions are challenging, sport continues to grow in China, and we are addressing our current headwinds to reignite brand momentum and a healthy pull marketplace.In APLA, Q2 revenue was down 2%. Nike Direct declined 4% with Nike.Digital down 8% and Nike Stores up 2%.\nWholesale declined 1%. EBIT declined 12% on a reported basis. Earlier on, we read consumer trends in Korea and Japan and moved quickly to diversify our sportswear footwear portfolio. Our mix of classic footwear franchises in APLA is below our global business, and new styles are resonating with consumers. Our Look of Running franchises are up triple digits, and new releases like Nike C1TY and Air Max Muse drove positive consumer response.\nIn addition, we drove strong growth in men's and women's training, and kids global football, as men's and women's running returned to growth in the geography.\nNow let me turn to our financial outlook. As I said last quarter, we intend to continue providing quarterly guidance during this period of transition. Let me start first by providing some.Additional color and contextElliott has now outlined certain strategic actions to reposition our business and re-energize.Nike brand momentum through sport.\nSome of these actions have been in motion, and we are accelerating the pace. Others are new.More specifically, we are shifting Nike Digital to a full price model and reducing the percentage of our business driven by promotional activity. We are also reducing investment in performance marketing, which will reduce paid traffic. This will require short term liquidation of excess inventory through less profitable channels.\nWe are creating capacity in the marketplace to sell in seasonal newness and innovation for Fall and Holiday 2025. This requires additional investment in marketplace returns, higher wholesale discounts to liquidate excess inventory, and to win back shelf space, as well as higher promotions to accelerate volume.Through our Nike Factory Stores.\nWe are targeting a significant reduction in weeks of supply of our classic footwear franchises over the next few seasons, with timelines varying by franchise, channel, market, and geography. As a result, summer order books will.Be down versus the prior year.\nWe are increasing brand marketing activity to support key product launches and upcoming sports moments. Investment in sports marketing is also increasing with our recent long-term partnership extensions.We are investing to rebuild our Key City Offense, our sport-by-consumer field of play, and our commercial teams to serve our retail partners.\nWe believe the strategic actions that Elliott has outlined are the right moves for Nike to create better balance in our business and to reignite growth with our wholesale partners in an integrated marketplace. Over the near term, the net effect of these actions will result in lower revenue, additional gross margin pressure, and higher demand creation expenses, with a greater headwind to the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.\nTurning to our third quarter outlook, we expect Q3 revenues to be down low double digits. This reflects initial steps on the actions outlined above, as well as worsening foreign exchange headwinds, partially offset by a timing benefit from Cyber Week.\nShifting into our third quarter, we expect Q3 gross margins to be down approximately 300 to 350 basis points, including restructuring charges during the same period in the prior year. This reflects the actions described earlier to clean and to reset the marketplace. We expect Q3 SG&A dollars to be slightly down year over year, including restructuring charges in the prior year. We will contin to tightly manage expenses, while we strategically increase investment.\nAs mentioned earlier. We expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to.Be $30 million to $40 million for Q3.\nWith that, let me turn it back over to Elliott.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThanks, Matt. Before taking questions, I wanted to share some additional thoughts. Matt and I have made it clear that we're repositioning the business to get back to driving a pull market for Nike. Over the coming quarters, we'll provide more details of our plans, and I commit to being transparent on our progress. We'll also share more specifics about the marketplace moves, stories, and products that give us optimism.\nI want you to know my bigger purpose for being here. I rejoined Nike to take our consumers, our amazing athletes, and this great company to someplace new. I want to be a part of a team that celebrates the biggest sports moments in unexpected ways, supports record-breaking athletes, creates innovation that people couldn't even imagine, builds new markets for sport from the ground up, and most of all, a team that changes people's lives.\nA team that helps athletes at all levels all around the world to reach their full potential. It's an ambitious vision, but one that I truly believe only Nike can deliver. Thank you. Let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Just a reminder, it is star one. If you have a question, the first question comes from Bob Drbul, Guggenheim.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nHi Elliott. Welcome back. Congratulations and best of luck.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Bob. I appreciate it. It's good to be back.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nI guess. I appreciate all the commentary. The one question I'd love for you to elaborate a bit more on is the relationships and the reception by your retail partners, especially around earning back the shelf space that you've given up as a company over the last few years.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah, thank you, Bob.\nHere's what I'd say. We are absolutely committed to getting back to leading and growing a consumer-led marketplace. I think there's a couple key words there, obviously key being consumer-led. The bottom line is there are consumers that want to shop Nike Direct, there's consumers that want to shop wholesale, and there are consumers that want to shop digital and physical. We have to show up with the best representation of the Nike brand, wherever that is. We will do exactly that. In terms of our wholesale partners, I've got a long history there, as you know, Bob and I have deep relationships with all of them. I listed a number of them.\nWe have work to do, and I would say especially in the specialty channels, Bob, running and football specialty. We're committed to investing in there. We've already started to invest in those areas. We started to engage with our wholesale partners, bringing them out here for what we call key account planning meetings, or bringing them out to have product engagement meetings for Fall 2025. The response has been very positive. If I had to sort of, you know, frame it up for you, they want us to get back to being Nike, and they want us to have the unrelenting flow of innovative products that we bring across all sports against all price points.\nThey want us to get back to delivering bold brand statements that help drive traffic. Because when it's all said and done, what they want and need from us is to drive mutually profitable growth for them and for us. That's exactly what we're going to get back to, and we will. The only way we're going to get back open-to-buy and shelf space is to do the things that we've already laid out: clean up the marketplace, bring innovative, coveted product every single quarter, bring the brand heat that drives traffic and drives sell-through.\nThey're open, they're receptive, and we're excited and looking forward to getting back in business with them.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nGreat, thanks. I guess one of the other meetings I think you said you had was with the NCAA. Just curious if you think this is the year for the Ducks. Are they going to win the College Football Playoff?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nBob, that's a trick question. You know, my guess is I might have the founder on this call, I don't know.\nI think where I sit today and the role I sit, I better say I better go with the Nike team. By the way, with the number of Nike teams we have in the playoffs, I like my chances.\nOh, I like that. I'd like a few more of those calls or questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take the next question from Michael Binetti, Evercore.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nSenior Managing Director and Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nHey guys.\nElliott, welcome back. It's great to hear your voice. Thanks for all the detail, Matt.\nElliott, did you think, you know, you.Gave us some commentary around how you're planning the near term investments in the business, and Matt, you made some allusions to some of those investments continuing into the fall. As you look at your first 60 days and think about the path to getting this brand back to growth longer term that it, that it deserves, what do you think are some of the.\nMost important.Things about how you phase costs and bringing investments back into the business along the way, and the pace of those investments along the way as you look to, I guess, returning to growth as we look past fiscal 2025.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Michael.\nWe touched on in our prepared remarks what we saw.\nOut in the market as we traveled around. First and foremost, we've got to get back to putting sport at the center of everything that we do, our product management. We're starting to clean up what we have out in the marketplace. We're starting to shift dollars from performance marketing to brand marketing.\nWe will invest in our fields of play because that's where we drive our product innovation, our newness, our distinction. We will also invest in the brand, and then finally, which is demand creation both from sports marketing and just big, bold brand marketing efforts. We touched on what we call our ground game in key countries and key cities. We'll speak later today with our teammates, but I think the easiest way to think about it is we can't do all of them everywhere. We're going to focus in on five sports to start with: Running, Basketball, Training, Football, and Sportswear. While we have 10 key countries.\nTwelve key cities, we're going to focus our efforts on three key countries in five key cities. We're really going to narrow down, and we'll pace and phase as we go throughout the next 18 to 24 months or so. I'm excited about the actions we're taking and the clarity we have about where we need to invest.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nMichael, what I would add to that is you've seen us for a couple quarters now tightly managing expenses as we have been prioritizing our investments in the brand, demand creation, and the long-term sport partnerships. These assets like the NFL, the NBA, the WNBA, Brazil, these are long-term partnerships deep into the next decade. I think that's a great example for you of our commitment to sport and to invest behind sport, not only now, but for the long term.\nOver the next couple quarters, you will see our demand creation investment continue to go up. That's going to be a combination of sports marketing and our investment behind the brand. This quarter, our SG&A was down 3%, but our demand creation was up 1%. We expect demand creation to continue to lead our SG&A growth over the next few quarters.\nThe other thing I would just add, you know, is when I think of investment, I'm thinking up and down the P&L, and we are making meaningful investments beginning in the third quarter to clean up the marketplace. That means liquidating inventory. That means our sales return reserves in order to be able to clear aged inventory so we can create space to sell in our new assortments, and the innovation that we're excited about in Fall and Holiday 2025.\nIt also means planning for markdowns in our factory stores. That's reflected in the guidance that we provided for Q3. We do expect that to continue for the near term until we can get ourselves back to a balanced and repositioned business to drive growth. Looking forward to.\n\nOperator\n\nFrom Bank of America, Lorraine Hutchinson has the next question.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks, Elliott. You're accelerating a lot of the work around lifestyle in fiscal 2025, but how much incremental pressure do you expect on 2026 sales? Based on your analysis of the pipeline, when will newness gain sufficient scale to offset that pressure?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThanks, Lorraine. Again, as we look at where we are today, we've touched on it a number of times already, and the concentration that we have in a few key franchise styles and one of the core competencies that we have at Nike is franchise management. It's foundational to this company, and as we already talked about, we're taking actions to reduce the amount of inventory in the marketplace, which then opens up shelf space, open-to-buy for new, innovative product. I am excited about the product that is coming.\nWe have three brands that we can choose that we can drive from Nike, Jordan, and Converse, from performance to Sportswear with over 10 different sports, men's, women's, kids, footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and up and down price points. I've seen now the product that's coming from.\nOur fields of play, I was able to sit through a Fall 2025, a few of the presentations with our key retailers, and they're excited about the product that's coming, and it will be led with Running, Training, and sportswear. I think these small cross-functional teams are doing a really nice job of now starting to flow innovative product into the marketplace. That's the quickest way to return to health.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nLorraine, we took another step forward this quarter.\nThose three franchises decelerated at a rate that was faster than the overall business for the second straight quarter. The rate this quarter was greater than we drove in the first quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, that has had a disproportionate effect on the Nike Digital business results because of the concentration of those franchises on digital.\nWhat we had highlighted was that these actions would result in a mid single digit headwind on our financials for the balance of this year. You know, with Elliott being 60 days in and looking at the current plans and where he wants to take our product portfolio, we have accelerated those actions. I expect the impact to be bigger for the balance of this year.\nYou know, getting very sharp and specific on reducing the weeks of supply over the next few seasons to ensure that across the entire marketplace these franchises are back at a healthy full price level. I made a comment in my prepared remarks that Summer 2025 is down slightly versus the prior year, and that reflects this accelerated level of actions that Elliott outlined. I'd note that even with these actions, we almost offset it by the contribution of newness and innovation. Even that as a signal for me gives me confidence that the work we started over a year ago to build the pipeline.Is taking root with our partners.\n\nOperator\n\nAdrienne Yih from Barclays has the next question.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you very much. Elliot, welcome. Look forward to meeting you.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Adrienne.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nYou're welcome. I apologize. My phone's crackly. Sorry about that. I appreciate the notion of margins before sales. When we look at kind of what you're doing, you're accelerating sort of the reset actions. When you get to the fall of next year, do you have the proven innovation at scale to replace what you are liquidating now and then? Matt, is there a reset inventory provision that's happening right now in the gross margin? Excuse me. Kind of to wrap that all up, it would very much seem that you are going for those margins before sales. When we think about FY 2026, I think it would be rightfully the right thought to think that sales would be down again.\nIf you're going for margins, as you say, you know, healthy bedrock margins before you drive the top line growth. Thank you.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThanks.\nHey, Matt, how about if I take the first part of it, I'll hit product and then.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nOkay.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nSo.\nWe outlined the idea of fields of play and taking each of our sports and further segmenting them by men's, women's, and kids, and putting tight, small teams against each one of those segments of business. That fortunately has already started. That started over 12 months ago. Because of that, we're starting to see those teams deliver the innovation.\nThey're taking the insights from the consumers that they serve in each of those fields of play, and we're starting to see the product come through the marketplace. It started in Spring and Summer. As it relates to fall, as you referenced, great confidence around running, especially on the footwear side of our business structure: Peg, Vomero, three different price points, a lineup that includes a really strong trail lineup. We have a leading business in racing, both flats and spikes.\nOur training, of course, is led with Metcon and continues to be a strength of ours in training. Along with our apparel that's coming along with that, we have some new concepts around comfort, style, and performance. Basketball is another one that excites me, and it's maybe the best example of this field of play working.\nLet me start with men's and our portfolio. You have Jordan with Tatum and Luka coming, and then the Nike brand, of course, LeBron, Kobe, Ja, Booker, and a new GT Series. I'm really excited about the basketball lineup. What is really fun for me to see coming back new is to see us running this gender offense. We've launched a women's basketball program, which I didn't think we'd ever do. Sabrina, Matt already touched on it. Number two shoe in the NBA.\nThen we have A'ja and Caitlin coming back from behind, and behind that sportswear, a new lineup around Look of Court, Look of Basketball, Look of Football, including the Field General. Net net is the product's coming, and we're gaining confidence with each season.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah. From a financial implication perspective, Adrienne, I guess, couple thoughts. You know, first, you know, as I said, a number of these actions we had underway and Elliott has provided a perspective that we accelerate them. Some of these actions are new actions, like moving more aggressively to reposition Nike Direct and Nike Digital in particular as a premium channel.\nWith him being 60 days in, you know, we are continuing to take time to understand the impact of those actions. We remain committed to be transparent and provide guidance on a 90 day basis as it relates to, you know.Kind of what's in the third quarter.Outlook and how quickly are we moving.\nYou know, with revenues being down low double digits and our margins being down 300 to 350 basis points, we are certainly accelerating some of these actions, but some of these actions are going to take time to carry all the way through. Our focus is on getting.Back to a healthy marketplace and getting.\nBack to a full price business, both in our partners, and importantly in Nike Direct, because we believe that will elevate the entire marketplace and create a foundation for growth. We're very focused on our inventory because we know that a healthy inventory is absolutely critical for us in order to be able to present the right assortment for consumers and to give our new innovation and our new seasonal product.\nThe best presentation across the entire marketplace.\nThat's what's been reflected in our third quarter financials. I'll just reiterate a point I made in my prepared remarks, which is, you know, I said that we expect a greater headwind in the fourth quarter.\nAs compared to the third.That's because the timing of implementing these actions are different across different geographies and different timelines.\nYou heard me talk about the product portfolio rebalancing being ahead in APLA or our repositioning the digital business being ahead in Europe. As we look ahead from what we can see today to the fourth quarter, we expect the headwinds to be larger in the fourth quarter than the third quarter guide that we provided.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jay Sole, UBS.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nTerrific. Thank you so much for taking my question, Elliott. You know, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you know, you're willing to take some actions in the near term that will hurt in order to do what's best for the brand and the company over the long term.\nHistory of Nike is that, you know, the company has always tried to balance short term earnings with sort of long term investment. The question is how far are you willing to take the actions in the short term to really put the business on that sustainable path you're talking about to, you know, to drive. Like in other words, how long are you willing to sort of take the actions in terms of resetting the marketplace, you know, making investments in key cities, you know, rebuilding brand marketing?\nIs there a limit, and is there a sort of a balance you're thinking to strike, or are you willing to go 100% to just do the right thing, whatever it costs to put the company back on the path to winning? Sorry, that's a long question, but hopefully that made sense.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThat's all right. No worries. Here's how I'd love for all of you to think about it. I want you to know we're acting with a sense of urgency, and you've heard Matt talk about the different moves that we're making around inventory, et cetera. I think the biggest takeaway, hopefully, is that we're putting sport back at the center of everything that we're doing.\nOur product offense, we are going to lead with sport, and we'll do that through our sport Fields of Play. We've got the cross-functional teams, and you can see now already the investments that we've made there, and we'll continue to make there, are starting to pay dividends as we roll it through Spring and Summer 2025 into Fall and Holiday 2025. From a marketing perspective, we will continue to invest in big, bold brand ideas.\nWe touched on some of the activities that have already taken place and some of the, excuse me, marketing campaigns. The winning isn't comfortable and won an award at Advertising Age for 2024 Ad of the Year. Feeling good about where we're heading. We've made investments in sports marketing.\nWe continue to do that, and then of course through the marketplace and investing in the marketplace is doing the things that we've already talked about, pulling inventory out, return to vendor. It's also investing in new product marketing, in-store presentation, both at a strategic account level that covers an entire country, and then down to the city level, which includes.\nSpecialty accounts, which we are making some investments in, running specialty, we've started in North America. I think it's going to take time, but I am confident that we are making the right moves and the right shifts to drive this brand, this business forward.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nJay, the way I think about,\nThe implications on our financials in the near term, I break these actions down between two buckets. I would say there are near term headwinds that we will endure as a result of the repositioning of our channel mix and our product portfolio, and those will create headwinds and are creating headwinds right now. We expect that as we recalibrate the portfolio of both our channels, meaning Nike Direct and wholesale, or our product, that those headwinds will end and then.\nWe have transitory headwinds, which are the.Actions that we're taking to clean up the marketplace in inventory as well as some of the supply chain deleverage that we're experiencing as our sales decline, which we would expect to recapture as our business returns to growth. I think that hopefully it's a helpful way to think about, you know, what we're looking at here. We're definitely focused on both of those dimensions, and confident that these actions, you know, will reposition Nike and also, you know, provide opportunity for us once we've completed what we've set forward to do.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up is Matthew Boss, J.P. Morgan.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks, Elliott. Maybe could you help rank the Fields of Play opportunities you see by category, and then just on the long-term view, what's a reasonable timeline to realign inventory to pull market, and then after, for the product pipeline and the marketing investments to return to sustainable, profitable growth?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah, Sure, let me hit the Fields of Play. We have a number of Fields of Play, and we have a sharp focus on five. We see those as our biggest opportunities, from running to basketball to football, that's global football or soccer, training, and sportswear. We will break each one of those Fields of Play down by men's, women's, and kids. What we're most excited about is.\nNot only the product innovation that's coming out of there, but the merchandising opportunities that we have. For example, there are moments when we need to show up as a running brand, footwear, apparel, accessories, men's, women's, kids. There are moments when we need to show up as a women's brand. This offense allows us to do both of those and will unlock incremental growth for both our brand and our business moving forward. In terms of the Fields of Play, those are sharp focus in the near term, and we are learning and growing this offense and be able to apply it to more sports in the future. We're excited about it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is Jonathan Komp, Baird.\n\nJonathan Komp\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah, hi, good afternoon.\nI want to follow up on the ultimate sort of margin recapture potential, if you will. I'm just curious, Elliott, as you look at some of the moves the past few years as the brand is focused on.\nWhere the product's being sold more in the digital channel specifically, and today, as you look at the organizational structure.Around supply chain and distribution, are there sort of unique opportunities to become more efficient, or is it purely going to.Be, you know, getting back to growth.To scale some of the investments from.The past few years?\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc",
    "content2": "Hey, here's what I'd say. No question, growth certainly will help. I believe the moves and are confident that the moves that we're making will help set us up for long term, sustainable, and profitable growth. The product, the marketing, the clean marketplace.\nOne of the moves that I did make is one of the first leadership moves I made. I had Venkatesh Alagirisamy, who's now our chief supply chain officer, reporting directly to me. He looks at everything from factory transportation all the way through to logistics to the consumer. It certainly will be, I've only been here 60 days, but it'll certainly be a focus as we move forward as an opportunity for margin expansion.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nCFO, Nike Inc\n\nJohn, you know, if you look over history, we've consistently been a double digit margin company. And you know, when I think of the actions that we're taking in the marketplace today, you know.\nThere are a number of opportunities as we look forward to. Specifically, we talked several years ago about the profitability of selling a product through the digital channel. That math is relying upon it being a full price sale. To take the point that Elliott made around the business being 50% full price and 50% off price today, the profitability of the channel has significantly been challenged over the past several quarters.\nIn addition to cleaning up the inventory, there's certainly a margin rate benefit opportunity within Nike Direct to run, albeit a smaller, but a healthier and more profitable business. That includes opportunities our teams are working on to continue to drive the cost of fulfillment down, as well as being less reliant upon paid media and performance marketing in order to be able to drive the top line.\nLeveraging the investments that we're making in our brand to drive organic top of funnel traffic to us and to our partners.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up is Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nVP of Equity Reseach, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for taking our question. Elliott, was hoping you could speak to any specific actions that you'll be taking either in the North America or Greater China geographies as you look to accelerate some of these actions over the course of the next 12 months. Thank you.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah. I'll take North America first.\nWe have a new leader, Tom Peddie, leading North America. He has a deep, long history with Nike and a lot of experience. He's led in North America before. I can tell you this, he and his team are being aggressive in all the actions that we've outlined in terms of cleaning up that marketplace, building back the relationships with our wholesale partners, investing in the brand, elevating Nike Direct, and they'll start moving there.\nIn spring, in January. Resetting Nike Direct, leveraging the relationships, investing in RSG, which is running specialty. We've invested in EKINs on the ground game, investing in the brand. We touched on a bunch of that Liberty, Dodgers wins, and the shift's going to take time, but I'm really confident in Tom and his team's ability to execute across product, brand, marketplace, and to get North America back to growth in terms of China.\nHey, we are all, we continue to be excited about China long term. There are 1.3 billion consumers, and our biggest opportunity is to invite those consumers into the world of sport, and the lifestyle of sport, and to grow the overall marketplace, and when we do that, I like our chances of growing.\nWe were just in China and there's no question it's also a promotional marketplace. The competitors have both international and local increased, and it's a place that I've spent a tremendous amount of time. I've been in China market since 2002 and had some deep experiences in China in 2006 and 2008 getting ready for the 08 August 2008 Olympics and led a reset plan in China and a growth plan there. In the end, I have confidence in the teammates to help get this business back to growth. It will start as it always does with product innovation, and we are investing with China in product innovation. Not only the product from the globe, but we have a local.\nWhat we call GEL Geo Express Lane. It's a local product creation team on the ground creating product for China. We also have a Sports Research Lab, we call it the NSRL Nike Sport Research Lab that is doing of China research in terms of gait, foot, forearm, et cetera. We're making product of China for China, and then big brand bold statements match. Matt touched on some of them, Shanghai Marathon, et cetera. I think our biggest, biggest after product becomes the marketplace, we have got to reset bigger, bolder, consumer-led Nike concepts.\nThat represent the full expression of the Nike brand, have the service and the experience that we expect that will drive.The performance and the productivity of those doors. The good news is I've just met, I was over there and I met with.Topsports and with Pou Sheng, our two biggest partners, and they're ready to go. Long-winded answer, but I think it all comes back to what we were talking to in both of these geographies. It comes down to product management, it comes down to brand management, and it comes back to marketplace management.\n\nOperator\n\nNow we'll hear from Ike Boruchow, Wells Fargo.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thanks, thanks so much for taking the question. Elliott, great to hear from you. Actually, two questions I think for Matt. Just follow ups on the guide. When you talked about the expense guide for the third quarter, I just want to make sure I understand, is that relative to the $4.2 billion in expenses of last year?\nBecause I know there was a restructuring charge that some of us took out. Just trying to understand the growth up slightly or down slightly is relative to what dollar number, and then just a follow up to that is when you talked about greater headwinds relative to Q3, I think that was in the sentence of talking about revenue, gross margin, and demand gen spend.Was the comment meant to encapsulate all three of those line items, or was it really meant for revenue or gross margin, or something more specific?Thank you.\n\nElliott Hill\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nYes, Ike, on your first question, the SG&A guide relates to the full amount including the restructuring charge in the prior year.\nAs it relates to your second question, the answer is yes. As I mentioned, these actions are happening, you know, on different timelines across different regions. Based on what we can see today, we think.\nThe net impact of these actions across revenue, margin, and demand creation.Will be larger in the fourth quarter than they are in the third quarter. The year over year impact is another way to take it. The year over year impact when you compare to the prior year will be more significant in the fourth quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude the question and answer session as well as today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.\n[Audio Playing]"

Welcome to Nike, Inc.'s Fiscal 2024 Q4 conference call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike, Inc.'s Fiscal 2024 Q4 results. Joining us on today's call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe and our CFO Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in Nike's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information.\nPlease refer to Nike's earnings press release or Nike's website investors.nike.com for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliation. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. I want to start by briefly commenting on our financial results for full year Fiscal 2024. Revenue grew approximately 1% on a currency neutral basis, and earnings per share grew 15%. Q4 revenue was flat for the quarter. We saw strong gains within performance product. However, this is more than offset by declines in Lifestyle. These declines had a pronounced impact on our digital results. These factors, when combined with increased macro uncertainty and worsening foreign exchange, have caused us to reduce our guidance for Fiscal 2025. Matt will provide more detail on our results and outlook later in the call.\nWhile Fiscal 25 will be a transition year for our business, we continue to make real progress on our comeback. Over the past year we've highlighted the strategic shifts we're taking as a company, including leadership and organization changes, kick-starting a multiyear innovation cycle, and creating capacity to invest in consumer-facing activities. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we're making a series of adjustments to position us to compete and win. We're sharpening our focus on sport, accelerating our pace and scaling of newness and innovation, driving bigger, bolder storytelling, and elevating the entire marketplace to fuel brand distinction and be in the path of the consumer.\nThis is our playbook, and we're seeing momentum build in all four areas, particularly on the performance side of our product portfolio. We have work to do, but we're on it. Our teams are moving with energy and urgency against the opportunity we see in front of us. Now as we discussed over the past few quarters, we've been accelerating our innovation pipeline, including pulling forward several innovations, some more than a year. We're moving aggressively to re-establish our innovation edge. We began with a focus on performance as Nike always does, and the early results from newness and innovation are encouraging. Performance grew double digits in the quarter with growth in many of our key sports.\nAs we kicked off our multi-year innovation cycle, one of our key priorities has been increasing our speed to the consumer. We believe accelerating the pace and consistency of our innovation will allow us to deliver impact at scale season after season. Now as you know, for years Nike has had an Express Lane which enables short lead-time replenishment, and hyper-local design, and we'll continue to leverage Express Lane. Over the past year we have also built a new way of working across the entire product creation process. We call this Speed Lane, and it's part of a broader company-wide effort to move faster and be more responsive to the consumer.\nFor example, through Speed Lane we're leveraging our Bowerman Footwear Lab to accelerate design, we're leveraging advanced digital tools to quicken development, and we're leveraging key manufacturing partners to speed up product testing and production. We've already accelerated a half a dozen models for this new capability, and in the second half of the fiscal year you'll see other new innovations come out of Speed Lane, including several exciting new franchises across Fitness and Lifestyle.\nAs I've mentioned, our sharp focus around newness and innovation starts with performance and we're seeing the impact across key sports. Let me give you a few brief examples across three: Basketball, Fitness, and Running. First, Basketball, which was up double-digit growth in Q4 across Men's, Women's, Kids', and Jordan. This was driven by new innovation from the G.T. Cut to Kobe's new footwear and apparel to the Sabrina 1, which in itself has taken two points of share across the entire US Basketball market including both Men's and Women's. We recently announced Sabrina's next shoe as well as A'ja Wilson signature franchise and we announced the signing of Caitlin Clark to a roster of athletes that was already the game's best.\nAll this energy will continue to fuel the rapid growth of our Women's Basketball business as excitement around the WNBA soars to historic highs amidst an expanding fan base. Of course, this month's Jayson vs. Luka NBA Finals matchup marked the first time Jordan's signature athletes met on Basketball's pinnacle stage. We celebrated Jayson's title with one of the Jordan Brand's biggest marketing efforts ever.\nNext, let's look at our Fitness business. Fitness represents one of the largest market share opportunities we see as a company, particularly for our female consumer. We've made intentional decisions to make meaningful investments in Fitness, and these actions are paying off. Over the past quarter, we saw broad-based growth for Fitness led by double-digit growth in apparel. For example, statement leggings, which is a key focus for us, were up high double digits in Q4, led by innovations we've introduced over the past few quarters with Universa, Zenvy, and Go. Women's Fitness footwear also had a strong quarter driven by Motiva and the latest version of Free Metcon, which came out last summer. Free Metcon is now Nike's number one Women's Fitness shoe, having expanded from the gym to the street.\nNext, let's look at Road Running, which remains a competitive battlefield, but we are playing to win. In past calls, we've discussed that we're now aligned, resourced, and taking this challenge head on with confidence. We've been hustling to accelerate our Running innovations and amplify our ground game. While our overall Running business was impacted in Q4 by our proactive actions to manage the Pegasus portfolio transition, we're pleased that recent new releases in Vomero, Invincible, Infinity, and Structure all grew high double digits over the quarter. We're making it easier for consumers to discover these styles by simplifying our Running construct at retail as we highlight our best-in-class cushioning technologies.\nNow, as you know, a few weeks ago we launched the Pegasus 41, a new chapter for Nike's biggest performance franchise. Pegasus 41 pairs Zoom Air with full length ReactX foam for a ride that's more comfortable, durable, and responsive than ever. It's received strong reviews from industry experts. We supported the Pegasus 41 with our full playbook, backed by Nike's most comprehensive Running campaign in years, which will last for several seasons. It was also fueled by a refreshed ground game. This included neighborhood activations to drive consumer trialing at scale and building energy across the full marketplace including Nike Direct, our strategic partners, and our performance authenticators such as Running specialty doors. This energy drove Pegasus 41 to a strong start, led by better than expected sell through in both wholesale and Nike Direct.\nOur full Running journey for Fiscal 2025 goes beyond the Pegasus 41 launch. We'll be adding several dimensions for Pegasus in holiday before introducing additional exciting innovations in the second half of the year, including Pegasus Premium, and Vomero 18. We're already seeing strong wholesale order book for Running across the next few seasons as we continue to take meaningful strides to assert our leadership in this key sport.\nNow let's talk about Lifestyle where we're focused on building a more diversified Lifestyle footwear portfolio to complement the industry's three largest franchises. We're excited about our pipeline of new Lifestyle products. A key example was last quarter's introduction of Dynamic Air, our newest breakthrough innovation platform. We launched the Air Max Dn globally, and within just a few months Dn has become a top 10 Lifestyle franchise in our Men's business and is resonating particularly well with sneaker-engaged consumers in major cities. And importantly, Dynamic Air is an innovation platform. We're already working on the next two iterations of Dynamic Air and we will.\nContinue to innovate on this platform, including customizing air cushioning to create unique consumer benefits. Another component of fueling a more diversified Lifestyle portfolio is taking advantage of Nike's unmatched vault. One example is retro Running. We saw an opportunity in the marketplace for retro and moved quickly and nimbly to fill it with our Y2K portfolio, and consumers are responding. We experienced significant quarter-over-quarter retail sales growth for Y2K and now expect to nearly triple our retro Running business by the end of Fiscal 2025 compared with the start of Fiscal 2024. Now, while we are growing new Lifestyle offerings, we're also accelerating planned reductions for our three largest franchises, and this will have a meaningful impact near term on our overall Lifestyle growth rate.\nNow, while we have work to do, we are very focused on scaling the newness to offset this planned reduction and we're excited about the pipeline with exciting footwear concepts coming in the second half of Fiscal 2025. Finally, the Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world. This is led by breakthrough innovation and announced by a brand campaign that you won't be able to miss. We recently unveiled our A.I.R. for Athletes innovation at our Nike On Air event in Paris, and we can't wait to bring all this Olympics product to life across the Games and in more than 8,000 doors worldwide, and throughout, our brand storytelling will be bold and clear. With sport and athletes at the very center of it all. From brand voice to retail activations, this summer we will cut through the clutter to create powerful energy for the Nike brand.\nWe're back doing what we do best, creating impactful storytelling and ultimately brand distinction in sport. In the end, we're taking our challenges head on and we're regaining our edge. Thanks to the heart and hustle of our global team, we're aggressively asserting the future of Nike. With passion, clarity, and grit. We're driving this business forward. We're excited about the opportunity in front of us and we're eager to prove what Nike can do. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nThanks John, and hello to everyone on the call. For Nike, Fiscal 2024 was a pivotal year to get back on the offense in sport with consumers led by an urgency to accelerate our pace of innovation and scale newness across our product line. Today, our playbook is in motion, our teams are focused and hustling to deliver. We're seeing positive signals from consumers and retail partners across the world. That said, this quarter we have been navigating several headwinds which we now expect to have a more pronounced impact on Fiscal 2025.\nAlthough the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning Nike to be more competitive with a more balanced portfolio to drive sustainable profitable long-term growth. Let me provide some deeper insights into the Q4 and the implications we see as we look forward before reviewing our financial results and our outlook. First, after double-digit growth over the past several years, our Lifestyle business declined in Q4 across Men's, Women's, and Jordan. More than offsetting strong growth in our sport performance business. Second, Nike Digital declined 10% in the quarter.\nAlthough our digital business has grown at an approximately 26% CAGR since Fiscal 2019. We missed our Q4 plan on softer traffic, higher promotions, and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises. More specifically, these franchises underperformed our overall digital business results in the quarter, especially in April and May and continuing on into early June. This is even as these franchises continue to drive retail sales growth at high full-price realization in multi-brand retail. Third, we experienced meaningful shifts in consumer traffic in key markets, particularly in Greater China where brick-and-mortar traffic declined as much as double-digits versus the prior year.\nWe also continue to see uneven trends in EMEA and other markets around the world. Last, foreign exchange headwinds worsened, creating an additional one-point headwind on revenue in the quarter. In the midst of these dynamics, our goals to return to strong growth remain the same. Read and react to the consumer, maximize full price sales across all channels, protect long-term franchise health, prioritize a healthy pull market, and create marketplace capacity for new products and new stories coming in Fiscal 2025.\nTherefore, despite continued marketplace demand, we are advancing our timelines to tighten total supply of certain classic footwear franchises at different paces across different channels around the world. In particular, we are aggressively adjusting our forward-looking plans for these franchises on Nike Digital where they have their highest share of business. All told, we expect these actions to create several points of short-term headwinds on revenue in Fiscal 2025. However, our past experience gives us confidence that proactively rebalancing our portfolio will strengthen our competitive position and fuel brand momentum as we take the consumer somewhere new.\nLet me share a few recent examples. Back in Fiscal 2018, we recalibrated the supply of select Jordan Brand franchises, resetting our launch business and bringing more dimension to our portfolio. Over the subsequent quarters, we turned the page from double-digit declines in the brand to the start of multiple consecutive years of strong double-digit growth. Earlier this year we moved quickly to reshape our Lifestyle footwear portfolio in Japan and Korea, two of our most trend-forward markets where our teams lead reacted to consumer signals.\nWe reduced supply of some classic franchises while scaling and creating new energy around other models in our vault. In the Q4, we regained our number one position in Korea in Women's Lifestyle footwear and extended our lead in Japan with new momentum heading into Fiscal 2025. Now, as we accelerate our pace of newness and innovation, the early response from consumers and partners are reinforcing our optimism in Nike's path forward. First, the sharper focus on sport is creating impact. This quarter performance grew across Men's, Women's, Kids, and Jordan across all channels and geographies and we expect to build on that momentum leading with performance in Fiscal 2025.\nWe're seeing favorable indicators in key focus areas including strong double-digit growth in order books with North American Running specialty partners in both holiday 2024 and spring 2025. In Lifestyle, fresh releases are resonating positively with consumers. For instance, new executions around retro Running and field franchises such as Cortez, Killshot and the Field General are driving strong retail sales growth as we prepare to scale these franchises in Fiscal 2025. Our teams are also attacking opportunities across price points, including a refreshed lineup of new footwear products below $100. Building on this quarter's double-digit growth, we plan to scale new performance and Lifestyle models in spring 2025.\nAdded up, we expect the business contribution from new products to more than double from the start of Fiscal 2024 to where we end the year in Fiscal 2025. Last, we are managing expenses tightly through this product cycle transition while reallocating resources to maximize consumer impact. This is enabled by our Save to Invest initiative, which is creating investment capacity to fuel our next phase of growth. At the end of Fiscal 2024 we have unlocked savings from initiatives up and down our P&L and across our value chain from reducing small parcel fulfillment costs to consolidating suppliers, optimizing technology spend, and restructuring our organization to streamline layers and support functions.\nIn turn, we are reinvesting nearly $1 billion in consumer-facing activities in Fiscal 2025, which we expect to accelerate our return to strong growth. This includes ramping up our ground game offense and Running in key cities, increasing resources in design, product creation, and merchandising for our key sport dimensions, deepening our sports marketing portfolio, elevating the distinction of our brand in physical retail, and driving bigger, bolder brand campaigns starting with EC24 and the Paris Olympics. Now let me turn to our Nike, Inc. Q4 results. In Q4, Nike Inc. revenue was down 2% on a reported basis, and flat on a currency-neutral basis.\nNike Direct was down 7%, Nike stores were down 2%, and Nike Digital was down 10%. Wholesale grew 8%. Gross margins expanded 110 basis points to 44.7% on a reported basis primarily due to strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates, and improved supply chain efficiency, partially offset by lower margins in Nike Direct, unfavorable channel mix and net foreign exchange impact. SG&A was down 7% on a reported basis as increased investment in demand creation was more than offset by reductions in operational overhead.\nThis includes impact from approximately $40 million in restructuring charges. Our effective tax rate was 13.1% compared to 17.3% for the same period last year due to changes in earnings mix. Partially offset by decreased benefits from one-time items such as stock-based compensation. Diluted earnings per share was $0.99, up 50% versus the prior year. This includes non-material impact from restructuring charges. For the full year revenue was flat on a reported basis and up 1% on a currency neutral basis.\nDiluted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion, up 27% versus the prior year on significant improvements in working capital. Inventory declined 11% versus the prior year with continued improvement in days in inventory. Now, let me turn to the operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 1%. Nike Direct was down 9%, with Nike Digital down 11%, and Nike Stores down 5%. Wholesale grew 6% due to accelerated shipping timing from Q1 of Fiscal 2025 and EBIT grew 5% on a reported basis. This quarter we saw softer traffic in our factory stores, highlighting increasing pressure being felt by the value consumer.\nThat said, we saw a number of bright spots as well, including strong growth in Basketball, Fitness, and Kids offset by declines in Lifestyle in Jordan. Kids led our results in the geography with performance in Men's of strong double digits. In Women's Fitness, we gained market share in footwear, in Men's and Women's Running fall footwear bookings are up double digits, led by the Pegasus 41. In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 1%. Nike Direct was down 8% as Nike Stores grew 1% and Nike Digital declined 14%. Wholesale grew 7%, EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis. In a cautious macro environment, we are seeing performance innovation drive strong sell through.\nThis is partially offset by overall declines in Lifestyle, with new product releases working well. Global Football grew double digits across Men's and Kids. In Women's Fitness, we drove strong momentum in footwear and new apparel releases such as our refreshed Nike Pro line. In Lifestyle, our retro Running franchises continue to scale and our Air Max Dn launch drove energy with a full marketplace takeover.\nIn Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 7%, including several points of contribution from Tmall's earlier start to the 618 shopping holiday. Excluding this timing benefit, we fell short of our plan with traffic softness persisting across all marketplace channels. Nike Direct declined 2% with Nike stores down 6% and Nike Digital up 8%. Wholesale grew 15%. EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis with continued impacts from foreign exchange.\nOur Kids business set the pace in the geography this quarter led by Running and Basketball, within Men's and Women's Lifestyle, retro Running styles and our latest Express Lane releases drove positive consumer response, and in Men's and Women's Running, retail sales for our new releases: Structure, Vomero, and Invincible grew double digits.\nThe China marketplace remains highly promotional and we continue to manage both Nike and partner inventory carefully. While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in Nike's competitive position in China in the long term. In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 4%, Nike Direct declined 3% with Nike Stores up 11% and Nike Digital down 12%. Wholesale grew 9% and EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis. Mexico, Southeast Asia, and India led our growth in the geography, and across APLA we drove strong momentum in performance with Men's Basketball, Men's Global Football, and Women's Fitness up double-digits.\nJordan brand drove energy with streetball activations in Tokyo and Manila and market share gains in Basketball footwear. Now let me turn to our Fiscal 2025 financial outlook. We are managing a product cycle transition with complexity amplified by shifting channel mix dynamics. A comeback at this scale takes time. With this in mind, we've considered a number of factors and scenarios in revising our outlook for Fiscal 2025. Most importantly, this includes timelines and pacing to manage marketplace supply of our classic footwear franchises.\nLower Nike digital growth, especially in the first half of the year, due to lower traffic on fewer launches, planned declineso f classic footwear franchises, given Q4 trends. As well as reduced promotional activity, increased macro uncertainty, particularly in Greater China with uneven consumer trends continuing in EMEA and other markets around the world and sell into wholesale partners as we scale product innovation and newness across the marketplace and finalize second half order books. Taking all of this into consideration, we now expect Fiscal 2025 reported revenue to be down mid single digits with the first half down high single-digits.\nForeign exchange headwinds have also worsened and will now have a one-point translational impact on revenue in Fiscal 2025. Turning to gross margin, we expect full year expansion of approximately 10 to 30 basis points on a reported basis. This reflects benefits from strategic pricing actions and lower product input costs partially offset by supply chain deleverage, channel mix shifts, and net foreign exchange impact. We expect full year SG&A growth to be up slightly versus the prior year, as we increase investments in demand creation to ignite brand momentum and maximize reach and impact, while holding operating overhead largely flat.\nOther income and expense including net interest income is expected to be approximately $250 million to $300 million for the year. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. Now turning to our first quarter, we expect Q1 revenue to be down approximately 10%. This reflects more aggressive actions in managing our classic footwear franchises continuing challenges on Nike Digital muted wholesale order books with newness not yet at scale, a softer outlook in Greater China, and a number of quarter-specific timing factors.\nWe expect Q1 gross margins to be in line with the full year guidance, and we expect Q1 SG&A to be up mid-single digits as we hold operating overhead flat while investing in key brand moments including EC24 and the Paris Olympic Games. For Nike, inspiration starts with the athletes we serve, their dreams motivate us to create the most innovative product in sport and tell stories that reach millions of people around the world. Above all, they remind us of the hard work and the hustle that is required to win. Before I close, I'd like to thank our Nike teammates whose passion and drive are the fuel for our comeback. The heart, the focus, and the collaboration that I'm seeing from our teams today are my greatest reasons for confidence as we move forward. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please, please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe John, just to summarize and think about relative to three months back, I guess how would you rank changes on the macro front and similarly on Nike execution that impacted the change in your 2025 outlook today relative to three months ago? And then Matt, just on the gross margin, could you just help break apart maybe the puts and takes to consider over the course of 2025 and how best to model the cadence from a gross margin perspective?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nWell, thanks Matthew. You know, we set out our what we're calling our comeback plan a year ago, and in the last 90 days I would say our execution continues to stay on pace. Matt, you can talk about macro, and the franchise management impacting the numbers, but on the fundamental things we set out to do, four things that we are moving aggressively on one, put sport back at the center of everything we do, serving the athlete, and over the last 90 days we completed completely aligning our organization along the lines of sport, are co-locating those teams, and now end to end have clear what we call field of play sport based field of play teams end-to-end, which is accelerating our pace and also improving our execution.\nAs we talked about the last couple quarters, we've reignited our innovation pipeline including pulling several innovations forward. So in addition to launching Air Max Dn and Pegasus 41 during the quarter or early this quarter, we'll also pull forward key innovations like the Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18, which are just two examples of what's coming in spring 2025. And as I mentioned earlier, speed is a capability we're building which we feel increasingly strong about, and brand is getting strong with Euro Champs, you see our Awaken Your Madness campaign, which is really the first of the bigger, bolder brand voice you're going to hear, and then we're very excited about the Olympics coming.\nA lot of the work that went into the Olympics happened in Q4, but you're going to get to see it in a few weeks. And then on Marketplace we've spent a lot of time leaning in with our wholesale partners. We've had several wholesale partner summits, we've had RSG groups, neighborhood partners, and authenticators to campus. We're exposing our three-year product innovation pipeline to them, and feedback's been very strong. Our order book for holiday spring 2025, holiday 2024 spring 2025 is strong, and so our confidence is building. So on the fundamentals that we are executing against this proven playbook on a comeback that will take time, we feel like we've made strong progress.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nAnd just hitting the financial implications relative to 90 days ago, last quarter we said that we thought revenue was going to be down low single digits in the first half, and that included a more pronounced impact in the first quarter. We also said that we expected revenue to grow and what we saw in the Q4 were really two things. One, Lifestyle: our Lifestyle business declining more pronounced on Nike Digital, specifically in April, in May, and those trends continuing into June. What I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that those specific classic franchises that we were talking about underperformed our overall digital business results in the Q4.\nAnd so when we look at our updated guidance of down mid-single-digits for the full year. There's really three things that are driving the change. One, I'll start with FX. Our outlook on foreign exchange and the strength of the US dollar had a one-point impact relative to 90 days ago. We've softened our outlook for Greater China, and that also similarly had a level of impact for the full year guidance. And then the majority of the remainder of the change is related to the more aggressive actions that we're taking on our key franchises across the total marketplace. But really, with the compounded impact on total Digital, and the bigger impact of this will be in the first half of this year, but we are planning for meaningful sequential improvement in the second half of the year.\nThat's how I think about the revenue differences relative to the revenue differences relative to what we said 90 days ago. On Q1, the other impact was timing and we saw the 618 period come earlier into May than we had in the prior year. That had an impact on Q4's results but also an impact on Q1's results. We saw some favorable shipment timing in North America as we prepare to go live with our ERP and also just better general product availability. So that also had an impact on the Q1 numbers.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nI just want to add one more thing that Matthew, you've heard Matt and I both talk about it. It's an intangible thing, but I think it's just so important, which is the heart and hustle of our team, which has just been extraordinary over the last year, but also in the last 90 days, just accelerating both Heidi's and Craig's teams, the teamwork of how they're working together, end-to-end, the.ocus and focus on the consumer, the increasing speed, pulling things forward. There's a palpable shift in the confidence and forward-looking nature of our team. So, I want to give huge credit to them. But also just recognize that is so important in Nike, and our teams are, I think, feeling more confident each day comes along.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nRetail Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Can you provide some numbers that might help us build confidence in the meaningful second half improvements? How much less of a headwind is there from sunsetting some of these franchises? How do total order books look and anything you can provide numerically that helped you to get to that back half improvement?\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nWell, Lorraine, as I mentioned, you know, we've looked at a number of different factors and scenarios as we've updated our guidance for the year, that ranges from looking at different slopes of different curves of different products over time and developing a perspective on how we think the trends are going to play out as it relates to some of our largest franchises. But those franchises continue to drive retail sales growth and high levels of full price realization in the marketplace. So the bigger impact on the first half are the adjustments that we're taking to manage the health of those franchises, starting first with Nike Digital. And that has a pronounced impact on revenue, which is creating a more meaningful first half impact.\nWe want to continue to let those franchises in the multi-brand environment continue to have the impact that they're having for our partners. One of the ways that we maintain the health of those is by reducing what we're offering to consumers through our digital channel as it relates to the second half. You know, we highlighted a couple of things, but we are planning for meaningful sequential improvement in the second half versus the first half. It starts with the confidence that we have around the new products that we're bringing to market: the Pegasus 41, the Pegasus Premium, the Vomero 18, the order book for Air Max Dn, plus the next Air Max iteration that's going to be coming to market, plus our plans to scale, to scale the innovation and the newness that we've been discussing.\nAnd so when we look at where we are today and the ways in which we're working to drive this plan through the balance of the fiscal year, our scaling of newness is on track and our teams are hustling to see whether there's even opportunities to accelerate the scaling of that newness in the second half.\nWe are confident in the indicators that we're seeing in the marketplace right now. We gave you a couple of specific numbers as it relates to Running and Running specialty, but what I will tell you is that our initial read of our spring order book is in line with the guidance that we're providing. And so we feel confident that we're creating better balance across our portfolio and also building momentum with our wholesale partners.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHi. Just two questions for me. I guess the first one is, when you look at the visibility of the business, I think in some of your answers to Lorraine's questions, when you look at the visibility of the business today, with the shifts that are occurring, can you just talk about how you feel looking at that versus what you saw over the last 12 and 24 months, just in terms of your ability to predict? And then just the second piece of this is, when you look at the channel shift that is going on wholesale to direct or bricks and mortar the digital pieces of the business, can you just give us any more framework around how to think about the P&L impacts at a higher level?\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nSure, Bob. Well, as it relates to the visibility with the shifts, I mean, we were surprised at what we saw on these larger franchises as we were navigating through the Q4. That is what's caused us to revise our guidance. I would say in general, we've driven incredible growth in our Digital business over the last four years, and we've had a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to drive those results against the consumer opportunity that's in the marketplace. I think most recently, in the context of managing our overall franchises, the dynamic of increasing supply of these franchises in the wholesale marketplace relative to having the supply of them on digital, and the relative balance between those things, those factors are what drove some of the volatility this quarter.\nLooking at the trend in retail sales, but also looking at our overall plans for how we manage franchises, you know, based on our experience of doing this, we've made the adjustments in this forward-looking guidance, and we've been more aggressive with it on Nike Digital. So, you know, we're continuing to improve with the capabilities that we're building in terms of demand sensing, leveraging data and insights in order to have better predictability of our own business. But I feel really good about the adjustments that we're making at this point in time and the aggressiveness through which we are the rest of the way that we continue to manage it.\nI'd also just say that when I look at the Digital business overall, we're already planning for lower launches in Q4 because we had an extraordinary number of launches in the Q4 of the prior year. And if I exclude the impact of the biggest franchises on our digital business, the rest of our Digital business was healthy and we were pleased with the growth that it delivered. So from that end we feel comfortable in the way that we're looking at this. As far as the channel shift mix going forward, it certainly will have a headwind in Fiscal year 2025, both in terms of revenue, as I just mentioned in answering a prior question, but also on margin.\nThese products also have an outweighed impact on margin, just given the high levels of full price realization that we've been driving across these franchises. We are planning for channel mix to be a headwind in 2025, but I'm pleased that we're still able to expand margins 10 to 30 basis points in the year. That's despite another year of about 15 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. So we are expanding margins as we look towards Fiscal year 2025. We still believe, while channel mix may be less of a driver as we look forward, we have a number of other opportunities to continue to drive more profitable business over the long term. It starts with a strong brand, and it starts with creating great products that consumers love.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nI'd add to that a healthy marketplace where channel mix is driven by consumer demand. We said we want to be where the consumer is, whether that's digital, our own door, or wholesale. We're embracing a more balanced approach to growing the whole marketplace. A couple nice evidence points of what I think health looks like is we've mentioned that performance grew double digits in the quarter, it grew double-digits in wholesale, and it grew double-digits on digital. The first couple of weeks of Peg 41 sold through well in wholesale, and it sold well in Nike Direct, both digital and our doors. Over time, our channel mix should be driven by consumer being at the consumer at the right time in a given shopping occasion. We think it'll settle out in a consumer friendly way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nManaging Director and Consumer Discretionary Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the amount of newness that is coming down the pipeline, you know, kind of over the next six to 12 months. Has there been another time when Nike has historically launched this magnitude of newness? And how do you read sort of the second degree of the consumer? Right, so it's going into the wholesale channel first. How do you read the success of that sort of at the end consumer as it goes through the wholesale pipeline? Thank you.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nWell, Adrienne, as we've said, we've said it for now for a couple quarters, we are very excited about this multi-year innovation pipeline and cycle. It's just as you've seen some early examples of it in this past quarter with Dn and Pegasus 41, and as we are saying, as we move into the end of this second half of this fiscal year, which we talk about as spring 2025 and summer 2025 of the seasons, the amount, breadth, and depth of the innovation is just accelerating significantly. At our size and scale, we know we need to both innovate broadly and deeply, but also provide innovations that can scale. So we've set a goal of doubling the growth of our new innovations by the end of 2025 versus the beginning of 2024. We're on track to achieve that.\nAnd one of the ways, when you ask how do we know that, is the wholesale partner feedback on what they see both in the second half of this year and into 2026, because we're showing them three-year roadmaps in many cases around Running, around Basketball, around Lifestyle. The wholesale feedback has been strong, and their order books, as Matt mentioned a minute ago, are reflecting that. And so we view our job to be able to deliver season in, season out strong innovations. The ability to scale those innovations over time, both to delight consumers and also bring us to healthy and sustainable growth. We feel very good about the track we're on, and we think it will accelerate as the year goes on.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nAdrian, I would just add that one element of newness is also in the Lifestyle side of the business. You know, over the last four years we have driven double-digit growth and created an extraordinary amount of energy. We've created iterations dimensions to Air Force 1, to Air Jordan 1, to the Dunk business. As a result of that, we've created extraordinary consumer demand and so one element of us bringing newness to the market is actually going into Nike's vaults, what no one else has, and being able to create energy the way that we've done over the last four years to be able to move consumers on to a new place. And it's something that we can do, that we have a proven track record doing. In Fiscal year 2019, the Dunk represented 0% of Nike's business.\nWe've scaled that dramatically with strong consumer appeal and response over the last three years and now we're managing that franchise back to continue to ensure that demand in the marketplace is greater than the supply that we're offering. And that is how we're managing these franchises. And so on the one hand, there's certainly a performance innovation side, what we showed in Paris, and what John was highlighting in terms of what's coming; we feel great about. But there's also an element of Nike taking advantage of its vault of assets and bringing new innovation, new stories, new partnerships to bring new products to market, to capture an incredible amount of sneaker demand out in the marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I wanted to follow up on Adrienne's question and your comment about the franchise management that you're focused on for FY2025. Can you contextualize the importance of these larger classic franchises in relation to Nike's current sales in comparison to historical averages? Do you expect to be remixed to typical franchise penetration rates by the end of the year as you scale these new innovations? And then perhaps a follow up from Matt. Can you provide some additional color on how you're thinking about the gross margin bridge and the tailwinds that you expect from input costs, and priorities pricing relative to some of the headwinds that you see? Thank you.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nI mean, these franchises are the largest franchises in industry history. They've gotten that way based on consumer demand. So we certainly started managing these franchises a couple years ago. What we were most focused on was the fact that we needed to restrict supply of these franchises into the marketplace. Because we didn't, because we had a gap in innovation in our pipeline, which we've talked about over the last couple of calls. And so the intentionality around managing these franchises is that newness is what's moving the consumer, and we wanted to move to more newness.\nAnd so the significance of it is the impact that it's going to take in Fiscal year 2025 on our financial outlook as we're pulling the amount of supply down and creating better balance in our portfolio. And when I say that, I don't mean that lightly. I mean better balance between performance and Lifestyle, better balance between high price points and lower price points, better balance between wholesale and direct, even within wholesale, between sporting goods and athletic specialty or other channels. So that is where our focus is. I think the actions that we're taking and the guidance that we've provided is to follow through on those actions.\nYou know, I've been at Nike for over 15 years, and you know, we've gone through these product cycle transitions before, and you know, while this is challenging and it's going to be challenging over the next couple of quarters, our history has demonstrated that when we take action and we do it aggressively and we get behind the things that are new, and we build marketing and storytelling around it, we move the consumer fairly quickly to a new place. And what we're doing here is nothing different than that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking our question here and thanks for all the details. We look after 2025, I guess as we look beyond 2025, you've given us a work a year where you've got a lot of work you're going to do here. As you know, you'll have classics cleaner, you'll have the channel mix more stable, you'll have the innovation working. Can you just help us think about within a historical context in the past I think you spoke to a Nike that could grow high single digits but I think in the future wholesale plays more of a role China maybe doesn't grow what it once did.\nSo a few things like that that are kind of different than the old world. Is maybe you can help us think about what you see as the longer-term opportunity for this, for this business as channels, geos, and franchises come back into alignment. And then I guess just at a bigger picture, we can see the lab is back at work bringing out new technologies on the performance side. But maybe walk us through how you can use innovation and performance and how you can create the halo for Lifestyle, which is really just more cyclical product. I'm curious how you guys look at the catalog and how you lean on innovation to try to drive the Lifestyle stuff back to growth.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nWell, I might just start, Michael, by saying as we get through some of this portfolio adjustment, we still have significant tailwinds in our industry. The fact is, sport is growing. The definition of sport is growing, healthy Lifestyles is becoming embraced globally. I was in China a couple weeks ago, and it was very striking, the focus on healthy, healthy Lifestyles. So I think there's a structural tailwind for the industry. I also think where sport happens, it's one of the derivatives of the post-COVID environment.\nYou don't have to go to the gym or the field. You're working out in your backyard or working out or taking a walk. So sport's happening in many more places, and that line between sport and Lifestyle is blurring with athleisure. So people want to look and have great style while they're doing sport, and they want to have sport-inspired style when they're not doing sport. So we view all those things as tailwinds. You ask about Lifestyle innovation. We want to be sport-based in our Lifestyle innovation, both in footwear and apparel. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to do that across Men's, Women's, and Kids, and Jordan Streetwear being an example of it.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah, I'll just finish up this question and then I'll come back to the start, Michael, where you asked. But I would also say that the lines that blur between performance and Lifestyle are really as much about how consumers are using products. The one thing that's undoubtable is that the consumer wants more comfort. And you can see that across the marketplace, our teams are absolutely focused on fit and comfort as we bring these new iterations to market. And I think that when you look at products like Pegasus Premium or even the Pegasus 41 or the Vomero 18, I think you're going to start to see consumers carrying those over into Lifestyle because they're new, they're fresh, they've got a particular look. And so we're balancing the fact that the consumer is voting for performance and innovation.\nWe need to make sure that we've got performance and innovation that they can wear every day. In addition to leveraging the vault, as I said before, leveraging the vault to bring classics back. Because there will always be a classics business, there will always be an energy business around classic Lifestyle products. We've got a great vault to be able to leverage doing that.\nAs it relates to your question about the long-term model, I guess here's what I would say. You know, we're focused on driving unit growth. I think I said that a couple quarters ago. The importance of that point was that it wasn't about one particular channel or the other. It's growing the overall marketplace. So we're focused on driving unit growth where the consumer is, given where we see the dynamics in the marketplace.\nRight now, we're also focused on taking back market share, and we see opportunity in the performance dimensions, in particular, to come strong with a strong pipeline of innovation, to come back, and to take market share. But this product transition is going to take a little bit of time for us to work through. And so over the course of the next couple of quarters, we're going to execute the plan that we've laid out here for Fiscal 2025. At that Investor Day in November, we will provide an updated outlook on growth and profitability, taking into consideration the marketplace dynamics that we're dealing with across the portfolio, where we are in the product transition, and also some of the strategic shifts that we've put into place over the last year.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Your next question will come from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nAneesha Sherman\n\nManaging Director and Retail Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. I'll start with just a quick follow-up. Matt, you talked about the challenge for the next couple of quarters on product lifecycle management. So, can you clarify, are you expecting this reset to be done by the end of a fiscal year? So are you expecting to exit FY2025 at a normalized run rate on the top line without the headwind? And then, second, I'm curious about where you are on the organizational reset and kind of shifting of the cost base. How much of that $2 billion cost reallocation do you expect to be done with by the end of the fiscal year? Is it going to be front-loaded or is it going to be spread out for the next couple of years? Thank you.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah, no problem. On your first question, the actions that we're taking on Nike Direct and Digital are more aggressive. So the adjustments that we're making to our, to our plan, specifically as it relates to our own channels, are going to be largely taken into consideration in the first half of this year. We will continue to manage franchises because you can picture a curve that goes up and a curve that comes down. As the curve comes down, it doesn't happen in a moment.\nIt happens naturally over time as consumers react to supply coming out of the marketplace. But the actions that we're taking are also causing us to look at the broader marketplace in the second half of the year and ensure that we're reducing supply there as well to maintain a healthy marketplace and also to ensure that we've got capacity in the market to bring newness in. I mentioned that we're planning on scaling newness, that newness is scaling as we make our way up through the year from -10 in the first quarter, to down high single digits in the first half, to finishing the year at down mid single digits.\nThe largest driver of that is going to be on the full year basis, the scaling of newness that we're bringing to market. We expect to exit the year with momentum, and that means that we expect the new things that we're bringing to market to begin to outweigh the franchise management that we're navigating through in this year. As we look forward to 2026, you know, we'll continue to manage these franchises in line with consumer demand. But what's going to make it, what makes that possible is the fact that we've got more new things coming that we're driving energy around that will be more than offsetting the way that we manage those franchises.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nAnd then, Aneesha, on the second question the way you asked it, I want to just distinguish one thing you mentioned, organizational reset. That's behind us, and as I mentioned earlier, we are now completely aligned across the organization around sport field of play, and our teams are focused; they're excited. There's just a tremendous amount of hustle throughout the organization, and you can feel it. And so that's going to continue. So the headcount dimension of the Save to Invest is behind us. And now those teams are focused on driving for the consumer innovation and execution.\nWe'll look to other areas to provide ways of savings, non-labor areas. Matt, you can describe some of these, but it's the organization is now 100% focused on driving the growth and innovation we've been talking about through our call. And I can again just reassure you that everyone's got energy, hustle, and excitement about the future.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, Nike Inc\n\nYeah, I mean we've been focused as we've been talking about building an operating model with greater speed and cost productivity as we grow. And so the actions that we've taken over the past year have enabled us the opportunity to make some bold swings in Fiscal 2025, we've reallocated $1 billion into consumer-facing activities.\nThat includes teammates that we've invested in in product design, building out the merchandising function to John's point, we have sport-focused teams now at global and in the geographies in order to be able to execute this new offense. We're putting more of our investment dollars in demand creation while we're managing operating overhead tightly.\nWe did that in Fiscal 2024. You saw even with the restructuring charge, some significant effort to manage operating overhead so that we could reallocate resources as I've referenced. While these investments will take some time to drive a return, they're absolutely the right thing for us to do to reignite brand momentum and to get us back on the offense with consumers. And so that's, you know, that's what we've done. And we will continue to manage SG&A tightly, leveraging this program and this initiative to create the capacity for us to invest, to push us forward with the consumer.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, Nike Inc\n\nAs we wrap up. Paul, just one, maybe just one final comment. You know, this is, and this is intended for Nike's team around the world. This has been a challenging last year, and so much hard work and energy has gone into it. I want to just thank everybody on Nike's team globally for what, how you've led through this, and how you've operated through this. It's so clear to me, and I'm saying this on behalf of Matt, Heidi, and Craig and our whole leadership team.\nNike's real competitive advantage at the end of the day is Nike's people and Nike's culture. So those people and that culture is alive and well and ready to compete and hungry to drive the kind of execution and growth we've been talking about. All call. I just want to wrap up with thanks to everyone on Nike's global team.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, Nike Inc\n\nThank you for joining our Q4 Fiscal 2024 call. We look forward to hosting many of you here at the headquarters for our Investor Day in late November. More details to come. This concludes our call. Good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2024 Q3 conference call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, NIKE\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2024 Q3 results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nThese risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.\nWe will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. Before I get into our Q3 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic passing of Kelvin Kiptum last month. Kelvin had just set the marathon world record in Chicago. He was a world-class athlete, champion, and a beloved member of the NIKE family. Kelvin was an inspiration to so many of us, and he'll long be remembered and honored for the impact he had both on the running community and beyond.\nLooking at our business, Q3 performed in line with our expectations. That said, we know NIKE is not performing at our potential. While our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy has driven growth and direct connections with consumers, it's been clear that we need to make some important adjustments. Simply put, we need to make adjustments in four areas. We need to sharpen our focus on sport.\nWe must drive a continuous flow of new product innovation. Our brand marketing must become bolder and more distinctive. While NIKE Direct will continue to play a critical role, we must lean in with our wholesale partners to elevate our brand and grow the total marketplace. This is exactly what we're doing. Starting last June, we aligned our organization to put the consumer and a sharp focus on sport back at the center of everything we do.\nWe integrated our leadership structure, appointing Heidi O'Neill and Craig Williams as co-presidents. We've reinvested in consumer-led, sport-focused teams that are the foundation of our offense, and we're driving our winning formula of creating a relentless flow of innovative product combined with distinct brand storytelling delivered through differentiated marketplace experiences. While we still have much work to do, we are making significant progress.\nWe're well on our way to building a multi-year cycle of innovation that's bringing freshness and newness to consumers. We've pulled forward several innovations more than a year, and our intent is to delight consumers and disrupt the industry. Our brand storytelling will leverage our athletes and sport moments to become sharper and bolder, beginning with the Olympics this summer. We're increasing our investment in wholesale to help us elevate and grow the entire marketplace.\nWe recognize that our wholesale partners help us scale our innovation and newness in physical stores and connect our brands in the path of the consumer. Most importantly, we're back on our front foot with growing confidence in our innovation pipeline. We know it'll take some time to scale these innovations, but we see some early green shoots. We're also carefully managing our most important franchises for the long-term health.\nAs a result, our product portfolio will go through a period of transition over the coming quarters. But altogether, we are relentlessly focused on driving NIKE's next chapter of healthy and sustainable growth. And we look forward to sharing our plans in depth at an investor day later this year. Now, as we said before, our success always starts with innovative product. And so that's where I'm going to focus on today's call.\nToday, our innovation engine is moving with speed. Our innovation, design, and product creation teams are working hand in hand with urgency and creativity. They're leveraging new technologies to be faster, more collaborative, and more expansive in their thinking. We have many platforms at NIKE that drive growth. But today, let's go deep on our greatest innovation platform and a true source of competitive advantage: Air.\nToday, as a platform, Air is a double-digit billion-dollar business on its own, larger than some Fortune 500 companies. There's nothing like Air. It's a proprietary technology that lets us iterate and revolutionize. It drives breakthrough performance benefits for athletes and defines the future of sportswear. Air offers stability, resilience, and energy return unlike any other cushioning platform. Simply put, Air helps athletes win.\nDecade after decade, we've developed new breakthroughs in Air. As we approach the Olympics in Paris this summer, we continue to innovate with Air with a focus on helping the world's greatest athletes compete and win on sport's largest stage. So this summer, you're going to see Air drive major advancements in measurable performance benefits on the track, on the court, and on the pitch.\nIn addition to Alphafly 3, which continues to set the standard for distance racing, you'll see Air in new footwear that brings elite performance to everyday runners. You'll see Air in football and basketball footwear in new and more visible ways. And you'll see Air in the fastest track spikes we've ever created. You're going to get a chance to see all of these products, in fact, our full Olympics innovation lineup two weeks from now at our Innovation Ignition event that we'll be hosting in Paris.\nNow, beyond creating leading-edge performance innovation, we also continue to bring new sensations of Air across our business, including our lifestyle portfolio. For instance, Dynamic Air, our newest innovation platform, is a true breakthrough, delivering a uniquely comfortable sensation with each step. It's a total rethinking of what airbags can be. Historically, airbags have been fixed and static, pictured inflatable raft.\nThey compress when you step and then immediately return to their original shape, ready for the next step. Dynamic Air changes the game. It unchambers the air to create a new underfoot sensation that's truly responsive. As the consumer takes a step, our new four-tubed air unit allows air to flow freely between the tubes, responding to the pressure of each unique stride to deliver maximum comfort.\nWe will scale Dynamic Air across many of our leading Air franchises, but it starts with the Air Max Dn, a shoe that offers just the latest example of how we're using air to craft a new lifestyle franchise. I've been wearing the Dn all week, and in fact, I'm wearing it right now. And it really is a unique and great sensation. And what's more, Dn's bold style and design identity is deeply rooted in youth culture and the next generation.\nWe're excited for consumers to experience it. Next week will be NIKE's 10th Air Max Day. It'll be a day when you see us drive an integrated offense of innovation, storytelling, and consumer activations that we're very excited about. Air Max Dn will be debuting in more than 4,000 stores globally on Air Max Day, creating impact like we haven't seen in years.\nWhen we teased Dn last month, we saw a rise in other Air Max franchises. This is common. Our experience has been that when we launch a strong new product, it creates energy for the whole family. It all speaks to the confidence we feel when we look at our overall innovation engine and pipeline from Air to the rest of the portfolio. Now, earlier, I mentioned the impact NIKE can have as we sharpen our focus on sport.\nThe world got a great reminder of that today with the announcement of the awarding of the German football contract. I was fortunate enough to be in Germany for our pitch earlier this week, and I can tell you it was simply NIKE at its very best. It started with our deep and unparalleled commitment to sport. We are the world's leading sports brand, the largest sports brand, the leader in football, the world's most popular sport.\nOur focus started with product innovation, both on the pitch with unmatched kits and footwear that popped and had style and performance, and extended into distinct and fashionable lifestyle design. Our ability to tell stories shone through to make the German team a global brand and make their athletes global heroes. Our ability to expand the game, expanding the women's football game, and inviting youth culture into football all mattered.\nIt was a remarkable team effort and a great proof point that when NIKE brings out our best, no one can beat us. We feel deeply honored and privileged to partner with the German Football Federation starting in 2027. Before wrapping up, let me touch on something else that's core to our DNA as a company: NIKE's purpose. Purpose will always be our foundation and remains deeply embedded in our strategy.\nWe're defined by our commitment to the future of sport and service to athletes around the globe. Purpose continues to guide us and redefine our own potential for positive impact in the world. We're pleased with the progress we've made against our 2025 purpose targets across representation, sustainability, and community. To learn more, please see our recently released FY23 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report.\nIn the end, we're acting with urgency as we make the adjustments needed to compete and win. I'd like to conclude by saying that I deeply appreciate how much our team has kept our focus on delivering results amid macro volatility and an organizational restructure. This has been a difficult time for our organization, and I feel truly grateful for our teammates who've dedicated and demonstrated such dedication and commitment to our work together.\nIt's thanks to them that I feel so confident in NIKE's future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's Q3 showcased the operating discipline of our teams as we delivered revenues up slightly on top of the prior year's double-digit growth, outperforming our expectations in North America and more than offsetting dynamic conditions in some other geographies.\nWe executed well to recapture transitory cost headwinds and expand gross margins, even in a promotional environment. Our inventory position remains healthy, with total marketplace units down double digits versus the prior year and weeks of supply at their lowest levels since the pandemic. Most importantly, our teams are focused on what matters most to capture the strong growth opportunity we see in the marketplace. This means creating more value for consumers by scaling new product innovation with greater brand impact across the full marketplace, with even more inspiration through sport and our athletes.\nLast quarter, we highlighted that particularly in an uneven macro environment, newness and innovation are what drives brand distinction. Consumers are moving quickly to access new products. Trends are igniting in different places and rapidly spreading around the world. NIKE needs to be faster. And so we are accelerating a multi-year innovation cycle.\nAnd while our new product cycle is just getting underway, this quarter showed that we are on the right track. Since the start of this fiscal year, new and updated footwear models have grown into a majority of our top 20 growing footwear franchises in Q3. Added up, footwear products introduced over the past several quarters are on track to generate a multi-billion dollar run rate on an annual basis. And we see even more opportunity ahead.\nOn the whole, we see momentum where we are focused most. Performance footwear grew high single digits this quarter, with double-digit growth from $100-plus franchises, including Kobe and Jordan basketball, Metcon and Motiva and fitness, and Structure and Vomero in running. Women's fitness footwear grew double digits, and key apparel franchises such as $100-plus leggings continued scaling with strong sell-through.\nNew product journeys, from Book 1 to Vomero 5 and V2K, to Lunar Roam and Travis Scott's Jordan Jumpman Jack, drove consumer energy. Ahead of a new wave of NIKE Air innovation, the Air Zoom Alphafly 3 debuted with a marathon world record and sellout launches across multiple markets around the world. As you heard from John, we believe the Paris Olympics will serve as a catalyst for our brands as we launch our newest NIKE Air innovations for athletes. Most importantly, this is just the beginning.\nWith a growing portfolio of new concepts, platforms, and capabilities, our innovation teams are well-positioned to continue driving breakthroughs in performance and lifestyle over the coming years. Now, to maximize the impact of our new product cycle, we are accelerating several important actions lined up against key brand and sports moments.\nFirst, we are elevating and differentiating the consumer experience with our brands at retail, especially as consumers continue to shift back into physical stores. This includes increased investment to support strong seasonal retail marketing execution, breadth and depth of assortment, and elevated service and product presentation. You heard John say that we will initially launch the Air Max Dn next week at more than 4,000 doors.\nWe will increasingly leverage our full portfolio of thousands of physical doors to position our newest products in the path of consumers. Second, we are sharpening our brand storytelling to tell fewer, bigger stories with greater reach. We will focus our demand creation investments to elevate our brand and most distinctive products, leading with the voice of the athlete, amplifying our new innovation, and engaging consumers at the point of sale.\nAs we look forward, we see that our Olympics Air for Athletes campaign will be the boldest expression of NIKE's brand voice in many years. Third, we are in the midst of shifting our product portfolio towards newness and innovation. Last quarter, we spoke of our intentional actions to reduce marketplace supply of certain key franchises to ensure they remain healthy and strong while feeding and scaling new products.\nGiven the way consumers are responding to our newest product journeys, even amidst a more promotional environment, we have decided to accelerate our actions. For example, we are pulling back supply of classics such as the Air Force 1, and we're reducing supply of Pegasus ahead of launching new innovation in the Pegasus 41. We've been here before. Twelve months ago, our basketball portfolio was meaningfully impacted when we exited a key signature franchise.\nSince then, we've more than offset that impact by scaling innovation with the GT series, introducing newness to consumers in Ja, Sabrina, Kobe, and Book, and returned to strong double-digit growth this quarter in basketball. Looking ahead, we expect lifecycle management of key product franchises to create some near-term headwinds, particularly on digital. However, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to fuel brand momentum and return to stronger long-term growth.\nLast, while we continue to bring operational discipline as we manage our business through these shifts and a multi-year period of higher cost inflation, we're also positioning NIKE for the future. This includes restructuring our organization to sharpen our focus and increase our investment on the consumer and sport, which we believe will fuel our next phase of long-term growth.\nThis quarter, we began streamlining support and operating functions, reducing management layers, and shifting more of our resources towards consumer-facing activities. In particular, we are increasing investment in areas such as design, product creation, merchandising, brand, and our ground game to drive greater impact for consumers, dimensions of sport, and the marketplace. Overall, our focus is on allocating our resources to drive more return while building an operating model with greater speed and better cost productivity as we grow.\nNow, let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. Q3 results. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue was up slightly on a reported and currency-neutral basis, with low single-digit growth in the NIKE brand, partially offset by declines at Converse. As a reminder, this follows 14% reported and 19% currency-neutral growth one year ago as we were liquidating excess inventory in Q3 of fiscal 2023.\nNIKE Direct was up slightly versus the prior year, with NIKE stores up 6% and NIKE Digital down 4%. Wholesale grew 3%. Gross margins expanded 150 basis points to 44.8% on a reported basis, driven by strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates, and improvements in supply chain efficiency, partially offset by higher product input costs. This also includes 50 basis points of negative impact from restructuring charges.\nSG&A grew 7% on a reported basis as increased investments in demand creation was partially offset by disciplined expense management. This quarter, SG&A was also impacted by approximately $340 million in restructuring charges. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.5% compared to 16% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.77. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charges, earnings per share would have been $0.98, up 24% versus the prior year.\nNow, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 3%. NIKE Direct grew 2%, with NIKE stores up 3% and NIKE Digital up 1%. Wholesale grew 5% and EBIT grew 18% on a reported basis. This builds on extraordinary growth in the prior year, with North America revenue up 27%, including NIKE Direct up 23% and Wholesale up 32% in Q3 of fiscal 2023. This quarter, we exceeded our expectations in North America with strong holiday sales, lighter markdowns than our competitors, and unit growth versus the prior year.\nInventory is also down double digits at the end of Q3. Kids grew double digits across footwear and apparel, with seasonal fleece and performance footwear resonating. We also saw positive momentum in women's lifestyle and fitness, with strong growth from the Dunk, Free Metcon, and Retro Running Styles. Jordan Remix and Sport Performance grew double digits.\nIn running, Structure, Vomero, and the Invincible delivered double-digit growth. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 4% as NIKE stores grew 6% and NIKE Digital declined 10%. Wholesale was down 5% and EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results compared to tremendous growth in Q3 of fiscal 2023, when EMEA revenue was up 26%, NIKE Direct was up 39%, and Wholesale was up 20%.\nHowever, sales in the geography fell short of our expectations this quarter as we navigated increased macro volatility and softening consumer demand. That said, newness and brand distinction continues to fuel momentum in EMEA. In running, a sell-out Alphafly 3 launch energized our road racing portfolio. In lifestyle, P-6000 and Vomero 5 continued to scale. Fitness grew double digits as we activated our ground game with brand activations and our trainer network.\nOverall, inventory remains healthy, with units down double digits versus the prior year. As we look forward, we see the launch of Air Max Dn, Euro Champs 24, and the Paris Olympics as opportunities to create near-term brand momentum despite a challenging consumer backdrop. In Greater China, Q3 revenue grew 6%, in line with our revised expectations that we shared at the end of last quarter.\nNIKE Direct declined 1%, with NIKE stores growing 6% and NIKE Digital declining 13%. Wholesale grew 12%. EBIT grew 3% on a reported basis, with multiple points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. Chinese New Year sales grew year-over-year, with our NIKE and Jordan Year of the Dragon Express Lane collections driving excellent sell-through. Retail sales with our partners grew double digits in Q3 versus the prior year.\nKids led our growth in the quarter, with performance dimensions up strong double digits. In basketball, Book 1, Kobe, and G.T. Cut 3 launched with strong sell-through. In running, the Structure, the Invincible, and the Vomero drove strong growth this quarter. The Jordan Brand delivered double-digit growth in women's and kids, with consumer anticipation building ahead of this week's opening of Jordan World of Flight Beijing, which will be the brand's first pinnacle retail concept in China.\nIn APLA, Q3 revenue grew 4%. NIKE Direct grew 4%, with NIKE stores up 18% and NIKE Digital declining 6%. Wholesale grew 3%, and EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis. In Central and South America, we delivered double-digit growth and improved return on sales in the first full year of our shift to a distributor model. In Mexico, we gained brand strength and momentum with strong growth in football.\nIn Japan, running grew double digits. Across APLA, football and basketball grew double digits, fueled by the Mercurial, LeBron, and the GT series. Women's holistic fitness grew across all channels, with Motiva and statement leggings in particular resonating. Now, let me turn to our financial outlook. As we look forward, we are driving earnings growth and offsetting softer second-half revenue with strong gross margin execution, disciplined cost controls, and healthy and more productive inventory levels across the marketplace.\nExcluding restructuring charges, we expect to deliver on the full-year earnings outlook that we communicated at the beginning of this fiscal year. More specifically, for the full year, we continue to expect revenue to grow approximately 1%. We now expect Q4 revenue to be up slightly, reflecting some shipment timing benefits in Q3 and lower digital growth due to franchise lifecycle management.\nQ4 also has one point of negative impact on reported revenue from a stronger US dollar. Moving down the P&L, I will note that our guidance includes restructuring charges of approximately $450 million in our second half, with $403 million incurred in the Q3. This primarily impacts SG&A, with approximately 15 basis points of impact to full-year gross margins. We expect Q4 gross margins to expand approximately 160 to 180 basis points.\nThis guidance continues to reflect benefits from strategic price increases, lower ocean freight rates, lower product input costs, and improved supply chain efficiency. Our outlook is now partially offset by higher markdowns, reduced benefits from channel mix due to franchise lifecycle management, and worsening foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, this translates into gross margins expanding approximately 120 basis points, including approximately 60 basis points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds.\nWe now expect Q4 SG&A to be down slightly versus the prior year, including restructuring charges, reflecting improvement versus our prior guidance. For the full year, this translates into SG&A growing low single digits, including restructuring charges, also reflecting improvement versus our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, we expect full-year SG&A to be roughly flat. Our guidance for other income and expense and our effective tax rate remain unchanged.\nAdditionally, given the strategic actions we walked through earlier, I want to share some early thoughts on how we are planning for our next fiscal year. First, we expect revenue and earnings to grow versus the prior year, with operating margins expanding, excluding the impact of the restructuring charges in fiscal 2024. However, we are prudently planning for revenue in the first half of the fiscal year to be down low single digits.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this reflects near-term headwinds from lifecycle management of our key product franchises, more than offsetting the scaling of new products as we shift our product portfolio toward newness and innovation. This also continues to reflect the subdued macro outlook around the world.\nMost importantly, we are focused on amplifying brand strength and consumer impact, which is the foundation for how we drive sustainable long-term growth. Looking ahead, we are confident in our product pipeline for fiscal 2025 and the momentum that we will build throughout the year, moment by moment, creating brand impact and deep consumer connection through sport. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, simply press star one on your telephone keypad. Our first question will come from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Maybe just to start, Matt, I want to ask you about the fiscal 2025 commentary you made. You're talking about low single-digit growth for the first half of the year. You said operating margin, I think you said growth, actually restructuring charges and EPS growth.\nCan you give a little bit more to mention around what you expect for operating margin next year, like what kind of growth you expect? Will growth on the reported numbers from this year or will be sort of below that? And then I guess just bigger picture, if we can take a step back, let's talk about the operating model. The company switched to a men's, women's, and kids' construct a couple of years ago, away from the category offense. How has that changed? How have you perceived that change? Has it been what you expected it to be?\nDoes NIKE plan to make any changes to the operating model? Thank you so much.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nMatt, why don't I take the second part of that question and then you take the first? So Jay, as I mentioned, we are making and started nine months ago important adjustments in our offense. And that started with putting the consumer and sport squarely back into our offense. And so that allows a sharpness across men's, women's, kids, and Jordan around sport. And so there's a sharpness around running end to end, around fitness, around basketball, around football, and around lifestyle.\nSo we've brought the best of the category offense right back in, along with the sort of gender umbrella. And that's resulted in consumer-led sport-focused teams that are back on our front foot, as we talked about, building a strong innovation pipeline and in classic NIKE form. It's not just one or two products.\nIt's building a three-year pipeline so that we can bring innovation season after season in each sport. In fact, we were just this week, we had 300 or 400 of our top leaders here for spring 2025, that addition of the next round of innovation. I can tell you our teams are excited. It's not just one season. It's a full three-year pipeline. We're combining that with elevating our brand and bigger, bolder stories grounded in sport and athletes that cut through and connect with impact. Again, you'll see that in the Olympics. You saw that a little bit with Caitlin Clark and with Sabrina most recently, little examples of it, getting back to what we do best and what we're doing that with brand.\nAnd then in the marketplace, while we have a sport focus, we're combining both the best of our direct offense, but a reinvestment with our wholesale partners so we bring a more holistic offense that grows the market and gets in the path of our consumer. And so that's what's driving our growth. We've made the necessary adjustments to bring the best of what's worked in our proven formula so that we move forward.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nAnd Jay, the way I think about fiscal 2025 is that we are taking our product portfolio through a period of transition. We talked about this last quarter in terms of our focus on scaling newness, innovation, and the green shoots that we were seeing in terms of the way the consumer is responding to the newness that we're bringing to market.\nThis quarter only gave us more confidence that that is where we need to focus and how we will continue to create greater impact and distinction from a brand point of view. So this quarter, we saw a majority of our top 20 growing footwear products be new products that have been created this year. Those products are on a trajectory to deliver multi-billions of annual run rate of incremental revenue. That's where our focus is. At the same time, we're managing some of our largest lifestyle franchises and some of our performance franchises back to make space for the newness. That's going to have a corresponding offsetting impact.\nAnd because we've been missing some product newness at scale in our portfolio over the last several seasons, these actions are resulting in a decline of low single digits, which is how we're thinking about the first half of the year. But we believe we will inflect in the second half and grow next year on the top line. And when we step back and think about the importance of newness and innovation, and not just to drive the top line, but to create consumer impact at scale, that's the foundation for us driving long-term growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Boss\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks. So John, could you elaborate on the new multi-year innovation cycle and how best to think about the timeline for transition to the next chapter of growth that you cited? And maybe, Matt, staying on that topic, high level, any material changes to consider with the top line growth profile or your high-teens margin target as we think about this next chapter of growth?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Matt, well, I can't tell you the change in the feeling of our innovation design and product creation teams getting back on their front foot. And it's not just about a product or an item here and there. It's around building a robust pipeline of innovation. So I mentioned in my remarks Air.\nAir has been probably the single largest innovation platform in NIKE's history. And we continue to innovate with Air, both in performance, which you'll see in the Olympics, and you'll see it impact almost every sport dimension. And you'll get to see that in a couple of weeks. And measurable performance benefits, again, classic NIKE innovation. And then also in lifestyle. Let me just take Air Max Dn.\nWe're launching Air Max Dn next week, but we already have next year's Air Max and the following year developed, which are further innovations in Air so that it's not just one year, it's three years in the pipeline that we're working on improving and improving and improving as we bring it with power to consumers.\nBeyond that, let me take a running. I was over, Matt and I were over in the running room. It was yesterday, I think, Matt, wasn't it? It was yesterday. And the three-year pipeline of innovation is clear across Vomero, Structure, and PEG. So we'll have PEG 41 launch in June. PEG Premium will be, as well as other members of the PEG family, PEG Trail, all coming in the second half of the year. And we're clear what's coming in 2025 and 2026 across PEG, Vomero, and Structure. Again, pipeline.\nSame thing in women's. We went into the women's room. Amy Montagne and team have lined up not just what's coming in the short term, but what's coming season after season, which is what allows NIKE to drive innovation at scale and consistency.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nI'll hit on the question, Matt. On the timeline of transition, I'll just reiterate what I just said, which is we believe that transition is going to occur in the second half of fiscal 2025. You will continue to hear us talking about the way we're scaling newness and innovation from this point forward. The products that are already out in the market, we expect to continue to scale. John's referenced the Dn, the PEG 41, and we've got other things that are coming in the first half of this year.\nAnd so that's what we're excited about, offset by the way we're managing some of our franchises. When I think about your question about material changes to the long term, I'm going to hit on maybe a couple of points here.\nI think the first one I'd say is that while our strategy over the last few years has been consumer-led, what I would say is that the last year or so, we've been more focused on trying to achieve mix of marketplace targets than we have serving consumer demand where the consumer is shopping. And so there's been more focus on trying to achieve the 40% digital metric or the 60% direct metric when that was always a consumer-focused strategy. The consumer is still clearly shopping in multi-brand retail.\nWe need to elevate our brand and our positioning to be able to serve the consumer and to have the maximum impact from the new innovations that we're bringing to market. So those measures are not measures that are guiding our forward-looking plans, okay? The second I'd say is that when we look at the industry and step back overall, stepping back from being in a moment of transitioning our product portfolio, we continue to see strong growth potential in our sector.\nWe think we continue to have industry tailwinds, consumer interest in sport, more people participating in running events and marathons, and to more people focused on fitness and living a healthy lifestyle. There are natural consumer tailwinds that are going to continue to drive growth in our sector. We expect to grow and to take share like we always have.\nAs it relates to our long-term margin target, I think this quarter and this year has been a great proof point on us recapturing some of the transitory cost headwinds that have been in our face the last couple of years, but also showing how we can execute to deliver gross margin expansion and be disciplined in the way we're managing costs while we're investing in the consumer.\nWhen I look forward, I think we can continue to drive more profitable growth. And the margins that we've discussed and the opportunity for margin expansion is still significant within our model. But having a strong brand is the foundation for us to be able to drive long-term growth and profitability. And we're focused on what it takes through this flow of innovation, authenticating ourselves, being authenticated in sport, and elevating our presence across the marketplace.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nIf we can do this, we think we can drive attractive growth and high profitability. When we get to investor day later this year, what we'll do is we will update our algorithm and our expectations over the next five-year period.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping to get your updated thoughts on the pricing power of the NIKE brand and the markdown opportunities that you see as you build into this new multi-year innovation cycle. Are there any near-term or medium-term offsets that we should contemplate as you work through franchise management and the current macro? And how are you thinking about the most important drivers of operating margin expansion into next fiscal year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah, let me start by talking about pricing power. One of the biggest benefits to a strong brand, an innovative brand, a brand that's continuing to bring freshness and newness to the consumer is pricing power. And over the last couple of years, given our brand strength, we've been able to implement strategic pricing in order to be able to offset some of the headwinds that we've been facing. But as we look forward, we believe that more newness, more freshness, products that are more connected to stories that are relevant to consumers should give us the ability on a structural basis to continue to expand our profitability.\nThe point I was trying to make in response to Matt's question is that when the brand is strong, the biggest driver of growth and margin expansion is strong consumer demand for the products we have, and high levels of full price realization. That ultimately is the fundamental as we carry forward.\nIn the near term, one of the headwinds that we're going to see is that, not surprisingly, our digital business carries a higher mix of the biggest franchises that consumers love. So as we manage the supply of our larger franchises, we do expect that there will be a near-term channel mix headwind from transitioning our product portfolio. We view that as being a near-term factor. Because ultimately, for NIKE to grow at the rates that we aspire to grow to, we have to grow units across the marketplace.\nWe have to grow units in NIKE Direct through digital in our stores, and we've got to grow units through our partners. And so that is where our focus is, dimensionalized through sport, our fields of play, the way we've always segmented the marketplace to grow so that we can work and serve the consumer where the consumer's at.\nAs far as operating profitability long term, we continue to believe that we can expand gross margins by running our operating model and also driving value out of some of the things that we've talked about in the past, like product cost initiatives to lower our input costs. We're actually already starting to see some benefits on that in the back half of this year, continuing to drive supply chain efficiency.\nThen, as I mentioned, the way that we're thinking about managing our SG&A, shifting more of our resources to be consumer-facing, we're focused on building an operating model that's got greater speed and drives greater productivity as we grow. We think that will also be a source of long-term margin expansion for the company.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nManaging Director, Evercore\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for all the detail and diagnosis about a lot of the moving parts in the business here today. Very helpful. I guess, as we look at the Q2 in a row, I guess wholesale in China has grown a lot faster than DTC. Obviously, that's a very important market for you.\nA lot of important things for us to think about in that market. Can you help us a little color in the different trends in that market that you see? And then, I guess, as we think about how you'll manage these franchises into next year, we've also heard some good growth rates in some parts of the wholesale channel for the first half of your fiscal year. So I'm assuming we'll see more of that franchise management on the DTC side.\nAnd if so, considering that's an important channel for the rest of the P&L, I'm assuming we can orient ourselves around gross margin pressure in the start of next year as you work your way through that before we see the influence of returning to growth down the P&L.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah. Matt, why don't you take the first part of that, and you the second. So, Michael, on China, interestingly, Angela Dong and her team and all of our top partners were here for the last week. As you know, we have 6,000 multi-brand doors. They were here for our innovation. And a couple of things are clear. Sport is strong in China, and NIKE is strong in China. Our growth in Q3 was 6%, which was in line with our plan.\nAnd we're gaining share. We're gaining share certainly against the global brands, and we're gaining share against the local brands. So NIKE's brand is strong, and it's back. With regard to channel mix in your specific question, part of what's driving that is the consumers are back on the street. And so I would say that the physical retail channel in China is stronger than digital.\nAnd then within digital, Tmall, which was historically the biggest digital driver, is experiencing less growth. We're still the number one sports brand on Tmall. And social commerce, Douyin, is growing. And we're not yet on Douyin. We're just getting on Douyin. And so you'll see us expanding our growth into social commerce, which is the growing digital channel in China. But I can tell you, Matt and I had a chance, and Craig Williams and others, to meet with our partners from China.\nThey came away seeing our innovation pipeline that I've been talking about, Matt and I have been talking about on this call, what we've got in store coming. And it was the first time they'd been on our campus in four years since COVID, and they came away excited, leaning in.\nWe are very optimistic about the future in China, and we will grow across multi-channels to grow the market. It's probably the era of the world we do that the best.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah. And to John's point, not only do we have 6,000 stores, but China is a monobrand market. And so whether it's owned or partnered, it's a monobrand market, which gives us the ability to have the best expression in front of the consumers, to be able to direct the assortment so that as we bring newness, innovation, and new stories, we partner with our partners.\nAnd the last thing I was going to say, Michael, is just the penetration of NIKE Direct in China is lower than what it is across our other geographies. In terms of your question about where we'll see the franchise management, yes, you're right. It will be more in NIKE Direct, and primarily because we continue to see a heavy level of promotional activity happening across digital, across all of our geographies.\nAnd while we continue to see, as we've supplied our largest franchises to our wholesale partners, we're actually seeing incredibly strong weekly sell-through on these franchises. We're seeing high levels, high above our targets of full price realization. And so our franchises are healthy. In fact, we could sell more of these products if we wanted to. But we don't think that's the right thing to do from a brand point of view.\nAnd we know that we manage these franchises for long-term health. And so we're focused on scaling the newness and creating the consumer space for us to tell stories about new things that we're bringing to drive energy. And that's where our focus is. And so that's ultimately where our teams are spending their time, and that's what's influencing the near-term transition that I highlighted a little bit earlier.\nAs far as the margin question goes, what I'll say is that we're going to grow revenue and earnings next year, and we expect to drive operating margin expansion, excluding the impact of the restructuring charge. That's going to come through gross margin expansion first, and then continuing to be disciplined in the way we manage SG&A in order to be able to drive more productive growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nPerfect. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple from me. On the front half, 2025, revenue guidance, down low single digits. Can you give us any color on how you're thinking about it by geography or channel? And then just bigger picture on this kind of wholesale re-entering, are you having any trouble kind of rebuilding the muscle there, facing any difficulty as you re-enter? Has NIKE's criteria changed at all in terms of how you think about the right partners or distribution going forward? Thanks a lot.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nOkay. John, why don't I take the first part, and then I'll start the second one if you want to jump in on that one.\nAnd go for it. So Alex, I think the only thing I would say at this point is the way that we're thinking about the geography splits is we're not assuming that economic conditions in the international markets in particular get better. It assumes a status quo relative to where we are today. And next quarter, I'll provide more tangible insights into not only the first half, but our full-year growth over fiscal '25. On the wholesale side, what I would say is that I think the biggest thing to take away is that we don't like the way our brand is showing up in wholesale, and we own that. And we need to focus on elevating the experience for consumers when they come into interaction with our brand.\nIf you segment our marketplace by dimension and by where we sell our seasonal units on a full-price basis, our wholesale partners represent 3/4 of the market from a unit perspective. The importance of being able to elevate and to position our brand correctly and to tell stories about the products that we're bringing to market in that environment is an absolutely critical way, not only to help consumers fall in love with the products we have, but to also give consumers that tangible ability to come into real-life connection with the NIKE brand.\nWhat we're focused on, beginning with the Dn, is we're going to see and you'll feel the Dn launch in 4,000 doors initially across the marketplace.\nWhen we look at the way we're going to scale that innovation over the next several seasons through product journeys with different partners, telling different stories in different parts of the marketplace, we're very excited about the impact that that could have on the market, and we know that it's what we need to do. The investments will be in things like seasonal marketing campaigns, elevating the presentation of our product, investing in the breadth and depth of the assortment, including color, so the consumer gets more choice off of the products that we care about the most in order to be able to create that kind of impact across the market.\nWe think we've got the right partners, but our strategy and our approach to the marketplace is constantly evolving based on where the consumer is, based on where the consumer is shopping, and who's connecting most with the consumers. So apart from some of the areas that we've been talking about where we need to create new distribution because we see growth opportunities that don't line up with our current partners, our focus is on our current partners right now and elevating the experience of our brand with them.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nI just build on what Matt said, Alex, the first part of your question. Our partners want us. They need NIKE to help grow the market. They want newness. They want NIKE freshness. They want us to lean in with them. And that's exactly what we're doing. So the reception's been very strong and very good. And we'll continue to capitalize on that and leverage that so that we collectively grow the entire market in service of the consumer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions for me. The first one is, in the running area, when you talk about wholesale, can you talk about any progress that you're seeing with the RSGs as partners? And then the second question is, Matt, you mentioned just the opportunity or the ability to see a catalyst in sales from the Olympics. Can you just talk about your opportunity to capitalize on some of those products and your expectation from that? Thanks.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nBob, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a chance to be with Heidi and her teams on looking at the running pipeline and the everyday running pipeline. There are clearly already some early green shoots. The Vomero 17 and the Structure 25 out in the market today, both growing double digits to very strong reception. As I mentioned earlier, the Pegasus family, starting with Pegasus 41, Pegasus Premium, Pegasus Trail coming in the second half of the year.\nThe order book is looking good. We're also, in direct answer to your question, investing in our ground game with more focus and specificity around running than before. That includes being where runners are, so being at the marathons, at the local races, at the local runs. We had a strong presence at the LA Marathon and activations there with very positive response.\nIn fact, we had a shoe exchange effort that went crazy with so many people switching over to NIKE because we're there with them. We'll continue to do that. Then in the RSG channel, as you mentioned, we've increased our focus and penetration and RSGs and other new partners that authenticate our brand, and we've doubled our EKINs. As you know, our EKINs are the experts who provide our partners with even greater NIKE expertise and personal engagement.\nSo if you take the combination of strong innovative product portfolio and pipeline with more ground game and presence where runners are, combined with a greater marketplace distribution, including RSGs, and with our EKINs in the field, we feel like we're already seeing some green shoots of progress in everyday running, and we'll continue to see that quarter after quarter.\nIt won't happen overnight, but we're already seeing momentum in North America, and we believe that will continue around the world.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE",
    "content2": "Yeah, Bob. Another indicator of a green shoot for us is that our bookings for Fall 2024, which is the fall season coming up in running footwear, delivered strong growth. To John's point, that's across our $100-plus products, but also us coming back into market with a new line of core running footwear. So it's another green shoot for us that we see momentum in running in particular, and one that we're focused on continuing to ignite. I think the Olympics actually will help that as a segue to your second point. The opportunity that we see starts with our brand.\nThe opportunity starts with our Air for Athletes campaign that we're going to be bringing through the Olympics, combined with the products that John referenced, the ones that you will see on the track, on the streets vis-à-vis the marathon, to on the football pitch with visible air, to the basketball court with air being visible, leveraging the similar technology that we've leveraged through the Alphafly 3. And so we're excited about the innovation we're bringing, but it's an ignition point because there is material value from the products that we will sell that we sold in around these Olympic stories, but it's about igniting the air platform as we go forward.\nSo the way we think about it is that it's a catalyst from both a brand and a business point of view, because it will be an important moment on the world's biggest stage to showcase the best and greatest innovations in these sports. Then the connection of the innovation to the pipeline of product that's coming that we expect will drive growth through their balance of 2025 and into 2026, especially as you think about the next air iteration and the one after that, which we already have in development. So from our perspective, it's a tremendous opportunity to catalyze energy, but more importantly, to reposition NIKE at sport with the athlete and drive the next chapter of growth for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude our conference for today. We thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer, NIKE\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE Inc's Fiscal 2024 Q2 results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE Inc President and CEO, John Donahoe, and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.\nWe will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc President and CEO, John Donahoe.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. NIKE is the market leader in sport. It's a role we take seriously. We create innovation that pushes human potential. We expand the world of sport, inviting new generations all around the globe into the community of athletes. We fuel the energy and excitement of sport itself, both on a global stage and on the ground in communities and cities everywhere. One thing that distinguishes NIKE more than any other brand in the world is that we get our inspiration from athletes in sport. It was a great quarter for NIKE and the athletes who inspire us. Here's just a few examples. Calvin Kiptum broke the marathon world record wearing the Alphafly 3, which builds on our proprietary system of speed that continues to set the standard.\nA'ja Wilson earned WNBA Finals MVP after leading the Las Vegas Aces to their second straight title. LeBron James and Anthony Davis led the Lakers to the first-ever NBA in-season tournament championship. Aitana Bonmatí won the Women's Ballon d'Or, and Sha'Carri Richardson was named USA Track & Field's Female Athlete of the Year. Being inspired by world-class athletes like these keeps us focused on what's redefining what's possible. That's what sets us apart. No one changes the game like NIKE, from our breakthrough innovation for toddlers with the Swoosh 1 shoe to being able to elevate beloved products like Kobe's into an entire franchise, to NBA players increasingly choosing to play in the Sabrina 1, a shoe deeply resonating across gender. Again and again, it's NIKE that pushes what's possible to break the status quo. Now, in addition to creating best-in-class innovation, great companies must also focus on strong execution.\nAnd that's what we did in Q2, delivering our second $13 billion quarter, this one on top of last year's extraordinary 27% growth. We drove more than 20% growth in earnings per share this quarter. Simply put, this is the result of relentless execution by our team in an uneven macro backdrop. Looking at holiday, we outpaced the industry, driving growth of close to 10%. NIKE Digital had its strongest Black Friday week ever, and a record number of consumers shopped in our stores over the long Thanksgiving weekend. In Greater China, brick and mortar grew double digits during National Day holiday, and NIKE once again outperformed the industry during 11.11 is the number one sport brand on Tmall.\nThese holiday results, when combined with Q2's earnings growth and our continued healthy inventory, showcase how we're executing against our priorities, even in the face of a highly promotional environment and increasing macro volatility. Last quarter, I talked about how we're getting back on our front foot, accelerating the flow of our innovation and executing with excellence across our winning formula of innovative product times distinctive storytelling times differentiated marketplace experiences. Let me give you a few examples of where we've demonstrated progress. Within our running business, we're driving deeper connections with the running community. We recently launched our most innovative trail shoe yet, the Ultrafly, at the world's pinnacle trail race. We hosted over 1,000 runners for a uniquely NIKE experience, which drove energy and positive feedback from both elite runners and the broader trail running community.\nAnd we partnered with top RSG doors for a series of community activations centered on the Ultrafly and other key products like Pegasus Trail, and Wildhorse. All this led to growth of over 20% in our trail running portfolio for the quarter. In global football, we're fueling growth through strategic-only NIKE athlete storytelling. As you know, we have a three-silo construct in men's football, having paired Erling Haaland with the Phantom Boot, Jamal Musiala with the Tiempo, and Kylian Mbappé and Marcus Rashford leading the Mercurial. With the game's greatest showcasing our product superiority and our seamless execution to pull this innovation through the marketplace, all three franchises are up strong double digits, even lapping last year's strong performance with the Men's World Cup. And in lifestyle, we're driving a women's-led geo-by-geo marketing acceleration behind V2K, a standout shoe in our fast-growing retro running line.\nIt's being fueled by a tongue-in-cheek campaign that's resonated with this consumer and a creator partnership strategy that's delivered head-to-toe style inspiration into her preferred media channels. All this catalyzed the V2K to very strong sell-through in the quarter, with exciting potential for this style still to come. All three of these examples offer an early indication of the growth we aspire to. We have real opportunity to drive progress across many dimensions of our business, and that's our priority moving forward. At NIKE, we like to say, \"We're on the offense always.\" When we see something that needs solving, we don't wait around. We solve it. And so, as we look to the future, we know where we must focus. Three areas will always drive our distinction and competitive separation: product innovation, storytelling that connects, and marketplace execution.\nWhen NIKE's at its best, we create impact on a scale that can't be matched, grounded in sport, centered in youth culture, inviting consumers around the world into our brands. The second half of Fiscal 2024 represents the start of a multi-year product innovation cycle that will introduce new franchises, concepts, and platforms, elevating our full portfolio. And while there'll be some key moments in the second half, this new innovation cycle will take some time to fully ramp up, given our size and scale. Now, we know we have an outsized opportunity to drive long-term profitable growth. We have areas of significant growth potential, like women's, Jordan Brand, and running, each of which requires focused investment to reach full potential. We also must get deeper traction on our key speed initiatives.\nToday, we know we must be faster, increasing the pace of innovation, increasing the pace of market-to-consumer, and increasing our agility and responsiveness. To drive this, we'll embrace a significant savings plan to create investment capacity to fuel profitable growth at speed and scale. Areas of potential savings include simplifying our product portfolio, increasing automation and the use of technology, streamlining our organization, and leveraging our scale to drive greater efficiency. Let me just acknowledge that this work will be led with respect and thoughtfulness as we move to improve the ways in which we work and build a leaner and stronger company for the future. Matt'll provide more detail on this later in the call. Now, we've made some progress as we look to accelerate growth in our business.\nI want to walk through two key areas today where we're investing for future and further growth: our women's business and Jordan Brand. Both women's and Jordan are opportunities that are grounded in performance and the ability to drive culture and lifestyle, with the latter providing even greater scale and growth opportunities. First, let's discuss women's, which is already a roughly $9 billion business, and that's just the NIKE brand, excluding Jordan and Converse. Our women's business has grown high single digits on average over the past three years. And while we're encouraged by this progress, we now have line of sight into what we believe is the best plan we've ever had to accelerate growth in women's. Our plan makes us even more confident in serving her through sport and style. Today, about 40% of our members are women consumers.\nThey make up a bigger proportion of new members, and their demand per member is growing faster. We see great opportunity to better serve this consumer by responding to her needs across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle. Let me first touch on performance, where we're focused on innovating for her to create new opportunities we did not previously serve. We've now built a collection of bras and leggings across different price points. This includes our statement leggings, Zenvy and Universa, all of which are above $100, a price point we were not previously in. These leggings serve her with a whole new approach to fit and comfort, thanks to new material innovation. We're holistically elevating our retail, presentation, and storytelling to help her find the right product for her exact needs. More and more women are joining our brand by purchasing these leggings.\nIn fact, all told, statement leggings fueled our fitness apparel growth in women's for the quarter. And in footwear, we're seeing very strong sell-through for the Motiva, a shoe with a comfortable and distinctive design that shows how we've dimensionalized performance into walking. And Free Metcon is also performing very well, serving her need for versatility by expanding a fitness shoe into comfortable everyday wear. And at the same time, when we look at women's lifestyle, we've established our leadership position in women's sportswear through a focus on style and comfort, with iconic franchises like Air Force 1, Dunk, Court, and Fleece, all of which drive continued momentum with new energy and design. And we're also fueling the rapidly growing retro running trend with our portfolio styles like the Vomero 5, V2K, and P-6000.\nIn fact, even with us sequentially increasing the supply, demand for this entire line is so strong there remains tremendous opportunity to grow further. We're excited to scale these styles over the next few seasons. And so today, we're taking the right steps to serve our women consumer with energy and sharpness. And we're fully aligned in accelerating our offense to raise our game with an eye to the immense opportunity we see going forward. Now, let's discuss Jordan Brand, which is on a clear path to become the number two footwear brand in North America, the biggest brand not named NIKE. We're fueling the strong momentum in Jordan by growing a Monday-to-Friday business with a more diverse product portfolio on top of our very successful launch business. Over the past few years, we've driven strong growth in the Jordan business by bringing more dimensions into the brand.\nWe're proving that Jordan can be more than retro, more than footwear, more than men's, and more than North America. An approach to growth will continue to bring life and growth over the coming years. This is just the beginning for Jordan Brand, as we see even greater growth potential through our plan for deeper investment, which for Jordan will come in areas like merchandising, marketing, and marketplace. For instance, today, Jordan Brand performance product is outpacing overall growth, with Jordan reigniting its on-court presence in basketball with the strongest signature portfolio ever, as Tatum, Luka, and Zion push the brand to new heights both on and off the court. Jordan's also expanding beyond basketball into, for example, golf, global football, and American football. Jordan women's and kids continues to lead the brand's overall growth.\nWomen's and kids business share within Jordan have increased seven points over the past three years. Jordan apparel is now a roughly billion-dollar business, averaging almost 20% growth over the past three years. We're also building new dimensions in the iconic AJ1 franchise across high, mid, and low, as well as through women's-led dimensions such as the Elevate and the Brooklyn Boot. I'd also like to spotlight Jordan's strategic approach and success with our Remix footwear line, which again has already surpassed the billion-dollar annual revenue mark with high double-digit growth. Led by styles like the Max Aura and the Stadium 90, Remix has increased Jordan's accessibility through more affordable price points and an expanded distribution with key partners. Last but not least, Jordan's share from international markets continues to expand as we bring the brand to global cities in an authentic way.\nThis has shown up as we pilot the Jordan Destination tab in the NIKE Commerce app in EMEA with stronger results. The Jordan World of Flight doors in Milan, Tokyo, and Seoul have emerged as the company's most productive retail concepts. The sky is the limit for Jordan as we continue to invest and explore what's possible for one of the world's leading brands. In the end, we are moving with confidence against the opportunities we see. Looking ahead to the next calendar year, we remain single-minded in our focus to compete and win. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's Q2 financial performance reflected our proactive marketplace management and disciplined execution, with tremendous delivery by our teams in a dynamic environment.\nRevenue was up slightly versus the prior year, growing 1% on a reported basis, as we compared a 17% reported and 27% currency-neutral revenue growth one year ago. Gross margins expanded despite a highly promotional marketplace. Combined with disciplined SG&A management, earnings per share and free cash flow accelerated. As I said last quarter, we believe we are turning the corner in driving more profitable and sustainable growth. At the same time, there were a number of puts and takes in the quarter. So before I walk through our financial results, let me share some perspective on our performance in light of current macro and consumer trends, as well as additional insight into our business direction. Now, as you recall, we moved proactively in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory and reduce wholesale selling for the first half of Fiscal 2024.\nWhile this dampened our reported revenue growth through Q2, total retail sales in the quarter grew across the marketplace on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. ASPs were up across both footwear and apparel, and AURs grew across channels. Average order values among NIKE members increased versus the prior year. Our higher-priced products, in particular, have been resilient, with our $100+ footwear models driving strong growth in units sold across the marketplace. Overall, we have maintained lower markdown rates than many of our competitors. In the most impactful consumer shopping moments, NIKE's brand strength created even greater separation. We delivered market-leading results in Greater China on Double 11. Over the Black Friday and Cyber Week period, NIKE Direct grew approximately 10% across North America, EMEA, and APLA. In Q2, NIKE Direct once again led our growth, and wholesale shipments exceeded our expectations.\nHaving said that, we are seeing indications of more cautious consumer behavior around the world in an uneven macro environment. Total retail sales across the marketplace fell short of our expectations, with softer demand outside of the key consumer moments. While NIKE's store traffic continued to grow, we saw softness in digital traffic and higher levels of promotional activity across the marketplace. As a result, we are adjusting our channel growth plans for the remainder of the year. Looking to our product portfolio, our top franchises continue to drive strong full-price sales. But we intentionally manage the life cycle of these models across the marketplace for long-term value. Given the promotional environment and the cautious consumer behavior that we are seeing, we are stepping up our plans to reduce marketplace supply of our key franchises.\nOur goal is to focus NIKE's brand heat and energy on what is new as we accelerate our product innovation cycle. We have seen encouraging signs from recent consumer activations around some of NIKE's latest innovations and newness. We intend to accelerate our pace through the Paris Olympics and beyond. While this will initially take some time, we are confident in our pipeline and the product journeys, stories, and consumer energy to come. Now, as you heard from John, our priority is to drive sustainable and profitable long-term growth while building a faster, more efficient NIKE. Since Fiscal 2019, our investments in accelerating NIKE's consumer direct vision have created new operating capabilities, added tens of millions of new members to our member base, and delivered a return of more than $12 billion of incremental revenue. However, we have also added complexity and inefficiency.\nIn this competitive environment, we need to accelerate our pace of innovation, elevate our marketplace experiences, maximize the impact of our storytelling, and increase our speed and responsiveness, all in service of the consumer. To do this, we are creating investment capacity to fuel NIKE's next phase of innovation, growth, and profitability. We are identifying opportunities across the company to deliver up to $2 billion in cumulative cost savings over the next three years, both up and down our P&L and across our value chain. Some examples include simplifying our product assortment, improving supply chain efficiency, leveraging our scale to lower the marginal cost of operations, increasing automation and speed from data and technology, streamlining our organizational structure, reducing management layers, and enhancing our procurement capabilities.\nAs we look to drive greater efficiency and productivity, we will reallocate and invest the majority of these savings to deliver the greatest consumer impact on our largest growth opportunities. Ultimately, we believe that building a faster and more efficient NIKE will accelerate future growth and innovation and deliver long-term profitability, creating value for years to come. We will continue sharing updates over the coming quarters. Now, let me turn to our NIKE Inc Q2 results. In Q2, NIKE Inc revenue was up 1% on a reported basis and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis, following our strong top-line growth one year ago. NIKE Direct grew 4%, with NIKE Stores up 9% and NIKE Digital up 1%, while wholesale declined 3%.\nGross margins expanded 170 basis points to 44.6% on a reported basis, driven by strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates, improved supply chain efficiency, and modest markdown improvements, partially offset by higher product input costs. This included impact from approximately 60 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A grew 1% on a reported basis, favorable to our expectations through disciplined expense management and some shifts in timing of spending. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.9% compared to 19.3% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.03, up 21% year over year. NIKE inventory dollars are down 14% versus the prior year and down high single digits versus the prior quarter.\nIn total, NIKE inventory dollars are down over $1.5 billion from the peak at the end of Q1 in the prior year, with days in inventory continuing to improve. Total footwear and apparel inventory units across the marketplace are down double digits versus the prior year. Now, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue declined 3%, with wholesale down 9% versus the prior year. NIKE Direct grew 3%, with NIKE Stores up 4% and NIKE Digital up 2%. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis. This follows extraordinary growth in Q2 of Fiscal 2023, with North America revenue up 31%, NIKE Direct up 23%, NIKE Digital up 31%, and wholesale up 37%. This quarter, we saw mid-single-digit retail sales growth with key partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods, JD Finish Line, and Hibbett. Jordan and women's led our momentum in the marketplace.\nWith Jordan, remix footwear grew double digits, and the AJ11 Gratitude release delivered the brand's largest shock drop ever. Within women's, Dunk, Free Metcon, and our $100+ statement leggings delivered strong growth. In addition, Structure 25 and Vomero 17, our latest updates for everyday runners, drove positive response from consumers and running specialty partners. In EMEA, Q2 revenue declined 3%, with wholesale down 8%. NIKE Direct was up 7%, as NIKE Stores grew 8% and NIKE Digital grew 7%. EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. As a reminder, this also compares to tremendous growth in Q2 of Fiscal 2023, with EMEA revenue up 33%, NIKE Direct up 44%, NIKE Digital up 62%, and wholesale up 28%. Against the backdrop of increased macro headwinds, we saw strong consumer response to newness and premium innovation. Our winterized running products drove positive sell-through, along with strong growth from Invincible, Vaporfly, and Ultrafly.\nMercurial and Phantom and Tiempo grew double digits. And our retro running styles, including V2K, P6000, and Shox, continue to energize the marketplace. In Greater China, Q2 revenue grew 8% and wholesale grew 19%. NIKE Direct declined 4%, with NIKE Stores growing 16% and NIKE Digital declining 22%. EBIT grew 1% on a reported basis, with multiple points of impact from foreign exchange. On the whole, we are seeing a highly promotional marketplace with increased macro headwinds, especially on digital. That said, Q2 was another strong quarter in brick and mortar, with continued improvement in full-price sales and sales in NIKE-owned and partnered doors growing mid-teens versus the prior year. We also continue to see strong momentum with key strategic partners, including Topsports and Pou Sheng. And NIKE continues to strengthen its lead as Chinese consumers' number one cool and favorite brand.\nTurning to our product portfolio, performance outpaced lifestyle this quarter, with innovation and hyper-local storytelling resonating with consumers. We saw strong momentum in basketball, fitness, retro running footwear, and winterized apparel. Locally inspired Express Lane collections, including our street dance-inspired Dunk and hyper-local Pegasus releases, were top choices for consumers. Overall, our inventory remains healthy, with units down and improved markdown rates versus the prior year. Looking ahead, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment. However, we remain confident in NIKE's brand strength, our deep consumer connections, and our foundation for long-term growth in China. In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 10% and wholesale grew 7%. NIKE Direct grew 15% as NIKE Stores grew 17% and NIKE Digital grew 14%. EBIT grew 7% on a reported basis. Southeast Asia, India, Korea, and Mexico grew double digits, leading a record quarter for the geography.\nOur Flipkart and Myntra platforms drove strong growth in India. Korea led record member day sales in the geography, and Mexico accelerated its digital momentum over the Buen Fin shopping holiday. We saw strong momentum across our portfolio, led by Jordan and Kids. Jordan Brand delivered strong growth in Remix footwear, AJ1 Essentials, and Signature Basketball. In Kids, lifestyle and global football grew double digits, with positive momentum from All Kids Fleece, Court Borough, and the Mercurial. All told, our team executed with tremendous focus and agility to deliver our Q2 results while managing through volatility. Last quarter, as I provided guidance, I highlighted a number of risks in our operating environment, including the effects of a stronger US dollar on foreign currency translation, consumer demand over the holiday season, and our second-half wholesale order books. Looking forward, the impact of these risks is becoming clearer.\nAs a result, we are adjusting our full-year financial outlook. Looking to the balance of the year, we expect Q3 reported revenue to be slightly negative as we again compare to double-digit growth in the prior year, and Q4 reported revenue to be up low single digits, with full-year reported revenue now growing approximately 1%. This new outlook reflects increased macro headwinds, particularly in Greater China and EMEA, adjusted digital growth plans based on recent digital traffic softness and higher marketplace promotions, lifecycle management of key product franchises, and a stronger US dollar that has negatively impacted second-half reported revenue versus 90 days ago. I will also remind you that there are approximately 400 basis points of headwinds from supply disruptions and accelerated liquidation in the prior year.\nWe expect increased gross margin expansion in our second half, with Q3 margins expanding 160 to 180 basis points and Q4 margins expanding 225 to 250 basis points. We continue to expect full-year gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points. This reflects benefits from strategic price increases, improved ocean freight rates, and supply chain efficiency, partially offset by higher product input costs and approximately 60 basis points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We expect full-year SG&A growth to improve to low single digits, excluding restructuring charges, as we continue to tightly manage expenses and improve productivity and efficiency. Specifically, we expect SG&A dollars in both Q3 and Q4 to be modestly above our first-half run rate, excluding the charge. We anticipate a restructuring charge of $400 to 450 million in our second half, primarily related to severance costs, which will be recognized largely in the Q3.\nWe expect full-year SG&A, including the restructuring charge, to grow mid-single digits. We now expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to be $275 to 325 million for the full year. We continue to expect our full-year effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. Taken all together, strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost controls are enabling us to offset softer second-half revenue and drive earnings growth. Excluding restructuring charges, we expect to deliver on our prior full-year earnings outlook. While we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic, we have been here before, and we know that moments like this are when NIKE operates and executes at its best. We will stay on the offense, manage risk, optimize opportunity, and leverage our strengths to create even further competitive separation.\nAs we move forward, our focus is building a faster, more efficient NIKE and embracing the opportunities in front of us to accelerate sustainable and more profitable growth. So with that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. We also ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks. So two-part question.\nJohn, could you maybe elaborate on the structural changes that you cited that maybe in the pivot to the front foot on innovation, just the structural changes that you see supporting that and what that means for the product pipeline as we think to next year? And then, Matt, maybe footnote that portion of the press release relative to the commentary around the second half, just how best to footnote this? And could you help break down the change in your Q2 revenue or your second-half revenue outlook between retail and wholesale?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYou want to go first, Matt?\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nAll right. Yeah. Let me go ahead and start, talking a bit about the environment that we're operating in right now and what's changed and what we're seeing.\nWe obviously delivered a strong quarter and delivered revenue in line with the guidance we gave 90 days ago, and are incredibly pleased with the disciplined execution and management of the marketplace, including our inventory being down 14% and NIKE+ partner inventory being down double digits versus the prior year. But what we saw in the quarter was a bifurcation of performance. And specifically, what I mean is that we saw incredibly strong performance for the NIKE brand over the largest consumer moments if you bookend from back to school in the prior quarter through Black Friday and Cyber Monday this quarter. But in the periods in between, we saw softer performance in the marketplace. And as a result of that, total retail sales in the quarter were below the expectations that we set for ourselves 90 days ago.\nAs a result of that, and specifically considering the promotional activity we see in the marketplace and some of the softness in digital, we've lowered our guidance for the balance of this year and provided a little bit of sharpness for you on Q3 and Q4 in particular. Q3 really is reflective of the comparisons to the prior year, much like we anniversaried this quarter. But overall, we've taken a more prudent approach to our planning for the balance of the year, given the increased macro headwinds we're seeing in China and EMEA in particular, and the way that we've adjusted our digital growth downward based on the traffic softness that we've seen and the higher marketplace promotions.\nSo connected to what John will talk about in a second, our focus is on newness and innovation, particularly because in an environment like this where the consumer is cautious and we're seeing higher levels of promotional activity, it's newness and innovation which really creates brand distinction in this environment. We're even seeing it in the context of recent releases and recent product introductions that we've had over the last 60 to 90 days.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nMatt, to the first part of your question regarding the structural changes, as you know, six months ago, we realigned our entire organization under Heidi O'Neill and Craig Williams as our co-presidents. It is making a huge difference in our focus and ability to execute.\nAs you know, we're single-mindedly focused on aligning our entire team to drive what NIKE does best: innovative product combined with distinctive storytelling, combined with unique marketplace experiences. And as Matt just said, we have a real focus, Heidi, Craig, and teams, a real focus on newness and driving our next product innovation cycle, which will elevate our entire portfolio. Right? This is what NIKE does best. And we're doing it with consistency and scale where we want to break through. That's our focus. And so you're seeing some, I'll maybe pick one example where you're seeing some early results. Look at what's happening in basketball right now. Right? We are bringing fresh, innovative product at scale. So the past six months, we've launched Sabrina 1, LeBron 21, Tatum 1, Luka 2. The Ja 1, you saw Ja come back two nights ago, the Ja 1 on Christmas Day.\nSo that's creating huge momentum in basketball with great innovation. In the next three months, we add to that G.T. Cut, which is one of our most innovative shoes to date, the Book 1, which we think has great appeal on and off the court, and of course, Kobe, which we think has huge potential on an ongoing basis. This is driving momentum both on the court through performance, like NIKE does, innovation and performance, and off the court. That translates into lifestyle. You may have seen LeBron was wearing the Lunar Roam walking into his game the other night, and Lunar Roam sold out in seconds the day we launched it two days ago.\nAnd so what you're seeing is when we focus our guns on driving performance innovation, translating that into lifestyle, we can cut through and drive scale and consistency like no one else can. So as we look ahead, we're excited about 10th anniversary of Air Max Day. That's coming up in March. The Air Max DN is our best Air Max product in years. You'll see us really get behind it. That will be, I think, both a successful shoe, but more importantly, can help lift the Air Max portfolio. With running, we'll be focusing on calendar 2024 will be the year of Pegasus for us with the PEG 41 and the PEG family refresh. And then we're getting excited and gearing up for the Olympics, right, in Paris this summer. That's when NIKE shines its best.\nYou'll see us really using air as a source of innovation, both in performance and in lifestyle. So you called it a pivot. I just think it's an acceleration, an alignment, and an acceleration of speed and focus is distinct, and we feel it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Binetti\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here, and thanks for all the detail today, particularly around some of the longer-term thinking in the business. Some of the longer-term commentary is pretty helpful. I'm just wondering if we can help true up the margin story for the next few years. I guess, would you—is the $2 billion in cost savings, we said the majority will be reinvested?\nIf I try to think back to the longer-term target of getting the business to the high teens margins, this should go a long way. Is your feeling that the net amount of these efficiencies takes us to that multi-year target? And then considering, Matt, the commentary on the second-half revenues here, a lot of it sounds like it's macro in China. Maybe some help thinking about as we look past 2024. Do you have visibility yet to say, \"Hey, we've got the controllable to help us offset some of the macro pressures that we see to make 2025 an algorithm revenue year\"?\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSure, Michael. Well, let me start on the margins. I think that this quarter was really a strong proof point with strong gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion. The team's execution and gross margin in particular was really strong.\nWhen we look at the drivers of it, it's a combination of recovery of the transitory headwinds, which we've been talking about for a couple of years now, but also structural drivers like price increases, which we've been able to sustain in this environment, and supply chain efficiencies, specifically meaning that we're improving our cost per unit as we deliver product into the marketplace. And so the underlying drivers that were behind our long-term margin goals are still there, and this quarter is a great proof point as we're on that trajectory. The way to connect it to the Save to Invest plan is to think a little bit about the opportunities for us to drive more profitable growth as we look forward. And I've been talking for a couple of quarters now about lowering our marginal cost of growth.\nWhen I look back on some of the long-term targets that we've given, like SG&A as a percentage of revenue being below pre-pandemic levels, we've largely done it. When we look at our resources today, we see greater opportunity for efficiency, effectiveness, and reinvesting some of those resources for higher return opportunities, like John mentioned. So that's really what we're focused on. I will remind you what I said on the call, which is that this isn't just SG&A. The $2 billion Save to Invest plan is up and down the P&L, and it's across our value chain. So we will see benefits in SG&A, but we really are looking at the business holistically. Our focus as we look forward is to drive more profitable growth over the next several years. We remain confident in the long-term margin goals that we've been talking about.\nAnd so as we approach 2025, we know that we're due to provide an update on those long-term goals, but we still remain confident on the endpoint. As it relates to the revenue, just hit it quickly. Yes, we are largely seeing adjustments based on increased macro headwinds in China and in Europe. The element that we can control in this is the commentary I made around managing our franchises. We have incredibly strong franchises. In fact, we build dimension to franchises. It's what we do to drive growth in our business. And we continue to see those largest franchises driving year-over-year growth and selling at levels of full price realization that's above the goals that we've set for the business.\nBut we know in an environment like this, when the consumer's under pressure and the promotional activity is higher, that it's newness and it's innovation which causes the consumer to act. And John just referenced a number of products and product launches in the last 45 to 60 days where we're seeing an incredible amount of consumer energy in response to newness and new stories. And we've seen either full sellouts or incredibly high levels of full price selling. And I won't rename all the products, but what it demonstrates is what we already know, which is that in this type of an environment, what we control is accelerating our pace of innovation and newness in order to give the consumer something to want to continue to invest in this category. And we think that we can do it like nobody else.\nWhat you're hearing from us is a controllable effort to accelerate that pace, managing some of the larger franchises and really accelerating as we go forward. That'll start with many of the items we've been talking about in our portfolio through the balance of this year. And then the acceleration you're going to see and feel, especially as we focus our brand heat on this newness, will carry us into 2025. We know it's going to take time because you got to scale this newness and the innovation, and that's what we're focused on doing. Our guidance for the second half from a controllable perspective is also reflecting on the proactive actions we're taking to manage our product portfolio as we look forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gabriella Carbone from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Line is open. Gabriella, you're.\n\nGabriella Carbone\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, hi.\nThank you so much for taking my question. Sorry about that. I want to dig in a little bit more on the running category, particularly. How has your approach to this category maybe changed over the past year? And then I know you mentioned trail running. Are there any other products of this category? You mentioned scaling moving ahead, but that you've been seeing good customer response and that you're excited about.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Gabriella, we've made running a key priority. We talk about three areas we're really getting behind where we see huge growth opportunity at being women's, Jordan, and running. And as you said, in running, we tend to break it into three categories. And for us, it starts with road racing. That's the pinnacle. That's the peak.\nAnd as you know, in the past three to six months, we are dominating it through the Alphafly 3, which debuted in the Chicago Marathon. Kelvin Kiptum, as I mentioned in my remarks, set a world record. It's dominating the podiums for both men and women. And that'll actually be launching, available to the public in Q3. And as we see people going into racing into the Olympics, both marathon and otherwise, our performance running for racing is unmatched. And then as trail, as you mentioned, that's the fastest running segment, grew 20% for us. And we do what we do. It's innovation's driving it. So the Ultrafly, which is the first trail shoe with a carbon fiber plate, that's, again, very Nike, very classic Nike innovation, performance innovation, along with Pegasus Trail and Zegama.\nTrail is growing fast, partly because trail running's growing, but increasingly, trail shoes are becoming lifestyle shoes. They're being worn on the streets, particularly in EMEA and in Europe, but also around the world. So we'll continue to invest in great product there, as well as, as I said in my remarks, our ground game. Then in the road running or everyday running category, this is the area where we have the most work. So we have good product. We had some nice wins in the quarter, the Structure 25 and the Vomero 17, which were our latest updates for everyday runners. They had positive response from consumers, and specialty runners, but we're very focused on building out our ground game with everyday runners.\nThat means getting into the RSGs, back into the RSGs, and being present where runners are, whether it's not just at the marathons where the elite runners are, but the everyday races in the key cities around the world, and the running communities. You'll see us; we are steadily investing in that and building our presence there. As we look forward, in terms of driving scale in everyday running, as I mentioned earlier, we're focused on Pegasus. That's our largest franchise, one of the largest franchises in running history, period. We're very excited about PEG 41 and updates across the PEG family, which are coming in calendar 2024. So a lot of focus. We'll report in road everyday running. It's going to be quarter by quarter, steady progress, steady progress, steady progress toward our goal.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nI'd just add too that we're excited about the product portfolio we have below $100. That product offering that's coming to market in the coming quarters will also enable us to get back on our front foot at an important price point in multiple markets across the world.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLorraine Hutchinson\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus on the China margins for a minute. And was just curious, outside of the FX hit that you're facing, do you see an opportunity to drive margins in China back toward pre-COVID levels, or has something changed that makes that market less profitable?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nWell, Lorraine, let me first just step back and look at how we see China for a minute, and then we'll talk about margins because if you don't have a great business, it's hard to have great margins. The fact is we feel very good about our position in China and our ability to compete. That has not changed from 90 days ago. China's sport is back. The China consumer's back out on the street with a real focus on active and healthy lifestyles. You see the government encouraging sport and healthy lifestyles. Gen Z is the most active generation ever. So that's a tailwind for our industry. Even in the face of macro uncertainty, our brand is continuing to resonate.\nWe're doing what NIKE does so well, which is taking global products, global innovations, global brand, global athletes, and powerfully combining them and connecting them to local culture, local sport, and local consumer moments. A wonderful example last quarter is Eliud Kipchoge, the world's best marathoner, did a tour through China right before the Shanghai Marathon. As you know, we sponsor the Shanghai Marathon. And sure enough, we dominated shoe counts in the top 100. We swept the women's podium. And that's bringing energy and running and the lifestyle of running. And it's growing the market. I mean, I think we're a great percent. Yes, there's some macro headwinds, but we feel very good about our position and our ability to compete.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah.\nOn the profitability side, what I'd say, Lorraine, is that this quarter, if we exclude the impact of FX, our EBIT grew faster than revenue in Greater China. And so I think it's a great proof point that we can start to expand margins and move back towards where we were prior to the pandemic. I did mention that the marketplace is highly promotional, and we're seeing that especially on digital. And so in the near term, the promotional nature of the marketplace is holding us back. But what I would tell you is that our inventory units are down versus the prior year. Our full price realization is continuing to improve in our stores and our partner stores. And as we look at the environment that we're in right now, we're not going to race to the bottom on digital.\nWe're going to focus on prioritizing brand health and brand strength. Right now, the digital marketplace in particular is at the highest of promotional activity. So an element of us revising our guidance for the balance of this year is an acknowledgment that we don't want to chase that. That's not who Nike is. We're going to focus on innovation and newness and building a strong business in the marketplace on things like the basketball products that John referenced. We're super excited about bringing Kobe to market in Greater China. The Jordan business continues to have tremendous resonance there. That's how we're going to grow and continue to compete in that market.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nExcellent. Happy holidays, and thanks for taking my question.\nMatt, how should we think about operating overhead and demand creation going forward as we think about the overall SG&A piece of the business? There's obviously some restructuring and some cost savings, but is this a time you need to reinvest given the changes in the competitive environment and the need to reinvigorate the product cycle and the marketing? Curious how we should think about the SG&A algorithm going forward.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah. I mean, John, when we think about the Save to Invest plan and the value it will create and the capacity it will create for us to be able to invest in the biggest growth opportunities we see, we don't envision that as being people. We envision that as being consumer-facing investment, bringing product innovation to market and having maximum impact with the consumer.\nOur goal here is to see a reallocation of resources through this program so that more of our dollars are going towards consumer-facing activities that can have the kind of impact that you referenced. We believe when we look at the size of the market, our position against some of the categories that John referenced, and/or the way the consumer is continuing to encourage us to bring them new and interesting things from a Jordan perspective, we see opportunity to continue to grow our business. That's where our focus is. I think we're focused on driving more profitable growth.\nThat should mean that there's some leverage in SG&A, but you should also expect to see us reinvesting some of the resources that we're taking out of the business back in things that are consumer-facing that have an impact on sport, and that continue to enable us to maximize the impact of the stories that we want to tell.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nIt's exactly why we're doing it because we want to double down on our investments to capitalize on growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nIke Boruchow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good afternoon.\nThanks for taking the question. Matt, maybe for you, just on the North America market, can you just comment more broadly or specifically on the current state of the inventory situation, maybe both yours and just competitively of what you're seeing out there in holiday?\nAnd then just timeline on when you think that the inventory dynamics, and at least North America, might be more cleaned up or more healthy for the brand to start to see better price realization and growth. Thanks.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE",
    "content2": "Sure. Well, so in the quarter, we did see growth in retail sales in North America versus the prior year. Remember, it wasn't a lot of growth because we were comping some very significant growth rates in the prior year. The actions that we've taken on inventory are significant. And our inventory units are down strong double digits in North America. That's the biggest market where we've seen the biggest movement in our inventory. When we look at the level of inventory in our partners relative to their current level of retail sales, we feel good about the weeks of supply that we have there.\nWhat I would tell you, in the large majority of our partners, we also are seeing the highest mix of current season inventory that we've seen in many, many seasons. So we feel great that our partners are positioned to put our newest and most relevant product in front of the consumer. We are watching the marketplace closely because my comments around the big consumer moments and the in-between periods apply to North America as well. So we are watching cautious consumer behavior there. But at this point, we feel great about our inventory. And that's why we're so focused on newness and innovation because that's what's going to pull us through a promotional marketplace like we have. So there's definitely a lot of inventory in the market across brands, but we feel great about where we are.\nNewness and innovation is what will enable us to earn open-to-buy in our partners and will enable us to re-accelerate the top line.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPaul Lejuez\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys. I'm curious if you could talk about and quantify the cumulative freight drag that you've seen over the past two years and the timing of how you will recapture that freight drag in Fiscal 2024 versus Fiscal 2025 just based on your recent freight contracts. And what are the offsets as we think about potential puts and takes on the gross margin line 2024, 2025? Thanks.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nWell, sure. We've been talking about 200 basis points of impact from ocean freight cumulatively over the past two years. And we started to see those transitory benefits begin to recapture here in the Q2.\nSome of our upside in the quarter versus our guidance was, it came a little bit earlier than we had anticipated. Our rates for this year locked. And so we expect to continue to see that recovery of that in Q3 and Q4. One of the other transitory impacts that we're watching closely was markdowns. And right now, we're only planning for a very modest amount of markdown recovery relative to the markdowns that we incurred in the prior year. And that's just given where the marketplace is. We've decided to take a more prudent approach to our margin guidance for the balance of the year given some of the uncertainties that are out there. So when we look to the balance of this year, we're encouraged by the second-half expansion being higher than the first-half expansion.\nOne of the other things that we're starting to get visibility into when we look at our margins in Q4 is product costs. Product input costs are starting to flip to a tailwind. So when we think about the long-term margin goals that we have, the teams are executing well, and we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing through this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

Welcome to NIKE, Inc's fiscal 2024 Q1 conference call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Trussell. Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, NIKE\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc's fiscal 2024 Q1 results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc President and CEO John Donahoe and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nThese risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted.\nWe will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to participate as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc President and CEO John Donahoe.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. NIKE's foundational competitive advantages are the envy of the industry. As the global athletic market leader, our scale and portfolio allow us to create an impact that only NIKE can. Consumers all over the world recognize NIKE as the number one champion for athletes and sport as we fuel inspiration and push the limit of human potential with the industry's most innovative products. Over the past few years, we've navigated through an unprecedented external environment. We've worked through many challenges: societal, geopolitical, global health, supply chain, and more. And during this time, NIKE has grown larger and stronger. In fiscal 2019, NIKE's revenues were $39 billion. Today, we're over $50 billion. And what's more, our growth has outpaced the overall industry during this period.\nLet me offer a few examples of how we've redefined the game over the past few years. The consumer told us they wanted a lifestyle product, and we delivered, growing Air Force 1, AJ1, and Dunk to be the three largest footwear franchises in industry history. We continue to set the bar in key global sports like basketball and global football. Jordan is now one of the leading brands in North America with potential for so much more. We've accelerated digital capabilities that fuel engagement with our brands and deepen direct consumer connections around the world. The list could go on and on. But we have a saying here at NIKE: \"There is no finish line. We never settle. We always measure ourselves against our full potential.\" NIKE has always been synonymous with sport.\nWe're at our best when we deliver breakthrough ideas by lining up innovative products with distinctive storytelling delivered through differentiated marketplace experiences. When we do it well, we expand and grow the market. Today, as I've just mentioned, we're succeeding in many areas of our business, but we expect more of ourselves and others. For example, over the past few years, we launched new product innovations in running, but we need to drive more meaningful consumer connections among everyday runners and scale these innovations more effectively across the marketplace.\nOur storytelling has driven energy in many areas, but we have the opportunity to cut through with more sharpness and clarity around the performance benefits and distinction of our products. We've built the best-in-class marketplace with unrivaled scale and reach. But we have the opportunity to deliver more compelling assortments, particularly when it comes to serving our women consumers.\nSo across our company, we are focused and mobilized to address areas where we need to raise our game while continuing to drive competitive separation across the board. We're aligned, we're competent, and we've kicked into a new gear. One recent example: a couple of weeks ago, we had over 300 leaders from across the globe gathered here in Beaverton to immerse ourselves in our Fall 2024 lineup.\nNow, our teams have been back together in person over the past 15 months, and our innovation pipeline is strong, and it was on full display. The excitement and alignment of our leadership team was clear as we continue to obsess the product and storytelling we'll be bringing to life for consumers at the Paris Olympics and into the fall. Simply put, our teams are on the offense as we compete to win in all segments.\nAnd so today, I'd like to offer three examples where NIKE showed our best this quarter, where we brought together product, storytelling, and marketplace to connect with consumers and drive results. Let's start with this summer's World Cup. At NIKE, as I've said before, it always starts with great product. And in football, that's led by Phantom Luna and Mercurial, our most innovative football boots, as well as our array of national team kits designed for elite female players. And last but not least, our style-driven collections that stood out so well this summer. We brought our culture of innovation to life through our storytelling as we dominated the conversation with a leading share of social voice. In particular, we were incredibly effective in reaching Gen Z women through our lens of sports, style, and culture.\nOn TikTok, our priority channel for Gen Z, our engaged audience, meaning those who actively interacted with our content, was up 172%, a huge statement of NIKE's ability to connect with authenticity to this important demographic. We also extended the tournament's energy through our stores. I was in Australia this summer and got to experience our Dream Arena, the immersive retail destination we created for the World Cup by transforming our Sydney flagship store, just the latest example of how we can amplify global sport moments at retail. The experiences inside Dream Arena included the best of NIKE: jersey customization, local co-creator workshops, NIKE trainer-led workouts, exclusive product launches, and more. The response to Dream Arena surpassed our expectations with some great learnings we plan to use at scale moving forward. All this led to results.\nIn both footwear and apparel, we beat our sell-through plans with strong double-digit growth across men's, women's, and kids in global football. Among all our key boot franchises, Mercurial, Phantom, Tiempo, and Phantom Luna saw double-digit growth in Q1, leading global football to grow double digits in the geo. In APLA, football also grew double digits with strong growth in kids' sized kits as we continue to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the sport. Whether it was from this summer's World Cup and the Euros last summer or the WNBA and our investment in coaching, we are committed to growing the game for women's sport. Next, let's touch on basketball, another area where you can see our end-to-end offense driving accelerated competitive advantage. In basketball, we have an unprecedented portfolio of product.\nEarlier this month, we announced our latest signature shoe, Devin Booker's Nike Book 1. It's a shoe built for comfort and performance with clean on-and-off-court style. The Nike Book 1 will hit retail in December with consumer energy already building. The Sabrina 1 continued its very strong sell-through this quarter with both women's and men's interest high. Just a few hours ago, we launched the LeBron 21. The 21 builds on the success of the 20 by keeping its low-profile design and adding premium lightweight materials designed to connect with younger generations. Q1 also saw the official introduction of the Kobe brand. We commemorated Kobe Day on 24 August with re-releases to very strong demand. In fact, demand so strong that we only fulfilled a fraction of it.\nAlong with Vanessa Bryant, we also selected six schools to be honored as Mamba programs for the upcoming college basketball season, with both their men's and women's teams having the opportunity to wear Kobe brand player-exclusive footwear. We see huge potential with the Kobe brand both on and off the court as we continue to honor his legacy. This quarter, we also brought the energy of basketball directly to the consumer. We hosted tournaments in cities like LA and Chicago, culminating with the NIKE World Basketball Festival in New York. These events created an electric atmosphere, especially during the NBA off-season, like only NIKE can.\nIn a quarter where Jordan footwear grew double digits, the Jordan Brand demonstrated its power by bringing Zion, Luka, and Jayson Tatum to Paris for Quai 54, which is one of the world's biggest streetwear and streetball tournaments that doubles as a showcase of the culture and growing community of basketball. Now, moments like these don't just grow competitive separation for NIKE and Jordan. They also are how we grow the game and we grow the broader market. Finally, I'll walk through the geography where our overall vision comes to life best: Greater China.\nIn Q1, Greater China grew double digits for the second straight quarter and we're taking share in the market. It's in Greater China that we offer the consumer NIKE's most premium and elevated retail. The team gets the most out of our innovative product through world-class and locally relevant storytelling and strong marketplace execution.\nA great example is our women's business, which outpaced overall growth in the quarter. The work the team has done to serve our women's consumer in Greater China is proof of what NIKE can do when all the pieces are aligned. A highlight in Q1 in Greater China was our three-day sports festival, Sportchella, where we welcomed thousands of women to connect with our three brands through movement and mindfulness. The team amplified the impact of the festival by partnering with Tmall to create the first NIKE Super Brand Week, which drove more than 2 billion impressions. This partnership seamlessly integrated the event with a digital shopping journey that generated very strong consumer response and engagement. Our Greater China team also brings our brand to life through our best retail experiences, fueled by strong and meaningful storytelling.\nThese breakthrough retail experiences highlight our innovations and marketing in a clear package for the consumer. For example, in Q1, our seasonal presentations and curated head-to-toe style guides had very favorable consumer response. Once again, this combination of innovation, storytelling, and marketplace execution led to results. We took share in women's and Greater China this quarter with strong growth across a wide range of products, from footwear with the Motiva and Free Metcon to apparel with our statement bras and leggings. All in all, across our entire portfolio, the Greater China team has orchestrated a fully connected marketplace. They continue to transform digital commerce, launching China-specific versions of our apps, which are faster for consumers and more personalized, including a new Jordan destination to the NIKE app in Q1.\nAnd their expanding connected partnership, which after just a few quarters is now live in 350 doors across 102 cities and is driving substantially higher member demand versus last quarter. Simply put, Greater China sets the execution standard for us. Our goal is to scale their success across all of our geographies, every sport, and every dimension of our business.\nThat's how we win over the long term. In the end, as I've said, we're focused and moving with great confidence against the opportunities we see. Our teams feel energized, united by our shared passion and urgency for competing at the highest level. We set high expectations for ourselves at NIKE. That's what winners do. Now, more than ever, we're ready to bring our very best and demonstrate what NIKE is capable of. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's Q1 results demonstrated the impact of staying on the offense when we drove a quicker return to a healthy marketplace in fiscal 2023 and leading with operational discipline as we begin the new fiscal year. We delivered Q1 results in line with our guidance. Retail sales across NIKE Direct and wholesale continue to grow on top of extraordinary sales this past year. Both NIKE inventory and our total marketplace inventory are healthy. Working capital efficiency is improving with a normalized supply chain. Gross margins are expanding on an operational basis, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, and transitory headwinds are abating. In short, we are building on a strong foundation for sustainable and more profitable long-term growth.\nBefore reviewing our financial results, let me first speak to what we are seeing from our consumer in the marketplace and where we are driving focus and attention to unlock even greater potential ahead. In Q1, retail sales across NIKE Direct and wholesale grew mid-single digits versus the prior year. Our top franchises are driving strong full-price sales, and our newest product offerings across NIKE, Jordan, and Converse are generating positive consumer reception.\nLooking at inventory, we continue to feel very good about our position. NIKE inventory dollars are down 10% versus the prior year. Our total inventory units across the marketplace, including NIKE and our wholesale partners, are down double digits versus the prior year. Partner-owned inventory units are in line with the previous year, with levels planned to remain lean through our Q2, a meaningful accomplishment after higher levels of wholesale sell-in during fiscal 2023.\nOn the whole, we're very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we're seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell-in in our second half. Overall, we're confident in the health and shape of our marketplace. NIKE Direct continues to lead our growth up 6% versus the prior year. As we deliver on our strategy to elevate the marketplace through premium physical and digital retail experiences, we continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands.\nIn fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year, with increasing average order values. Our stores delivered an especially strong quarter, with traffic up double digits from last year and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels.\nThis is similar to what we are seeing across the industry. After seeing this trend build in early July or in early June, our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full-price sales across our entire store fleet. NIKE Digital grew 2% with non-linear comparisons to the prior year, including liquidation actions and a higher number of product launches on the SNKRS app in fiscal 2023. Looking through all that, what stands out are the underlying consumer trends we see in our digital business. This includes sustained momentum on the NIKE mobile app, with growth in traffic and increasing member buying frequency. We continue to see a growing structural advantage as more consumers start their shopping journeys with us on mobile. Meanwhile, within wholesale, we see largely positive results from our most important strategic partners.\nSpecifically, we were pleased to see high single-digit to low double-digit retail sales growth and strong inventory management with many of our key partners, including Dick's Sporting Goods and City Specialty Partners in North America, JD, Zalando, and Sports Direct in EMEA, and Top Sports in Pou Sheng in Greater China. We continue the reset of our business with Foot Locker, planning for near-term sales declines as they invest in consumer-right concepts for the future.\nUltimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels, with no single partner representing more than a mid-single-digit of NIKE's total business. Looking across the entire marketplace, we are confident in our brand momentum as we accelerate direct consumer connections, elevate our brands, and create capacity for long-term growth. Looking ahead, our priorities start with our product pipeline.\nOver the coming seasons, we will build on the market share gains that we have accelerated in recent years by scaling newness and innovation across our portfolio while carefully managing the health of our most iconic product franchises. This year, for example, we will build on the consumer momentum around running and modern comfort with performance and lifestyle franchises such as Infinity, Motiva, Invincible, Vomero 5, V2K, and the Air Max 1. We will refresh our basketball portfolio across NIKE and Jordan through innovation and style and grow the Kobe brand. We will ignite the next chapters of Pegasus, the Jordan Game Shoe, and Tech Fleece while continuing to grow powerhouses like Dunk and Metcon.\nAnd as we look toward the second half of this fiscal year and beyond, from the 10th anniversary of Air Max Day to the Paris Olympic Games, we will introduce our next wave of NIKE Air innovation. This will bring our most comprehensive evolution of the Air platform in years, one that we expect to catalyze both our brand and business. We will deliver pinnacle performance innovation to athletes while also scaling into new lifestyle franchises over the next several years. Ultimately, we are focused on scaling a deep, diverse, and distinct product portfolio, not just for one quarter or one season, but for years to come. Last, we are turning the corner and driving more profitable growth while also recovering on transitory cost headwinds.\nThis includes structural improvements in profitability in areas such as supply chain, with reduced digital split shipments and improved digital fulfillment costs enabled by investments in our regional service centers and a new transportation management system. In addition, NIKE brand ASPs are up across footwear and apparel across all geographies as we focus on the price value of our products. In Greater China, consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, healthy inventory, and sequential improvement in full-price sales will enable us to begin rebuilding towards higher profitability in the geography.\nFinally, we are focused on improving our marginal cost of growth with more modest increases in operating overhead this fiscal year, following two consecutive years of double-digit growth. We are doing this by unlocking speed and productivity as we transform our operating model to build a faster and more efficient NIKE. Now, let me turn to our NIKE, Inc Q1 results. In Q1, NIKE, Inc revenue grew 2% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew 6%, with NIKE Stores growing 12% and NIKE Digital up 2%. Wholesale grew 1%, reflecting our proactive decisions to restrain inventory supply and prioritize marketplace health, particularly in North America.\nGross margins declined 10 basis points to 44.2% on a reported basis, primarily driven by higher product costs and approximately 90 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, almost completely offset by strategic pricing actions. SG&A grew 5% on a reported basis, primarily due to increased demand creation expenses around World Cup and more moderate increases in operating overhead, benefiting from shifts in timing of technology investments to the remainder of the year.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared to 19.7% for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time benefit provided by the recent delay of the effective date of US foreign tax credit regulations. Diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Now, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue declined 1%, with wholesale down 8%, in line with our expectations following our restrained sell-in of marketplace supply. NIKE Direct was up 7% as NIKE Stores grew 11% and NIKE Digital grew 4%. EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis, primarily due to strong gross margin expansion.\nIn a competitive environment, our retail sales momentum grew throughout the quarter across NIKE Direct and wholesale. NIKE's back-to-school performance outpaced the broader industry, with strong sales from our top franchises and clear consumer excitement around newness.\nInfinity 4 drove strong full-price sales as we partnered with key running specialty accounts to host community activations. Our newest generation of Tech Fleece, amplified by strong investment from key marketplace partners, drove retail sales of double digits from last year across NIKE Direct and wholesale. Zenvy, Go, and Universa fueled double-digit growth in statement leggings, with Dunk and Free Metcon driving strong sell-through. The Jordan Brand continued its momentum with double-digit growth, led by Jordan Women's and Kids, as well as performance basketball. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 6%, with NIKE Direct also up 6%. NIKE Stores grew 17% and NIKE Digital declined 2%. EBIT declined 5% on a reported basis. Global football and fitness grew double digits, and women's outpaced our total growth in the geography this quarter.\nNew innovation and styles are resonating, with Phantom Luna driving strong sell-through, Metcon up double digits, and Motiva, our new walking shoe, off to a great start in creating a new performance category for NIKE. Pegasus, Invincible, and Vomero also delivered strong results in the quarter. In addition, statement leggings and shorts grew double digits with integrated brand and retail experiences. And as we deepen our focus on serving all segments of the running community, trail running footwear grew double digits with new product innovation and brand activations. In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 12%. NIKE Direct grew 10%, with NIKE Stores up 12% and NIKE Digital up 6%. EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis.\nThroughout the quarter, we saw incredible energy around the return of sport, with thousands of young runners joining in our back-to-school kids' race, players across cities taking part in our Jordan Flight basketball tournament, and historical highs in social engagement with our neighborhood accounts as consumers joined in hyper-local community experiences to celebrate our newest Kobe release. Retail sales across NIKE Direct and wholesale grew double digits with another quarter of strong sell-through. In a highly promotional marketplace, we outperformed industry trends with improvement in full-price sales.\nOur performance dimensions led growth with consumer excitement around G.T. Jump, Sabrina 1, and Invincible. In lifestyle, Vomero and other retro running styles are gaining momentum as we prepare to scale over the coming seasons. In APLA, Q1 revenue grew 3%. NIKE Direct was up 3%, with NIKE Stores up 10% and NIKE Digital declining 3%.\nEBIT declined 17% on a reported basis. Japan, Southeast Asia, India, and Mexico led our growth this quarter as we accelerate our momentum in international markets. In particular, store traffic in Japan is returning to pre-COVID levels. Sales through our new Myntra partnership in India are already exceeding plan. And Mexico's digital business delivered double-digit growth. Kids led our growth in the geography, up double digits with strong growth from Mercurial, Court Borough, and Fleece. We also saw market share gains in women's lifestyle with positive consumer response to Air Max Koko, V2K, and Gamma Force. In addition, Jordan continues its global growth, with Luca and Tatum fueling strong momentum in performance basketball and our new streetwear-footwear franchises resonating with consumers. Now, let me turn to our financial outlook.\nAs we look forward, we are confident in NIKE's new product innovation pipeline, brand strength, deep consumer connections, and the health and shape of our marketplace. Our Q1 results reaffirm our expectation for healthy, profitable growth this fiscal year. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow mid-single digits. At the same time, we are closely monitoring the operating environment, including foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand over the holiday season, and our second-half wholesale order book. As a reminder, this growth outlook includes approximately four points of headwinds from accelerated liquidation and higher wholesale sell-in during the prior year, as we sold roughly five seasons of supply within four financial quarters. Therefore, quarterly comparisons across marketplace channels and in the aggregate will be non-linear.\nWe continue to expect gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points on a reported basis, which includes 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We are cautiously planning for modest markdown improvements for the balance of the year given the promotional environment. We continue to expect SG&A to slightly outpace revenue growth, more specifically at the high end of mid-single digits. We continue to expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to be $225 to 275 million for the year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. Now, let me provide some additional color on our Q2. We expect Q2 reported revenue growth to be up slightly versus the prior year as we faced our most challenging comparisons from fiscal 2023.\nWe expect Q2 gross margins to expand approximately 100 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting benefits from strategic pricing, improved markdowns, and lower ocean freight rates, partially offset by higher product input costs. We continue to expect a negative impact from 50 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect Q2 SG&A to grow mid to high single digits. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. For NIKE, being on the offense means competing to win now and over the long term. We are confident in our strategy, our leadership position, and our ability to create even greater opportunity ahead. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And just a reminder, it is star one to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Bob Drbul, Guggenheim Partners.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first question really is, when you talk about the innovation pipeline for fall of 2024, can you just expand a little bit more in terms of the focus or the categories or really sort of what you see driving the business that you laid out at that most recent meeting? I have a follow-up.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nGreat, Bob. Well, as I said in my remarks, I cannot underestimate or understate really the impact of having our teams back together in person over the past 15 months. We absolutely see that kicking into gear with our product pipeline. This past quarter, you heard a couple of great examples of performance innovation around Phantom Luna, World Cup kits, the Infinity 4, which had one of our latest foam platforms, ReactX foam, highest energy return, and lowest carbon footprint.\nWell, that will sustain for many quarters and years. And over the next six to nine months into the Paris Olympics and the fall, there are several areas we're very excited about. Matt and I both talked about basketball. I don't think we've ever had a stronger portfolio of basketball shoes, whether it's the Sabrina 1, the LeBron 21, the Book 1. Jordan has Tatum, Luca, Zion, and a great game shoe coming. And then, of course, we have Kobe. So we see real growth, growing our basketball business and growing the game and market of basketball on and off the court. In running, we feel good about the Invincible 3, Infinity 4, Vomero 5, Peg 41. We feel very good about coming into Paris, as well as the Motiva, which we think have real legs.\nAnd then Air, Air is an area we're putting a huge amount of focus, and we're very excited about the innovations coming in Air, both performance and lifestyle. We have the 10th anniversary of Air Max Day in the spring as we move into the Paris Olympics. Air will be an important opportunity both in performance and in lifestyle. We see several opportunities to build real scalable innovation and growth.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Thanks. I just have a question. In North America, I guess in the current quarter, what's the bigger tailwind to the business right now? Is it the Travis Kelce jerseys or the Colorado football merchandise?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nOregon Duck jerseys. We love the NFL, and we continue to see a lot of momentum with Coach Prime, so.\n\nBob Drbul\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\n[inaudible] Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nUp next is Adrienne Yih, Barclays.\n\nAneesha Sherman\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nAdrienne Yih\n\nManaging Director and Consumer Discretionary Analyst, Barclays\n\nI guess my question is going to be on kind of the shaping of wholesale. Matt, if you can help us out with the, I guess, do we expect direct to be similar to the current quarter, and then the balance of that, the kind of up slightly for the current quarter guidance, to the balance of that come out of North America wholesale? And then my other question is on the China market.\nJohn, you talk about kind of strength and regaining market share, but at the same time, you talk a little bit about it continuing to be promotional. It's great to see that you're regaining full price. How much demand creation are you doing there? What does the promotional environment look like exiting the quarter? And any comment on exit trends? How should we think about kind of the trends over the next couple of quarters relative to your long-term algorithm? Thank you very much.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nAll right. Well, John, why don't I start on marketplace?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nSure.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSo Adrienne, when we look at our performance this quarter, I'd be remiss to not just reiterate what I said on the call, which is we saw very strong retail sales in the marketplace at mid-single digits. And in particular, we're very pleased with the performance across a range of our most important wholesale partners delivering growth, high single digit to low double digit. What I said last quarter in terms of the way that I was thinking about channel growth for this year, I said that NIKE Direct would lead our growth. And it did this quarter.\nAnd we do expect NIKE Direct to continue to lead our growth throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. The period that we're heading into in Q2 and Q3 is really the higher levels of sell-in that we did last year as we proactively focused on returning our marketplace to a more healthy level. As an example, you might recall our Q2 wholesale revenue last year was up 30% versus the prior year. And so as we face those comparisons, we do expect that NIKE Direct will be the best indication of the growth that we're driving in the marketplace while we comp those non-linear comparisons in the prior year. But we feel very good about the health and the shape of our overall marketplace, including in North America.\nWe're continuing to focus on driving growth across dimensions, across channels, up and down price points, and are very focused on building a product pipeline to enable us to do that over the coming years.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nAdrienne, in China, it's interesting. I've been to China twice now in the past four months. I think, Matt, you were there in August. We feel good about the market there and our position. Frankly, a couple of things stand out. One, sport is back in China. You can just feel it. That gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment, regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there. You saw we had strong double-digit growth in Q1 and Q2. We're helping to really drive momentum and sport there. I talked about Sportcello. I think Matt mentioned the back-to-school kids' race.\nGiannis did a tour there this summer that got huge response. Outdoor basketball. So we're doing what we do best, which is driving energy and excitement around sport, which then translates into our brand connection and our consumer connection being as strong as it's been in a long time. And as I said, it's perhaps the best example currently where we bring this great innovation with distinctive storytelling, with distinctive marketplace reaction. And so even in a promotional period, our full-price sell-through and our innovations are connecting well and doing well.\nAnd so we got our inventory in shape much sooner than the market in China. And so we're playing on the offense. We're playing on our front foot. And we feel good about the opportunities in China in the coming quarters and into the medium to long term.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah. I would just say that I think that the retail sales growth that we referenced in our two biggest wholesale partners is a great indication of the health of our inventory and our ability, especially in this Q1, to flow a complete assortment and season into our retail stores in the marketplace. And that's NIKE at its best. Our most premium elevated retail experiences, high levels of seasonal assortments where we can tell stories and really bring the breadth and the dimension to consumers.\nAnd we saw that momentum building throughout the quarter. So we feel really good about the decision we made to move fast. And even though the marketplace is promotional, we're on our front feet in terms of the way we're able to present our brand and our stories and our products to consumers in that market right now.\n\nOperator\n\nUp next, we'll take a question from Alex Straton, Morgan Stanley.\n\nAlex Straton\n\nEquity Research Managing Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nPerfect. Thanks so much. I just wanted to focus on kind of the running innovation that you guys highlighted a number of times on the call across areas. I think you had said you'd launched some running in the last few years, but perhaps it didn't connect as much as you wanted or you wanted to scale it more effectively. So could you just touch on maybe what changed in NIKE's approach in the last few years and then what you plan to do differently to kind of reignite that? Thanks a lot.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Alex, as I said, we're at our best when we align innovative product with distinctive storytelling through a differentiated marketplace. And in running, we have three different categories in running.\nIn racing, we take our performance innovation, which sets the bar in the industry with the Alphafly, the Vaporfly, and NEXT%. We have compelling breakthrough storytelling, whether it's breaking two or we reach that elite runner, and we reach them through a differentiated marketplace. So we're doing well there. In trail running, which is the fastest-growing segment, the Pegasus Trail is doing very well. We feel really good about our innovation pipeline, and we're increasingly leaning into the trail running community and to marketplace connection with that trail runner.\nThen the area that we've talked about, road running, or what we call road running or everyday running, we're very clear. We're prioritizing the everyday runner who wants newness and consistency. We're focusing, therefore, on some key models and ensuring that we get in the path of runners.\nSo in terms of innovation, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've had some very good innovations the last couple of years. The Invincible took some of the performance benefits from our road racing shoes, particularly ZoomX, and brought them into an everyday running shoe along with some great cushioning. So good innovation. Similarly, the Infinity 4 brought the ReactX foam platform, which has got some real characteristics of low carbon footprint and better high energy. But we're not yet combining those innovations with getting in the path of the everyday runner with a really strong ground game. And that starts with distribution, making sure we're breaking through everywhere, everyday runner shops. So whether that's our own direct channels, wholesale channels, running specialty doors, they play a really important role.\nYou may have noted we launched the React 4 in partnership with running specialty stores. So that's a step in the right direction, and we're really working to break through in these channels. Then we're working hard to better connect with runners in their community where they are, whether it's driving connections through NIKE Run Club and our mobile apps, being present in marathons, races, and just being where runners are. So in this case, we know what we need to do. We are focused on it, and we are moving with urgency to deliver.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nThere's also a meaningful opportunity as running influences lifestyle and sneakers. As we've had tremendous success from a classics perspective over the last couple of years, we have a rich heritage of products in our pipeline related to running for decades.\nAnd so one of the things that we're also doing is accelerating our opportunity in running lifestyle with some of our best franchises and capturing on that trend, and also the consumer shift to modern comfort. And we feel like that one-two punch, as John mentioned, innovation, performance, and lifestyle is really going to position us well to take a greater attack at the running marketplace holistically.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next up is Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks. So John, maybe could you speak to underlying demand trends as the Q1 progresses or any early fall trends that you're seeing in both North America and China? And then multi-year, I'm curious what you see as the next leg of the consumer direct acceleration strategy or just any initiatives that you see to drive further market share gains as we look forward.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nActually, Matt, why don't you take the first part of that?\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nOkay.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nStaying close in on demand, and I'll take the second.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSure. Well, Matt, as I referenced, we saw mid-single-digit retail sales growth this quarter. This quarter, we have a unique dynamic because we saw a difference in what we're reporting or what we're communicating from a retail sales perspective versus where NIKE's reported revenue is. That's because of the restriction of sell-in that we put into place the last couple of quarters of last year. We do expect that to continue as we go into the Q2. So we are planning for retail sales growth to be in line with what we delivered this quarter from a mid-single-digit perspective.\nWhen we look at the big consumer moments this quarter, 618 seems like so long ago at this point in time, but 618 in Greater China, we were the number one sports brand on Tmall and saw impressive double-digit growth over that time horizon. Within back-to-school, we outperformed the industry. When you look at our performance over the quarter, we saw momentum building throughout the quarter heading into back-to-school. So we were encouraged by what we were seeing from a consumer perspective.\nI mentioned that we saw high single-digit to low double-digit growth in our most important partners and strong growth in NIKE Direct this quarter, given what we're anniversarying in the prior year. We continue to see consumer demand for our brands and for our products to be very, very strong. Sport is growing, and the consumer is proving to be resilient.\nThere are some dynamics in terms of shifting that's happening from channels. We saw it in our partners a couple of years ago. And this quarter, we are seeing consumers spending more time in brick-and-mortar locations, but 90% of their shopping journeys are starting with digital. And so we continue to believe that our digital and physical strategy of serving consumers is the right strategy to serve demand as we look forward.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nAnd Matt, if we just extend out, as you asked, a little bit longer term, we step back. We still see the same fundamentals, which are some structural tailwinds in our industry, right? The definition of sport is expanding.\nWith the movement toward health, wellness, and fitness and new big areas of movement like dance, one of my favorites, we've had a lot of interaction with breakdancing in the last three months here on campus, seeing some of the elite breakdancers who will compete in the Paris Olympics come in. But dance throughout Asia and other places is a huge market. So we just see an expanding definition of sport where movement has become sport and we're at the center of that. The movement toward athleisure, right? There doesn't need to be a trade-off between what you wear on the pitch and at work, between comfort, performance, and style. Athleisure combines all of those, and we're very well positioned to continue to drive that trend.\nAnd then the digital connection of consumers means that sport, whether they're watching it or commerce, is always one click away. And our leading portfolio of digital assets gives us a huge advantage there. So those are some structural tailwinds. And then we just do, we're in a great industry with those tailwinds. We've got to do what we do so well. Innovation plus great storytelling plus great marketplace, we believe will drive real strong growth. And we see great growth in women's. Jordan, we think, has extraordinary growth. Running, we think, we have great growth. Continuing to expand the market in basketball, global football, and as Matt mentioned, this driving performance and then into lifestyle is something that makes our industry, our business, and our future quite attractive.\n\nOperator\n\nJay Sole from UBS has the next question.\n\nJay Sole\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nMatt, you talked about you're seeing underlying structural gains in profitability and margins. Can you just talk about how you're feeling about the long-term opportunity for margin in the context of the long-term guidance you gave a couple of years ago for NIKE's ability to get to a high teens EBIT margin over time? Thank you.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSure, Jay. Well, we remain confident in our ability to drive our long-term financial goals. And we still believe those long-term goals of profitability are achievable. But the timing is difficult to predict. But the reason why I emphasized what I emphasized this quarter is that I really feel strongly that fiscal year 2024 is a turning point for us and a proof point for NIKE to drive more profitable growth.\nThe structural things that I referenced, the structural drivers, I should say, that I referenced, it starts with creating value for the consumer in our products. We continue to see benefits in our gross margin through strategic pricing and managing the price value of our products with ASPs across the NIKE brand across all geos up this quarter. One of the opportunities we continue to see, and we saw some benefit of it this quarter, is lowering our supply chain costs. We've increased the size of our supply chain the last few years to be able to address the growth that we've seen in our business, both overall and in digital. Now our teams are very focused on driving greater efficiency in the way that we serve consumer demand across channels.\nI mentioned a couple of examples like reducing digital split shipments so that a consumer doesn't get two boxes for the same order, the way that we're lowering our outbound fulfillment costs through the investment in regional service centers that are closer to where consumer demand is. And so those are just a couple of examples that we continue to see. And then, of course, we do expect that while the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn't as clear, we do believe we're going to be a more direct and a more digital company and a more profitable company. And there's a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well. So we continue to believe these goals are achievable.\nBased on our gross margin plans for this year, our performance in the Q1, we believe we're turning the corner on starting to climb to greater profitability as a company and as a brand.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Piral Dadhania, RBC.\n\nPiral Dadhania\n\nEquity Analyst, RBC\n\nHi, evening. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been answered, so maybe I could just ask a follow-up, a clarification. Matt, I think you said that in Q1, your partners registered high single digit to low double digit sales growth in the period. I just wanted to understand whether that was their sell-out number or whether that was your sell-in number. Any clarification there would be very helpful.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSure. That was a sell-out number. That was a sales-to-consumer number.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jonathan Komp, Baird.\n\nJonathan Komp\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hi. Good afternoon.\nMatt, if I could ask a follow-up just as you think about the Q2, given some of the unusual comparisons, would you be willing to share any shaping guidance across some of the segments? And then bigger picture, if you could just comment on sort of the shape of the recovery of the sales and the profitability that you're seeing in China, and any thoughts as we look to the balance of the year. Thank you.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nSure. Well, as it relates to the Q2, what I said was that we expect our growth to be up slightly versus the prior year. I did answer Matt's question just, and I'll connect the two together, but we are expecting retail sales, so sell-out to the consumer, to be in line with the mid-single digit that we delivered this quarter across the full marketplace.\nThe Q2 is really the last season that we've managed the sell-in to a more restricted level so that we could ensure that the marketplace was set right as we look towards the remainder of this year. As far as the comparisons go, Q2, and I think I referenced the wholesale number earlier, but we're comping about 27% currency-neutral growth in Q2. But what we're much more focused on is the quality and the health of the growth that we're delivering in the quarter.\nAs you see our gross margins expanding in the Q2 on an operational basis, excluding the impact of FX, we're up 150 basis points and are really encouraged as we think about what we delivered in the Q1, the improvements we're guiding to, and believe we can deliver in the Q2, and then the way that will accelerate through the balance of the year. As we get into the second half of this year and we think about our gross margins, we're going to start to see even more impact from ocean freight because those are rolling in midway through this quarter. We're expecting to see lower product costs in the second half, and our FX headwinds are going to abate a little bit as we get into the back half of this year.\nAnd so some of those elements will drive increasing margin expansion as we carry through the balance of the year. I think the last part of your question was on China and profitability. What I would just say is that we know from a long history of managing this business that when you have a healthy marketplace and you're driving full-price sales and you are driving productivity in your retail formats, you've created the environment that's ripe to drive profitability improvement.\nAnd as we look at the momentum that we're seeing in Greater China, another quarter of double-digit growth, we're increasingly confident that we're going to begin to rebuild towards higher profitability in that marketplace. That's on the product and marketplace side. And then also, I referenced an example where we're lowering our supply chain costs in Greater China. And so we feel quite good with that as well.\nOur reported numbers in China are going to be challenging for the next couple of quarters because of foreign exchange headwinds. And so we'll continue to try to highlight the opportunities and what we're driving from a profitability perspective. But that's one of the reasons why our EBIT was down this quarter in Greater China, as foreign exchange headwinds, as a result of the strength of the US dollar, definitely create a bit of pressure in the short term. But we're focused on what we can control and continuing to drive a healthy, profitable business in that market and believe the fundamentals for long-term growth and profitability are strong for NIKE.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Aneesha Sherman, Bernstein.\n\nAneesha Sherman\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein",
    "content2": "Thank you.\nSo as a result of your direct-to-consumer strategy, you've shifted, I guess, more than 20 points of sales mix from wholesale to NIKE Digital over the last seven or so years. You're seeing shoppers returning to stores this year. You did make some adjustments to adding physical distribution points. Do you feel like you are in enough physical retail doors today to appeal to a rebalancing of shopping habits? And then a quick follow-up on overheads. You talked about lowering some of the specific costs of direct, and split shipments and fulfillment costs. Can you give more color on the investment cycle or on the investment cycle to support the direct business as well as centralized investments like ERP and kind of where you are this fiscal year and next fiscal year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nMatt, why don't I take the first part, maybe take the second.\nSo Aneesha, again, our entire marketplace strategy is driven by giving consumers what they want, when they want it, how they want it. That starts with our digital properties, our own direct retail, which Matt will talk about in the second part of the answer. But wholesale plays a really important role for us to get the breadth and depth of access to consumers and consumers' access to our products.\nAnd so, as you know, we've really sharpened our wholesale focus over the last few years to focus on fewer multi-brand partners where we're investing in elevated retail experiences and connected digital membership at scale. And so that's DSG, JD, Zalando, our partners in China. We've got a great launch with ProDirect. Hibbett will come online with connected membership in October. And so we think there's a lot of growth opportunity with those strategic wholesale partners.\nWe're also putting increased attention on our neighborhood partners who are authenticators. They help authenticate both sport and lifestyle, and drive energy and local connections. And then, as we said, where we see gaps, whether it's in a price point or a gap in a product segment, we'll selectively add wholesale partners in different geographies and in different segments. And this will be a dynamic thing. I mean, we're led by the consumer.\nWe have the blessing of the strongest direct connections in the industry. And with direct connected membership, we can be indifferent about which channel. And Matt, you're going to talk a little about, I guess, the margins of our direct, but the NIKE Rise, our direct monobrand doors, NIKE Rise, and our Well Collective doors are doing quite well. And we feel like we're getting our concept right.\nNow that we have seasonal rate assortments coming into them, we feel very good about our ability to augment where there are gaps as well with our own monobrand doors. Also, House of Flight on Jordan. So we feel good about being on the front foot with our marketplace. I think the most wide and connected marketplace offense in the industry.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nCFO, NIKE\n\nYeah. And I think I would just add maybe one point, and then I'll hit the last part. When I think about the momentum that we've seen over the last several years from a digital perspective, you're right. We have shifted our channel mix. And that's been a consumer-led and a consumer-driven shift based on the consumer's desire to want to connect with NIKE both through our digital apps and through our stores. What we saw this quarter wasn't unexpected for us.\nAnd when we look underneath the momentum that we saw in our NIKE mobile app, we saw strong growth, high single-digit growth, in traffic. We saw member activity continue to increase both in terms of engagement and buying behavior, and a higher basket size, a higher AOV. And so we continue to be focused on creating the best personalized experience for our members from a digital perspective.\nAnd we believe that that's going to continue to fuel growth in our digital business over the long term. I do think this year the comparisons are going to not be linear as we go quarter to quarter, channel to channel, given what transpired last year. But what we're seeing from a consumer perspective doesn't shift our dimensionality in terms of needing to do something different in order to serve consumer demand.\nAs John said, we've got the biggest, deepest breadth of distribution of anyone and have the right partners to be able to serve the marketplace. As it relates to overhead, the numbers that I referenced actually impact our gross margins, our lower digital fulfillment costs that sit in our gross margins. It's something that we've been focused on for some time.\nWe started investing a couple of years ago in regional service centers in North America, in Europe, and in pickup points closer to the consumer in Europe, all with the intention of building a supply chain that enables us to serve demand closer to consumers. It's more sustainable because we don't have to put product on airplanes, and leveraging our store footprint through O2O capabilities. So we've been investing for a few years in developing and scaling those capabilities to be able to serve consumer demand.\nAs I look forward from here, our investments will be aligned with the way that we grow the business. In other words, we've invested to, and now we're learning to operationalize and take advantage of these capabilities. We are implementing our ERP in North America. We went live with our retail business in the Q1, and everything has gone well. We're focused on bringing the second part of our North America business, the wholesale side of our North America business, online in our new ERP later this year. That is our largest investment in transformation of our supply chain and enabling us to operate like a retailer. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity that it presents for us to really modernize the way we work and to serve consumers at speed across the marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nEveryone, that does conclude our question and answer session. It also concludes our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Please refer to Nike's earnings press release or Nike's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable gap measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. fiscal 2023 was a milestone year for Nike as we set new records while delivering on our operational and financial goals. It's clear that our strategy is working and that Nike's unique advantages continue to drive competitive separation. Looking at our results, we exceeded $50 billion in revenue with growth of 16% on the year. This growth is broad-based across our consumer construct of men's, women's, and kids, across performance and lifestyle, and across all geographies. North America, EMEA, and APLA all saw full-year double-digit growth, and Greater China returned to double-digit growth in Q4. We're also driving strength through our industry-leading brand portfolio with Nike, Jordan, and Converse, all of which achieved strong growth in Fiscal 2023. In particular, I want to highlight Jordan Brand's record year.\nJordan grew mid-30s with impressive growth across men's, women's, and kids, footwear and apparel, and in both North America and international. In fact, Jordan is well on its way to becoming the second-largest footwear brand in North America. And last but not least, we returned to healthy inventory ahead of our competition. Our inventory is flat year-over-year in value and down in units versus 12 months ago. The actions we've taken position us for more profitable growth moving forward. Across our business, we continue to build a marketplace that addresses how consumers want to be served, giving them what they want, when they want it, and how they want it. NIKE creates distinction across the marketplace by segmenting consumer experiences to drive deep, direct connections with consumers and grow the marketplace.\nToday, in the industry, with digital and physical growth converging, we've accelerated investment to create a truly distinctive digital experience through our own platforms. Every year, we serve traffic in the billions, which delivers strong digital growth as both conversion rate and average order value continue to improve. This success helped increase the digital share of our business to 26% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 10% in fiscal 2019. For the year, we had strong digital growth of 24%, and we expect Digital to continue to lead our growth. Now, this is all powered by our membership offense. We know our consumers better and are better able to serve them, with data-driven insights fueling our end-to-end value chain, including product creation, marketing, and merchandising.\nThis is translating into sustainable and profitable growth for Nike, and we believe this growth will only accelerate as we add new capabilities built to serve consumers at scale. In fiscal 2023, we expanded our membership base, but more importantly, we elevated and deepened these consumer relationships. Our members now engage with us more frequently, buy more, and are more loyal to our brands. Once members join our ecosystem, they are increasing their lifelong sport journeys with us. Now, of course, Nike members also shop across marketplace channels. And so, as we grow, we're always actively managing our marketplace to serve consumers with expanded choice, access, and convenience. We think about our multi-brand partners in three complementary groups that each serve distinct needs. First, as you know, over the past five years, we've created greater focus and differentiation, working with fewer large multi-brand partners.\nThese partners have the scale to invest in retail experiences and connected digital membership to drive long-term growth. Second, we've also sharpened our commitment to neighborhood authenticators in both sport and lifestyle to drive energy and validate our brand. This investment in community ensures brand access as well as deep local consumer connection. And third, we partner with accounts that help us provide access to consumers across different segments and price points. And at the same time, we continue to invest in Nike store concepts that create new distribution and serve growth opportunities not currently being addressed by our wholesale partners. The recent unveiling of our Nike Well Collective, which responds to deep insight from our female consumers, rebrands Nike Live and creates an elevated approach to retail. Nike Well Collective brings new energy and sharpens our focus on serving the opportunity we see with women.\nSo this is how our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy drives the future of the marketplace: a seamless, member-led experience that addresses the opportunities as we see them across the consumer landscape. Last month, I was in Shanghai and Beijing, and I was blown away by how the entire marketplace experience comes to life there. Our Greater China team is building a connected and seamless journey across digital and physical, commerce and social, owned, and partner doors. And I will tell you, the merchandising is best in class. You can just feel the energy of our brand and our product. And with our record-breaking performance during this year's 618 shopping holiday, in which we were the number one sports brand on Tmall, I'm even more confident in our playbook and strategy in China. Today, we're excited and confident with the opportunity we see in front of us.\nLooking to fiscal 2024 and beyond, we will continue to expand our competitive separation. To that end, this quarter, we made some shifts within our senior leadership team that will further deepen our growth and accelerate our marketplace advantage, elevating Heidi O'Neill and Craig Williams to become Nike brand's two presidents. Heidi and Craig are both incredible leaders with long track records of driving growth and results. And their new roles are designed to drive an even greater focus on innovation and integration for our business. These changes will streamline our efforts across product, brand storytelling, and marketplace. I will tell you, I'm thrilled, and I can also tell you that their teams are thrilled as well for the kind of growth we'll be able to achieve under this new simplified structure.\nFor the remainder of my remarks today, I want to walk you through something that defines everything we do, and that's sport. Sport is who we are. It will always be our differentiator. No brand can grow the world of sport like Nike. No brand connects people to sport by putting all of the pieces together like we can. We stay in the lead because we combine innovation, brand, and the culture of sport and do it all at global scale. This is the power of our strategy. We're able to both unleash athlete potential and create the lifestyle of sport around the globe. Where other brands strive to grow their slice of the pie, we're able to grow the pie itself. Let me walk through three areas where we have expanded the world of sport and where we see even greater opportunity ahead. First, let's discuss global football.\nIn fiscal 2023, global football grew 25%, nearly doubling overall Nike growth, with women's and kids' businesses growing even faster. Key boot franchises like Mercurial and Phantom saw high full-price realization as we continue to win share on pitch. We invest in the grassroots of the game while also partnering with the sport's greatest. Erling Haaland joined our roster this quarter as his record pace of goal-scoring cements his stamp on the future of the game. We can't wait for this summer's World Cup. Nike is proud to partner with more federations in the tournament than any other brand, and we've matched that energy with our most comprehensive women's football collection ever. For example, we'll launch the most innovative women's-led football boot in our history.\nAfter more than two years of testing and designing, the new Phantom Luna boot features a proprietary cleat pattern that provides peak traction and stability for female players. In addition, our World Cup kits will debut significant fit and material innovations mapped to a woman's specific movements. And last but not least, we've created our largest-ever football-inspired sportswear collection for both fans and athletes when they're off pitch. We're just weeks out from the tournament, and we're focused and aligned to drive energy like no one else as we connect the next generation of fans to the world's most popular sport. Next, let's discuss basketball, where we continue to see significant market leadership. Today, Nike defines basketball. As we look to the landscape, we see only expanding competitive separation ahead. Our influence in basketball is elevated by the strength of our portfolio of brands: Nike, Jordan, and Converse.\nIn fact, our roster, which is already the game's greatest, set a new standard this season. For the first time ever, all three of our brands were represented in the All-NBA First Team, with Luka and Jayson from Jordan, Giannis from Nike, and rising star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander from Converse. This is an unprecedented accomplishment. And speaking of the game's greatest, fiscal 2023 marked 20 years of LeBron's signature shoe. We're excited by the continued potential of the LeBron business as his brand reaches a new dimension by bringing back earlier styles onto the court, igniting new energy for these retro models with consumers. And in addition, the Sabrina 1 is resonating strongly since launch, helping double our WNBA business versus what it was two short years ago.\nIt's going to be an exciting summer as we set the stage to relaunch the Kobe brand in advance of Kobe Day on 24 August. As you know, it's already been a great few months for basketball. We had a thrilling NBA season, which concluded with Nikola Joki? taking the Denver Nuggets to their first-ever title. The WNBA season kicked off with Brittney Griner making her return to the court. Earlier this week, A'ja Wilson was named an All-Star Team Captain. In China, ten-time Chinese Basketball Association All-Star point guard Guo Ailun won his third CBA championship. Earlier this week, in fact, last week in the NBA Draft, Victor Wembanyama was selected number one overall by the San Antonio Spurs. We're thrilled to have Victor in the Nike family, and we're excited for what the future holds in basketball.\nNow, I want to take a minute to go a little bit deeper into the Jordan Brand. Jordan's greatest advantage is its authenticity and connection to sport, which drives a special bond with generation upon generation. This brand has built a cultural identity that transcends the game, connecting people with deep emotion and a sense of self-belief. It's this authenticity that fuels Jordan's leadership in streetwear. Jordan continues to dictate the conversation by being a premium brand that drives sportswear culture. You've seen this come to life through Jordan's partners across pop culture, from product launches like the women's Teyana Taylor AJ1 high to the brand's meaningful collaboration with the movie Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Today, Jordan is extending its core strengths in men's. In Q4, Jordan launched the Tatum 1, which completes Jordan's signature offense along with Luka, Zion, and the game shoe.\nWith this foundation in place, Jordan has plans to now scale these four franchises even further. And at the same time, Jordan's building real energy around our biggest growth opportunities. In fiscal 2023, Jordan had over-indexing growth in both women's and kids alongside increasing strength in apparel. And today, Jordan's growth in performance footwear is now outpacing retro footwear. But no discussion of Jordan's opportunity would be complete with also looking at its international business. In most of our geos, Jordan's penetration is about 10 points lower than it is in North America. And this is the growth opportunity we plan to capture moving ahead. Simply put, we continue to see a tremendous amount of potential for the Jordan brand and its differentiated ability to drive culture, connection, and growth like nothing else. Finally, let me comment on our running business.\nRunning's been a competitive battlefield lately, with more and more brands joining the market. Today, we're more aligned and resourced to compete and win. We saw roughly 10% growth for our running footwear business in fiscal 2023, and we're just getting started. Now, as you know, NIKE's advantage in innovation is shown as we continue to set the pace in racing and trail running categories, led by the new Vaporfly 3 and Pegasus Trail 4, respectively. Following a recent reset, we're prioritizing the needs of everyday runners through newness and consistency in the key styles they love most. For example, last quarter, we launched the Invincible 3, which continues to perform well. Since its Q3 launch, Invincible has already doubled its retail sales versus last year. Next quarter, we're debuting the InfinityRN 4, another major update to a popular franchise.\nIn fact, I'm wearing a pair right now, and I have to say they feel great. The InfinityRN 4's ReactX is our newest foam, a breakthrough innovation that's more sustainable and offers runners a smooth and responsive ride following years of women's-led testing. This is just the start as we reinvigorate our running footwear line, with more to be unveiled as we build momentum heading into the Olympics in Paris next summer. In addition to innovating for runners, we're also driving the lifestyle of running as only NIKE can. The Vomero 5, which in fiscal 2023 kicked off our strategic relaunch into the intersection of running and streetwear, has already become a staple of modern sneaker culture. The Vomero 5 is coming into the summer with a lot of momentum as we substantially increased its volume all year.\nJust last month, we launched the Motiva, a walking shoe with a distinctive design at an attractive price point and one that's representative of the aggressive approach we're taking to opportunities we see in the market. In just two months post-launch, Motiva has had strong sell-through, particularly for women, already becoming a top five performance footwear style globally on Nike Digital. Ultimately, when we look at the full running business, while we know there's a lot of work ahead, we remain confident in our go-forward strategy and firm in our belief that we're all set to compete with strength. In the end, our CDA strategy is working. Our brands have strong energy. Our innovation pipeline is as relentless as ever, and we're executing against what matters most to consumers.\nAs we look to fiscal 2024, Nike will occupy the same leadership position that we earned year after year as we usher our industry into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nThanks, John. Hello to everyone on the call. Nike is a growth company, and fiscal 2023 demonstrated our ability to deliver strong growth in the midst of rapidly changing market conditions. Throughout the year, we drove competitive separation by doing what Nike does best: serve athletes with product innovation and rich storytelling, amplify our brand voice through key sport and consumer moments, deepen consumer connections across our portfolio, and actively manage the marketplace to drive sustainable, profitable growth. For the full year, we delivered mid-teens revenue growth with accelerating momentum in our performance business and sustained strength in lifestyle.\nWe added $7 billion of revenue in total on a currency-neutral basis, which included adding $3 billion to North America, our largest, most mature market. In addition, our top franchises drove strong full-price sales with mid-single-digit price increases, and we grew units and ASP across both product engines. In Q4, we saw another quarter of strong consumer demand, with traffic growing online and in our stores, and total retail sales across the marketplace up double digits versus the prior year. Beyond driving strong top-line growth, we finished the year with a significantly improved marketplace position, with total marketplace inventory units, including NIKE and our wholesale partners, down year over year.\nWe feel very good about the results driven by our decisive actions over this past year, as well as the sales momentum that we continue to see from Nike Direct and our top strategic partners, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, JD Sports, Sports Direct, and our city specialty partners. To go a little deeper on inventory, Nike, Inc. inventory dollars are flat versus the prior year, with units down double digits across both footwear and apparel. Apparel units are down more than 20% versus the prior year. Our mix of in-transit inventory has normalized, and days in inventory show improvement versus the prior quarter and the prior year. Closeout mix is in line with pre-pandemic levels, with improvements in the average age of our closeout inventory versus the prior year.\nFrom a geography perspective, both North America and Greater China have inventory dollars down high single digits versus the prior year, with units being down double digits. All told, we are entering fiscal 2024 on our front foot, ready to navigate any uncertainty that may be ahead of us and ready to compete from a position of strength. Now, as we move forward, we are building on a strong foundation for future growth. Our confidence is grounded in the power of Nike's portfolio, deeply connected to the consumer, centered in sport and youth culture, fueling authenticity and distinction, unrivaled in breadth and depth. Our strength begins with our scale, from our investment in innovation to our sports marketing portfolio, our digital platforms and membership, and our global reach.\nWe create value for consumers around the world, leveraging Nike's scale and competitive advantages to drive sustainable growth and strong returns to shareholders over the long term. Today, Nike's opportunity to grow is as large as it's ever been. Consumer interest around the world in sport, health, and wellness has never been greater. What excites us most is the potential still ahead. Let me share just a few examples. First, one of Nike's greatest competitive advantages is our relentless pace of innovation. We innovate to make athletes better, to serve more athletes, and to make the world better for athletes everywhere. Right now, in our LeBron James Innovation Center, we are creating new concepts, new platforms, and new capabilities to fuel Nike's next 50 years of innovation and growth. We will continue to increase investment in innovation to create value for athletes.\nThis gives me confidence we can drive long-term growth for Nike. We have some great opportunities over this next fiscal year to showcase our latest innovations on the global sports stage. Second, we're accelerating direct consumer relationships across our digital platforms. By better knowing and serving the consumers who love our brands, we are also unlocking strategic and financial benefits for Nike. For example, we have partnered with Adobe to enable one-to-one member personalization, driving gains in member retention, click-through rates, and conversion, resulting in higher demand per member and returns on digital ad spend. We're only beginning to operationalize these new capabilities and consumer experiences on our digital platforms, and we see even greater opportunity to come. Third, we see meaningful growth potential in our international markets.\nThis includes Korea, one of our most digitally connected markets, Central and South America, a region with a deep love of sport, Southeast Asia and India, with one of the world's largest youth populations, and, of course, China, where young consumers are seeking our top product innovation, and Gen Z is coming of age as the country's most active generation ever. Last, we can now see around the corner on the transitory cost headwinds that pressured profitability in fiscal 2022 and 2023. When combined with our structural opportunities to improve profitability as we grow, we are confident that we will deliver above-average margin improvement in fiscal 2024, with many of the drivers continuing into fiscal 2025. Now, let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. Q4 results. In Q4, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 8% on a currency-neutral basis.\nNike Direct grew 18%, with 14% growth in Nike Digital and 24% growth in Nike Stores. Wholesale grew 2%, moderating as planned as we tightened supply to normalize marketplace inventory levels. Gross margins declined 140 basis points to 43.6% on a reported basis, primarily due to higher product input costs and elevated freight and logistics expenses, higher markdowns, and 100 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by strategic pricing actions and lapping higher inventory obsolescence reserves in Greater China in the prior period. SG&A grew 8% on a reported basis, primarily due to wage-related expenses, variable Nike Direct costs, and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.66. Now, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 5%.\nNike Direct was up 15%, and Nike Digital grew 17%. Wholesale declined 3% following reduced spring and summer sell-in to proactively manage marketplace inventory. EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. For another consecutive quarter, strong consumer demand drove total retail sales up double digits across the marketplace, enabling us to drive a quicker return to healthy marketplace inventory levels. Member engagement grew on all digital platforms, and buying frequency was at an all-time high. Nike store traffic and revenue grew double digits, surpassing industry trends. We saw strong brand momentum across our portfolio. Performance dimensions delivered strong growth, with LeBron and Giannis at double digits. Free Metcon extended its lead as our top women's performance franchise. The Jordan Brand delivered another dominant quarter with women's leading growth, Luka and Tatum highlighting momentum in performance and iconic franchises inspiring the next generation.\nIn fact, this quarter's AJ1 Spider-Verse launch drove our largest ever kids' sneaker drop on the sneakers app. With a robust product pipeline, a healthy mix of inventory, and a normalizing supply chain, we are confident in Nike's ability to set the pace in North America as we look ahead. In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 7%. Nike Direct was up 28%, and Nike Digital grew 24%. EBIT declined 13% on a reported basis. EMEA's Q4 results demonstrated the strength of our complete offense as Nike increased market share in performance and lifestyle. Digital continues to power growth with traffic up double digits, and conversion rates expanding. Brick-and-mortar traffic in key countries also remains strong. Nike's authenticity in sport and culture continues to create separation. Vaporfly and Alphafly topped shoe counts at the Paris and London marathons, while Pegasus and Invincible drove strong sell-through.\nWe channeled the energy of Air Max Day into positive momentum for Air Max Pulse and Air Max One, and we closed out our biggest football year ever up double digits with strong full-price sales led by Mercurial and Phantom and balanced growth across men's, women's, and kids. In Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 25%. Nike Direct grew 19%, with Nike Digital declining 12% as consumer buying continues to over-index in brick-and-mortar versus the prior year. EBIT grew 70% on a reported basis. This quarter left no doubt. Sport is back. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and NIKE's brand momentum is growing. We celebrated the return of sport with full marketing activations around the Chinese High School Basketball League, Air Max Day, and Super Brand Day, and we extended that energy into our strongest product sell-through in eight seasons with full-price momentum accelerated by our healthy inventory position.\nRunning grew double digits, fueled by newness and hyper-local storytelling, including strong Express Lane executions for Invincible 3 and community activations around Pegasus 40. Basketball grew double digits led by the GT Cut, and we saw exceptional sell-through for our GT Jump Players Edition inspired by longtime Nike athlete Etienne Lyon. Earlier this month, our 618 results surpassed last year's record-breaking performance with sales up double digits. Next week, we will build on that momentum as we kick off Nike's first athlete tour in China since the pandemic by welcoming Giannis to Beijing. As we look forward, we are confident in the strength of our consumer connections and confident in Nike's ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in China. In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 6%, including approximately 6 percentage points of a headwind due to the impact of our shift to a distributor model in Central and South America.\nNike Direct was up 9%, with Nike Digital growing 9%. EBIT declined 16% on a reported basis. This quarter highlighted our balanced growth in the region. Jordan Brand continued its international expansion with strong double-digit growth as our new world of flight doors in Tokyo and Seoul create local brand energy. We also saw strong growth in women's lifestyle and men's performance with positive momentum from Cortez and Vomero 5 and sustained strength from Pegasus and Invincible 3. In global football, we drove double-digit growth across men's, women's, and kids, with excitement building ahead of this summer's Women's World Cup. We finished the year in APLA with new milestones and new opportunities in the region. In Southeast Asia and India, we grew our business by over 40% this year, reinforcing the potential that we see in the market.\nIn Korea, our Nike app launch drove 2.5 million downloads and $100 million in incremental demand within its Q1, showing how elevated local digital experiences can accelerate consumer demand. Across the region, we continue investing to grow, from launching Argentina.com and Peru.com to introducing Nike's first direct digital footprint in India. Now, let me turn to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. We enter the new year with clear advantages: strong consumer momentum, a robust product innovation pipeline, healthy inventory, and a normalized flow of supply. That said, we are closely monitoring the macro environment, consumer behavior, and retail trends. Our priority for fiscal 2024 is to drive healthy full-price growth while unlocking speed, agility, and efficiency in our operating model. We are focused on what we can control as we position Nike to compete at its best.\nWe are taking a balanced approach to planning our business, building on our proactive decisions more than six months ago to tighten buys. We expect this to translate into an improved marginal cost of growth, expanding profitability, and higher returns on invested capital. We have also taken into account several non-count factors from the prior year that will impact overall rates of growth as well as quarterly comparisons. For the full year, we expect fiscal 2024 reported revenue to grow mid-single digits, led by Nike Direct. This includes approximately four points of headwinds from the prior year, from wholesale shipment timing and accelerated liquidation activities. In addition, based on current spot rates, we do not expect any material translation impact on revenue in fiscal 2024.\nWe expect gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points on a reported basis, which translates to approximately 200 basis points of operational gross margin expansion, excluding 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. This reflects the beginning of recovery from transitory headwinds, including more favorable ocean freight rates starting halfway through the Q2 and a modest improvement in markdowns versus the prior year. We also expect continued structural gains from our focus on price value, including low single-digit price increases in fiscal 2024, plus ongoing benefits from our shift to a more direct business. We expect this to be partially offset by higher product costs, with inflation causing higher labor and fulfillment expenses in parts of our supply chain.\nWe expect SG&A to grow slightly above revenue as we increase investment in demand creation to support key global sports moments, and product launches, and invest in capabilities to transform Nike's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness. We will continue to manage SG&A to remain below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of revenue. Our other income and expense, including net interest income, is expected to be $225 to 275 million of income for the year, and we expect our effective tax rate to be similar to fiscal 2023. Now, let me provide a few important insights into our Q1. We expect Q1 revenue growth to be flat to up low single digits, reflecting our decision to tighten first-half buys and restrain marketplace inventory.\nWe expect another quarter of sequential improvement in gross margin, down 50 to 75 basis points on a reported basis, which translates to 25 to 50 basis points of operational gross margin expansion, excluding the negative impact of 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect SG&A to grow low double digits on a reported basis, driven by increased demand creation investments around the Women's World Cup and transformational investments to drive efficiency, including the activation of the next stages of our ERP implementation in North America. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and on the offense, leveraging our experience and the capabilities that we have developed to lead through times of uncertainty while investing to capture the growth opportunities in front of us. For Nike, creating the future always starts with serving athletes in sport.\nAs we look to fiscal 2024, we have an incredible year of sport ahead of us. From this summer's World Cup to the road to the Paris Olympic Games, it will be a year to remember. Just like the athletes we serve, Nike will be ready to bring our best. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Everyone, if you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. We'll take our first question from Tom Nikic, Wedbush Securities.\n\nTom Nikic\n\nResearch Analyst, Wedbush Securities\n\nHey, everybody. Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to ask about North America and specifically the wholesale channel. I think there's been some news recently about maybe some wholesale partners that you had either exited or de-emphasized, and now you're going back into some of those retailers. What drove that decision?\nAnd I guess kind of what changed in your mindset that maybe a year or two ago you thought DSW was not somebody you wanted to partner with, but now you do, and Macy's, etc.? So just any insider color there would be really helpful. Thanks.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Tom, I'll take that. Let me just say right up front, our marketplace strategy remains the same as it's been over the last several years. And this is simply a continued evolution of the very same marketplace strategy. And I'll remind you that our marketplace strategy is driven by the consumer. I mean, at the end of the day, we start with the consumer, and consumers in this day and age want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. Consumers want digital and physical access. They shop across both channels. They want a mono brand and multi-brand.\nThey use different shopping occasions to use different channels. Consumers expect us to know who they are, and consumers have said to us they want a consistent and seamless experience. And so that is what has driven our marketplace strategy. And as you know, it starts with digital, our direct connection with the consumer. Our digital apps, our mobile apps are unmatched in the industry, and that's our fastest-growing channel that will continue to be our fastest-growing channel because we directly connect with the consumer digitally. We augment that with owned retail where we are building out stores, Nike stores, in segments that are currently underserved by our wholesale partners. We would say women's is one of those cases, and Jordan being another. So we're selectively opening new doors. And then multi-brand wholesale partners play a really important role. And as I said in my remarks, there's different segments.\nSo we spent a lot of focus and attention, and we've talked a lot over the last couple of years about the larger multi-brand partners like DICK'S, JD, Foot Locker, and Sports Direct. We've talked some around neighborhood doors where we authenticate. That's such an important role. And then we have accounts that help us serve distinct segments of consumers or price points. And so what we've done over the past quarter is simply an extension of that. Our direct business will continue to grow the fastest, but we'll continue to expand our marketplace strategy to enable access to as many consumers as possible and drive growth.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd next up is Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.\n\nMatthew Boss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks. So, John, with the expanded definition of sport and greater awareness of health and wellness that you cited, could you elaborate on how you believe the Nike brand is positioned to capture market share globally? And then, Matt, on the revenue guide for this year, could you just help bridge one Q relative to the full year? Maybe some of the puts and takes, I think, would be really helpful in terms of getting from the Q1 to the full year.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nThanks, Matt. And, Matt Friend, how about I'll take the first second. So, Matt Boss, we see the same structural tailwinds you just described. We are blessed with structural tailwinds around an expanding definition of sport, particularly around health and wellness, and a related structural tailwind around this movement toward athleisure.\nOur marketplace strategy is simply geared to expand, leverage our competitive advantages to not only gain share, but also grow the market by being where consumers are. And again, as I said a minute ago, to give them what they want, when they want, how they want it. Two examples come to mind. One is just Digital. I cannot tell you how important it is, our mobile apps. In fact, in Q4, our four mobile apps, SNKRS, the Nike mobile app, NTC, and NRC, had over 500 million visitors within the quarter. And that's just in the US or North America, APLA, and EMEA. Doesn't even count in China. So there's no one else in the industry that has anything close to that. And what that means is we are in the privileged position of being in consumers' pockets and on their home screens of their phones.\nThat's cherished real estate. So our mobile apps give us a huge advantage because it creates shopping occasions when they're browsing on SNKRS. It creates shopping occasions when they're working out. It connects us to consumers globally and will help us both grow the market and gain share. A second example will be around health and wellness in women's. We talked in my remarks about the Nike Well Collective. What this really is, is Amy Montagne, who's leading our women's team and just doing a fabulous job. Amy and her team have sharp consumer insight through the eyes of the women consumer, the female consumer, this intersection of sport, wellness, community. It's all infused with style. The distinction of style and performance for women is a much more nuanced and integrated thing.\nAnd so Nike Well Collective is both a branding and a way that our voice to her and our storytelling to her will come to life, but also our retail doors. And we have been opening Nike Live doors, as you know. We'll rebrand those Nike Well Collective. I will tell you the Nike Live doors, which are largely focused at women consumers, are performing very strongly around women's performance products, around women's fitness, leggings, and bras, around lifestyle as well. And so in that way, we're expanding our access to women consumers. And so we'll continue in our marketplace strategy. It really reiterates what I said a minute ago of being aggressive to be where the consumer is so that we're there when they want us, where they want us, and how they want us.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nAnd Matt, I'll just jump in on the question around revenue guidance. Let me start by just saying we're incredibly pleased by the growth that we delivered in fiscal year 2023 with 16% growth on a currency-neutral basis. If you look at our results in North America and EMEA on a currency-neutral basis, our growth was even higher. When you then compare our reported revenue growth to retail sales growth to the consumer across the marketplace, we drove strong double-digit growth in retail sales to the consumer throughout the year, including that trend continuing into the Q4. Nike Direct in the Q4 grew 18% versus the prior year. In this Q4, remember that we moderated the sell into wholesale but continued in terms of trying to prioritize a healthy marketplace, and we still drove strong growth in retail sales across the marketplace.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2024 and the mid-single-digit guide, it starts with the approach that we've been taking around assessing marketplace health and our consumer trends, and then the pressure that we see, the potential pressure that we see on the consumer. So we made a decision to tighten our first-half buys and continue the trend that we had done in the second half. But we are expecting retail sales to continue a trend, so retail sales to the consumer to continue a trend of growth versus the prior year. And actually, when we look at the first half and the second half of next year, we're actually planning for a fairly consistent level of retail sales growth to the consumer. The distinction with the first half is that we're continuing to manage marketplace inventory, and continue to just manage marketplace health.\nNike Direct is going to continue to lead our growth. When we look at next year in the second half in particular, we're excited about the new products that we've brought to market this year and scaling them next year. We're excited about new product introductions and then ultimately capturing the energy around the Paris Olympics, which is a wonderful moment for NIKE. But mid-single-digit revenue growth on the full year, and that includes four points of non-comp headwinds from wholesale shipment timing in fiscal year 2023, plus some of the accelerated liquidation activities that we had. So all told in this environment, we feel like mid-single digits a great number.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd Jim Duffy from Stifel is up next.\n\nJim Duffy\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for taking my questions. Some great progress on the inventories, and you spoke to an improved inventory posture in the marketplace. Just thinking about competitive dynamics, can you elaborate on your expectations for the promotional backdrop in fiscal 2024? And then related to that, you were very promotional clearing inventory across fiscal 2023. How does that factor into your outlook for the mid-single-digit growth and specifically the growth for the D2C business? Thank you.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nSure. Well, Jim, I would say in general, the marketplace remains highly promotional. And when we step back and look at the actions that we took last year, we're very happy with where we finished the year. In fact, our inventory levels are ahead of our plan and ahead of the competition. We saw total marketplace inventory units down versus the prior year. And when we look at NIKE-owned inventory in particular, we feel incredibly good about where we are and the plans that we have going into the first half of next year.\nThe large majority of our strategic partners have also done a beautiful job moving through the inventory and balancing the trade-offs of investing in consumer connections, elevating the retail environment, and moving through inventory. So we feel great about where we are, but we recognize that next year the environment is going to continue to be promotional. And that even puts pressure on our wholesale partners in terms of how they think about managing through the first half of the year. So we believe that the right focus and attention for Nike is to focus on recovering a higher level of full-price growth in fiscal year 2024, profitable growth, full-price growth.\nThe mid-single-digit guide does reflect four points, as I mentioned, of non-comp impacts, which are partially wholesale shipment timing because you recall last year there was a lot of late supply from 2022 that came into 2023, but also a little bit of extra liquidation as we were more aggressive moving inventory both through our own channels and our partner channels. But when I look at our growth plan for next year, adjusting for the comp headwind, and look at the profitability recovery that we see on the margin, gross margin, and EBIT line, I feel like it's a great plan and sets us up well for long-term growth and profitability.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Good afternoon.\n\nBrooke Roach\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThis is Brooke Roach filling in for Kate. Thank you so much for taking our question. You commented in the prepared remarks about seeing around the corner on transitory cost headwinds that have pressured your profitability, and that FY 2024 will start to see some relief there. Can you speak to the proportion of transitory costs that you anticipate to recapture in FY 2024 and what's still on the horizon for FY 2025 and beyond? Thank you.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nSure. So when we look at where we ended the year and the progress that we've made on inventory, we feel really good about our ability to drive healthy growth in 2024. You see that in our gross margin guide. We're guiding to expand margins by 140 to 160 basis points, and that includes a 50 basis point negative FX headwind. If we back out the FX, it's approximately 200 basis points of operational gross margin expansion.\nThe large majority of the 200 basis points is the beginning recapture of transitory headwinds. We will continue to see structural benefits in fiscal year 2024, but those are being partially offset by higher product costs and inflation in parts of our supply chain. When I look at the large majority of our transitory headwinds, we've been talking about two for the past several years. One is freight logistics, and the second one's liquidation. We've now negotiated our ocean freight rates with partners for fiscal year 2024, and we've negotiated rates that are near pre-pandemic levels. Those benefits don't kick in until halfway through the Q2. So we'll start to see that tailwind come in Q2, and then accelerate in Q3, and Q4, and then carry into fiscal year 2025.\nAs it relates to the liquidation impact, we are planning for an improvement in full-price mix and markdowns. We've baked that into our plans for fiscal year 2024. We recognize, as I answered the question for Jim a little bit earlier, that we continue to operate in a promotional marketplace. We're going to continue to read and react. As a result of that, we've planned for a modest recovery of those costs. You'll also recall that in fiscal year 2023, we were comparing to extraordinary levels of full-price realization, well above the 65% threshold that we had provided as our target. At this point in time, we're not planning that we're going to recover back to that level of full-price realization, but that instead we will be operating at or around the 65% level.\nBut we've also now seen a new way of living. And so it gives us some optimism that there can be more opportunity than even the metric that we've provided. But those two things taking into consideration, as we look to our margins beyond 2024, there's going to be some structural tailwind that comes from freight and that, or sorry, some benefit that's going to come from freight. And then our focus is going to be on the structural drivers that give us confidence in achieving the long-term margins that we've been talking about.\n\nOperator\n\nCristina Fernández, Telsey Advisory Group, has the next question.\n\nCristina Fernández\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group\n\nYeah, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could talk about the recovery you're seeing in China, how did that progress through the quarter? Just overall, when you look at the marketplace, how is it different today versus pre-pandemic in your ability to use your athletes and influencers to drive sales?\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nYeah, Cristina, probably the highlight of the last 90 days for me was getting back to China for the first time post-pandemic. And I will tell you, it was such a palpable reminder of, A, what a strong team we have there. And I just want to, again, call out our China team who has just done a spectacular job over challenge after challenge after challenge over the last three or four years. But what's also clear is the consumer is back in China, and Nike and Jordan Brand are strong. So as you heard, our Q4 growth was 25%.\nWe had a strong 618, and that's across different categories, performance and lifestyle, men's, women's, kids, really strong performance in running and basketball, wholesale fitness. But what was really clear is that the Nike formula of the best innovation combined with great local storytelling combined with the marketplace is connecting with Chinese consumers, particularly Gen Z. And so the Gen Z consumer in China cares about innovation, and they're doing a great job of taking our global innovations and hyper-localizing them, as well a great job of local storytelling. When I was there, we saw Craig Williams and I were there together. We saw the live streaming studio where we do a lot of live streaming in a way that really connects with Gen Z. Social shopping is taking off in China in a bigger way than other places, and we're at the front edge of that.\nThen, as you know, we have 6,000 monobrand doors that provide such an advantage. I will tell you, being in several of those doors in Shanghai and Beijing, it was right when the Motiva was launched. In the far majority of those 6,000 doors, the first floor is dedicated to women's. You walk in, and it is some of the best merchandising of a great innovation like Motiva connected to her, pulling her off the street and into the doors. So we'll continue to invest in China. Our China for China strategy, I think, is going very, very well. Looking ahead, we're optimistic about Nike's brand, Jordan's brand, and the momentum we have. As well, we think it's a structural tailwinds in the region make us optimistic over the long term. Gen Z is the most active generation.\nThere's a growing middle class, increased focus on health and wellness. So a very energizing visit, and makes us very confident about our brands and our business in China.\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE\n\nI think that the other thing I would just add is the activity and the effort that we've taken over the last three quarters to improve our inventory position in the marketplace. We had another great quarter, we reported. And where you really see that come to life in a monobrand marketplace, where you can see the full breadth in our stores, is that you get the full breadth of a seasonal assortment, which is when NIKE is operating at its best. Leading with innovation, China actually is our largest penetration of innovation of any geography that we operate in, and that connects well with what John referenced in terms of what the consumer is looking for.\nBut this quarter in particular, as we've improved our inventory position, we saw the highest level of full-price selling that we've seen in eight quarters. And that just shows the strength of NIKE when we have a healthy marketplace and we can bring the breadth of the assortment and the depth of our stories to bear for the consumer and to drive consumer demand.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question today will come from John Kernan, TD Cowen.\n\nJohn Kernan\n\nResearch Analyst Covering the Retail and Consumer Brands Sector, TD Cowen\n\nExcellent. Thanks for taking my question. Now, I just wanted to go back to the margin puts and takes and maybe talk a little bit about the long-term margin targets that were issued way back in fiscal 2022. I know a lot's changed since then, but are we still thinking in terms of a high teens operating margin long term? And how do we think about the margin profile of DTC and the mix shift to DTC?\n\nMatt Friend\n\nEVP and CFO, NIKE",
    "content2": "Sure, John. Well, let me start. I'll start with the back, and I'll come to the front in terms of the way you asked the question. We're making substantial progress towards the long-term goals that we had highlighted a couple of years ago. Our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy has been a consumer-led strategy. And when we look at the mix of our business in digital and in direct relative to where we were in fiscal year 2019, we've made significant progress against it. And we continue to invest to grow based on the fact that consumer continues to choose to shop in our stores and in our digital channels, or at least to engage in our digital channels before they go try to find the product that they want in the wholesale marketplace.\nAnd so we're very pleased with where we are today. We finished fiscal 2023 at a 44% mix in total direct and a 26% mix in digital. The consumer will decide the ultimate endpoint. What I mean by that is whether we land exactly at 60% or not doesn't really matter. But what we are confident long term is that we're going to be a more direct and a more profitable company. So when I look at our guidance for fiscal 2024 and the gross margin expansion that we're planning for on an operational basis, we're making significant progress to come back to where we were prior to the transitory impacts. Then we still see the benefits of structural opportunities to drive our margin long term. We've talked about those before.\nThose include the price value that we create in our products and the opportunity that creates for us to raise prices, to the impact of having an increasing channel mix, to some of the product cost opportunities we see through simplification of our SKU line and end-to-end efficiency. The timeline to predict when we're going to get there, as we've been talking about for a couple of quarters, is difficult to predict. A point on that in case is we've got 150 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds between last year and this year. We are confident that we're on the path towards achieving these long-term goals, even though it's a little bit more difficult to predict the exact time that we're going to get there. We think that we're on a path to the high 40s long-term gross margin goal.\nAnd at this point, we're continuing to do within our control in order to move us in that direction.\n\nJohn Donahoe\n\nPresident and CEO, NIKE\n\nAnd, man, John, I'll just build on one of the things that Matt says. The key to the whole thing is having the best innovation in the industry. That's what brings people to our direct channels. That brings people to our digital channels. And the momentum Heidi has had her team together offsite earlier this week and seeing the design, product creation, men's, women's, kids, storytelling, and brand teams really accelerating the pace of innovation, accelerating our ability to connect with the consumer is ultimately what's going to fuel not only our top line but also our bottom line. And so the feeling of momentum and confidence is really growing as we move into this more streamlined structure.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd everyone, that does conclude our question and answer session.It also concludes our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mr. Trussell, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC.\nIn addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and nonpublic financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance, NIKE, Inc.\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2023 third quarter results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Thanks for your cooperation on this.\nI will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe.\n\nJohn J. Donahoe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, ServiceNow, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. We delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 14% on a reported basis and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding our plan. Our growth this quarter was broad-based across our brands, channels and geographies. We had strong digital growth of 24%, which once again was fueled by double-digit increases in traffic on mobile and our apps. And while Direct, led by digital, remains strong and will continue to drive our growth, our wholesale channel continues to be an important part of our strategy as we access key consumer segments and achieve distribution scale across the marketplace. Wholesale grew 18% in Q3, reflecting strong retail sales with growth that over-indexed across our strategic partners.\nThis quarter continued our positive currency-neutral growth in all 4 of our geographies. North America, EMEA and APLA all delivered double-digit revenue growth. Greater China grew 1% despite a very challenging December following the shift in the country's COVID policies. And we're making great progress on inventory with our inventory dollars down sequentially versus last quarter. In Q3, we had inventory growth of 16% year-over-year. Our decisive actions are enabling us to navigate through the shifting dynamics with continued improved efficiency. These results demonstrate yet again that we're on track to hit our fiscal '23 priorities of getting inventory in a healthy position and delivering revenue consistent with the financial goals we set earlier in the year. In an environment of increasing macro volatility, the distinction of our brands and our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy set NIKE apart.\nLooking ahead, CDA continues to unlock our future growth potential by powering up our holistic offense across innovation, brand engagement and marketplace, all fueled by consumer insight. As we know, consumers today have rising expectations and changing behaviors. What creates separation for NIKE in this dynamic environment is our innovative product, brand scale and direct connections we have with our consumers. It's these connections that serve as one of our greatest competitive advantages as we translate insight into innovation. Thanks to our consumers' love of our brand, we enjoy a high rate of engagement, fueling richer, deeper understanding. Across the company, our insights model creates confidence in growth in ways that are uniquely NIKE as we make the entire enterprise faster, more efficient and more targeted in the growth opportunities that we go after.\nSo today, I thought we'd go through 3 areas where we leveraged our insights model this quarter. You may have heard us say before that running is the heart of NIKE and basketball is the soul. I'll discuss these 2 businesses, and then I'll talk about a product franchise that's a multibillion-dollar business in its own right, Air Max.\nSo first, let's start with running. Since our founding, we've used elite athlete insight to innovate at the edges of human potential. And that's led to platforms like NEXT%, which remains at the front of the pack in the world of distance running. And then we use these insights and innovations to serve everyday consumers no matter where they are in their running journey.\nToday, we leverage our direct relationships with runners worldwide, fueled by insight from our Nike Run Club app, along with consumer feedback across brand and marketplace touch points to know how our consumers are using our product and what pain points we can solve to keep them moving. For example, we saw our Invincible consumers pushing more distance on their runs, which requires better support and protection. So this quarter, we introduced the Invincible 3, which is designed to provide maximum cushioning and comfort. It also offers a wider fit than some of our past running footwear and uses the most ZoomX foam of any of our road running shoes. It's a shoe that demonstrates how NIKE isn't just innovating for performance but also designing to drive the lifestyle of running.\nConsumer response to the Invincible 3 was strong across our geos and throughout NIKE Direct, strategic wholesale partners and running specialty doors. And what really sets Invincible 3 apart is how we executed across the marketplace, driving consistent storytelling across channels, working closely with our partners to elevate our own retail presentation and theirs, all with a sharp focus on helping consumers find the right shoe for them. This approach will be accelerating as we focus on positioning ourselves for share gains in this important category.\nOur research with runners also leads us to launch product in complementary categories such as trail running, which is our fastest-growing running segment. This fueled the launch in Q3 of the Pegasus Trail 4. The Peg Trail 4, which has seen over-indexing strength with female consumers, takes many of the well-loved attributes of the Peg and adds rugged features that let runners keep the pace even on looser terrain. The combination of React foam and underfoot traction has proven to be a perfect crossover shoe for runners looking to split time between road and trail. Thanks to our ability to use analytics and insight to discover opportunities for growth in running, we continue to connect to the grassroots of this global community, and we remain confident we can take full advantage of these opportunities over the long term.\nNext, our Basketball category is in the strongest position it's ever been as we continue to grow the energy of the game globally. Across NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand and Converse, we've strengthened our signature athlete portfolio, adding Gen Z superstars while still being anchored by some of the game's greatest players. Last month, LeBron James set the all-time NBA scoring record in a thrilling game in L.A. I was fortunate enough to be there with our Co-Founder, Phil Knight. After the game, Phil turned to me and said that moments and athletes like this are why we got into this business, and he's right. And as I said last quarter, the LeBron 20 was the strongest LeBron launch in years, fueled by storytelling and the blend of innovation with sportswear design. This created greater commercial appeal, as seen in Q3 with very strong sell-through throughout the marketplace and full family sizing.\nThis is approach we use across our portfolio across our NIKE Basketball product construct. Thanks to our ongoing dialogue with athletes from the elite to the everyday we design around 3 key aspects of the game: cutting fast, playing long and jumping high, all while emphasizing off-the-court style.\nSo when we began work on a signature shoe for a playmaker and generational talent like Sabrina Ionescu, we knew the shoe would focus on cutting, helping her stop on a dime and accelerate back again. The Sabrina 1 uses research from thousands of athletes, both female and male, to create a unique traction pattern and a low-to-the-ground design that has lifestyle appeal that we're thrilled about. We're excited about the potential with the Sabrina 1 and the continued power of our increased focus on Women's coming out of CDA.\nOver in Jordan Brand, Q3 saw the release of its own young signature shoe. Jayson Tatum debuted the Tatum 1 last month at the NBA All-Star Game with fireworks, breaking the all-star record for points scored. The Tatum 1 joins the Luka, Zion, Westbrook and game shoe franchises for the strongest signature portfolio in Jordan Brands' history, helping fuel robust growth for the brand alongside of its consistent strength in retro.\nCrafted with efficiency in mind, the Tatum 1 is Jordan Brand's lightest basketball shoe and has a large volume Zoom Air bag in the forefront for energy-returning stability. Special care was given to the Tatum 1 kids design. The kids-specific model has specialized zonal rubber on the outsole for the durability needed for young kids' style of play. But the biggest innovation in the kids design came directly from parents, including Jayson himself, who asked for an easy-on, easy-off system. In preschool and grade school versions, designers came up with a new innovative tailgate system. And in toddler sizing, there's an even simpler collapsible entry technology. The Tatum 1 represents an evolution for the Jordan Brand, shifting from serving an individual athlete to also serving the next generation to come as well. The potential here to bring innovation into our Kids business is vast as we build lifelong relationships with younger generations.\nThird, let's discuss NIKE's Air Max franchise. Our Air Max business continues to expand, growing double digits in Q3. Like Air Jordan, Air Max is a great example of how we build significantly scaled businesses off our greatest performance innovations. Looking again at our insights Model, Air Max also exemplifies how we brief new product by leveraging qualitative and quantitative member data science to have a sharper and more targeted focus. We're able to ask ourselves who are the consumers we want to serve and what are they looking for.\nFor example, the 270 has been a top 5 Air Max franchise for the past 5 years. But we heard from younger age groups that they want their own version, a more street-engineered durable shoe, one with a new lifestyle identity. This vision of building a future franchise for the next generation led us to create the Air Max Pulse with the broader goal of creating an entire portfolio of classics for this generation. The Pulse connects the 270-style Air bag with a brand-new upper, bold and versatile styling and new Air Max branding. The Pulse launches on Air Max Day next week, and we can't wait for consumers to give it a try.\nAnother Air Max model launching next week is the \"Design by Japan\" Air Max 1 '87. This women's exclusive model represents the first time our members influenced product creation using polling on the SNKRS app as well as local member polling data. With just a year from conception to delivery, we relied on our Express Lane capabilities to make and deliver the product in such a short turnaround. Members who participated will be the first targeted for the shoe, creating NIKE's first full circle insights-to-shopping experience. And this is only the first example of this kind of product creation, and we look forward to seeing what we can do next.\nOverall, we're excited by how our focused approach to insights will fuel future growth. We're still in the early innings, and we're thrilled by the possibility ahead of us as we stay dedicated to listening to the athlete and leveraging membership data to inform future products and consumer experiences.\nBefore I close, I want to mention that, in 2 days, on March 23, we'll release our fiscal '22 Impact Report. As you know, at NIKE, purpose is deeply ingrained in everything we do. For example, you read that we've given more than 375,000 girls expanded access to sport through our community partners. In addition, we've maintained one-to-one pay equity for women and U.S. racial and ethnic minorities internally while also helping the first of our suppliers' facilities achieve a gender equitable workplace with upward mobility for women.\nAs you recall, 2 years ago, we set new quantifiable ESG targets focusing on a wide range of priorities across people, planet and play. I encourage everyone to learn about the measurable progress we've made at purpose.nike.com as we continue to create long-term value by shaping a better future through sport.\nIn the end, we're redefining what's possible, thanks to our close connections with consumers and how those relationships make us better again and again. We're supercharging how we serve athletes around the world with innovative product, brand engagement and experiences at retail. This promises to be yet another incredible year for sport, and there's never been a better time to be in the business we're in. I could not be more excited about our future.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's third quarter showed that in a dynamic environment, strong brands set the pace. Two quarters ago, we took clear and decisive action in response to changing marketplace and supply chain conditions. Our top priority was to strategically manage excess inventory and drive a quicker return to a healthy pull market, and our Q3 results prove that NIKE is leading the way.\nNIKE is more agile, responsive and resilient than before the pandemic with operational capabilities and an experienced team that enable us to create competitive separation. While we may continue to face heightened volatility, we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable and more profitable growth.\nConsumer demand for our portfolio of brands remains uniquely strong, fueling unit growth of approximately 10% despite increased macro uncertainty. NIKE, Jordan and Converse all drove double-digit currency-neutral growth this quarter. NIKE Direct outperformed with member buying frequency increasing and store sales growing across all geographies. Another quarter of industry-leading digital growth, up 24% in Q3, drove our digital share of business up to 27%. Our wholesale channel delivered a second straight quarter of outsized growth with a planned recapture of retail partner open to buy on improved inventory supply versus the prior year and strong consumer sell-through.\nRevenue from performance dimensions grew double digits versus the prior year with strong momentum from the Phantom GX, Invincible 3, LeBron 20 and other new product innovations. Revenue from lifestyle dimensions also remained strong as consumers continue to shift wallet share towards sport-inspired products that provide innovation, comfort and style.\nNIKE has been fueling this shift for more than 50 years, built on our passion for serving athletes. We have created the lifestyle around sport and have forged a deep connection to youth culture through our most iconic footwear franchises. Time and again, we take the consumer somewhere new. This quarter, we introduced new iterations of the Air Force 1 with Tiffany's, Undefeated and Drake. We drove energy around our top Jordan franchises with our latest Travis Scott AJ1 and a women's exclusive AJ4. We welcomed the year of the rabbit with a Dunk inspired by the iconic White Rabbit candy. We celebrated the NBA All-Star Game with an Air Force 1 Dunk and Blazer collection inspired by its host city. And we connected consumers to the Air Max 1 through craftsmanship, heritage storytelling and new modern renditions.\nThe energy that we are creating for the consumer continues to set NIKE apart. Even in a promotional environment, full price sales remain strong. And for the seventh consecutive quarter, ASP growth was positive for NIKE, Inc. with benefits from strategic pricing, product mix and our shift to direct more than offsetting the short-term cost of promotions to liquidate excess inventory.\nIn addition to driving strong top line results, we are making tremendous progress on inventory. Let me walk through a few key points. First, inventory dollars and units are down meaningfully from last quarter. In the third quarter, total inventory dollar growth was 16% year-over-year. In North America, inventory dollar growth was 14%. In Greater China, inventory dollars declined 4% versus the prior year, positioning us well for the momentum that we are creating in the China marketplace.\nNext, we are making even greater progress where we are focused most. In Q3, total apparel units were down year-over-year as we continue our sharp focus on liquidating excess apparel inventory. In North America, apparel units were down high single digits.\nFinally, we are confident looking ahead. With strong traffic and retail sales growth and reduced inventory buys for the spring and summer seasons, we are increasingly confident that we will exit the year with healthy inventories across the marketplace. In fact, given our brand momentum, we now intend to move through even more units by year-end than we had previously considered.\nBoth transit and buying time lines continue to tighten towards pre-pandemic levels, and free cash flow accelerated this quarter through improvements in working capital. Along with an improving flow of seasonal supply, our decisive actions will enable NIKE to compete at its best, driving consumer energy through new product, seasonally relevant assortments and fresh storytelling and premium retail experiences. Regardless of the near-term uncertainty facing consumers, we will be prepared to lead and to operate from a position of strength.\nNow let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. third quarter financial results. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 14% and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, with broad-based growth across brands, channels and geographies. NIKE Direct grew 22%, led by 24% growth in NIKE Digital and 19% growth in NIKE stores. Wholesale grew by 18%, driven by strong partner demand based on accelerating retail sales, higher shipments based on earlier supply availability and lower shipments in the prior year given supply constraints.\nThird quarter reported gross margins declined 330 basis points to 43.3% due to higher markdowns, increased product input costs, elevated freight and logistics expenses, including higher supply chain network costs in North America, partially offset by strategic pricing actions. This also includes approximately 140 basis points of impact from unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates.\nSG&A grew 15% in Q3 primarily due to wage-related expenses, variable NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16% and substantially consistent to the same period as last year. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.79.\nNow let's review the operating segment results. In North America, we drove strong holiday sales with momentum continuing into the new calendar year. Q3 revenue grew 27% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Direct up 23% and NIKE Digital up 25%. EBIT grew 23% on a reported basis.\nConsumer demand drove strong growth across performance and lifestyle. LeBron, Giannis and Luka grew high double digits, fueling market share gains in basketball. A strong Invincible 3 launch energized the marketplace, doubling digital sales compared to the Invincible 2. Air Max grew double digits, and the Jordan Brand kicked off its 23rd year, also known as Jordan Year with strong double-digit growth, incredible momentum, especially with women consumers and even greater potential with a path toward becoming the #2 footwear brand in North America.\nAcross the marketplace, we continue to capture opportunity with our growing digital advantage. Member moments throughout the quarter drove double-digit growth in repeat member buying. On the NIKE app, we integrated personalized product recommendations for members using available inventory to increase sell-through of key products. In addition, return on ad spend improved for another quarter as we test personalization and consumer experiences with activity and preference data.\nIn EMEA, we saw strong growth across all Western European markets, including positive trends in the U.K. Q3 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Direct up 39% and NIKE Digital up 43%. EBIT grew 10% on a reported basis. New product innovation resonated deeply. Invincible 3 drove strong sell-through in NIKE Direct and with our retail partners. Our statement Go Leggings delivered positive early results with strong sales in NIKE Live and NIKE Rise doors where we've been able to create a unique retail experience for her.\nIn football, we are gaining share with a very successful launch of the Phantom GX plus sustained momentum in the Mercurial franchise. We saw strong consumer response as we continue to transform the consumer journey in Digital. Traffic grew double digits with average order value growing mid-single digits and nike.com leading new member acquisition.\nOn the NIKE app, member engagement grew double digits with the new Jordan member home button driving the highest click-through rate ever on the app. We also continue to drive convenience and improve NIKE Digital profitability by expanding O2O services, optimizing last-mile delivery and reducing digital split shipments.\nIn Greater China, we drove top line growth despite another quarter of volatility. Q3 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis, declining 8% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis with NIKE Digital declining 11% as consumer buying shifted to brick and mortar with the country's reopening. EBIT declined 10% on a reported basis.\nIn December, we managed through disruption from the country's shift in COVID policies with widespread door closures. Starting in January, we began to see a rebound in brick-and-mortar traffic with strong retail momentum around Chinese New Year accelerating into February, especially as our clean inventory position enabled us to serve consumers with fresh seasonal assortments.\nThroughout the quarter, we gained traction in some of our most important business dimensions. Performance footwear outpaced lifestyle with running up double digits, led by the Invincible 3. Meanwhile, in basketball, LeBron 20 and the G.T. Series resonated deeply with energy around our local Space Maker Summit and Jordan Brand's China High School Basketball League All-Star Weekend. Growth in Kids surpassed other consumer segments with positive response to hyperlocal collections, such as our Chinese New Year Leap High Express Lane pack.\nWe are optimistic as our business momentum continues to build. In Beijing, NIKE's brand strength is deepening, extending our lead as the #1 cool and favorite brand. We are also seeing the benefits of a more local operating model as we have made investments over the past 2 years to serve the marketplace's unique needs. Long term, we are confident that the fundamentals of growth for NIKE in China remains strong.\nFinally, in APLA, NIKE's brand momentum continues to fuel strong growth. Q3 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, including approximately 8 percentage points of headwind due to the first full quarter of impact from the transition of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay businesses to a distributor model. NIKE Direct was up 22% with NIKE Digital growing 23%. EBIT grew 1% on a reported basis. Football grew double digits with a successful Phantom GX launch, strong sales for the Men's World Cup in December, and excitement building for the Women's World Cup this summer. In Running, we saw strong momentum across our top footwear franchises, including double-digit growth for Invincible, Infinity and Pegasus. And in fitness, the Metcon Free continues to win with consumers, growing triple digits.\nWe also continue to accelerate opportunity in this geography through marketplace innovation. This quarter, we expanded Express Lane to bring more hyperlocal product to consumers. In March, we introduced the NIKE App in Korea, which launched as the #1 free shopping app in one of our most digitally connected markets. And later this week, we'll open our newest World of Flight door in Tokyo, expanding the Jordan Brand's international growth.\nI will now turn to our financial outlook for fiscal '23. To date, we continue to see uniquely strong consumer demand as our product innovation, brand storytelling and consumer connections drive distinction and growth in the marketplace. That being said, we are closely monitoring the building pressure on consumer confidence and the uncertainties of the macro environment. We continue to take a cautious approach in planning our business, leading with intentional financial and operational guardrails. And looking ahead, we will continue to transform our operating model, unlocking speed, agility and efficiency with an improved marginal cost of growth.\nAs a result of our strong Q3 performance, we now expect fiscal '23 reported revenue to grow high single digits, an improvement from mid-single-digit guidance in the prior quarter with approximately 600 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the fourth quarter, this translates into flat to low single-digit revenue growth.\nRemember, more than 6 months ago, we strategically reduced our inventory commitments for the spring and summer seasons to ensure that both NIKE and our partners can work through excess and early arriving inventory. As a result, we expect wholesale revenue growth to moderate for the next few quarters.\nWe expect fiscal '23 gross margin to decline approximately 250 basis points, at the low end of our previous guidance range. This reflects ongoing and accelerated actions to reduce inventory by year-end, elevated freight and logistics expenses, including higher supply chain network costs in North America and 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, we expect SG&A to grow approximately 10%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be in the high teens range. And consistent with my approach over the past few years, I will provide specific guidance for fiscal '24 on our next earnings call.\nIn this environment, what sets NIKE apart is our portfolio of leading brands, our proven playbook and a team and culture of innovation that continues to deliver. We have managed through cycles like this before, and we will be well prepared for the volatility that is in front of us.\nWith that, let's open up the call for questions.",

Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mr. Trussell, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC.\nIn addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and nonpublic financial and statistical information.

Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this.\nI'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe.\n\nJohn J. Donahoe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, ServiceNow, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. We delivered a strong quarter in Q2, with revenue growth of 17% on a reported basis and 27% on a currency-neutral basis. And looking at the quarter's results, we delivered our Q2 expectations on revenue, profitability and inventory.\nIn this current environment, our consumer demand stands out. Today, we're creating more separation between us and our competition thanks to the meaningful relationships we have with consumers and the continued success of our strategy. Our Q2 growth was broad-based across our brands, channels and geographies. We had strong double-digit growth across both our partners and our direct business, which was once again led by our industry-leading digital performance. The quarter saw more than 30% currency-neutral growth in our North America, EMEA and APLA geographies. And after nearly 2 years of unprecedented disruptions, Greater China grew 6% on a currency-constant basis, translated to minus 3% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange. Clearly, our brand continues to not only be top of mind, but prioritized by consumers around the globe.\nIn addition to our results, we're executing in the areas we spoke to 90 days ago as we take decisive actions to clear excess inventory. We believe the inventory peak is behind us as actions we're taking in the marketplace are working. Later in the call, Matt will share more about our progress on inventory in North America and a return to healthy inventory levels in China. So overall, our Q2 results give us confidence that we will deliver the year, and we remain on a path toward our long-term goals as well. Our current headwinds, such as foreign exchange and inventory challenges are transitory, but our tailwinds are structural like the expanding definition of sports, the consumers move toward digital, and the cultural shifts toward comfort and health and wellness. More importantly, our results speak to how we've leveraged our competitive advantages, which include a relentless innovation pipeline, unmatched brands and deep consumer connections to build relative strength and stay ahead of competition.\nAs you heard me say before, at NIKE, it all starts with product innovation. And this quarter, I'd like to highlight an important part of our culture of innovation: our constant pursuit to improve on our most popular platforms. We win with product because we know it's not only about individual innovations, but also about our ability to continuously bring newness to our greatest franchises.\nFor instance, earlier this quarter, we launched the LeBron 20 to strong consumer response. What's unique about the LeBron 20 is that it's LeBron's first signature shoe to debut with a low top. Driven by consumer insight and performance demands from LeBron himself, this style combines innovation with sportswear design to create greater commercial appeal with its ability to be worn on the court and off. And we're not just bringing innovation and excitement to existing franchises, we continue to expand the portfolio. Coming soon, we've got some exciting signature debuts in NIKE Basketball and Jordan Brand that we can't wait for consumers to see. With our strong product portfolio and unparalleled roster of athletes that we have today, we couldn't be more excited about the future of our basketball business.\nLast quarter, I highlighted another franchise in another sport getting an upgrade, the material, which added a Zoom Air bag to create NIKE's fastest football boot ever. And during the exciting World Cup over the last several weeks, the new material scored more goals than any other boot, led by Kylian Mbappé who won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer. In fact, NIKE's boots dominated the World Cup, scoring more goals than all other brands combined. And consumers have responded to this energy, giving the new material the highest full price realization of any performance product this quarter globally. And of course, for us, it doesn't just end in innovation with product. NIKE's innovation can also be felt with our rich and powerful storytelling and our deep brand engagement, particularly in global sports moments like the World Cup. NIKE's unique ability to bring together product storytelling and the world's best athletes has once again created something that only NIKE can.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our Q2 results speak to the continued success of our strategy. Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling our marketplace approach in which we directly connect with the consumer no matter where they shop. Today, our marketplace strategy is driving distinction in this current promotional environment. Our work to directly connect with consumers is founded on a simple consumer insight. Consumers want to get what they want, when they want it and how they want it. And consumers have told us they want a consistent, seamless and premium experience both digitally and physically around monobrand and multibrand. And so we're serving consumers digitally with our suite of apps. We're extending our reach and convenience through our strategic wholesale partnerships and leveraging monobrand doors to fill the gap for underserved opportunities like women's fitness and Jordan.\nThe key is building meaningful direct lifelong relationships with consumers. We deeply believe this will be an important source of differentiation going forward. Why? Well, for one, having a direct connection with consumers avoids the risk of disintermediation. In other words, with the consumer base that comes directly to our apps, to our website and to our owned and partner stores, we, alongside our partners are in a position to control our own destiny. And ultimately, this direct connection enables us to understand consumers better so that we can serve them better with the right assortment, with the right partners and at the right touch points.\nAnd what showcases the success of this strategy is our membership base. Membership was a key reason our digital business grew an industry-leading 34% this quarter. Q2 was our biggest member demand quarter ever, and we saw double-digit growth in member engagement. Today, we have roughly 160 million active members who engage with us on a regular basis. And more importantly, our repeat buying members who are more engaged spend more and spend more frequently are growing at an even faster pace of high double digits as they continue to be an important growth engine for our business. And our members also shop seamlessly across the marketplace. In addition to digital, a key member on-ramp for us is through our NIKE stores. In fact, more than 50% of store demand comes from members, and cross-channel members are even more valuable with higher demand per member than single channel members.\nAn important enabler of giving consumers a personalized shopping experience regardless of channel is our connected membership program with our strategic partners. You've heard us discuss it before, scaling connected membership with DSG, JD Sports, Zalando and top sports. And today, we're seeing results that are beneficial for everyone. NIKE is already learning more about our members, which helps us elevate in areas such as product creation, line planning and the experiences we deliver.\nAnd our partners are telling us that these engaged members are driving improved traffic, conversion and mutual profitability for them as well. And so while it's still early days on this journey, we're excited by the foundation we're creating. The ability to give consumers a personalized experience across channels, fueled by data and insight, opens up a whole host of opportunity for us. It positions us to empower consumers with their own choice while keeping the scalability and strengths in digital marketing, product creation, distribution and more, which results from knowing them so well. So ultimately, it will make NIKE a better retailer and also a better wholesale partner.\nLast but not least, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our Greater China team and the 6% growth they just delivered. As I said earlier, it's been nearly 2 years of unprecedented disruption in China. But this team's resilience, experience and strategy has set us apart to gain momentum on all fronts. Last month, we had a record-breaking 11.11 consumer moment, which concluded with double-digit demand growth and NIKE having outperformed the industry. And we keep setting new records as part of this important shopping holiday: #1 brand, #1 in traffic, #1 in live streaming, #1 in flagship store, #1 in membership acquisition and #1 in member demand penetration. And we're not just #1. This quarter, we saw movement in relative positioning as we create even more competitive separation coming out of this important consumer moment. And as you know, we have remained committed to investing in Greater China for the long term. Even in this dynamic environment, we continue to invest in technology, local marketing and more as we believe the best way to capture demand in China is to serve consumers in a locally relevant way.\nAnd today, we're getting a true competitive boost from our investments in these new capabilities. Let me just highlight a few. We launched China-specific versions of our apps to build NIKE experiences that are faster, more engaging and more personalized. We created a first-of-its-kind China-specific member journey with Tmall, which saw a significant uplift in new member recruitment and demand per member. We piloted connected membership with member-linked transactions to 42 NSP stores in 18 cities across China, driving conversion, member acquisition and retaining high-value members. And our team continues to drive China for China capabilities like delivering hyper local product design and localizing marketing content creation. Thanks to this focus, we're now serving our consumers in China with an agile, dynamic and personal way like never before. We're confident in our ability to compete and win in this marketplace for the long term.\nIn the end, I just want to say how proud I am of our entire global team. In times like this, it's people that make the difference. And a great team can turn challenges into opportunities, and we've got a great team, and that is exactly what they have done. This is a group who will stay on the offense to deliver the business while also creating the future of NIKE. We'll continue to build an even stronger position, and I couldn't be more excited.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's second quarter of fiscal '23 demonstrated again the power of our portfolio of brands. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged our brand momentum and deepened our connections with consumers to drive strong revenue growth. Before going into our second quarter results and financial outlook, I want to provide more insight on the strong consumer demand that we continue to see and the progress that we have made over the past 90 days regarding our inventory.\nConsumer demand for our brands drove double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth across NIKE, Jordan and Converse. Within NIKE Direct, retail traffic was up, conversion rates expanded and member buying fueled record digital results. Within wholesale, we saw strong retail sales and market share gains across our top strategic partners. Since last quarter, our brand momentum has accelerated into the holiday season. In North America, our Black Friday and Cyber Week performance set record highs for demand and traffic, fueling strong double-digit revenue growth and exceeding our plan. In EMEA, we closed our biggest Cyber Week ever, increasing demand by 75% from last year. In Greater China, our 11.11 demand grew mid-teens, outpacing the sports industry. And globally, our holiday season momentum has continued through the first few weeks of December.\nDespite operating in a largely promotional marketplace, we are creating brand distinction by driving healthy, profitable growth. Full price realization remains strong after strategic pricing increases, especially for our top innovation products in our largest footwear franchises. NIKE brand ASP is up year-over-year across our geographies, even with higher discounts to liquidate excess inventory. This quarter, we also leveraged targeted promotions to serve and acquire NIKE members, strengthening an important foundation for sustainable growth. Above all, our Q2 results reinforce our confidence that NIKE's brand and business momentum starts with the value that we create for consumers through our product innovation, deep brand connection and elevated experiences across the marketplace.\nNow let me turn to inventory. Last quarter, we talked specifically about the actions we are taking to address excess inventory, with focus on pockets of seasonally late products, predominantly in apparel. At the end of Q2, we are tracking in line with our plan, and we are pleased with the progress we have made over the last 90 days. Let me go deeper into what we are seeing and why I am optimistic about our path ahead.\nFirst, inventory dollars and units are down sequentially. Prior-year comparisons are distorted by last year's Vietnam factory closures. But compared to the prior quarter, inventory dollars were down 3% and units were down high single digits, with days in inventory at the lowest level in 4 quarters.\nSecond, we are making progress where we are focused most. In North America, year-over-year growth in inventory dollars decelerated from 65% in Q1 to 54% in Q2. More importantly, total inventory units are down low double digits from first quarter levels, even as spring product continues to arrive earlier with faster transit times.\nThird, the composition of our inventory is improving. In North America, apparel inventory units and apparel closeout units are both down mid-teens from the prior quarter.\nLast, we have proactively reduced forward supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we have tightened our second half buys to prioritize inventory health across the marketplace. As transit times stabilize, we are optimistic that we will begin to see a more normal and predictable flow supply in a more capital-efficient manner.\nLooking ahead, we are confident that our decisive actions have put us on the right track within the financial parameters that we provided last quarter. Our focus continues to be positioning NIKE for future seasons of sustainable and profitable growth.\nNow let me turn to our NIKE Inc. second quarter financial results. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 17% and 27% on a currency-neutral basis with strong growth across the portfolio. NIKE Direct grew by 25%, led by 34% growth in NIKE Digital and 11% growth in NIKE stores, highlighted by strong season-to-date holiday results. Wholesale grew by 30%, driven by strong demand for seasonal products, higher shipments based on earlier supply availability and lower shipments in the prior year given supply constraints.\nSecond quarter reported gross margins declined 300 basis points to 42.9%, primarily due to higher markdowns, mainly in North America, unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, elevated freight and logistics costs and increased product input costs, partially offset by strategic pricing actions. SG&A grew 10% in Q2, primarily due to wage-related expenses, strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3% compared to 10.9% for the same period last year, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation and earnings mix. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.85.\nNow let's review the operating segment results. In North America, we captured market share with strong holiday results and positive consumer response to new assortments. Q2 revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 21% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 23%, with NIKE Digital up 31% on double-digit growth in traffic and repeat member buying. Wholesale revenue grew 37%, driven by strong marketplace partner demand and improved inventory supply.\nPerformance innovation and fresh seasonal product resonated deeply with consumers. The LeBron 20, KD and Giannis fueled double-digit growth in basketball. And the AJ11 Varsity Red shock drop highlighted Jordan Brand's momentum. In women's, our new statement leggings, NIKE Go, launched with positive early response as the Free Metcon grew double digits. Dunk outperformed in men's, and Pegasus continues to win with everyday runners.\nBeyond product innovation, NIKE continues to create distinction at the intersection of culture and community. Ahead of homecoming season, our Yardrunners campaign elevated the voices of HBCU changemakers alongside the release of co-created product through our SNKRS App and neighborhood partners. In addition, with the recent announcement of future NIKE Off-White collections, we are deeply honored to introduce the next chapter of Virgil Abloh's continuing legacy with NIKE.\nIn EMEA, our team landed yet another strong quarter. Q2 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 23% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 44% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Digital growing 62%. Membership was an accelerator as members drove over 85% of demand during Cyber Week, our highest demand week ever in EMEA. Our campaign led with sport, adding more than 1 million new NIKE members as we invited consumers to join us in celebrating the World Cup.\nThe power of our portfolio drove momentum across the marketplace. Earlier this month, we celebrated the Milan opening of Jordan World of Flight, a premium retail concept at the forefront of basketball culture. Meanwhile, NIKE dominated shoe and apparel counts at the Berlin and London marathons, as Alphafly drove strong sell-through. Pegasus Shield and Windflo Shield grew double digits in women's running. Zegama created energy in trail running, the sports fastest-growing segment. And Global Football grew double digits as we continue to celebrate an incredible year of sports.\nIn Greater China, our brand and business momentum continued as Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 10% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Digital growing 9%. In addition to delivering positive growth, we achieved our goal of returning to inventory health at the end of Q2. Inventory dollars declined 3% this quarter and closeout inventory was down high double digits versus the prior year, with closeout mix now in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nOur team delivered these results while managing through significant COVID-related disruptions, including the closure of over 1,500 owned and partner stores at the end of November. We continue to closely monitor ongoing risk while focusing on what we can control, deepening our connections with Chinese consumers. As 18,000 runners joined in the return of the Shanghai Marathon, our brand presence was deeply felt not only as the title sponsor, but also as NIKE dominated the shoe count and local NIKE athlete, Zhang Deshun, topped the podium.\nThe energy extended into double-digit growth through our running business led by Zoom Fly and Vaporfly as well as the Pegasus and Windflo. NIKE's brand momentum with our youngest Chinese consumers continues to grow as well. On 11.11, Gen Z demand for NIKE grew by 45% on Tmall. And with NIKE leading on 11.11 as the #1 store on Tmall's kids footwear channel, plus our top Kids lifestyle footwear franchises growing double digits in Q2, we are more excited than ever about NIKE's opportunity to serve the next generation.\nFinally, in APLA, our team continues to overdeliver in our fastest-growing, most diverse geography. Q2 revenue grew 34% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 25% on a reported basis despite the transition of our SOCO territory to a distributor model. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis and NIKE Digital grew 35%. We deepened consumer connections across territories, with member days fueling robust growth. In Korea, one of our fast-growing marketplaces, we're excited to integrate our digital business on to NIKE's global platform, which will enable us to serve Korean consumers through the NIKE and SNKRS App. We also continue to strengthen local connections through our Express Lane with launches such as our Somos Familia collection.\nAcross APLA, this quarter showed the power of our complete offense. In women's, we drove energy and lifestyle with local storytelling around the Air Force 1's 40th anniversary. Global Football and Running led the way in men's performance, and Kids delivered balanced growth across apparel and footwear. Finally, the Jordan Brand continues to be an incredible engine for growth, with momentum in streetwear and performance footwear.\nNow I will turn to our financial outlook. As I said last quarter, we are taking a measured approach in the second half against an uncertain macro outlook as we continue to prioritize a healthy pull market. That said, we remain positive regarding the strong consumer demand we see across our portfolio of brands as well as the health of our product franchises. From product innovation to rich storytelling, the value that NIKE creates for the consumer continues to drive business momentum and competitive separation across the marketplace.\nGiven our strong second quarter performance, we now expect full year revenue to grow low teens on a currency-neutral basis, an improvement from our low double-digit guidance in the prior quarter. As of today, we expect approximately 700 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds, resulting in full year reported revenue growth of mid-single digits. Third quarter revenue growth is expected to be higher than the fourth quarter due to timing of wholesale shipments. We continue to expect gross margin to decline between 200 to 250 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting ongoing liquidation actions in the second half. This outlook reflects our strong performance in Q2, mostly offset by an additional 25 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, now totaling 95 basis points for the full year.\nWe expect the third quarter gross margin will decline at a similar rate as the second quarter, including 120 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to increase high single digits. We expect third quarter SG&A dollars to be in line with the second quarter. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the high teens range, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation.\nAs many of you know, we closed out NIKE's 50th anniversary this year. And for all the history NIKE had already made, it's the future that inspires us most. After all, NIKE's culture of innovation doesn't just shape the products we create and the stories we tell, it also defines the way we adapt and accelerate through dynamic conditions. Over this past year, no matter what we have faced, our teammates have continued to come together and deliver. I could not be more proud of their efforts. And as we turn toward NIKE's next 50 years, I have every confidence in the future this team will create. To every member of our NIKE, Jordan and Converse team around the world, thank you for all that you do and happy holidays.\nWith that, let's open up the call for questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe.\n\nJohn J. Donahoe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, ServiceNow, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. Before we get started, I want to give a special shout out to the greatest of all time, Serena Williams, following her final tournament at the U.S. Open. Serena doesn't like to use the word retired, so I won't either. But on behalf of the entire NIKE family and sports fans around the world, we're going to miss seeing her play. We're thrilled to see what she does next as she continues to serve as an inspiration and everything she does. Serena, on behalf of everyone at NIKE, thank you.\nTurning to our Q1 performance. Our teams continue to prove their ability to operate through volatility while also staying focused on the long term. For the quarter, our revenue growth was 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in our North America, EMEA and APLA geographies. I'm proud of our results this quarter as our brand momentum, culture of innovation and proven operational playbook delivered yet another quarter of strong revenue growth. Our brand strength continues to give us confidence in sustaining our top line momentum.\nThese results reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world as we keep them in the center of all that we do. Our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy enables us to create value around consumer creation, consumer demand in an entire marketplace fueled by the lifelong relationships we maintain. This significant momentum that we're seeing is fueled by structural tailwinds that continue to create energy for us. NIKE's growth is strengthened quarter-by-quarter by the expanded definition of sport, by the societal movement toward comfort and health and wellness and by the fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital. These advantages, along with our scale, the strength of our portfolio of brands and the right strategy, renew our confidence in a more populated competitive landscape. As the world's largest sports apparel and footwear company, we are happy to set the pace in serving the consumer.\nAt NIKE, our focus remains not only to grow market share but also to invest to grow the entire market. Our ability to expand the world of sport and our ability to create the future of sport itself is why I wouldn't trade NIKE's position with anyone.\nNow as you look at this quarter's strong results, we can see our brand momentum and global portfolio come to life. This is true across the 3 areas I'd like to walk through today: our brand that deeply connects with consumers fueled by authenticity and sport; our culture of innovation that drives a continuous pipeline of new products; and our competitive advantage across the marketplace as one of the few brands that can connect with and serve consumers at scale.\nSo let's start with NIKE's strong brand and our connection to sport, which differentiates us all over the globe. Consumers continue to rate us their #1 cool and #1 favorite brand as we connect directly and deeply with consumers worldwide. No matter the macroeconomic dynamics, no matter the competitive landscape, the NIKE brand, and indeed, all 3 of our brands, including Jordan and Converse, have created meaningful relationships with consumers across age, gender, ethnicity and more. This brand momentum is fueled time and time again by our athletes and teams. No other brand in the world can match our roster as we help them perform at their very best.\nJust look at women's football this quarter. Two fabulous international tournaments ended with NIKE federations on top with England winning the Euro Champs and Brazil's winner of the Copa America. And what's particularly exciting is that these 2 wildly popular teams will compete in the inaugural Women's Finalissima, the first-of-a-kind women's match between the European and South American champions. This historic match is slated for February 2023, and we can't wait.\nAnd speaking, we can't wait, we're very excited for the Men's World Cup later this year and the Women's World Cup next summer. This will truly be one of the greatest 18 months in footfall history, and NIKE will be there in full force.\nNow our brand strength and consumer connection will continue to be driven by storytelling through sport in a way that only NIKE can. In tennis, I mentioned Serena's farewell to the sport at the U.S. Open, but the new generation made some noise there too. Carlos Alcaraz won the men's side at 19 years old become the youngest men's #1 ever. Along with Frances Tiafoe and Jannik Sinner, the future of men's tennis was on full display, with NIKE proud to represent this next generation of exciting players.\nAlso in the quarter, the Las Vegas Aces won the WNBA title, led by Coach of the Year Becky Hammon, Kelsey Plum and League MVP A'ja Wilson. And American football is now back. With the Swoosh won by all 32 NFL teams, and NIKE and Jordan representing 21 schools and college football top 25. And finally, in the Berlin Marathon last week, Eliud Kipchoge smashed his own world record, running the marathon in an incredible 2 hours, 1 minute and 9 seconds while wearing the Alphafly Next% 2. Simply put, we have a roster of athletes, teams, leagues and federations that represents the very best in sport, creating inspiration for consumers worldwide.\nLet's move to innovation. As we've said before, NIKE's relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition. Today, we have incredible momentum in key products and franchises across the spectrum of lifestyle and performance. And what excites us even more is the energy and anticipation we're feeling for the innovative product that's next in the pipeline. We're now starting to see the product that reflects our shift 2 years ago to our new consumer construct of men's, women's and kids, and the impact it's had is remarkable.\nWe're also excited about how we'll be connecting this product to the consumer. Today, we're working toward being more seasonally relevant across the full assortment. So the energy we're creating from an innovation standpoint, when combined with how we plan to story-tell and connect it to the marketplace gives us immense confidence as we look ahead.\nEarlier, I mentioned this landmark 18 months for global football we've got coming up. We created a football boot to match the moment. So during the women's Euro Champs this past summer, we debuted the Air Zoom Mercurial, which for the first time, adds a Zoom airbag to what was already our fastest football boot. This gives the footballer an even greater sense of snappy propulsive energy return. The new Mercurial and energy around it is NIKE at its best, as products, storytelling the marketplace and elite athletes come together to connect this innovation to consumers.\nAnd with our best boot ready for the biggest stages of the world's most popular game, not to mention a full lineup of Federation kits, we're thrilled about translating this energy into commercial opportunity.\nOur culture of innovation is fueled not just by what we make but also how we make it. We're always looking to increase the pace and precision of product creation. New VR design software and simulation tools allow our designers and engineers to collaborate in real time like never before. This transformative path to continuous new innovation is highlighted by the new Air Max Scorpion. The Scorpion, which is an eye-catching shoe that offers our most Air ever in terms of pounds per square inch, followed a development time line of just 18 months. In fact, our digital transformation investments directly led to Scorpion's breakthrough innovation within our iconic Air franchise.\nHow did that happen? Well, thanks to computational design pioneered by NIKE for industrial design uses, Scorpion introduces a radical new system for airbags, moving from simple forms into complex new geometries for a unique underfoot sensation that has to be felt to be believed. And moving forward, we plan to accelerate the use of our industry-leading digital creation tools to bring new excitement to our biggest franchises.\nNow during last quarter's call, I mentioned a new platform that we believe has the potential to change the apparel industry. As some of you have seen with its launch last week, I'm talking about NIKE Forward, our biggest apparel innovation since Dri-FIT 30 years ago. NIKE Forward revolutionizes apparel creation to make premium sustainably-minded product that offers brand-new comfortable sensation. The truth is NIKE Forward feels different because it is different.\nForward's being introduced in hoodies and crewnecks for men and women that feature raw cut pockets, minimal seams and a modern silhouette. And this innovative product is warm and yet lightweight with a future-forward look that consumers have responded to since its unveiling last week. And as the consumer focus on comfort continues to gain momentum, we see vast opportunity ahead for scaling forward in our entire performance-driven sportswear apparel business. So from performance to sportswear sustainability, NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation as we use innovation and design to connect with and inspire consumers all over the globe.\nMy third and final point today is our competitive advantage across the marketplace. We're continuing to accelerate against our One Nike Marketplace approach in which we directly connect with the consumer no matter where they shop and with each channel playing an integrated role in the consumer's overall journey. Now our approach starts with NIKE Digital as that's where most consumers begin their shopping journeys. And then it's augmented by our strategic wholesale partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium and seamless consumer experience. And last but not least, our remodel brand stores which continue to play the key role of supplementing where there are gaps in the marketplace, such as women's or Jordan.\nNow this quarter, we delivered NIKE Digital's highest net revenue quarter ever. We see consumers continuing to vote for NIKE Digital as the NIKE commerce app had its highest traffic in history during Q1. And we keep elevating our ability to serve these consumers. For example, new membership tools we put in place last year in fiscal '22 that went live in Q1 create one-to-one connections at scale by delivering personalized consumer journeys and experiences which in turn drive first purchases and increased loyalty. And the SNKRS app continues to fuel energy to our growing audience of high-value members.\nWe're bringing this community in almost daily flow of compelling content and product launches. In Q1, for example, SNKRS saw its most member entries ever for the Travis Scott AJ1 that dropped in July with a record 3.8 million member entries for just a single shoe, SNKRS continues to impress as it offers the perfect intersection of content, community and commerce.\nSecond, our partners are and will remain a vitally important part of our marketplace strategy. Partners enable us to serve consumers with expanded access, choice and convenience, and above all, letting us know and serve these consumers across the full marketplace. Today, we're seeing growth through our partners and improved retail sales. For example, back-to-school was strong as supply continued to improve and traffic and sell-through continued to accelerate. And as we continue to focus on giving consumers personalized experiences regardless of channel, the key remains connected membership. This model gives shopper the benefits of NIKE membership in partner stores, accelerating in-store conversion, engagement and improving customer lifetime value.\nNow as you know, connected membership again last year with DICK'S Sporting Goods before 2 of our key partners in Greater China joined in, TopSport and Pou Sheng. And today, we're very excited to announce that we're now extending connected membership to EMEA with Zalando and JD Sports as increased opportunities for connected data and inventory make us even quicker and more precise in jointly serving the consumer.\nIn fact, just 2 days ago, we hosted our first in-person, NIKE Partner Summit in over 2 years in which we brought to Beaverton, a group of 24 of our top retail partners, representing 76 countries. The summit was a great opportunity for us to accelerate into the future together with a unified vision and belief in partnership and collaboration.\nAnd it was clear that our partners were excited to get the sneak peek at our upcoming product as well as getting a deeper dive in our strategy. NIKE will continue investing to deliver the very best brand in the industry to elevate our collective game with the right product experiences and unmatched storytelling through content and insights to help us win with the consumer. These strategic partnerships are truly win-win with plenty of opportunities still ahead.\nAnd finally in our marketplace strategy, we continue to build a compelling retail footprint with our own brick-and-mortar fleet. As Direct becomes an even bigger part of our business, we're investing in becoming a better retailer as we pursue our goal of becoming world-class in this space. In a dynamic retail environment, our global traffic is up, thanks in part to the unique NIKE experiences we offer across our assortment of retail concepts.\nFor instance, in July, we opened our first NIKE Rise store in EMEA, NIKE West London, following the success of NIKE Rise in China and Korea. All 3 NIKE Rise stores use real-time shopping insight and the community focus to deliver tailored in-store experiences for consumers. NIKE West London uses local sports, like football and running, along with data on the city and its athletes to create something that cannot be replicated anywhere else.\nIn the end, our strong brand momentum speaks to our continued belief that these are times when strong brands get stronger. We're supercharging how we serve consumers with innovation, direct connection and experiences that create lifelong relationships with our brands. There's never been a better time to be in the sport and wellness business, and I'm confident in our ability to not just stay at the front of the path but also to extend and expand our lead.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. Our first quarter of fiscal '23 demonstrated again the deep consumer connection and strong demand for NIKE, Jordan and Converse. In a dynamic operating environment, we delivered top line results ahead of plan, more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. With industry-leading Digital growth, positive retail traffic in our stores and online, and more product available for consumers across the marketplace, the power of NIKE's portfolio continues to fuel business momentum.\nAt our core, NIKE is a growth company, built on a passion for serving athletes. 50 years later, this passion inspires consumers worldwide through our commitment to product innovation and our belief that sport can change the world. Today, NIKE's potential for growth has no limits as we create our future through a steadfast focus on serving the consumer. At the same time, we are closely monitoring an operating environment that continues to be disruptive.\nSo before discussing our first quarter financial results, let me provide a deeper view into the latest shifts we are seeing and the actions we are taking to manage our business for the long term.\nOver the past 3 years, we have leveraged our operational playbook to manage through supply chain disruption and COVID-related store closures. I could not be more proud of how our team continues to adapt to changing circumstances with a relentless focus on getting the right product to the right place at the right time.\nThis quarter, it became clear to us that conditions in North America are shifting once again. Earlier ordering by retailers, driven by strong consumer demand and less predictable delivery time lines, had led to elevated inventory levels broadly across consumer goods. Then transit times began to rapidly improve with signals that further improvement may be coming. At the same time, consumers are facing greater economic uncertainty, and promotional activity across the marketplace is accelerating, especially in apparel. As a result, we faced a new degree of complexity.\nDemand for NIKE, Jordan and Converse continues to be uniquely strong with positive consumer response and high full price realization on fresh seasonal assortments and key product franchises. In September, month-to-date retail sales are up double digits versus the prior year, following a strong back-to-school season. However, our North America inventory grew 65% versus the prior year, with in-transit inventory growing approximately 85%. This reflects the combination of late delivery for the past 2 seasons plus early holiday orders that are now set to arrive earlier than planned and a prior year that was impacted by factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia.\nAs a result, we are taking decisive action to clear excess inventory, focusing on specific pockets of seasonally late products, predominantly in apparel. While we expect this to have a transitory impact on gross margins this fiscal year, we believe this cost will be far outweighed by the benefit of clearing marketplace capacity to align seasonally relevant product, storytelling and retail experiences for the consumer.\nTime and again, this is how NIKE responds to adversity. We adapt, we compete and we accelerate forward. With strong brand momentum, improving deliveries and a robust innovation pipeline, we're acting now to set the stage for future seasons of sustainable profitable growth.\nLooking ahead, we are especially excited about the breadth and depth of our product pipeline. This includes innovation platforms that break new ground in performance and sustainability. Women's apparel completely redesigned for fit, sensation and support. A renewed focus on serving everyday runners with the world's best running innovation across price points. A total refresh of our signature basketball line across brands. New sportswear collaborations with the leaders of youth culture and the next chapters of our most iconic product franchises.\nNIKE's authenticity as the champion for athletes and sport has always been one of our greatest strengths. Over the next 18 months, we'll drive consumer energy through new product and storytelling, in essence, doing what NIKE does best.\nNIKE's competitive advantages are also growing as the Consumer Direct Acceleration transforms our operating model, driving deeper and more direct connections through digital. NIKE membership serves as a catalyst for digital growth, driving greater engagement and higher lifetime value in our highest margin channel.\nThis quarter, repeat buying members grew by over 30% with increased buying frequency and demand across total NIKE members. In fact, many of our most important membership benchmarks, reflecting how well we convert, engage and retain buying members, are at near all-time highs. These trends give us confidence that we have a strong and loyal member foundation to drive digital growth ahead.\nSince fiscal '19, our Digital business has nearly tripled to exceed $10 billion in revenue, representing 24% of total NIKE Brand revenue in fiscal '22. Over this period, NIKE Direct gross margins expanded through the combination of rapid digital growth and improvements in channel margin profitability, ultimately fueling NIKE's overall gross margin expansion despite being partially offset by transitory headwinds experienced through the pandemic. While we continue to manage through short-term dynamics, these structural tailwinds give us confidence that we are making progress towards our long-term financial goals.\nNow let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. first quarter financial results. In Q1, NIKE Inc. revenue grew 4% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. This was led by 14% growth in NIKE Direct and 8% growth in wholesale. NIKE Digital grew 23% with double-digit growth across EMEA, North America and APLA, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value. First quarter reported gross margin declined 220 basis points to 44.3%. This was primarily due to elevated freight and logistics costs plus higher markdowns across the marketplace in North America and unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates.\nSG&A grew 10% in Q1, primarily due to wage-related expenses, strategic technology investments, increased NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7% compared to 11% for the same period last year, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation.\nFirst quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.93. Finally, inventories were $9.7 billion, up 44% compared to the prior year. Driven by volatility in transit times in North America, strategic decisions to buy inventory for future seasons earlier and lower inventory levels due to last year's factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia.\nNow let's review the operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 13% and EBIT declined 4%. NIKE Direct grew 13% versus the prior year, outpacing the broader market with double-digit in-store and digital traffic growth. NIKE Digital grew 19%, fueled by member demand and the NIKE app. Wholesale revenue grew low double digits with strong growth from strategic partners such as DICK'S and JD Finish Line as well as our authenticated partners.\nNIKE continues to lead as the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in North America. We're driving momentum across key consumer and sport dimensions, including positive consumer response to the Pegasus 39, Invincible 2 and Infinity 3 in performance running; high sell-through and full price realization across key footwear franchises, such as Air Force 1, Dunk and the Air Max 270 and broad-based growth across men's, women's, kids and Jordan on improved inventory supply.\nAs I previously discussed, we started to increase promotional activity in the first quarter and expect the broader marketplace to be promotional at least through the end of the calendar year. We expect that total inventory in North America peaked in Q1, and we anticipate seeing sequential improvement over the year as we rebalance supply and continue serving strong consumer demand. As we prioritize a healthy pull market, we are confident that our brand strength and decisive actions positions us well to compete and to capture market share.\nIn EMEA, we saw record results. Q1 revenue grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 11% on a reported basis, with broad-based growth and strong gross margin expansion driving the most profitable quarter in EMEA history despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. NIKE Direct grew 20% on a currency-neutral basis and NIKE Digital grew 46%. Running delivered solid growth with strong consumer response to the Pegasus 39, Invincible 2 and the Peg Trail 4. We also celebrated our most successful Mercurial launch ever and an unforgettable moment for women's sport at the European Championships, with our Never Settle, Never Done campaign driving over 450 million impressions.\nSince fiscal '19, EMEA gross margins have expanded by more than 500 basis points, with NIKE Digital increasing its penetration from 7% to 20%, nearly tripling its share of EMEA NIKE Brand revenue. This is another great proof point for how our consumer-led digital transformation is accelerating NIKE's growth and profitability.\nNext, I'll provide some color around our results in Greater China. In Q1, revenue declined 13% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 23% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct declined 2% on a currency-neutral basis with a 5% decline in NIKE Digital. While COVID-related disruption had meaningful impact on store operations and retail traffic, business performance and inventory management are ahead of plan as we continue to proactively recalibrate supply and demand.\nBrand strength is our competitive advantage, with NIKE setting the pace as Chinese consumers' #1 cool and #1 favorite brand, further extending our lead among teams. Product innovation remains a key differentiator with strong sell-through from the Alphafly Next% 2, the Pegasus 39, the G.T. Cut 2 and other performance products.\nJordan Brand's momentum was another highlight with year-over-year growth, driven by a standout Luka 1 launch, key franchise strength and the energy of Jordan's 25th anniversary campaign. We continue to deepen connections with Chinese consumers in locally relevant ways, from elevating the street dance community with hyperlocal product and storytelling to igniting youth basketball culture through the lens of the Chinese high school basketball league.\nWith Gen Z member demand growing more than 25% versus last year on NIKE's digital platforms and the newly launched localized NIKE app already leading as the #1 brand shopping app, we're more encouraged than ever about NIKE's opportunity to serve Chinese consumers with distinct, premium and localized experiences.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we are taking a cautious near-term approach in Greater China, given the ongoing risks of COVID-related disruption. However, our brand and business momentum gives us increasing confidence that NIKE's unique value proposition will fuel long-term growth in Greater China.\nAs we turn to APLA, Q1 revenue grew 16% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth led by Southeast Asia and India and Korea. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis, led by 29% growth in NIKE Digital and 31% growth from NIKE-owned stores. Our Member Days offense continues to accelerate member engagement, tripling repeat buying versus the prior year. Women's continues to deliver outsized growth, with momentum in performance running, footwear, bras and sports style innovation footwear like Air Max.\nPerformance fueled strong growth in men's with the launch of Pegasus, Infinity and Invincible in running and the Mercurial in global football. In addition, we have now transitioned our businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a distributor model.\nNow I'll turn to our updated financial outlook for fiscal '23. To date, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our portfolio of brands across our geographies. We are closely monitoring consumer confidence and behavior, and ultimately, the implications of high inflation on consumer demand. We've managed through cycles like this before, and we know these are times to stay on the offense, leveraging our financial strength to prioritize a quicker return to a healthy pull market. In this environment, strong brands set the pace and we are confident NIKE will emerge even stronger. We are focused on what we can control as we take a measured approach against an uncertain macro outlook.\nAccordingly, we will tighten up our second half buys and liquidate excess inventory more aggressively beginning in the second quarter, focusing the flow of new product to our strategic partners and NIKE Direct. Headwinds from foreign exchange have also shifted significantly in the last 90 days as the trend of U.S. dollar strengthening has accelerated. Based on current spot rates, net of hedging activity, we estimate the full year negative impact of foreign exchange on reported revenue and EBIT to now be approximately $4 billion and $900 million, respectively, creating a wide divergence in constant versus real dollar performance.\nWe continue to expect currency-neutral revenue growth of low double digits versus the prior year, equating to reported revenue growth of low to mid-single digits versus the prior year, assuming 800 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect gross margin to decline between 200 to 250 basis points versus the prior year. This reflects approximately 150 basis points of annual impact from higher markdowns and higher off-price mix to liquidate elevated inventory, a second straight year of more than 100 basis points of headwinds from elevated freight and logistics costs, and foreign exchange pressure now a 70 basis point headwind on the full year.\nWe now expect SG&A to increase high single digits as we prioritize investment in new transformational capabilities to serve consumers directly and at scale, partially offset by tighter expense control and limited headcount growth across the business. We now expect the fiscal '23 effective tax rate to be in the mid- to high teens range, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation.\nFor the second quarter specifically, we expect reported revenue to grow low double digits on strong consumer demand despite 900 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect second quarter gross margins to decline approximately 350 to 400 basis points versus the prior year, the largest impact across the fiscal year as we discount out-of-season product more aggressively in a largely promotional marketplace. This will require higher markdowns in our own channels and through wholesale partners.\nThe second quarter also compares to last year's record level of full price realization and includes headwinds from freight, logistics and other supply chain costs as well as foreign exchange. As we look towards the rest of our fiscal year, we are confident in our strategy and in our opportunity ahead. While we expect circumstances to remain dynamic, we are optimistic as we continue to make progress towards our long-term financial goals. Our brand momentum is strong. The power of our portfolio is unrivaled, and our vision of NIKE's limitless potential is clear.\nOn that note, I'd like to close by thanking our 79,000 NIKE, Jordan and Converse teammates around the world who serve our mission with a passion for sport and a culture of innovation unlike any other. They represent our true competitive advantage and our greatest reason for confidence as we create NIKE's future.\nWith that, let's open up the call for questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe.\n\nJohn J. Donahoe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, ServiceNow, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. This quarter, NIKE celebrated our 50th anniversary. On May 1, 1972, NIKE became its own company, a new stand-alone brand with its own mission and vision. As Phil and I put it recently, back then, all we had was a dream, a ton of ambition, a trunk full of shoes and a big swoosh on all of them. And over the 50 years since, NIKE has been a growth company. For 5 decades now, we innovated for athletes, redefining sport for generation after generation. And today, we're the biggest champion in the world for athletes and for sport, and we've inspired a global community and remain driven by the power of sport to create a better world.\nThis spring, we've been celebrating our 50th anniversary across the globe, and these moments have been particularly special as many of us have now returned to our workplaces. It's been great to see the collaboration and creativity as we strengthen our culture of innovation, team and community. I have personally loved feeling the energy of our teammates being back together again. In fact, I got to feel that energy not just here in our campus in Oregon, but also across Europe when a group of us visited our team there a few weeks back. After a couple of years of virtual meetings, it was great to finally spend time with our European teammates in person.\nAnother highlight from that trip was touring our European Logistics Center in Laakdal, Belgium and getting to see firsthand how efficiency and sustainability help us serve our consumers while minimizing our environmental impact. And I love getting a chance to spend some time with some of the players on England's women's national football team, the Lionesses, who were inspiring as they prepare for the Women's Euro Champs in England this summer.\nSeeing our European teammates in person again reminds me of how deeply grateful I am to all of our 79,000 global teammates. As we conclude this fiscal year, our NIKE, Inc. team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our consumers and our communities. And our teams have proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro complexities while also building our future. In particular, I want to acknowledge Greater China team, who have managed the business through a challenging period for them and their families. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this team is the greatest collection of talent in the world, and I sincerely thank them.\nThis fiscal year and certainly this past quarter, macroeconomic challenges have created a dynamic environment. And yet looking at our full fiscal year '22 results, it's clear that our strategy is working and that NIKE's unique competitive advantages continue to drive the business. Today, we're better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Over the past 2 years, we've transformed our business, building a muscle that won't just help us navigate future adversity, but one that gives us the ability and agility to continue to drive our growth. We now have a proven operational playbook with many levers at our disposal.\nFiscal '22 posed operational headwinds throughout the year, but we continue to invest. As other companies have pulled back, our investments have made us stronger. And we're excited by what we see as we look at our growth opportunities and the strong consumer demand we continue to enjoy. And as we look ahead to fiscal '23, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook.\nOur structural tailwinds, which include the expanded definition of sport, the societal movement toward health and wellness and comfort and the fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital, continue to create energy for us. These advantages, along with our size and scale, the strength of our portfolio of brands and having the right strategy, give us the confidence to move even faster against the opportunities we see ahead.\nNow NIKE's growth has been and will continue to be the result of 3 areas I'll walk through today. First, our brand deeply connects with consumers, fueled by authenticity in sport and compelling storytelling. Second, our culture of innovation drives a continuous pipeline of new products. And third, we continue to have a competitive advantage in digital as one of the few brands that can connect with and directly serve consumers at scale.\nSo let's start with the strength of the NIKE brand. You've heard me say that these are times when strong brands can get stronger, and that has never been more clear than it is today. Our passion for sport continues to drive our deep connections with consumers. While visiting our team in Europe, I was able to attend the NIKE versus NIKE FA Cup Final, which Liverpool won in the thrilling penalty shoot-out over Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. In April, Scottie Scheffler won the Masters. And earlier this month, Rafael Nadal won his 14th French Open.\nAnd it's been a great month for basketball as the WNBA season kicked off and an incredible NBA season concluded. The power of our full portfolio of brands was felt with NIKE basketball highly visible as the official supplier and partner for both leagues and Converse and Jordan showing up proud in the NBA Finals with Draymond Green and Jayson Tatum, respectively.\nIt was also a quarter defined by a series of only NIKE moments, none bigger than the April unveiling of the Serena Williams Building here in our campus. This 1 million square foot building is the new home for our design and product creation teams. More than 200,000 square feet is dedicated to lab space, which allows our innovation and product creation teams to test new ideas in developing, presenting and merchandising products. And along with the LeBron James Innovation Center that opened last fall, these facilities represent the single greatest investment in sports science, research, innovation and design in the world.\nAlso in the quarter, we were thrilled to launch the Nike Athlete Think Tank, which brought a group of female athletes together on our campus to share their experience and insight. The 13 athletes, including Serena, Sabrina and Shalane, also selected community organizations that NIKE will help fund through grants. Soon, we plan to grow the think tank, creating even more long-term impact at the grassroots level, fueled by our goal of empowering the next generation of women in sport.\nThis quarter, we also connected with our consumer through a powerful brand campaign tied to our 50th anniversary. The film, directed by and starring Spike Lee, celebrates NIKE's past and the promise of our future. The film was complemented by programming across our app ecosystem, Nike.com, social media and more to incredibly strong consumer response. In fact, our 50th anniversary campaign led to the highest NIKE commerce app traffic in our history, even higher than some of the major commercial moments in the past, which once again shows how brand heat can translate to member engagement. We saw particular energy with Gen Z as our campaign song went viral on TikTok, reaching #1 on the list of top trending TikTok songs.\nAnother only NIKE moment in Q4 was the launch of No Off-Season, our podcast focused on mental health and starring athletes including Karl-Anthony Towns and Laurie Hernandez. We created this podcast to help redefine sport for a new generation as another new and creative way that we drive relationships with consumers with an energy and scale that only likely NIKE can.\nAnd finally, we began the next chapter of our relationship with Kobe Bryant and his family this quarter as we launched a new Kobe shoe that pays honor to Gigi Bryant, with all profits donated to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation. This was a launch with deep global resonance from L.A. to Shanghai, with much more to come as we continue to build our Kobe business within our portfolio of signature franchises.\nMy second point today is our relentless pipeline of innovative products, which continues to drive separation between us and our competition. No other brand has our ability to resource, solve and scale in response to a consumer opportunity. In Q4, we again introduced new performance innovations to the market, including new footwear technology from both NIKE women's and the Jordan brand.\nIn women's, we launched the Nike Spark Flyknit, a new lifestyle shoe that introduces NIKE Running's latest innovation, the Spark cushioning system. Spark offers a new sense of comfort and energy return through its dual density on midsole. The Spark Flyknit is one of the first projects from our Nike Sports Research Lab focused on injecting performance technology into lifestyle products, in this case responding to the consumer insight requesting a women's shoe for those who are on their feet all day long. Moving forward, we will be scaling our use of performance innovation into lifestyle footwear with a special focus on the opportunity we see in the women's business.\nAnd in Jordan, this quarter, Luka Doncic debuted his hotly anticipated Luka 1 signature shoe during the NBA Playoffs. The Luka 1 introduces a brand-new performance foam called Formula 23, which provides a lightweight and responsive ride, befitting of one of the game's best players. Formula 23 is one of the most sustainable performance foams ever made by NIKE, and Jordan now plans to scale it across its product line, including into its next Air Jordan shoe.\nAnd speaking of sustainability, we continue to scale our industry-leading solutions in this space. In April, we launched new sustainable iterations of 2 footwear icons, the Pegasus Turbo Next Nature running shoe and the Mercurial Vapor Next Nature football boot, both of which are made with at least 50% recycled content by weight. Next Nature continues the work we started with Space Hippie, with plans to scale even further across our franchises.\nAnd we're also innovating how we reduce waste beyond individual products and franchises. This led to the Nike Re-Creation program, in which vintage and obsolete products are collected and used to create new, locally designed and manufactured products. The program, which combines design, retail and distribution, launched in L.A. with plans to expand to London and Paris in fiscal '23, building a local ecosystem in all 3 cities. We know that singularity is the future of sustainability and these local ecosystems creating the exciting beginnings of a fully circular infrastructure at NIKE.\nAnd looking ahead, we're excited to soon introduce a new platform that we believe has the potential to change the apparel industry. It's a new material that brings together scale, innovation, sustainability and design like only NIKE can. This material isn't a knit or a woven, and it significantly reduces environmental impact through fewer carbon emissions and by not using water or dyes. We believe this platform could do for apparel what Flyknit did for footwear. Its first products will be unveiled this September, and we can't wait for all of you to see it.\nNow for my third and final point today, NIKE's increasing digital advantage. With an own digital business that grew 18% in fiscal '22, we continue to set the pace in our industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that drives one-to-one consumer experiences at scale.\nThis quarter, our app ecosystem grew into an even greater share of our total digital demand, helping our digital share of the business reach 24% in Q4. This is a shift being led by the consumer as they pursue the most personalized shopping experience NIKE provides. And we do not take lightly the choice made by consumers to put us in the most prized real estate that exists today, the home screen of their phone. No other brand occupies that space globally like NIKE, and it remains one of our biggest competitive advantages.\nMoving to physical retail. We continue to bring to life our vision of giving consumers personalized digital experiences regardless of channel. We know that consumers expect us to know who they are online or offline and across the full array of mono-brand stores, NIKE Digital and our wholesale partners. Within our NIKE-owned stores, higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are simply driving a better consumer experience. Online to off-line services, such as buy online pick up in-store and ship from store, are driving growth with 100% of our North America stores now offering at least one element of O2O.\nAnd in addition to our owned physical retail, we continue to innovate and codesign great partner experiences and business models to better know and serve consumers. We started this journey through connected inventory to provide better allocation, extend product choice for consumers and reduce friction such as products being out of stock.\nAnd increasingly, we're moving beyond inventory to a broader approach of knowing and serving our consumers as NIKE members particularly when shopping through our retail partners. As you know, this is a journey we announced in Q2 through our partnerships with Dick's Sporting Goods to connect member accounts. And then we continued in Q3 with NSP partners in Greater China. And with clear success thus far in knowing our shared members better, our strategy expanded in Q4 to serving our shared members one-to-one through connected data.\nConsumers are responding to the meaningful benefits we're now testing, and we'll continue to extend the best of NIKE to our members across the marketplace with additional partners and expanded services in fiscal '23. At the same time, our growing participation in new digital platforms continues to expand access points to NIKE across the digital ecosystem.\nAfter last quarter's first official NIKE NFT collaboration with RTFKT, we took another step in our journey to serve our community with innovative virtual products in Q4. Our first co-branded virtual sneaker, the RTFKT x Nike Dunk Genesis CRYPTOKICKS, continues our connection with an audience that will help shape the future of sport and culture.\nIn the end, as we look to start a new fiscal year, NIKE will do what we've done for 50 years now, and that's staying on the offense. We have a proven playbook, and our unique strengths and competitive advantages give us even more confidence about our future. Our focus is on the long term, and we're not slowing down.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's 50th year has been a year of transformation. Through dynamic conditions, our team has remained focused on what we can control, continuing to lead with speed, agility and responsiveness. Most importantly, we stayed focused on accelerating our strength and building NIKE for the future. In this environment, what guides us is a relentless focus on creating value for our consumer, and what fuels our confidence is the way our consumer is responding.\nFiscal '22 was our largest revenue year ever, even with supply constraints challenging our ability to serve consumer demand. We are optimistic as we enter fiscal '23, with our source base fully operational, production surpassing pre-pandemic levels and inventory flowing again into our largest geographies.\nAs we set the foundation for another year of strong growth, I'd like to provide some broader context around our strategic transformation. Two years ago, we introduced a bold new phase of our strategy, our Consumer Direct Acceleration. In the early months of the pandemic, we set our sights beyond simply navigating through short-term volatility. Instead, we outlined a clear vision to pursue even further competitive separation by expanding our digital advantage, reshaping the marketplace of the future and creating deeper, more direct consumer relationships.\nToday, NIKE's continued momentum shows that our strategy is working. As we look forward, let me briefly highlight 3 of NIKE's foundational elements for long-term value creation, our global portfolio, our consumer-led digital transformation, and our expanding direct-to-consumer operational capabilities.\nFirst, one of NIKE's greatest strengths is our unrivaled global portfolio. Together, NIKE, Jordan and Converse represents 3 of the world's most connected consumer brands, dimensionalized across sport and lifestyle, footwear and apparel, up and down price points, throughout geographies, at the center of cultural relevance.\nToday, NIKE is the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world, leading as the champion for athletes and sport. With a sharpened consumer construct across men's, women's and kids, we're deepening our sport focus, expanding our product pipeline and accelerating our long-term growth potential. The next chapter of our partnership with Kobe Bryant and the Bryant family is just one example of how we continue to bring new energy and dimension to our portfolio.\nJordan Brand's momentum has also been unstoppable, with some of the most exciting young athletes in sport and some of the most iconic products in the world. Since fiscal '20, Jordan women's has tripled, international geographies have grown over 60% and apparel has grown over 50%. Now with approximately $5 billion in revenue, fiscal '22 was Jordan's biggest year ever, with epic growth potential ahead.\nConverse also delivered incredible milestones in fiscal '22. Product and storytelling through the lens of youth and creativity are resonating deeply, with growing strength among women consumers. As Converse scaled its digital offense and invest in new product creation, the impact is clear with global revenue approaching $2.3 billion, total digital penetration reaching 27% globally and EBIT more than doubling since fiscal '20. Across all 3 of our brands, we're driving a more direct, digital and differentiated future and I wouldn't trade our position with anyone.\nNext, our consumer-led digital transformation is driving long-term growth and value. A more digitally connected NIKE is a more valuable NIKE. Today, our own digital business, representing over $10 billion in revenue, is more than double in size versus pre-pandemic levels. After increasing market share and gaining 3 percentage points from the prior year, NIKE Digital now represents 24% of total brand revenue.\nMore importantly, we are accelerating the pace and scale of NIKE's direct consumer connections. With growing digital traffic and Nike App downloads, our apps now represent almost 50% of total digital demand. In turn, increased digital engagement is translating into more repeat buyers, a higher buying frequency and increased average order value, ultimately driving higher lifetime value through membership. And as retail consolidation continues and consumers converge around fewer digital platforms, a distinct NIKE consumer experience is driving more direct connections, positioning us well for long-term growth.\nLastly, we are transforming our operating model with new capabilities in order to move at the speed of the consumer. This year, we will begin to see value from our biggest investment in NIKE's digital transformation, our new ERP. As we shift to an increasingly direct-to-consumer future, a new ERP will be foundational for increasing speed and agility across our supply chain. This will give us real-time visibility to inventory across our network plus dynamic transactional capabilities to optimize consumer demand and inventory productivity. We will go live with our new ERP in Greater China in July and continue building and testing in North America for deployment in fiscal '24.\nWe will also see a new consumer marketing offense in action in fiscal '23. Through new capabilities activated in partnership with Adobe, we will unlock additional productivity and demand creation and member retention across our NIKE ecosystem. We have started testing audience segmentation in North America with real-time data and personalized journeys on the Nike App, with plans for further expansion in the coming months.\nIn Greater China, we are also accelerating our digital capabilities, building on our 40-year history in the market with an ecosystem from China for China. In fiscal '23, we will deliver a new suite of commerce and sport activity apps, deepening our connections with Chinese consumers through an enhanced user experience, including locally relevant features across our digital apps, services and our owned and partner retail stores.\nFinally, we continue to scale our Express Lane, which combines hyper-local consumer insights with improved responsiveness and speed to market. In fiscal '22, Express Lane drove approximately 25% of total NIKE Brand revenue with higher profitability. We expect to build Express Lane into a larger portion of our business in fiscal '23 and beyond.\nNow let me turn to NIKE, Inc. fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance.\nIn Q4, NIKE, Inc. revenue declined 1% and grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis. This was led by 11% growth in NIKE Direct, offset by a 3% decline in wholesale. NIKE Digital grew 18%, fueled by strong demand across our app ecosystem.\nFourth quarter reported gross margin declined 80 basis points versus the prior year. This was primarily due to specific actions taken to manage supply and demand in Greater China following COVID-related disruption as well as elevated freight and logistics costs. Headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strategic pricing actions, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, improved NIKE Direct margins and a higher full-price mix.\nSG&A grew 8% in Q4, primarily due to strategic technology investments, increased NIKE Direct variable costs, wage-related expenses and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 4.7%. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix and a noncash onetime benefit related to the onshoring of our non-U.S. intangible property.\nFourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90. This includes a $0.10 nonrecurring noncash charge related to both the deconsolidation of our Russian operations as well as the transition of our Argentina, Chile and Uruguay businesses to a strategic distributor model.\nFinally, inventories were $8.4 billion, up 23% compared to the prior year period. This was driven by elevated in-transit inventories due to extended lead times from ongoing supply chain disruptions, partially offset by strong consumer demand.\nNow let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 5% and EBIT declined 18%, in line with our expectations as we lapped supply shifts in the previous year. Elevated ocean freight and logistics costs continue to dampen near-term profitability in this geography. NIKE-owned inventory grew 30% versus the prior year, with extended lead times causing in-transit inventory to be 65% of our total inventory at the end of the quarter. Wholesale revenue declined 12% due to inventory supply constraints. Strong marketplace demand drove closeout units down double digits versus the prior year.\nNIKE Direct grew 5% versus the prior year, delivering its highest quarterly revenue ever. Marketplace channel growth was led by 11% growth in NIKE Digital with another quarter of historically low markdown rates and lower available inventory supply. NIKE Digital total penetration reached 27% for the quarter, led by strong NIKE app growth. Even with lean available inventory, our power franchises continue to resonate deeply. Pegasus led the way for performance footwear, Jordan launch delivered a record-breaking quarter, and classics such as Dunk and Blazer drove strong full-price growth. Meanwhile, we continue to test and learn across our newest retail concepts, such as our Nike Live doors, which are increasing member buying amongst women.\nIn EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 20% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 63% on a reported basis. With broad-based growth across channels, consumer dimensions and product engines, NIKE Direct grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis, powered by healthy retail traffic as we anniversary COVID-related closures from the prior year. NIKE Digital grew 21%, driven by positive launch sell-through, improved full-price selling mix and lower markdown rates.\nSport continues to power our EMEA marketplace, highlighted by growth in running and fitness, performance franchises such as Metcon and Mercurial and apparel launches such as the elite bra in women's. Looking ahead, EMEA will kick off the most unprecedented 12 months of global football in NIKE's history, starting with the Women's Euro Champs this summer, Men's World Cup in the fall and Women's World Cup next summer. NIKE is meeting the moment with a complete offense, including new kit launches, new training and lifestyle assortments, and a Mercurial, Tiempo and Phantom footwear innovations across men's, women's and kids.\nNext, I'll provide some deeper color around our results in Greater China. In Q4, revenue declined 20% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 55% on a reported basis. This follows the region's most widespread COVID disruption since 2020, impacting over 100 cities and over 60% of our business. As conditions shifted, our experienced local team acted quickly and decisively. We leveraged the diverse logistics network and strong local partnerships, returning to 100% capacity at our central logistics center within 3 weeks. Our marketplace team also adjusted inventory to meet digital demand. As a result, NIKE Digital landed Q4 with low single-digit growth.\nDespite a dynamic operating environment, NIKE extended its leadership position as Chinese consumers' #1 cool and #1 favorite brand. We saw this translate into positive business impact on NIKE Tmall's Super Brand Day, which drove 90% member demand penetration and nearly 1 billion impressions. NIKE also created a clear separation on 6/18 as the undisputed #1 store and #1 brand on Tmall sport channel, outperforming the market. In addition, as lockdowns lifted in specific trade zones in late April, May and early June, we saw improved store traffic and overall consumer demand.\nKey footwear franchises continue to win in the marketplace, led by GT Cut as the #1 style in performance basketball and Pegasus 39, which drove strong results in men's and women's running. Express Lane also drove incredible sell-through with locally inspired launches such as the Air Force 1 logo and the head-to-toe street dance pack in footwear and apparel. As I mentioned earlier, we took specific actions in Q4 to recalibrate forward-looking supply and demand, prioritizing the return to a healthy pull market by the end of the second quarter. While there may be near-term risk of further COVID disruption, longer term, we continue to be encouraged by another quarter of brand momentum in the marketplace.\nAs we turn to APLA, Q4 revenue grew 24% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 31% on a reported basis, reflecting our largest quarter ever in the geography. We saw double-digit currency-neutral growth across Korea, Mexico, Southeast Asia and India and Japan. NIKE Direct grew 43% on a currency-neutral basis, led by 59% growth from NIKE Digital. Membership fueled double-digit growth across all territories as our SNKRS App drove its best-ever quarter in Japan, Korea and Mexico. We also saw our biggest quarter yet for women's, led by performance running, classics and lifestyle apparel. Kids led the way within NIKE Digital, up nearly 100% from last year. We're expanding support for a new generation, driving strong results with proven franchises such as the Court Borough plus newer innovations such as Dynamo Go.\nNow I'll turn to our financial outlook for fiscal '23. We enter the year confident in our brand strength, consumer connection, product pipeline and normalizing inventory supply into a healthy pull market in North America, EMEA and APLA. We continue to see momentum against our largest growth drivers and our most iconic product franchises. At the same time, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and the implications of high inflation on near-term economic growth and consumer demand. We are also taking a cautious approach to Greater China given uncertainty around additional COVID disruptions. As such, we have factored various risk scenarios into our guidance for fiscal '23.\nWe expect revenue for the full year to grow low double digits on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 400 basis points. In the first quarter, we expect real dollar revenue growth to be flat to slightly up versus the prior year due to COVID disruption in Greater China and more than 500 basis points impact from foreign exchange translation.\nWe expect gross margins to be in the range of flat to declining by 50 basis points versus the prior year with a wider-than-usual range reflecting our consideration of a number of scenarios. We expect to benefit from mid-single-digit pricing actions and continued gains from our shift to a more direct business, offset by another 100 basis points headwind from elevated ocean freight costs, increased product costs, discrete supply chain investments and normalization of historically low markdown rates. We expect foreign exchange to be a 30 basis point headwind on gross margin due to strength in the U.S. dollar, largely offset in fiscal '23 by favorable hedge rates versus current spot rates.\nWe expect gross margin pressure to exceed 100 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal '23, both as we recalibrate supply and demand in Greater China and as we anticipate higher promotional activity to sell seasonal inventory, which has arrived late due to a combination of factory closures and longer transit times. We expect SG&A to increase high single digits to low double digits as we continue to invest in our people, our brands, new stores and our transformational capabilities. And lastly, we expect the fiscal '23 effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range.\nAs we move forward, we will stay focused on what we can control and continue managing the business for the long term. This includes leveraging our scale and financial strength, optimizing supply and demand and most importantly, creating value for our consumer from the products we design to the stories we tell, to the experiences that we deliver. Our consumer-direct acceleration is working. Our long-term vision has never been more clear. And if there is anything that's 50 years of growth have proven, it's that with the right team and the right strategy, the future is ours to create.\nOn that note, I'd like to close with a heartfelt thank you to the team that makes it all possible, the people behind the art, science and magic of NIKE. Our team is and always will be NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. And as proud as we are of all that NIKE has achieved over the past 50 years, what excites us most is what comes next.\nWith that, let's open up the call for questions.",

Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Fiscal Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at http://investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mr. Trussell, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including the annual report filed on Form 10-K. Some forward-looking statements may concern expectations of future revenue growth and gross margin.\nIn addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to constant dollar revenue. References to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants may also reference to other nonpublic financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. To the extent nonpublic financial and statistical information is discussed, presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be made available at NIKE's website, http://investors.nike.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul Trussell.\n\nPaul Trussell\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2022 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about 45 minutes ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com.\nJoining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe.\n\nJohn J. Donahoe\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, ServiceNow, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. I first want to acknowledge the deeply troubling crisis still unfolding in Ukraine. It's a time of great concern for all of us, and it is simply devastating to see the impact it's having on the lives of so many people. As always, our primary focus is the safety and well-being of our teammates and their communities, and we remain hopeful for a peaceful resolution soon.\nNow turning to our Q3 performance. More than 2 years since the start of the pandemic, our teams continue to prove their ability to operate through volatility while also staying focused on the long term. And we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It's clear that our strategy is working, with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation and proven operational playbook, we stay in the lead and continue to drive further competitive separation.\nI'm proud of our results this quarter. We met and even exceeded what we said we would deliver 90 days ago. For Q3, our revenue growth was 5%, led by double-digit growth in NIKE Direct. This success, amidst the dynamic macroeconomic environment, is what continues to give us confidence in our long-term outlook and it's why I would not trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Our investments are making us stronger and we're excited by what we see as we execute against our growth opportunities.\nAs a team, we're driven by our shared purpose to move the world forward through the power of sport. And earlier this month, we released our fiscal '21 impact report. This report, which marks our 20th year reporting on our environmental and social impact is our first since we set new quantifiable ESG targets last year. We're focused on a wide range of priorities from building a diverse, inclusive team and culture, to meeting the challenges of climate change, to helping kids access the joy of play and movements. I encourage all of you to learn more about the measurable progress we've made at purpose.nike.com as we continue to create long-term value by shaping a better future through sport.\nAnd of course, 2022 isn't just an anniversary for our impact report. It's also a big year for NIKE itself. This May, NIKE will be celebrating our 50th anniversary as a company. 50 years ago, our journey began with a dream to serve athletes, and today, we're humbled by what we've achieved and we're thrilled and excited by what's to come.\nLooking at Q3, NIKE's growth was and it will continue to be the result of 3 areas I'll touch on today: first, connecting with consumers through our strong portfolio of brands; second, driving a relentless flow of new product innovation; and third, expanding our digital advantage to create the marketplace of the future.\nSo let's start with NIKE's strong brand and our connection to sport, which differentiates us all over the world. NIKE's connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. And our roster of athletes is second to none. Rafael Nadal made history by becoming the first male tennis player to win 21 majors with his victory at the Australian Open, and he now stands alone at the top of the men's game.\nAaron Donald, Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. led the L.A. Rams to a thrilling Super Bowl victory. And in the NBA All-Star game, a face-off between Team LeBron and Team KD ended with LeBron hitting the game winner. I was able to attend the game and I loved getting to see the league showcase of its 75th anniversary team. It was just an awesome reminder of the power of sport and what sport has meant to so many of us over the years.\nThe quarter also saw the Winter Olympics and Paralympics produce some extraordinary athletic performances. Nathan Chen won gold for the U.S. in the men's singles figure skating. And Chloe Kim won gold in the U.S. in the half-pipe, making her the first woman to win 2 gold medals in the event. And throughout the Olympics, our Never Done brand campaign was awesome. In Greater China, it featured snowboarder Cai Xuetong, and it saw an incredible response in that geo with over 6.1 billion impressions.\nAnd we're also in the middle of an amazing March Madness with NIKE, Inc. having more teams still alive across the men's and women's brackets than all other brands combined. But there's 1 familiar face to the Sweet 16 I want to acknowledge. As you know, Mike Krzyzewski is coaching in his final season at Duke, having already announced his retirement as the winningest coach in NCAA men's basketball history. Coach K has been a member of the NIKE family for nearly 30 years, and his leadership and clear set of values have meant so much to this company and to me personally.\nMy leadership role models have always been head coaches, leaders that serve their players, serve their programs and serve a broader cause, and Coach K has been right up there at the top of that list. So from the entire NIKE family, happy retirement, coach.\nThis was also a quarter where the world was reminded of how the NIKE Brand drives the culture around sport. In January, Sotheby's auctioned off 200 pairs of the Louis Vuitton Air Force 1 by Virgil Abloh and reported that it set the record for the most valuable sneaker and fashion auction ever at more than $25 million, with all proceeds going to Virgil Abloh's Post-modern Scholarship Fund. The auction drew the most bidders of any auction in Sotheby's history and was their most valuable charity auction over the past decade. It's simply another reminder of how the NIKE Brand, our most iconic product franchises and our partnerships, can come together for the kind of power and cultural energy and excitement that only NIKE can create.\nIn fact, that power was also felt in one of the biggest stages of the quarter. During the halftime show of the Super Bowl, in front of the largest U.S. TV audience of the last 5 years, we saw NIKE Jordan and Converse footwear all on stage during the performance, which was simply an incredible moment for our portfolio of brands. Our portfolio is one of our best competitive advantages, fueling energy to consumers worldwide.\nAnd we also connect that energy to consumers through the investments we make. Driven by our commitment to women's sport, this quarter, we furthered our 25-year commitment to the WNBA by becoming an equity investor in the league. We'll work together to deepen WNBA's storytelling and bring more girls into basketball at the local level. The consumer response to our long-standing commitment has been clear. This season, we sold more WNBA jerseys on nike.com on launch day alone than we did over the entire previous year. And this is just simply the latest example of how driving the sport of basketball to a new generation of fans connects us to a vast market with plenty of growth ahead.\nAs you know, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. And our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition. And we don't just create new franchises, we grow them to global scale. Take a look at FlyEase. We've talked before about our hands-free accessibility line, and we're excited by our work to scale this innovation across our entire portfolio.\nHere's just 3 examples from Q3. As part of the Metal Stan look for the Team USA, Olympians and Paralympians, we designed the ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot, FlyEase's first crossover into our celebrated outdoor ACG line. And FlyEase also moved into Converse for the first time with the Chuck Taylor All Star CX FlyEase, as Converse now joins NIKE and Jordan in adding the hands-free innovation to footwear icons. And in kids, where helping make spontaneous play easy is one of our goals, the new Dynamo Go uses FlyEase to help kids quickly get their shoes on and off. Dynamo Go debuted in Japan, Korea and Greater China to become one of the season's top 5 sellers, and we have a North America launch scheduled for April.\nBy driving impact across platforms, our work to scale FlyEase catalyzes growth. We expect FlyEase to be roughly $0.25 billion business by fiscal next year, with vast opportunity for even greater growth and value to come.\nLooking at performance innovation. In Q3, we launched the ZoomX Streakfly, our lightest road racing shoe yet. The Streakfly offers an engineered knit upper and responsive ZoomX midsole, all designed for speed in the middle distances. Also in running, the Pegasus 38 saw very strong sell-through in the quarter, continuing the Peg's lineage as one of our powerhouse franchises.\nAnd we're also always innovating in apparel. I mentioned the Olympics earlier. The hockey jersey worn by our federations, including the U.S. and Canada, were designed using brand-new 4D body mapping technology from our NIKE Sports Research Lab. This 4D body mapping, which gives our teams a fast, accurate and high detailed way to design, offers a hint of the future as we stay focused on bringing new technology into our growth opportunity in apparel.\nAnd last but not least, we continue to set the standard for sustainable product creation. A few weeks ago, we announced the NIKE ISPA Link, a new proprietary platform where shoes are built with interlocking modules and they're connected without any glue. From a manufacturing standpoint, ISPA Link is revolutionary in its simplicity. One pair takes about 8 minutes to assemble, a fraction of the time needed for a traditional sneaker. And it doesn't require energy-intensive processes like heating, cooling and conveyor belt systems. So with no sacrifice to comfort or stability, the ISPA Link will be available at retail in June and we can't wait for consumers to give it a try.\nNow let's move to the marketplace as we align our business to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers. Our marketplace strategy is a growth strategy, and it's driven by the consumer, fueled by their expectations of a consistent, seamless and premium shopping experience. Our approach begins with the understanding that consumers expect us to know who they are regardless of channel, online or offline, across the full array of mono brand stores, NIKE Digital and our wholesale partners.\nOur wholesale partners continue to play a very important role in our marketplace strategy, so let me start there. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership model that makes real our vision to give consumers personalized experiences regardless of channel. It gives shoppers the benefits of NIKE membership to unlock exclusive offers, products and experiences in partner stores. And it also recognizes the importance of onboarding members in stores, which in turn accelerates in-store conversion and improve customer lifetime value.\nThis quarter, we extended this model globally, including 2 new connected partners in Greater China, Topsports, Pou Sheng. This is an exciting step on our journey within our marketplace strategy because it continues to prove how powerful it is when brands and retailers work together for the benefit of consumers. We value the strong strategic relationships we have with our partners, particularly through our shared vision of connected data and inventory. And this approach lets us serve consumers with the greatest access to the best of NIKE and to do so with speed and convenience in a more personalized, engaging and sustainable way.\nAnd what's more, in Greater China, this partnership model takes us into a new era of marketplace transformation. Moving forward, all of our existing contracts with our NSP partners in the geo will follow this connected membership model. And over time, we plan to convert all partner mono brand stores into digitally connected NIKE retail concepts as we unlock the benefits of data and inventory across the Greater China marketplace. We're excited by the promise of this new model, and we strongly believe it will elevate the entire marketplace and drive growth for both NIKE and our partners over the long term.\nNext, let's dig a little deeper into our growing digital advantage. As we create the future of retail, we build on our own digital capabilities that connect and serve consumers at scale. In Q3, digital revenue was up 22% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to drive greater competitive separation, particularly through our app ecosystem. The NIKE mobile app was up more than 50% in the quarter and overtook Nike.com on mobile for our highest share of digital demand.\nAnd SNKRS continues to gain momentum, particularly as its strong consumer engagement leads to improved conversion. The live streaming on SNKRS remains incredibly popular with new features continuously coming online. For instance, we started to drop product launches within live streams, which helps lead our audience to quadruple since our live streaming began last fiscal year. And in December, the AJ11 Cool Grey launch on SNKRS was the largest for a single style in the history of NIKE Direct.\nWe drove this unprecedented demand by engaging with consumers in new ways, including leveraging Snapchat's Try On lens, a #InMyJs Instagram activation and a Fortnite partnership with custom skins and a digital scavenger hunt. Looking forward, we're excited about the opportunity for SNKRS to continue to explore new dimensions and experiences like live streaming and to do so particularly for women's product and for apparel. More to come here soon as we continue to use digital to engage all consumers in ways that integrate culture, commerce, sport and innovation.\nAnd at the same time, our growing participation in new digital platforms lets us create innovative ways to connect with consumers, letting them unlock virtual experiences, products and rewards as we expand access points to NIKE across the digital ecosystem. For instance, to celebrate the Super Bowl, we collaborated with EA Sports, giving NIKE members who ran 5 miles in our Nike Run Club rewards and unlocks within the Madden game. Members had to link accounts between NIKE and EA to join the challenge, representing the first incidence of account linking with our gaming partners.\nThe number of new members we acquired surpassed our expectations. And the framework we developed with EA Sports will allow future membership connects to come to life even more efficiently with new partners. And we expect that this, in turn, will lead to increased engagement, membership and revenue growth down the line.\nAnd during NBA All-Star Week, LeBron visited NIKELAND on Roblox to inspire its community towards physical movement in play. On the NIKELAND court, LeBron coached and engaged with players, and participants were rewarded for physical gameplay with the ability to unlock virtual products. Since its launch, a total of 6.7 million players from 224 countries have visited NIKELAND on Roblox. And we plan to continue driving energy there with virtual products like LeBron 19 styles special to Roblox.\nIn addition, we announced NIKE Virtual Studios this quarter, following our acquisition of RTFKT. With NIKE Virtual Studios, our vision is to take our best-in-class experiences in digital and build Web 3 products and experiences to scale this community so that NIKE and our members can create, share and benefit together. In Q3, RTFKT released the first official NIKE-branded NFT, our first step into the world of digital product creation. We're pleased by the positive momentum and energy we're already seeing in the space, and we're excited by the future as we continue to extend our digital leadership in the industry.\nIn the end, NIKE is doing what we always do. We are staying on the offense. Our confidence as we look long term hasn't changed one bit. We've been resolute in fueling innovation and our brand is as strong as ever. NIKE's unique strengths continue to set the pace and keep us in the lead. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\n\nMatthew Friend\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NIKE, Inc.\n\nThank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE has become more agile, responsive and resilient over the past 2 years through the operational capabilities and playbook that we have developed to navigate the unexpected. This past quarter, the operating environment shifted rapidly as the latest COVID variant presented new challenges to business operations. And our teams around the world were prepared to do what was necessary to continue to serve the consumer.\nOur ability to optimize near-term performance through heightened levels of volatility while continuing to make strategic progress on Consumer Direct Acceleration reinforces NIKE's positioning as a portfolio of leading brands with unlimited potential. Marketplace demand continues to significantly exceed available inventory supply, with a healthy pull market across our geographies. When inventory supply is available in region, we are quickly moving it to the appropriate channels to serve consumer demand.\nConsumers continue to shift towards digital to find the products they love, and NIKE's digital experience continues to build deep consumer connections and capture digital market share. Now let me briefly update on the supply chain. All factories in Vietnam are operational, with total footwear and apparel production in line with pre-closure volumes and our forward-looking demand plans. Nearly all of our supplier base is operational without restrictions, and we are working closely with our partners around the world to navigate through the most recent risks related to COVID.\nInventory supply in our geographies is beginning to improve from here. Transit times, however, remain elevated. And in the case of North America, transit times in the third quarter have worsened. We have taken numerous actions to address these challenges, and in many cases, to protect against lead times increasing even further. Despite these ongoing challenges, we have been able to mitigate our transit delay impact by nearly 4 weeks versus industry averages. I am so proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment.\nNow consumer demand for all 3 of our brands, NIKE, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly strong. Our growth in the third quarter would have been even higher if we had greater quantities of available inventory to meet marketplace demand. Across the marketplace, holiday retail sales finished strong, and spring retail sales are off to a great start, fueled by strong demand for performance men's running, Air Jordan 1, classics footwear and our apparel fleece franchises. We are also sustaining a higher full-price mix with year-over-year improvement in markdown activity.\nNIKE Digital has seen improvement in conversion rates and lower customer returns despite having lower levels of available inventory in our most desired product franchises. And in Greater China, we saw improvement in full price realization versus the prior season. Speaking of product, we continue to refresh and reimagine our most iconic franchises through design, collaboration and creative storytelling. We are expanding the contribution of our express lane in all geographies to make more locally relevant product on shorter lead times, yielding higher rates of sell-through and profitability for NIKE and our partners.\nWe continue to deliver a consistent flow of product innovation in performance sports like running, basketball and training and through platforms like ZoomX, FlyEase and with the (inaudible) Our product is our most valuable form of demand creation, and we have a highly loyal and engaged audience eager to share in the stories we have to tell around our athletes and products.\nThis quarter, the NIKE Brand registered as both the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world. Recent product announcements ranging from our collaboration with Drake on the Knock the Line of apparel and sneakers, to the Ted Lasso-AFC Richmond kits for the show's third season speaks to the depth of our cultural reach. Our brands live at the intersection of sport, media, music and increasingly, technology, enabling us to be highly relevant to today's youth.\nAs I've said repeatedly over the past year, NIKE's market opportunity is larger than ever. Consumer interest in sport, health and well-being has never been greater. And consumers' desire to wear athletic inspired footwear and apparel in more moments of their lives is here to stay. NIKE will always be a growth company, fueled through innovation to help all athletes achieve their full potential.\nNow continuing with the theme of growth, John said earlier that our marketplace strategy is a growth strategy. And so I'd like to go a little deeper on where we are in our journey to create the marketplace of the future, including how we have managed our wholesale portfolio. Over the past 4 years, we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts worldwide by more than 50% while delivering strong revenue growth through NIKE Direct and our remaining wholesale partners.\nWe are now moving into the next phase of our marketplace strategy. We have finished communicating the big account pivots. And our go-forward growth plans are aligned with our wholesale partners. Wholesale partners play an integral role in our future marketplace, first, to authenticate our brands and then to create scale of distribution through a consistent consumer experience across a larger retail footprint. We will drive healthy wholesale growth with our remaining wholesale partners and recapture dislocated demand by elevating our partner's retail environment and digitally connecting NIKE membership with their retail experience.\nTake, for example, our collaboration with James Whitner's Whitaker Group, owner of Social Status and other sneaker boutiques. We recently partnered with The Whitaker Group to develop unique silhouettes of Jordan and Dunk products as well as produce SNKRS live content to connect our brand to important communities. We are committed to driving growth with partners like this as they create authentic, deeply connected consumer concepts in key cities and communities around the world.\nNIKE Digital continues to be our fastest-growing component of the marketplace. This quarter, downloads of the NIKE mobile app accelerated, and member buying frequency and average order values improved again as we continue to test member engagement across activity, content, community and commerce. In Q3, NIKE Digital gained 3 points from the prior year and now represents 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenue.\nWe're investing in NIKE stores to specifically address gaps in distribution to serve the growth opportunities we see in women's apparel and Jordan. Our NIKE Live concept is showing promising levels of productivity per square foot, store profitability and new member acquisition. We continue to obsess over the consumer experience and perfect the concept for her to maximize the incremental growth opportunity in the marketplace.\nWe will also begin testing a Jordan-only concept in North America in fiscal '23, leveraging a popular consumer experience that has been wildly successful in Greater China, the Philippines and Korea. Our approach is to first pilot these new concepts, iterate and perfect, and then move to scale. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen how creating the marketplace of the future will deepen our connections with consumers, fuel marketplace growth and expand the profit pool for NIKE and our wholesale partners.\nNow let me turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 5% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis, led by 17% growth in NIKE Direct. Wholesale returned to growth, up 1% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Digital grew 22%, fueled by strong demand through our NIKE app. NIKE-owned stores grew 14% with significant improvements in traffic during the quarter.\nGross margin increased 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins due to lower markdowns, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a higher full price mix, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs. SG&A grew 13% versus the prior year, primarily due to strategic technology investments, normalization of investment against brand campaigns, wage-related expenses and digital marketing investment to fuel heightened digital demand. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4% compared to 11.4% for the same period last year. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix, effects of stock-based compensation and recently finalized U.S. tax regulations. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.87.\nNow let's review the operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 9% and EBIT was flat. NIKE continued to drive momentum through key product franchises across men's, women's and kids. This was highlighted by double-digit growth in key men's running franchises like Pegasus as well as updates on franchises like the Wind Flow and Zamira. NIKE Direct grew 27% versus the prior year, led by NIKE Digital delivering industry-leading growth, increasing 33% versus the prior year, driven by double-digit growth in traffic, strong growth in new members and member engagement and improvements in member buying frequency.\nNIKE Digital in North America now has the highest penetration of all the geographies, representing 1/3 of total North America revenue in the quarter. NIKE-owned stores grew 16% due to traffic improving towards pre-pandemic levels and successful activations in key cities during moments like the Super Bowl in L.A. North America continues to experience strong full price realization and low markdown rates across the marketplace as inventory supply begins to improve.\nNIKE-owned inventory levels increased 22% versus the prior year, with in-transit inventory now representing 65% of total inventory at the end of the quarter, as transit times are now more than 6 weeks longer than pre-pandemic levels and 2 weeks longer than the same period in the prior year. In order to ensure the right assortment of products arrive on time for the fall selling season, we have moved forward our buying time lines to accommodate for longer transit times.\nIn EMEA, Q3 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all consumer segments, and EBIT grew 34% on a reported basis. Retail sales across the marketplace grew strong double digits with improvements in full price realization and lower average markdown rates. Team sports continues to make its comeback and the continuation of the Champions League tournament enabled global football to drive energy across the region. The momentum behind the Jordan brand in EMEA is also driving strong growth across all consumer segments, led by women's.\nNIKE Direct grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis, led by growth in NIKE-owned stores of 44% as we compare to uneven store closures due to COVID-related government restrictions in the prior year. NIKE Digital rose 11%, fueled by member-only access and app-exclusive releases and another quarter of strong double-digit growth in full price demand. Wholesale revenue grew 10%, led by even stronger growth rates from our strategic accounts.\nAs John mentioned in his remarks, we remain focused on the safety and well-being of our teammates regarding the deeply troubling crisis unfolding in Ukraine. Our own stores and digital commerce operations remain paused in Russia and Ukraine. As a note, our business in both countries represent less than 1% of total company revenue.\nIn Greater China, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 19% on a reported basis. Our results for this quarter were in line with our expectations, with sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. As we continued rebuilding local brand activities again this quarter, NIKE was rated the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in China, creating separation and distinction versus the competition.\nAnd as I said earlier, we are observing continued improvement in full price realization. Greater China delivered over $2 billion in revenue this quarter, driven by the Lunar New Year period as Nike.com saw record weekly traffic. We leveraged our Express Lane capabilities to design hyperlocal products with the Year of the Tiger elements, resulting in strong sell-through across men's, women's, kids and Jordan. Speaking of Jordan, the brand had a record quarter for revenue in the region, growing versus the prior year through momentum in both footwear and apparel.\nNIKE Direct was down 11% on a currency-neutral basis, with declines in both digital and physical retail channels. COVID-related lockdowns continue to create challenges for retail traffic. NIKE-owned stores were down 5% and Digital declined 19% due to the ongoing supply delays that negatively impacted timing of product launches. We created marketplace energy with the opening of NIKE Beijing, the first connected partner-operated (inaudible) and 2 new doors that set consecutive records for global opening sales.\nOur relentless focus on sport, product innovation and our most iconic product franchises, combined with local athlete storytelling, remains a competitive advantage for us in Greater China. We are closely monitoring the current situation regarding the virus, but we are encouraged by the momentum we are building in the marketplace.\nNow moving to APLA. Q3 revenue grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 17% on a reported basis. This quarter was the largest and most profitable in the history of the APLA region. We saw double-digit currency-neutral growth across nearly all territories led by Korea, Mexico and We're winning with the consumer and sport across performance and lifestyle, demonstrated by strong growth in running, fitness, Jordan and Classics.\nNIKE Direct grew 39%, led by NIKE Digital growth of 61% due to record-setting member days across a number of territories, delivering more than 2.5x the demand versus a typical week. NIKE-owned stores grew 17% while the wholesale channel grew 9%. Our focus on localized product and content, particularly the launch of our Kwondo 1 collaboration with K-Pop star G-Dragon demonstrated yet again our deep connection to consumers. It was APLA's biggest hyperlocal launch ever, reaching 91 million users on social and 3.8 million entries across SNKRS and our marketplace partners.\nNow let's turn to our financial outlook. We continue to expect revenue for the full year to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year. As you know, comparing quarters to prior periods has not been intuitive, so we continue to look at the size, trend and health of our business, market share and profitability relative to pre-pandemic periods, and we remain confident we are on track towards our long-term financial goals.\nSpecifically for the fourth quarter, in North America, we expect a decline in revenue due to year-over-year comparisons. And in Greater China, we expect to see another quarter of sequential improvement while we closely monitor the operational impact related to recent COVID lockdowns. We now expect gross margin to expand by at least 150 basis points versus the prior year as strong consumer demand continues to fuel high levels of full price realization, low markdown rates and low customer returns.\nBenefits of strategic pricing expected in Q4 are being partially offset by elevated product costs, primarily due to higher macro input costs, supply chain costs and strategic actions to expedite delivery of product in North America. Despite the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we continue to expect foreign exchange to be a 55 basis point tailwind versus the prior year. We now expect SG&A to grow mid-teens for the full year as our spend normalizes, and we continue to advance our capabilities to support our ongoing digital transformation. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the low teens for the fiscal year.\nAnd as we look ahead to fiscal '23, we are optimistic as our brand strength is unparalleled with a strong product pipeline and momentum against our largest growth drivers. Marketplace demand continues to exceed available supply as inventory supply begins to normalize in the fourth quarter, against the context of a healthy pull market, setting the foundation for another year of strong growth. We are focused on what we can control while there are several new dynamics creating higher levels of volatility. As a result, we will provide more specific financial guidance for fiscal '23 during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nIn closing, our strategy is working. NIKE's brand strength and consumer demand remains at an all-time high and we are confident in our business momentum. Our deep focus on the consumer and sport is what sets us apart from the rest. We continue to leverage the same principles for how we are strategically and financially managing the company. And as we approach our 50-year anniversary, we are reminded of NIKE's rich history of delivering consistent results even through periods of uncertainty as we build NIKE for the future. With that, let's open up the call for questions.",

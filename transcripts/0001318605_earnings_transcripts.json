M Central time in the update deck, we published at the same link as this webcast.\n\nDuring this call we will discuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.\n\nEvents or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties.\n\n[noise] uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.\n\nWe urge shareholders to read our definitive proxy statement, which contains important information about the matters to be voted on at the 2025 annual meeting.\n\nDuring the question and answer portion of today's call. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.\n\nBefore we jump into Q&A Elon has some opening remarks Elon.\n\nThank you Ware.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe're at a critical inflection point for Tesla and our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world.\n\nI think it's important to emphasize that because it really is the leader in real World AI.\n\nNo one can do what we can do with real world AI.\n\nI have pretty good insight into high AI in general I think that Tesla has the highest intelligence Betsy of any AI out there in the car.\n\nAnd that is only going to get better.\n\nAnd we're really just at the beginning of scaling Adam quite massively full self driving and robo taxi and fundamentally changing the nature of transport having people just don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will.\n\nTake off.\n\nWhere the it's honestly, it's going be like a shockwave.\n\nSo.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's.\n\nYeah, because it because the cars are all out there.\n\nYou know there are millions of cars out there.\n\nThat's where the software update become.\n\nFull self driving cars.\n\nAnd.\n\nAnd you know we're making.\n\nA couple of million a year.\n\nAnd in fact with the advent of with what we see now is as a clarity on.\n\nAchieving full self driving unsupervised full self driving I should say.\n\nI.\n\nI feel confident in expanding Tesla's production.\n\nSo that is that is our intent to.\n\nExpand as quickly as we can our future production.\n\nSo I was curious since do that until we have clarity on.\n\nAchieving.\n\nUnsupervised full self driving but at this point I feel like we've got clarity and it makes sense too.\n\nExpand production as fast as we reasonably can.\n\nWe're also making huge.\n\nMake vacation impact on the energy sector with.\n\nWith battery storage.\n\nSo with both the power wall, and especially with the Mega pack.\n\nWe are dramatically improving the.\n\nThe ability to.\n\nGenerate more energy from the grid.\n\nLet me sort of talk a little bit about that which is.\n\nIf you look at total U S energy.\n\nOkay. Buddy for example, there's roughly a terawatt of Gov.\n\nContinuous power available in the U S. But the average usage over a 24 hour cycle is only half of terawatt because of that.\n\nDifferent screen, they're not usage.\n\nIf you bought for the buffer the energy with batteries you can effectively double the energy output in United States, just with batteries building no incremental power plants.\n\nAnd it's very difficult to build pipelines.\n\nSo they take a long time, there's a lot of permitting that's not.\n\nAn industry that's used to moving fast so.\n\nWe see the potential therefore Tesla battery packs.\n\nTwo.\n\nLately improve the.\n\nThe energy output per year for any given grid U S or otherwise.\n\nWe're also on the cusp of a.\n\nIf something really tremendous with Optimus.\n\nWhich I think.\n\nIt's likely to be or has potential to be the biggest product of all time.\n\nAnd.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's difficult project.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not like it's just automatic.\n\nI'm unaware of any robot program by a Ford.\n\nFord or GM or by U S sort of car companies.\n\nMaybe think of Tesla as a car company were mostly make cars.\n\nAnd battery packs.\n\nBut.\n\nSo it's not like it's not just like an obvious falloff of lug thing to make Optimus, but.\n\nBut we do have the ingredients.\n\nWith real World AI.\n\nAnd exceptional electrical mechanical engineering capabilities.\n\nAntibodies scale production.\n\nWhich I don't think anyone else has all of those ingredients.\n\nSo.\n\nYes.\n\nWith version 14 of.\n\nThe Oh self driving which people you can see the reactions of people online.\n\nBut I'm quite amazed.\n\nIt actually than anyone in the U S can get.\n\nIn 2014.\n\nGo and select.\n\nThe advanced software in their car, so if you're listening right now and you'd like to try it out just going.\n\nAnd settings, and say I want to be advanced software and you'll get version 14.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd yes so.\n\nOn the front.\n\nUnveiled Mega block three mm. We also have exciting plans for Omega pack for Omega pack four will incorporate a lot of the.\n\nOkay.\n\nA lot of what is normally in a substation.\n\nAnd be able to output.\n\nHi.\n\nAt.\n\nProbably 35 kilovolt.\n\nDirectly so this.\n\nGreatly improves our ability to deploy mega pack, because it's not dependent on building.\n\nOur substation of 335 kv Omega pipe for so that that'll be thanks.\n\nThat's the best the engineering priority for.\n\nMega pack.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd.\n\nWe look forward to unveiling octopus b three.\n\nProbably in Q1, I think it'll be ready for.\n\nSo to show off.\n\nAnd.\n\nI don't think it's going to be quite remarkable.\n\nIf you would even seem like a robot it will seem like a person in the robot suite, which is kind of how we started off with autonomous.\n\nIt will seem so real.\n\nThat you'll need to like.\n\nOkay, I think to believe that it's actually a robot.\n\nAnd obviously like the real World intelligence, where devote.\n\nDeveloped for the car.\n\nMost of that transfers to optimize or so.\n\nIt's a very good starting point.\n\nIn conclusion.\n\nWe're excited about the updated mission of Tesla, which is sustainable abundance.\n\nSo going beyond sustainable energy to say sustain.\n\nSustainable abundance as the mission where.\n\nWe believe with.\n\nWith Optimus and self driving.\n\nThat's a you can actually create a world where there is.\n\nNo poverty.\n\nWhere everyone has access to the finance medical care.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat Optimists will be an incredible surgeon.\n\nFor example.\n\nI'd imagine that everyone had access to an incredible surgeon.\n\nSo so I think there is.\n\nNow of course, we would make sure optimists as safe and everything but.\n\nBut I do think we're headed for a world of sustainable abundance.\n\nAnd I'm excited to work with Tesla team to make that happen.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much Elon.\n\nWe also have some opening remarks.\n\nThanks Thomas.\n\nQ2 was a special quarter at multiple levels, we set new records not just for deliveries in deployments, but also around a range of financial metrics from total revenues and gross profit margins to free cash flow.\n\nThis was the result of continued confidence of our customers and our products and the relentless efforts by the Tesla team.\n\nThe strength in deliveries was attributed to strong performance across all regions into China, and APAC were up sequentially 33, and 29% respectively. North America was up 28%, while EMEA was up 25%.\n\nThe base in deliveries was the function of continued excitement around the new model y.\n\nWe have previously talked about 20 to 25 being the year of the why and have since delivered on that promise with the new model wise at least in Q1, followed my model Y long wheel base and performance and more recently standard why in North America and EMEA.\n\nWe are now operating a robo taxi in two markets Austin and most bay area cities.\n\nWe've already expanded our coverage area in Austin three times since the initial launch and are on pace to continue expanding further.\n\nUnlike our competitors.\n\nSee fleet blends in the markets, we operate and since they don't have extra sensors that's.\n\nI'll play defense, which make them stick out.\n\nThis is an underappreciated aspect of our current wake offerings, which are all designed for autonomous driving.\n\nFeel that his experience.\n\nAs people experience the supervisor FSD at scale the demand for vehicles like Elon said would increase significantly.\n\nOn the SSD adoption front.\n\nContinue to see decent progress.\n\nI would note that total paid SSD customer base is still small around 12% of our current fleet.\n\nWe're moving we're working with regulators in places like China, and then we have to obtain approvals. So that we can get efficacy in those regions as well.\n\nNow covering a little bit on the financial side.\n\nAutomotive revenues increased 29% sequentially in line with the growth in deliveries.\n\nWhile regulatory cause its declined sequentially.\n\nWe entered into new contracts and continued delivery on previously entered contacts.\n\nOur automotive margins, excluding credits increased marginally from 15% to $15, four which was attributed to improvements in material cost and better fixed cost absorption due to higher volumes.\n\nOur energy storage business continued to deliver with record deployment gross profit and margins.\n\nAs discussed before this business has a bigger impact from tariffs as measured by a percentage of Cogs.\n\nSince currently all self procured from China, while we're still working on other alternatives.\n\nS.\n\nThe ramp of my guess factory Shanghai is happening this is helping us a lot of tenants because we are using this factory to supply the non U S demand.\n\nLike Elon said, you know good scale storage.\n\nThe only way we can get to electricity fastest is by using storage.\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is we are seeing headwinds in this business given the e&ps and competition and tests.\n\nThe total tariff impacts for Q3 for both businesses was in excess of $400 million generally split evenly between them.\n\nSo this is another demonstrated a marked improvement sequentially. This was a function of improvements primarily in our insurance and service center businesses.\n\nNote that while small are what actually costs are included within services. Another along with our other businesses like pay supercharging used car parts and merchandise sales et cetera.\n\nOur operating expenses increased sequentially.\n\nThe largest increase included in restructuring and other related to certain actions undertaken to reduce cost and improve efficiency to convergence. So far yeah, yeah chip design efforts.\n\nItaly, being legal expenses related to proceedings, and certain legal cases, as well as incremental costs incurred.\n\nIn preparation for our shareholder meeting such costs are recorded within SG&A.\n\nFurther our implied related spend is increasing especially in R&D as Ian recently granted various performance based equity awards to employees working on AI initiatives and of course that spend will continue to increase going forward.\n\nOn the other income or other income decreased sequentially, primarily from mark to market adjustments on BTC holdings, which was much smaller gain of $80 million in Q3 versus $284 million in Q2, but the rest of the movement attributable to FX movements in the quarter.\n\nOur free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $4 billion, which was yet another record.\n\nOur total cash and investments at the end of the quarter were over 41 billion.\n\nOn the Capex front, while we are expecting to be around 9 billion for the current year.\n\nWe're projecting the numbers to increase substantially in 2026 as we prepare the company for the next phase of growth in terms of not just the existing businesses, but not bets around initiatives, including Optimus.\n\nIn conclusion, not that binging, yeah into real World is hot.\n\nBut we have never shied away from doing what is hot.\n\nWe are extremely excited about the future.\n\nLaying down the foundation, the benefits of which will be realized or years to come.\n\nI would like to end by thanking the Tesla team our customers, our investors and support us for the continued belief in us.\n\nThank you very much my boss now, let's go to investor questions.\n\nDot com. The first question is what are the latest robo taxi metrics fleet size cumulative miles rides completed intervention rates and when will safety driver he removed.\n\nWhat are the obstacles still preventing unsupervised FSD from being deployed to customer vehicles.\n\nI'll start off with that and then shot can elaborate.\n\nBut.\n\nWe are expecting to.\n\nI have no safety drivers and at least.\n\nLarge parts of Austin by the end of this year. So within a few months, we expect to have no safety drivers.\n\nAt all.\n\nEastern parts, Boston, we're obviously being very cautious about.\n\nThe deployment so.\n\nSo our goal is to actually be paranoid about deployment, because obviously, even one accident will be front page headline news worldwide.\n\nSo.\n\nYes, that's better for us to take a cautious approach here.\n\nBut we do expect to have no no safe drivers in the car.\n\nAnd Austin.\n\nWithin a few months.\n\nI think that's perhaps the most important.\n\nAt a point and then we do expect to be operating.\n\nRobo taxi.\n\nIn.\n\nI think about.\n\nEight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year.\n\nIt depends on.\n\nThere is regulatory approvals.\n\nAnd but you can actually I think most of our regulatory applications or online you can kind of see them because they're public information.\n\nBut we expect to be operating in Nevada, and Florida and Arizona.\n\nBy the end of the year.\n\nSure.\n\nYes, we are continuing to operate our.\n\nfleet in Austin.\n\nIn the driver's seat.\n\nI would call it more than a quarter million lines.\n\nAnd then in the Bay area.\n\nThe person that I have received the recognition.\n\nMore than a million miles.\n\nSo and we continue to see that the feet.\n\nIt looks really bad that's what they're really happy.\n\nAnd there's no notable issues on the customer side yet.\n\nprovides for a total of 6 billion miles.\n\nYesterday.\n\nSo that's like a big milestone and all these empty continues to be very good and I think you mentioned.\n\nAre on track to do more of the person from inside the car altogether, starting with Boston.\n\nGreat.\n\nThe next question is what is the demand and backlog for Mega pack power wall solar or energy storage systems with the current AI done.\n\nIs tesla playing to supply power to other hyperscale or.\n\nDemand for makeup back in power wall continues to be really strong into next year. We received very strong positive customer feedback on our Mega Black Mega block product, which will begin shipping next year not a houston.\n\nAnd we're seeing remarkable growth in the demand for AI and data center applications as Hyperscale and utilities have seen the versatility of the Mega pack product.\n\nTo increase reliability and received and relieve grid constraints as you'd want us talking about.\n\nWe've also seen a surge in residential solar demand in the U S. Due to policy changes, which we expect to continue into the first half of 2026.\n\nWe introduced a new solar lease product.\n\nAnd we also began production of our test of residential solar panel and our Buffalo factory, and we will be shipping that to customers starting in Q1 the.\n\nThe panel has industry, leading aesthetics and shade performance and demonstrates our continued commitment to U S manufacturing.\n\nGreat. Thank you Mike.\n\nAnd Unfortunately, the next question is related to future products. This is not the appropriate venue to cover that so we're going to have to skip it.\n\nThe question after that is what does it present challenges in bringing optimists to market considering App control software engineering hardware training General mobility models training task specific models training voice models implementing manufacturing and establishing supply chains.\n\nYes, I mean, bringing office after Mr market is an incredibly difficult task to be clear, it's not like some walk in the park.\n\nAt some point I mean at this actually technically octopus can walk in the park right now.\n\nAnd we do have autonomous robots that.\n\nWalk around our offices at our engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, California.\n\nBasically 24 hours a day seven days a week.\n\nSo anybody that can buy you actually.\n\nYou can stop to stop one of the Optimus robots and ask him to take you somewhere and it'll literally take you to that meeting room or their location in the building.\n\nSo.\n\nI want to downplay the difficulty partners side.\n\nIt's an incredibly difficult thing, especially.\n\nDifficult to create a.\n\nAnd that is as dexterous and capable as the human hand, which is an incredible human hand is an incredible thing.\n\nThe more you studied the human hands the more incredible you realize the human hand is and why you need five four fingers and a thumb why the why the fingers have certain degrees.\n\nFreedom.\n\nYou know what why the various muscles are different strengths the fingers are a different lengths.\n\nAnd.\n\nIt turns out actually that all but those are all there for a reason.\n\nAnd.\n\nSo making it making it.\n\nThe hand and for them because most of that most of the accurate just like the human hands.\n\nMost of that to control your hand or actually primarily in your forum.\n\nOptimists hand, and forearm isn't it.\n\nIt'll be difficult engineering challenge.\n\nIt's I'd say it's that.\n\nMore difficult than the rest of from electromechanical standpoint, the forum in hand, it's more difficult than the entire rest of the robot.\n\nSo, but really in order to have it.\n\nA useful generalized robot.\n\nYou do need this you need incredible hand.\n\nAnd they need the real world AI.\n\nAnd you need to built to scale up that production.\n\nBut to have it be relevant because it's not relevant if it's just a few hundred robots.\n\nBut so you need to be able to make.\n\nAutonomous robots at volumes comparable to vehicles.\n\nIf not significantly higher.\n\nSo I'm trying to get a million of something you per year My attorney Mcmillian Artemis robust for your debt.\n\nManufacturing challenges immense considering that the supply chain doesn't exist.\n\nSo with with cars, you've got an existing supply chain with computers, you've got an existing supply chain with.\n\nWith a humanoid robot there is no supply chain.\n\nSo in order to manufacture that has actually has to be.\n\nBarry vertically integrated.\n\nAnd manufacturer.\n\nHum very deep into the supply chain manufacture the parts internally because there just is no supply chain.\n\nSo this is supposed to be kind of thing where I'm like if I put myself in a position of a startup trying to make and humanoid robot.\n\nI don't know how to do it without.\n\nAnd an immense amount of manufacturing technology.\n\n.\n\nSo.\n\nThat's why I think like Tesla is an almost unique I think I think unique position when you consider manufacturing technology scaling.\n\nReal World AI.\n\nAnd the and a truly dextrose hand.\n\nThose are the generally the things that I'm missing when you read about other robots that they just don't have those three things.\n\nSo I think we can.\n\nBut all those things those three things with an immense amount of work.\n\nAnd and that that is that is the game plan.\n\nSo.\n\nYeah My like my.\n\nNo fundamental concern with regard to.\n\nHow much voting control I Havent Tesla is if I go ahead and build this newest robot army can I just be outfit at some point in the future.\n\nThat's my biggest concern if I could.\n\nThat was really the only thing I'm trying to address with with this.\n\nWhat's called compensation, but it's not like I'm going to spend the money. It's just.\n\nSo if we build this robot army.\n\nDo I have at least.\n\nA strong influence over that robot.\n\nTrunk control, but a strong influence that's that's what it comes down to in a nutshell.\n\nLike I don't feel comfortable holding it robot on me if I don't have at least a strong influence.\n\nGreat. Thank you and we've already covered robo taxi expansion.\n\nUnfortunately, the question after that is another future product questions. So we're going to have to skip that.\n\nThe next one now is can you update us on the $16 $5 billion, Samsung chip deal and Taylor given the importance of semiconductors to autonomy and Tesla's AI driven future. What gives you confidence Samsung can fulfill AI six at Tesla timelines and achieve relatively better yields and cost versus T. S. T. S. M D.\n\nOkay, So I'm going to get quite a long answer to those question.\n\nCause cause unpack those question and then and then answer the Unpacked version.\n\nSo.\n\nFirst of all.\n\nI have nothing but great things to say about Samsung there.\n\nAmazing company.\n\nAnd Samsung it was worth noting.\n\nThis manufacturer.\n\nOur AI for computer and does a great job doing that.\n\nSo.\n\nNow with the.\n\nThe five mm and heroes.\n\nTo make a point of clarification relative to some comments I made publicly.\n\nBefore which is we're actually going to focus both TSMC and Samsung initially on AI five.\n\nSo.\n\nThe five chip designed by Tesla is.\n\nI think it's an amazing design.\n\nI have spent almost every weekend for last.\n\nLast few months.\n\nWith the chip design team.\n\nWorking on AI five.\n\nAnd.\n\nI don't hand out praise.\n\nEasily, but I have to say that I think I think that the.\n\nChip team has really.\n\nDesigning an incredible trip here this is by some metrics.\n\nYeah, if I have chip will be 40 times better than the AI fortunate not 40% 40 times.\n\nBecause we have a detailed understanding of the entire software and hardware stack. So we're designing the hardware too.\n\nAddress all of the pain points in software.\n\nSo I don't think that there really isn't anyone that's doing this I think the entire stack.\n\nAll the way through real World.\n\nCalibrating against the real World, where you've got cars and robust real world, but.\n\nWe know what the chip needs to do and we know what.\n\nJust as importantly, we know what the chip does it doesn't need to do.\n\nSort of.\n\nTo give you some examples here.\n\nWith a five.\n\nWe deleted b.\n\nThe legacy GPU or that or the traditional GPU, which is it's in AI for.\n\nBut AI five does not have.\n\nWe just just to leave it that the legacy GPU because it basically is a GPU.\n\nSo.\n\nWe also believe that the image signal processor.\n\nAnd.\n\nThis feels like a long list of.\n\nActually of deletions that are very important.\n\nAs a result of these deletions, we can actually put out five.\n\nAnd Ah have radical.\n\nAnd.\n\nWith with with good margin for the traces from the memory too that the trip.\n\nTesla trip accelerators.\n\nThe army the army CPU cores.\n\nAnd.\n\nAnd the PCI.\n\nSort of.\n\nThe PCI blocks so.\n\nThis this is a beautiful job.\n\nI've heard so much life energy cause shall personally.\n\nAnd I'm confident this will be this is going to be a winter next level.\n\nSo it makes sense to have.\n\nBoth Samsung and TSMC.\n\nOn five mm.\n\nSo you mean like the technically the.\n\nSamsung has slightly more advanced equipment, then they TSMC fab will be both be made in the.\n\nThe U S.\n\nTSMC in Arizona, Samsung in Texas.\n\nAnd a bit but it's.\n\nWe're gonna make starting off just to be competent of having.\n\nI called explicit goal was to have an oversupply of AI pipe chips.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause if we have too many F chips for the cars.\n\nAnd robots, we can always put them in the data center.\n\nSo we already use AI for.\n\nOr for training.\n\nOur data center, so we use a combination of airport and.\n\nNvidia hardware.\n\nSo.\n\nBut we're not about to replace and video to be clear, but we do use both.\n\nIn combination.\n\nAnd for video hardware.\n\nAnd there are five excess production, we can always put it in our data centers.\n\nAnd really it keeps it keeps improving.\n\nThe challenge that they have is that they've got to satisfy a large range.\n\nA lot of requirements from a lot of customers.\n\nTessa only has to satisfy requirements from one customer a tesla.\n\nThat makes the designs are all about it.\n\nEasier and means we can delete.\n\nA lot of complexity from the truth.\n\nLike I kind of set top boxes.\n\nSo like when you look at the various logic blocks in the chip.\n\nAs you increase the number of logic blocks, you will see an increase.\n\nInterconnections between logic blocks, which you can think of it like.\n\nThey're just highways like how many highways do you need to connect the various parts of the chip.\n\nAnd especially if you're not sure.\n\nHow much data is going to go between.\n\nEach.\n\nLogic block on the Chip then you kind of end up having tried highways going all over the place.\n\nIt's a very it's like it becomes almost impossibly difficult.\n\nDesign problem and Nvidia has done an amazing job of dealing with almost impossibly difficult set of requirements.\n\nBut in our case we.\n\nGreat for radical simplicity.\n\nAnd the net effect is that.\n\nI think and five will be.\n\nThe best performance per watt.\n\nMaybe by a factor of two or three.\n\nAnd the best performance per dollar for AI, maybe by a factor of 10.\n\nSo you know that's.\n\nYou know what we'll have to the proofs in the pudding. So obviously, we need to actually get this chip made.\n\nAnd made it scale.\n\nBut.\n\nThat's what it looks like.\n\nGreat. Thank you Elon.\n\nAlready covered unsupervised F S D.\n\nSo the next question is instead of trying to replace hardware three with hardware for why not give an equal incentive to trading for a new vehicle.\n\nYeah.\n\nNot completely given up on hardware.\n\nOur board last year, we offer the customers the option to transfer SSD to their new Waco.\n\nWhich at times had been running some promotions if if they got FSD. They can get better preferential rates. So we've been definitely taken care of this but we do want to solid taught me first and then we'll come back with a way to take care of these customers. These customers are very important they were the early adopters for what it's worth.\n\nMy daily commute is a hardware CCAR, which I use SSD on a daily basis. So we will definitely take care of you guys.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOnce the 14.\n\nIt's fully done.\n\nOur planning on working on our 14 light version photography, probably expected in Q2 next year.\n\nYeah.\n\nAwesome. Thank you Chuck.\n\nAlrighty. Our final question from say is how long until we see self driving Tesla semi trucks and .\n\nCould you see this technology, replacing trains.\n\nYeah, So I guess I'll start with that in terms of the semi a production plan and schedule. So the factory is it's going on schedule we've.\n\nCompleted the building and are installing equipment now.\n\nWe've got a fleet of validation trucks are driving on the road will have larger builds towards the end of this year and then our first online builds in the first part of next year ramping into Q2 timing with real volume coming in the back half of the year.\n\nSo that's going quite well and that's the first step obviously getting autonomous trucks on the road.\n\nIn terms of the trains you know there really great for long point to point deliveries are superefficient, but you know that last mile to load unload.\n\nRight.\n\nCan be better served for and shorter distances with autonomous semis and that would be great and so we do expect that to probably shift and as we really change the way transportation is considered.\n\nAnd so we're looking forward to that timeline and Ashoka I know you can can take the full self driving part currently the team is super focused on solving for passenger vehicles autonomy.\n\nThe same technology even.\n\nSuddenly quite easily.\n\nOnce we have data from the semi trucks.\n\nGreat.\n\nNow we will move over to analyst questions. The first question comes from Emmanuel at Wolf Manuel. Please go ahead and them yourself.\n\nGreat. Thanks, so much hi, everyone. So Elon you talked about expanding production of equal just fastest possible now that you have confidence in the unsupervised autonomy, how should we think about that in the context of your existing.\n\nThe city of 3 million units is that where youre, hoping to get volume to what sort of timeline are we talking about and would.\n\nWould this require some level of boosting or incentivizing the man like would just.\n\nBasically be prioritizing volume over near term profitability, even the longer term opportunity.\n\nWell, our capacity isn't quite 3 million.\n\nBut.\n\nIt will be 3 million at some point.\n\nAspirational.\n\nIt could be 3 million within .\n\nProbably at an annualized rate of 3 million within 24 months I think maybe less than 24 months.\n\nBearing in mind like this like there's an entire like supply chain.\n\nA vast supply chain, that's going to also move in tandem with that.\n\nSo I think.\n\nWe're going to work.\n\nWe're going to expand our production as fastest as we can.\n\nCan and.\n\nAnd as fast as our suppliers can can.\n\nAnd you can sort of keep up with it.\n\nAnd then we're going to think about a world where do we build incremental factories.\n\nOn bad debt.\n\nThe single biggest.\n\nProduction will be the cyber cap, which starts production in Q2 next year.\n\nThat's a that's really a vertical that's optimized for full autonomy.\n\nIn fact does not have a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nAnd it's really.\n\nAnd engineering optimization on minimizing costs might be like fully considered cost per mile of operation.\n\nSo that's.\n\nFor the other party.\n\nFor other vehicles, they're still they still have a little bit of the horseless carriage thing going on with you. Obviously, you got but you still got steering wheels and pedals and.\n\nAnd you're driving a car that.\n\nPeople might want to go up.\n\nVery fast.\n\nPast acceleration of tight cornering like high performance.\n\nThe cars, then you're going to design a different car than one that is optimized for a comfortable ride.\n\nBut doesn't expect to go past sort of 85 to 90 miles an hour.\n\nAnd it's just Amy for a gentle ride the whole time, that's what cyber cafes.\n\nSo.\n\nYeah. So it's.\n\nDo I think we will sacrifice margins I don't think so I think the demand will be pretty nutty.\n\nLike here's the here's the killer App really what it comes down to is can your text can you tax while you're in the car.\n\nAnd if your telephone yes. The cars now so good you can you can you can be on your phone.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd text the entire time, while you're in the car.\n\nIt's.\n\nAnyone who can buy the car will buy the car.\n\nAnd is it .\n\nSorry.\n\nSo.\n\nThat's what everybody wants to do in fact, not everyone wants to if they do do that and that's why in fact, the reason you've seen like that theres been an uptick in accidents.\n\nSure.\n\nPretty much worldwide is because people are texting and driving.\n\nSo autopilot extra dramatically improves the safety here.\n\nBecause if somebody is looking down at their phone, they're not driving very well.\n\nSo that's that's really the game changer.\n\nAnd.\n\nWe do see like.\n\nAt this point I feel.\n\nUh huh.\n\nEssentially 100% confident I say not essentially 100% confident that we can set that we can solve.\n\nBicycles Trikes full self driving at a safety level.\n\nMuch greater than human.\n\nSo we've released 14.1, we've got a technology roadmap, that's I think a pretty amazing, we'll be adding reasoning to the car.\n\nOur wealth simulator for assembly for reinforcement learning is.\n\nIt's pretty incredible.\n\nWhen you say that that has a reality simulator.\n\nIt's you can tell it on a screen.\n\nThe video that's generated by the Tesla reality simulator and but the actual video looks exactly the same.\n\nSo that allows us to.\n\nHave a very powerful reinforcement learning loop.\n\nFurther improve that tells the AI, we're gonna be increasingly parameter account by an order of magnitude.\n\nBut that's not in 14.1.\n\nThere are also a number of other improvements to the AI. It just.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat that are that are quite radical.\n\nSo it's.\n\nThis call will feel like it is a living creature. That's how good people he and I will get with the EF all computer with this before a high five.\n\nAnd then and then AI five like I said is by some metrics 40 40 times better.\n\nBut just say safely it's a.\n\n10 X improvement.\n\nSo it might almost be too much intelligence for a car I do wonder like how much intelligence should you, having a car it might get bored.\n\nYeah actually.\n\nAnd then one of the things I hope like well if we got all these caused maybe aboard.\n\nOr why there while there are sort of if they're onboard we could actually have a giant distributor influence fleet and say like well if they're not actively driving let's just have a giant distributed in French fleet.\n\nYou know at some point, if if you've got like tens of millions of cars in the fleet or maybe at some point 100 million cars in the fleet.\n\nAnd.\n\nLet's say they had at that point you know.\n\nLike I don't know.\n\nA kilowatt of inference capability of high.\n\nAnd French capability, that's 100 gigawatts of infants.\n\nDistributed.\n\nWith power and cooling taken with with cooling and power conversion taken care of.\n\nSo.\n\nThat seems like a pretty significant asset.\n\nYeah.\n\nGreat. Thanks, and the next question comes from Adam from Morgan Stanley Adam Please feel free to yourself.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I'm going to ask your question.\n\nIt seems like we might be having some audio issues with that and so we'll come back to you and the next question will then come from Dan from Barclays.\n\nHi, Good evening, Thank you for taking the question.\n\nI know that Tesla is really focused on with master planning for .\n\nA world and I think we've seen over the past.\n\nYeah, its willingness for Tesla to engage in and go into new markets New hands.\n\nNo.\n\nWhen you think about the growth prospects, how do we define the areas that are really within core competency.\n\nVersus where do you draw the line from markets or.\n\nApplications that are outside of Tesla is a core competency.\n\nActually I'm not sure what you mean by an AI applications outside of Tesla is a core competency.\n\nBut.\n\nAnd we kind of.\n\nWe didn't have any of these core competencies when we started you know [laughter].\n\nSo it's like with zero core competencies totaling competency of zero actually.\n\nSo I mean, you can think of Tesla is like I don't know a dozen startups in one company.\n\nAnd I've initiated every one of those start ups. So.\n\nIt's.\n\nIt wasn't used to make battery packs, so stationary battery packs, but now where do we make them for the homemaking for utility scale.\n\nOh, well Mega pack.\n\nUh huh.\n\nWe've created the supercharge network globally.\n\nI don't want no one else has created a global Supercharge network in fact that North American supercharger network. So good at that that basically that.\n\nEvery other manufacturer in North America is converted to our standard.\n\nAnd use our that the Tesla supercharger network.\n\nBut if it was so easy why don't they just do it.\n\nAnd the chip design team.\n\nWe started that from scratch the Tesla AI software team with Sutter from scratch.\n\nI literally just saying hey, we're going to start this thing I posted on Twitter now X and then.\n\nJoin us if you'd like to build it.\n\nIn fact, the choke was I believe the first person I interviewed for the Tesla autopilot team, which we're now called Seal's AI software team.\n\nWe have to ask soccer team.\n\nSo you know its core companies' competencies created while you wait.\n\nAnd.\n\n[laughter] Optimus that scale is the infinite money glitch.\n\nIt's like this is.\n\nIt's difficult to express the magnitude of like if you bought.\n\nSomething like that.\n\nLike if a optimists I think probably cheap five X the productivity of a person per year because it can operate.\n\n24 seven.\n\nIt doesn't even need to charge it can operate a tethered.\n\nIt's plugged in the whole time.\n\n.\n\nAnd.\n\nWhat is it that's that's why I call. It like if you true sustainable abundance.\n\nWe're working will be optional.\n\nYou know that there's limits to how much how much I can do in terms of enhancing the productivity of humans.\n\nBut there is not really a limit to.\n\nThat is embodied.\n\nThat's why I called infinite money glitch.\n\nI mean, one thing, which I'll further that is I mean people forget like our philosophy, Jason of autopilot was 10 years back. So you know you had started this way back in the door.\n\nYou've got the trees to prove them exactly.\n\nExactly and then even even on the Optima side.\n\nAs much as people think okay. This is a new thing I still remember was it four plus years back we went into finance meeting with Atlanta and he loves that.\n\nCause the robot on wheels.\n\nAnd that's where we started developing in fact, most of the engineering team, which is working on optimism.\n\nAsk him from the weak outside and that's why when we talk about manufacturing progress.\n\nWe have the wherewithal because the same engineers who worked.\n\nBack in the day on drive units are walking on actuators now so that's where we can do if there is any company, which can do it at scale that is gonna be us, but we also have actually added a lot of new engineers as well the team. So there's actually a lot of the credit.\n\nFor the Artemis Engineering is actually also near you introduced many of them that are just out of college actually.\n\nSo.\n\nDr. Louis Engineering team.\n\nTeam is a very talented team.\n\nI'd say like Wow.\n\nActually so.\n\nAnd.\n\nThe Artemis reviews at.\n\nAt this point or does the engineering review.\n\nAnd then there's the manufacturing reviewed a mcdonalds.\n\nSimultaneously.\n\nWith an iterative loop between engineering design and manufacturing because when we see it.\n\nWe design something that you feel like a man that's really difficult to make we need to change that design to make it easier to manufacture.\n\nSo we've made radical improvements to the design of Optimus.\n\nWhile increasing the functionality, but making it actually possible to manufacture like I'd say optimists too is.\n\nAlmost impossible to manufacturer frankly.\n\nBut.\n\nTwo five point, we've gone from.\n\nA person in a robot out but to.\n\nWhat people have seen with office 2.5, where it's doing Kung Fu.\n\nNo it was like.\n\nThis was at the at the Trop and Premier.\n\nDoing Kung Fu.\n\nUp in the open you know like with Jared Leto [laughter] like there wasn't a.\n\nNobody was controlling it it was just doing Kung Fu hero plateau.\n\nAt the Premier.\n\nYou can see the videos online.\n\nAnd actually the only things like a lot of people walked past it.\n\nThinking it was a.\n\nJust a person.\n\nEven though with documents.\n\nAt 245, you can see that it has a wasted three inches wide, which was obviously not a human.\n\nSo.\n\nBut the movements were so human like that people didn't realize a lot of people didn't realize they were looking at a robot.\n\nSo.\n\nAnd what I'm, saying is like Artemis through will be at.\n\nGiant improvement on that.\n\nAnd made it scale.\n\nBut like I said, it's a very difficult thing.\n\nYeah the Optimus.\n\nSort of engineering and manufacturing reviews, and that's what that's.\n\nThe Friday night meeting with Optimists, which sometimes goes till midnight.\n\nAnd then.\n\nSaturday meetings is what that is a Saturday afternoon with the the AI five chip design team.\n\nSo.\n\nThose two things are.\n\nCrucial to the future of the company.\n\nGreat Danes, you'll follow up yeah.\n\nRelated.\n\nMaybe you could just talk about to what extent are the AI efforts at Tesla and Xa add complementary or are they just different forms maybe you could just help distinguish the audience. Thank you, yes that there are different forms of AI.\n\nSo.\n\nThe.\n\nYes.\n\nThey actually had a.\n\nCroc is like a giant model that that you cannot you cannot possibly squeeze.\n\nOnto a car that's for sure. It is a giant piece of a model. It's with Crockett is trying to say so for artificial general intelligence with a massive amount of AI training compute and inference compute.\n\nSo for example for rock five will actually only run effectively on at GBP 300.\n\nHow much of a beast that five has.\n\nSo.\n\nAnd at worst Teslas I.\n\nModels are I don't know maybe about.\n\nLess than 10% the size maybe closer to.\n\n5% the size of Av block.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nYeah, they're they're they're they're really coming at the problem from very different.\n\nAngles.\n\nX and Croc are there competing with them.\n\nGoogle Gemini and opening a chat GBT and that kind of thing.\n\nSo.\n\nSome of it's complementary for example for Crock voice.\n\nMailed interact with Kraken the cars cool.\n\nUh huh.\n\nvoice.\n\nVoice recognition and.\n\nWhat are your voice generation.\n\nIt's rock so that's that's helpful. There.\n\nThey are are coming at it from kind of opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nYeah.\n\nAlrighty, Adam let's give it another try.\n\nWhen you are ready please unmeet yourself for the next question.\n\nAlrighty, Unfortunately, as still having audio issues. So we're going to move on to our Walt from light shed.\n\nPlease go ahead and them yourself.\n\nCan you hear me now.\n\nYes, perfect. Thank you.\n\nYes.\n\nJust getting back to Austin, if you can remove the safety driver at year end is the limitation in the Bay area, just regulatory or is it kind of a market by market learning process and I guess similarly in the eight to 10 markets that you mentioned to get at it is the decision there to put a safety attended in the passenger seat.\n\nOr the safety driver and is that.\n\nLike your step by step process to opening up a market or is it really just the regulation in the individual market.\n\nWell I think I think even if the regulators weren't making us do it we'd still do that as the sort of right sort of course cautious approach to a new market. So just.\n\nMake sure that we're being paranoid about safety.\n\nI think it makes sense to have it sort of.\n\nI sort of either safety driver safety occupants in the car.\n\nWhen we first go to new markets just to confirm that that's not something we're missing.\n\nBecause all it takes is like one in 10000 trips to go wrong and you got it you got an issue so.\n\nIt's it just to make sure that it is there some.\n\nOr you're already about a city like a very difficult intersection or I don't know something that's that's an unexpected challenge.\n\nIn a city put out one in 10000 situation.\n\nSo.\n\nI think we'd probably if you could just let it loose in this in these studies, but we just don't want we don't want to take a chance and and like you know what we.\n\nWe're talking about here is.\n\nMaybe three months of safety driver in a new metro ticking from that it's good and then I would take the safety driver of that that kind of thing.\n\nOkay, and then on an FSD 14, it has a different field in 13, and it's also I think a little different than what it feels like and in Austin.\n\nIs it basically different development paths path that youre doing in terms of the robo taxi stuff versus what youre dropping to the early adopters and when you and when you push these new builds.\n\nIs it that you're looking for notable improvements in intervention rates or is that largely solved and it's more about adding the functionality like the parking to drive knowledge or just the overall comfort.\n\nThe first priority when we released.\n\nA major new software architecture for autopilot is safety. So so it starts off with safety, obviously safety prioritized and then we and then we saw comfort thereafter, which is why I don't recommend people take the initial version.\n\n.\n\nThat's why I say like most people should wait until for 14.24 before they actually download version 14.\n\nBecause by 14.2 will address many of the comfort issues.\n\nHmm.\n\nPriority is very much safety first and then thereafter.\n\nThe comfort issue, that's why most people Oh, my God, I, probably that'll be a little like it'll be safe, but jerky.\n\nAnd I.\n\nWe just need time to kind of smooth the rough edges.\n\nAnd so if a company in addition to safety with the with the major news.\n\nYeah, you know what.\n\nThe pilot architecture change.\n\nBut it really is.\n\nI mean, I know what the you know.\n\nThe roadmap is for the test the real World AI and .\n\nAnd that's pretty granular detail, obviously, a show cause leading that.\n\nAnd I I mean, I spent a lot of time with the team.\n\nGoing in.\n\nLike Dude.\n\nExcruciating detail here.\n\nWhat we're doing to improve the real world AI.\n\nAnd I'm like I said, it's this car is going to feel like it is a living creature.\n\nThat's what AI for before even a high five.\n\nYes.\n\nOr anything or anything like that.\n\nHello.\n\nSo much like at least on the stuff you're working on in terms of like what we ship to customers.\n\nMostly the same obviously customers, mostly just like them. They can choose the car wants to park in a spot or something that would just not super relevant for what actually but that's only a few minor things like those ones.\n\nMajority of the algorithms and architecture and everything is the same I begin those pumps.\n\nYeah, but I mean, as I mentioned earlier like we'll be adding reasoning to I don't know sure because that like reasoning and like $14. Three maybe 14 point for something like that.\n\nBut I noticed you know for sure yeah, so with reasoning, it's literally going to think about which parking spot to pick.\n\nAt least I was going to say this is the entrance, but actually probably theres not pockets about right at the entrance if its a full.\n\nI'm talking about is fairly cool probably have open parking spot right at the entrance is very low but actually what else was simply due is dropping off at the entrance of the store and then go find a parking spot.\n\nBut it's going to get very smart about figuring out of parking as well just go to spot figure out it's gonna spot empty spots much better than humans, because you got 360 degree vision.\n\nAnd it's gonna Yeah, Yeah, like I said just.\n\nIt's going to reuse the reasoning.\n\nThis whole things.\n\nAnd putting that all inside your computer.\n\nOr is it extra shot and that's what the team is working on.\n\nAnything you can do reasoning on the server that takes forever, but then car you need to make some decisions.\n\nSo putting all that into the computer that's in the car that's the challenge.\n\nYeah, that's why I say like.\n\nPretty good understanding of like AI, that's sort of the giant model level with Croc and with Tesla and I'm confident in saying that Tesla has that that tells the AI has the highest intelligence density when you look at the intelligence per gigabyte.\n\nI think like Tesla is probably an order of magnitude better than anyone else.\n\nAnd it isn't it doesn't have any choice because that has got to fit in the Apple computer.\n\nThe.\n\nThe discipline of having that level of AI.\n\nIntelligence density.\n\nWe will pay great dividends. When you go to something that has an order of magnitude order of magnitude more capability like AI five.\n\nNow you have that same intelligence density but.\n\nBut you got 10 times more capability in the computer.\n\nYeah.\n\nGreat and the next question will come from Collyn at Oppenheimer co.\n\nColin please on mute yourself when you're ready.\n\nI'll go ahead, and let me yourself. Please thanks, so much guys.\n\nI appreciate you, bringing up the challenges at hand, dexterity and humanoids, along with the complexity of the supply chain and the vertical integration you guys are pursuing yeah, I'm just trying to harmonize.\n\nImmunize the timeline for the start of production next year with the current state of the supply chain and what sounds like a fair amount of work remaining on the dexterity before you can really frees the hardware design and start to scale up production.\n\nHmm.\n\nThe hardware design will actually be frozen.\n\nEven through startup production there'll be continued iteration.\n\nBecause a bunch of the things that you discover are very difficult to make you only find out pretty late in the game. So we'll be doing rolling changes.\n\nFor the Optimus design, even after sort of production but.\n\nBut I do think that the.\n\nYou know the new hand is.\n\nAnd incredible piece of engineering and.\n\nYeah, that's yeah, well like I said, we will have a.\n\nA production intent prototype.\n\nTo show off in Q1, and probably February or March.\n\nAnd then we're.\n\nYeah, we're gonna be building a million unit.\n\nOptimists production line.\n\nYou know hopefully with the production start towards the end of next year.\n\nBut that that production ramp will take awhile to get to an annualized rate of vermilion, because it's going to move as fast as the slowest dumbest least lucky.\n\nThing out of 10000 unique items.\n\nBut it will get to a million units.\n\nAnd then I will.\n\nBut we will do optimists.\n\nPoor that'll be you know 10 million units.\n\nOptimists five maybe.\n\n50 to 100 million units I mean, it's really pretty nutty.\n\nYeah.\n\nAlrighty that is unfortunately, all the time, we have for Q&A today and before we conclude though that Bob has some closing remarks.\n\nThanks Tavis.\n\nWant to take the time to talk about an extremely important work, which is being held on November six.\n\nMeeting will shape, the future of Tesla and we are asking you as our shareholders to supporting lost leadership.\n\nTwo the two compensation proposals.\n\nAnd the reelection of Idaho, Kathleen and Joel to the board.\n\nIt is a team sport and head of Tesla. The board is an integral part of the winning team.\n\nShareholders.\n\nAt the center of everything we do at Tesla and then.\n\nThe committee has laid out.\n\nCompensation package like Elon said, no we don't even want to call. It a compensation thought yeah. Its just not at the point as I just like it needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not not so much that it can't be fired if I go insane.\n\nBut.\n\nAnd I think that's sort of numbers in the mid Twenty's approximately.\n\nAs a company that has already gone public there's no.\n\nWe investigated every possible way to how do you achieve increased voting control without them.\n\nYeah.\n\nIs there some way to have like a super voting stock, but there really isn't a there is no way to help us with voting stock.\n\nAfter you have gone public but for example, Google matter.\n\nThere are many other companies have this.\n\nBut they had they had it before they went public and so it sort of gets I guess grandfather then.\n\nBecause it does not have that so.\n\nSo.\n\nIt's just.\n\nLike I said I, just don't feel comfortable building robot army here and not and then.\n\nYou know being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and glass Lewis, who I have no freaking clue.\n\nI mean, those guys are corporate terrorists.\n\nAnd the problem yet so let me explain like the core problem here is that.\n\nSo many of the index funds.\n\nPassive funds.",
    "content2": "Vote, along the lines of what whatever glass Lewis and ISS recommend.\n\nRecommend.\n\nNow they have made many terrible recommendations in the past that if those recommendations have been followed would've been extremely destructive to the future of the company.\n\nBut if you've got passive funds that essentially to defer.\n\nSponsored ability for the vote.\n\nTwo glass Lewis and ISS.\n\nThen you can have extremely disastrous consequences for a publicly traded company if if too much of a publicly traded company is controlled by index funds. It's the facto controlled by glass Lewis and ISS.\n\nThis is a fundamental problem for corporate governance.\n\nBecause they're not voting along the lines that are actually good for shareholders.\n\nThat's the that's the big issue I mean.\n\nThat's what it comes down to I.\n\nsays glass Lewis corporate terrorism.\n\nYeah, and I would say you know, especially come into did an amazing job in constructing this plan for the benefit of the shareholders.\n\nThere is no nothing we'd gets passed on till the time share owners make substantial returns. So that's right now and then I would say I would urge you to not only what on the.\n\nPlant, but also what on all the three doctors because of the exceptional knowledge and experience and literally we got Tesla will work with these doctors.\n\nThe India out.\n\nIt is not even a single.\n\nYeah.\n\nOne of the doctors I haven't spoken to are one of my colleague hasn't spoken to.\n\nAnd with.\n\nEven the doctors out here not just reading out as you know Powerpoint presentations.\n\nWorking with US day in day out.\n\nSo again I just urge you guys as shareholders to walk along the board's recommendation. Thank you guys.\n\nGreat. Thank you bet, Bob we appreciate everyone's questions today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay."

My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00PM Central Time in the update deck to be published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings to the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nThanks, Travis. So we've had a very exciting quarter. We were able to successfully launch a robotaxi, so providing our first rides with no one in the driver's seat to both paying customers in Austin. And as some may have noted, we've already expanded our service area in Austin. It's bigger and longer, and it's going to get even bigger and longer. We were expecting to really greatly increase the Austin service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing. And that's hopefully in a week or so, two weeks?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah, a couple of weeks.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nA couple of weeks or so. We're getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, and a number of other places. As we get the approvals and we prove out safety, then we will be launching autonomous ride-hailing in most of the country. I think we'll probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the US by the end of the year. That's at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals. I think we'll technically be able to do it. Assuming we get regulatory approvals, it's probably addressing half the population of the US by the end of the year. But we are being very cautious.\nWe don't want to take any chances. And so we're going to go cautiously. But the service areas and the number of vehicles in operation will increase at a hyper-exponential rate. So some other notable things. Model Y in June became the best-selling car in Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria. It is, I believe, the best-selling car of any kind in the world still. And autonomy is a big factor there. So even without supervised, even with just supervised self-driving, it's a huge selling point. And it's worth noting that we do not actually yet have approval for supervised FSD in Europe. So our sales in Europe, we think, will improve significantly once we are able to give customers the same experience that they have in the US. This is, I think, a very important point to convey.\nAnd we've been working with our main country regulator, which is the Netherlands. And I think we're close to getting approval with the Netherlands. Then it's going to go to the EU. It's quite a Kafkaesque. In fact, Kafka had no idea that something like the EU could exist. Beyond Kafkaesque challenges with bureaucracy. But we will get the approvals. I think we'll get some people in Europe will have an experience similar to that of the US in most of Europe this year, hopefully at least partially in this quarter.\nThen we also have some regulatory challenges in China, which we're hoping to unblock shortly, where, because we also cannot provide supervised FSD in China currently. But we're going to unblock that soon. And that's also another major; it really is the single biggest demand drive. Then within the US, as we get confident about safety in different geographic areas, we'll loosen up on how much somebody has to be laser-focused, have their eyes laser-focused on the road. That's been a common complaint.\nIn fact, it does create an odd safety issue where people will sometimes disengage Autopilot, then do something, change the radio, or maybe look at the phone, drive with their knee, and then re-engage Autopilot, which obviously is less safe than simply keeping Autopilot on. So anyway, we get that the experience will improve in the next several weeks. Because of our focus on Austin with no one in the driver's seat, the production release of Autopilot is actually several months behind what people experience on a Robotaxi in Austin.\nSo now we have the Robotaxi in Austin launched. We'll be adding back those elements so that there will be a step change improvement in the Autopilot experience for people outside of Austin. So this is really, as you can tell, this is very much sort of autonomy is the story. We need the physical product. Without which, you cannot have autonomy. But once you have the physical product, you need the autonomy is what amplifies the value to stratospheric levels. We also launched the Tesla Diner, which has been a huge hit. It actually got worldwide attention, which is unusual for a Diner. Diners don't typically get headline news around Earth. But this is a pretty special Diner.\nAnd if you're in the LA area, it's worth visiting. It's sort of a shiny beacon of hope in an otherwise sort of bleak urban landscape, frankly. So it's really quite a lovely experience. Great job by the Tesla team there. On the Full Self-Driving front, continue talking about that. We're continuing to make significant improvements just with the software. So we're expecting to increase the parameter count. Actually, at this point, I think we think we can probably 10 times, but almost 10times the parameter.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nYeah, roughly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, roughly 10 times the parameter count. So this is actually a very tricky thing to do because as you increase the parameter count, you get choked on memory bandwidth. But we currently think we can 10x the parameter count from what people are currently experiencing. So not just the 4 times, actually 10 times increase in parameter count. And yeah, so still a lot of improvement on the existing hardware to happen. Energy is growing really well despite headwinds from tariffs and various supply chain challenges. The Megapack is expanding capacity quickly. And we have upgrades to the Megapack that will make it even better. And we had record Powerwall deployment gain in Q2. So I think batteries are just going to be a massive thing. The scale of battery demand is, I think, not that many people appreciate just how gigantic the scale of battery demand is.\nThe way to think about it is that the US sustained power output for the US grid is around one terawatt. But average usage is less than half a terawatt. If you add batteries to the mix, you can run the power plants 24/7 at full capacity, doubling, more than doubling the energy output per year of the United States just with batteries. But that's, again, a big deal. It's a really big deal. Optimus. So we're evolving the Optimus design and really getting Optimus to the point where it is a phenomenal design.\nSo our Optimus version two right now is sort of two and a half. Optimus three is an exquisite design, in my opinion, and will be an incredible, as I've said many times before, product. It will be the biggest product ever. It's a very hard problem to solve. You have to design every part of it from physics-first principles. There's nothing that's off the shelf that actually works. So you've got to design every motor, gearbox, power electronics, control electronics, sensors, the mechanical elements. We've also got to train Optimus to use its hands and its sensors with a neural net. But we'll be applying the same techniques we've applied for our car, which is essentially a four-wheeled robot. And Optimus is a robot with arms and legs.\nThe same principles that apply to optimizing AI inference on the car apply to Optimus because they're both really robots in different forms. And Tesla, it is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI. A clear proof point for that would be if you compare Tesla to Waymo. Waymo's got the car. It's best tuned with God knows how many sensors.\nAnd yet, isn't Google good at AI? Yes, but they're not good at real-world AI. Thus far, Tesla is actually much better than Google by far, and much better than anyone at real-world AI. And by far, Tesla has the best inference efficiency. A key figure of merit for AI is, what is the intelligence per GB? And people talk about parameters, blah, blah, blah. But I think we're still talking about parameters and talking about gigabytes because with the parameters, you can have 4-bit parameters, 8-bit parameters, 16-bit parameters. But the actual constraints in the hardware are how many GB of RAM and how many GB per second can you transfer from RAM. Therefore, it is not a parameter constraint. It is a byte constraint. And Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI by far. And I have a lot of insight into this with xAI.\nxAI's Grok is the smartest AI overall, but Grok 4 is a giant beast at the terabyte level. So it's kind of important to note Tesla has the best intelligence density. Intelligence density will be a very big deal in the future. It is now. With Optimus 3, which is really the right design, it doesn't have at this point; there's no significant flaws with the Optimus 3 design. We are going to retool a bunch of things. There'll probably be prototypes of Optimus 3 into this year and then scale production next year. We're going to try to scale Optimus production as fast as it's humanly possible to do so and try to get to a million units a year as quickly as possible. We think we can get there in less than five years. That's my spokesman sort of, I guess.\nThat's a reasonable aspiration of a million units a year. Five years seems like an achievable target. In conclusion, so far, 2025 has been a very exciting year. A lot of major milestones. We've made clear demonstrable progress in autonomy that a lot of naysayers said we would not achieve. But it's worth noting that we have done what we said we were going to do. It doesn't mean we're always on time, but we get it done. On the critics, we're sitting there with egg on their face. Great, great, great progress by the Tesla team. Yeah, I do think if Tesla continues to execute well with vehicle autonomy and human-robot autonomy, it will be the most valuable company in the world. There's a lot of execution between here and there. It doesn't just happen.\nBut provided we execute very well, I think Tesla has a shot at being the most valuable company in the world. Anyway, obviously, I'm extremely optimistic about the future of the company. The best way to predict the future is to make it happen. And we're making it happen here with Tesla team. So I'd just like to say thanks to all of our supporters. And I think we've got, yeah, an incredibly exciting future.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Elon. And Vaibhav has a big remarks as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nService. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was an interesting quarter in a few respects. We started ramping up the production of the new Model Y at all our factories. We rolled out our robotaxi service in Austin and delivered a car completely autonomously directly from the factory to the customer's home. It is a seminal point to get to this thing. I mean, it took a lot of effort, and I really want to thank everybody at Tesla to make this happen. It wasn't an easy thing to do, but we did it. It took time, but we've just begun the next phase for the company. The one big bill has a lot of changes that would affect our business in the near term. The first among those changes is the repeal of the IRA EV credit of $7,500 by the end of this quarter.\nGiven the abrupt change, we have limited supply of vehicles in the US this quarter as we have already been in lead times to auto parts to build cars. We've rolled out all our planned incentives already, and we'll start paying them back as we start to sell. If you're in the US and looking to buy a car, the issue right now is we may not be able to guarantee delivery for this place in the later part of August and beyond. The bill also made changes to certain emission standards by reducing the amount of penalty to sale. This, in turn, will have an impact on the new sales of regulatory credits to other OEMs, and, in turn, will lead to lower revenues. While we now plan our business around such sales, it will nonetheless impact our total revenues going forward.\nOn the automotive product portfolio, the entire lineup is updated. Globally, we're seeing an increase in the number of test drives. We started the production of the lower-cost model as planned in the first half of 2025. However, given our focus on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the US before the EV credit expires and the additional complexity of ramping a new product, the ramp will happen next quarter, slower than initially expected. One thing which is grossly appreciated and Elon talked about it is that all our vehicles in the lineup are capable of autonomy. This is by far the biggest differentiator between us and the competition. Our vehicles top safety standards as is, but with FSD, they are and will continue to set a new standard for safety within vehicular transportation. We published our vehicle safety report earlier today.\nYou can see a car on FSD is 10x safer than a car not on FSD. We've started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend. Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version 12 of FSD, we've seen the adoption rates really increase. We've started seeing on the automotive revenue front, despite reduction in regulatory credit revenue, and the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially, even though total deliveries only improved 14%. This was primarily due to an improved ASPs because of the new Model Y. This helped in improving margins sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption despite an increase in cost from tariffs. We started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L.\nSequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately 2/3 of that impact in automotive and rest in energy. However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters, and so costs will increase in the near term. While we're doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front. The margins for the energy generation and storage businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced, primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins. We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet. Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter. I think Elon covered this, that industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.\nThe energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy-heavy. The quickest path to scale up energy is deploying storage. This is something that our customers have started realizing. Despite this business having the largest impacts from tariffs, we're seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts. The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year. The challenges of the storage business therefore remain both from the bill and from tariffs, and we're doing our best to try and manage through this. We will see shifts in demand and profitability. The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability.\nOperating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute. Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow. We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. Other income grew sequentially, primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Bitcoin holdings, which was $284 million gain in Q2, while being $125 million loss in Q1. Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price. While operating cash flows increased sequentially, so did our CapEx, resulting in $146 million of free cash flow.\nWe continue to make investments in various aspects of manufacturing like Cybercab, Semi lines, and other manufacturing spend and the expansion of our AI initiatives. Our latest expectation for the year in terms of CapEx is in excess of $9 billion. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs. However, the investments that we have made for AI, robotics, and our lead in energy set us up for a bright future. I would like to thank the whole Tesla team, our customers, our investors, and supporters for their continued belief in us.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. So now we're going to move on to Say.com questions. The first question is, can you give us some insight how Robotaxis have been performing so far and what rate you expect to expand in terms of vehicles, geofence, cities, and supervisors?\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah, Robotaxi has been doing great so far in Austin. Customers really love the experience. It's super smooth, very safe, and just a great experience overall. We already did the first wave of expansion in Austin, and we'll continue to expand in Austin to probably more than 10x our current operating region. We're also testing in a lot of other cities, as Elon mentioned. The next thing to expand would be in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are working with the government to get approval here and, in the meanwhile, launch a service with the person in the driver's seat just to expedite while we wait for regulatory approvals. We're also testing a lot of other cities in the US, including Florida, Nevada, etc.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Chuck. The next question is, what are the key technical and regulatory hurdles still remaining for unsupervised FSD to be available for personal use? Can you provide a timeline?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWe're certainly getting there. I think it'll be available for unsupervised personal use by the end of this year in certain geographies. We're just being very careful about it.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThis is not something which we want to rush. We want to make sure that everything is safe before we make it available broadly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, we're just being extremely paranoid. But I'm confident that by the end of this year, within a number of cities in the US, it'll be available to end users. Yeah.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. For us, it was the same AI hardware in the Austin Robotaxi vehicles as some customer vehicles. We did deliver a car autonomously from the factory to a customer this quarter. Every Tesla manufactured in the US and in Europe autonomously drives itself from the end of line to the loading docks. So it's just a software upgrade away.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think we'll end up delivering cars in the San Francisco Bay Area by default from the factory by the end of this year. A car will deliver itself to where you are unless you say you don't want that.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nVery reciprocal.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys. The next question is, what specific factory tasks is Optimus currently performing? And what is the expected timeline for scaling production to enable external sales? How does Tesla envision Optimus contributing to revenue in the next two to three years?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So the Optimus 3 design, as I mentioned earlier, is, I think, finally the right design. There'll be further optimizations, but there are no fundamental changes that are needed for the Optimus 3 design. It has all the degrees of freedom that we really want or need. So we'll have prototypes of that in, I don't know, three or three months, and then start tooling up production. We'll certainly start production on that in the beginning of next year. The production ramp. It's always difficult to predict the S-curve of your production ramp when everything is new because the rate of production will move as fast as the least lucky and least competent elements of the entire supply chain as well as internal processes.\nSo the more new stuff that is in a product, the slower the ramp could be because of unexpected supply chain interruptions or mistakes made internally. It's much easier to predict sort of the end of the S-curve or late in the S-curve than the beginning of the S-curve. And the beginning of the S-curve of the production ramp is, in any case, not really material for revenue purposes. The beginning of the S-curve, you're always negative gross margin, and you're debugging a lot of issues. So that's why I feel fairly confident predicting things, or at least medium confident in predicting where we are in five years, but it's hard to predict where we are in a year or two years.\nSo that's why I think five years, I think we could be at the, I'll be surprised if at the end of five years, 60 months from now, if we are not roughly making 100,000 Optimus robots in a month, in 60 months, I would be shocked.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. Next question is, can you provide an update on the development and production timeline for Tesla's more affordable models? How will these models balance cost reduction and profitability, and what impact do you expect on demand in the current economic climate?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWell, I think Vaibhav did a good job of answering this question and his opening remarks. As we said, we started production in June, and we're ramping quality builds and things around the quarter. And given that we started in North America and that our goal is to maximize production with IRA for the pending Q3, we're going to keep pushing hard on our current models to avoid complexity. Then, fortunately, when that rolls away, we'll be ready with the more affordable models available for everyone in Q4. And the goal with those products was not to negatively impact revenue or gross margin, but just to make a car that everyone loves and wants at a more affordable price.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you, Lars. The next question is, Can you talk about the benefits of Tesla investing in xAI?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThis is not the forum to discuss this topic. I mean, if there is something which we need to discuss, we'll discuss it separately.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nI think, obviously, we're a publicly traded company. Shareholders are welcome to put forward any shareholder proposals that they'd like. I've recently encouraged that and then have shareholders vote, and we'll act in accordance with the shareholder wishes.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you tell us a little bit more about what goes on in the Tesla design studio?\n\nFranz von Holzhausen\n\nChief Designer, Tesla\n\nDo you want me to take that one? We kind of generally say that what happens in the studio stays in the studio and that earnings calls are not the place to disclose new product stuff, but we're working to make sure that we have an exciting future for our Tesla and the product line.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, there's a lot of exciting things happening in the design studio. It's not static. And really, what's going to happen over the next several years is a fundamental transformation of the company from a pre-autonomy world to a post-autonomy. And I'm working on a new master plan to articulate that for Tesla team. And there will be some teething pains as you transition from a pre-autonomy to a post-autonomy world. But I think the future vision for Tesla is incredibly exciting and will profoundly change the world in a good way. It may sound like sort of pineapple or whatever, but I think, well, let's just say if we execute on that plan effectively, which is you have to actually do that, Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you. The next question is actually a duplicate on unsupervised FSD for customer vehicles, so we'll skip that. After that is, are there any news for Hardware 3 users getting retrofits or upgrades? Will they get Hardware 4 or some future version of Hardware 5?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI mean, what we want to do is we want to get unsupervised done on Hardware 4 first. Once it's done, then we'll go back and look at what we need to do with the Hardware 3 cars. I mean, like I said, the focus is first to get unsupervised out, and then we'll go back and see what more work we need to do.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. The next question is, can you give an update on Dojo and could xAI be a customer for Dojo?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nDojo 2, we expect to have Dojo 2 operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around 100,000 H100 equivalent. Then AI 5, which is really spectacular too. I don't use those words lightly. Spectacular too. The AI 5 chip will hopefully be in line production around the end of next year. That has a lot of potential. I think thinking about Dojo 3 and the AI 6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively we want to try to find convergence there where it's basically the same chip, but it's used where we use, say, two of them in a car or an Optimus, and maybe a larger number on a board, like on a 512 on a board or something like that, if you want high bandwidth communication between the chips for serving, during inference serving.\nThat sort of seems like intuitively the sensible way to go.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. The next set of questions have all actually been covered. So we'll end with, how will the BBV elimination of tax credits for solar projects affect your sales pipeline for Megapack?\n\nMichael Snyder\n\nVP of Energy and Charging, Tesla\n\nYeah. Our sales pipeline is quite diversified across customers and market segments. So we aren't heavily weighted in Megapack projects that are paired with solar. And as we talked about in the opening remarks, we're seeing storage quickly being recognized for its ability to unlock grid efficiency and how quickly it can be deployed to help the grid. Additionally, although the recent bill was not favorable towards solar, we believe solar projects will still get built because the energy is necessary, the projects are well developed, and they're ready for execution, and there's really no alternatives in the near term given gas turbine lead times and pricing. We also continue to see growth in the data center segment and in standalone storage projects providing capacity to the grid in several markets across the US. Overall, we're forecasting a very strong second half of the year as we increase deployments.\nLastly, we continue to invest heavily in US manufacturing to mitigate policy and tariff impacts, expecting our first LFP cell manufacturing facility to be online by the end of the year, and launching our third Megafactory near Houston in 2026.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you, Mike. We will now be moving to analyst questions. The first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner at Wolfe Research. Emmanuel, please feel free to unmute yourself whenever you're ready.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Can you hear me?\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nYep.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. So Elon, are you able to share any KPIs with us in terms of the Robotaxi business? How many vehicles are you operating, miles driven autonomously, or the number of safety-critical intervention? Just curious how the rollout generally is going and any sort of targets that you could share more broadly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nSure. Do you want to?\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. We have more than 7,000mi operating in Austin area. Just because service is new, we have a handful of vehicles right now, but then we are trying to expand the service in terms of both the area and also the number of vehicles both in Austin and other locations. So far, there's no notable safety-critical incidents. Sometimes we have our own restrictions as to, for example, we restrict our speed limit to 40mph roads. And if the vehicle wants to go on high-speed roads, we can stop the vehicle, but those are out of convenience opposed to safety-critical nature. So far, the service has been really well received, and we continue to expand on it. Great. And that. Yeah.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nLonger term, from an economics point of view, longer term, you've previously talked about working to drive down the cost per mile on the Robotaxis, maybe towards $0.30 or $0.40 per mile over time. Now that your service is live, how should we think about the main milestones to getting there?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Well, the Cybercab, which is really optimized for autonomy, that, I think, has got probably sub-$0.30 per mi potential over time, maybe $0.25. It's really like if you design a car from scratch to be a cost-optimized robotic taxi like Cybercab. For example, we're not trying to make it corner incredibly well like a Model 3 would or Model S or even Model Y. All of our cars that are driven by people are super fun to drive. They've got incredible acceleration, incredible cornering capability. But I think we're confident that very few people in a Cybercab want to be hurtling around. So we've reduced the top-end speed, which means we can use more efficient tires. We don't need as much acceleration. We don't need as much fake brakes to sort of we want stopping distance, but we're not expecting it to be heavily used.\nIt's a gentle ride. Essentially, you design it for a gentle ride, and then you have a much more optimized design point. So that's why it seems probable that we could achieve that, especially if Optimus is serving, cleaning up the car, and doing maintenance and stuff. And doing automatic charging. So I think the actual cost per mile of Cybercab will be very low. The cost per mile of our existing fleet will be higher, but still very competitive. So maybe some number of $0.50, I'm just guessing. Yeah. So really, Tesla's robotaxi fleet will go from tiny to gigantic in terms of operations in a pretty short period of time. My guess is it has a material impact on our financials around the end of next year.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Adam at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please unmute yourself.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Hello, everybody. So Elon, as Tesla moves into this next phase of physical AI, autonomous, humanoids, robotaxis, etc., world-changing, civilizational, species-changing technology with dual purpose, are you comfortable moving Tesla in this direction while only having a 13% stake in the company? Sorry, in the company. Is that sustainable, or do you still insist that something needs to happen given your current lack of control and the types of technology you're getting into?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. That is a major concern for me, as I've mentioned in the past, and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting. But yeah, it is a big deal. I want to find that I've got so little control that I can easily be ousted by activist shareholders after having built this army of humanoid robots. I think that, as I mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Elon, you're not going to go crazy. We trust you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nYou can stay a little crazy. A little crazy is okay. Elon, though, we understand the board of directors of a major US investment bank recently toured Optimus production. I don't know if you want to confirm that or not. It's just what we heard. That's cool. But when do you think others will be able to get a firsthand view of Optimus like that? And is the second half of this year too soon to have an AI Day? Because it seems like everybody else in the world is doing it, and this talent war is getting freaking crazy. And I know you've mentioned for recruiting purposes, this is a very important thing that you've done. I think people have copied you on this, and I'm wondering if this year is too early for that. Thanks, Elon.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYes. It's been a tough thing because when we're doing AI Day, we find that some of our competitors have literally done a frame-by-frame examination of our slides and everything we say, and then copy us. So I'm just saying, what's the trade-off? Which does help with recruiting, but then competitors look very closely and copy us. I mean, that said, we should probably. I mean, I guess we could consider the shareholder meeting to be sort of a. We can maybe go into depth, some amount of depth at the annual shareholder meeting with respect to Optimus, AI, and sort of our chip stuff, perhaps. Yeah. Tesla is also really underrated in terms of AI chip design as well as AI software. So there's still not a chip that exists that we would prefer to put in our car.\nThat is an AI chip that we would prefer to put in the car over our own, even though it's been now out for several years. And we're confident that the AI 5 chip will be a profound game changer. In fact, it's so powerful that we'll have to nerf it to some degree for markets outside of the US because it blows way past the export restrictions. So unless export restrictions change, we actually will have to nerf our AI 5 chip. It's kind of weird. Hopefully, we keep raising the bar on export restrictions. Otherwise, it gets a bit silly. But we'll have a bunch of Optimus robots on stage at the shareholder meeting. The Optimus lab is cool to see. It basically looks like the set of Westworld. We see robots in various stages. Some of them are in various stages of repair. I don't know.\nSo some combination of the Tatooine junkyard and Westworld is what it looks like. It's very cool. And Optimus is walking around the office here in Palo Alto. So 24/7, it's just walking around like a small—and we saw Optimus at the Tesla Diner serving popcorn. Yeah. So we'll go from a world where robots are rare to where they're so common that you don't even look up.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank. Edison, please unmute yourself. Edison, please go ahead and unmute yourself. All right. While Edison figures that out, we will go to the next question, which is going to come from Dan Levy at Barclays. Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nDan Levy\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Elon, you've talked about the opportunity to put non-Tesla-owned vehicles into the Robotaxi network. Could you just talk about the gating factors to enabling that and what timeline we should expect on personally-owned vehicles in the Robotaxi network?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWe haven't really thought hard about that. We need to make sure it works when the vehicles are fully under our control. And yeah, it's kind of one step at a time here. We don't want to jump the gun. As I said, we're being paranoid about safety. So it's like, but I guess next year, I'd say confidently next year. I'm not sure when next year, but confidently next year, people would be able to add or subtract their car to the Tesla fleet.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI mean, one thing to keep in mind is that we will have some criteria because even when you put your car in an Uber or Lyft fleet, they go through a whole checklist process of making sure things are working.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nIt's like an Airbnb or a Skype.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYes. Yeah. We will do something like that.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nKind of getting past it.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYes. Because we want, like Elon said, we want to be paranoid about security. I mean, aspects, small things like tread on the tire can have an impact on safety. So that's why we would want to do some proper validation before we let other cars come in.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nDan, you want to follow up?\n\nDan Levy\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nYes. Thank you. Could you just unpack the different costs associated with scaling the Robotaxi business and how you think about funding those costs? Are the cash flows in the auto business sufficient to fund it? And if not, what other funding sources do you think you'd use? Would you just fund it off the balance sheet?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, as soon as there is a clear cash flow stream associated with any product, you can finance it.\n\nDan Levy\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nIn the interim?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI mean, in the interim, we will use our balance sheet. But once we get to a certain scale in terms of recurring revenues, like Elon said, we could get into an easily and easiest kind of transaction to try and get funding.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. We will now move on to Mark from Goldman Sachs. Mark, please feel free to unmute yourself.\n\n[Analyst] (Goldman Sachs)\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the questions. With the FSD trials that Tesla has been offering to consumers and the attention on self-driving more generally, are you able to comment more specifically on what you're seeing with FSD subscription trends and take rates and help us better understand how large FSD revenue may be currently?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nSo we've definitely. I mentioned it in my opening remarks. Since we've launched version 12 of FSD in North America, we've definitely seen a marked improvement in the FSD adoption. And the other thing which we had also done last year is we did bring down the pricing, and we've made subscription much more affordable. So we have seen a 25% increase since that time, which is an encouraging trend. But honestly, we've just started the story around explaining the benefits of FSD. Like I said before, we released our vehicle safety report. Even if you don't believe in anything else, a car on FSD being 10x safer should be a motivator. Plus, the other thing is people don't realize even at $99 a month, it's like you're getting a personal chauffeur for almost $3.33 a day.\nThis is by far the biggest game changer, which I know we've been talking about it because part of it is we live and breathe it, but I feel like.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Most people still don't know it. The vast majority of people don't know it exists. And it's still like half of Tesla owners who could use it haven't tried it even once. They don't actually know anything. Obviously, this is something we want to educate them on. So we've got to, when they come in for service, we'll reach out to them, send them videos of how to make it work. And most of us, it's such a shocking thing. They don't think a car is capable of this. So you have to show them and get them comfortable with turning it on and off. It's so trivial, but it's like saying you've got a cat that can sing and dance, but it just looks like a normal cat. And you're like, until you see the cat sing and dance and talk, you're assuming it's just a cat.\nThat's Tesla FSD. Our car is intelligent.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nSo what we're going to do, to Elon's point, we've been giving people free time to try FSD, but we'll start giving more prompts to say, \"Okay, this particular drive, try FSD.\" So that, I mean, because it's literally seeing is believing. Like Elon said, think of it like a cat. It looks like a normal cat, but this cat can sing and dance. Same thing on FSD.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nIt's intelligent.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Yeah. And the 25% comment was 25% increase in the penetration rate since we've seen the release of V12 and V13 in North America. Great. Thank you. Mark, did you have a follow-up question?\n\n[Analyst] (Goldman Sachs)\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Thanks, Travis. Tesla has historically said it would use pricing as one tool to help drive auto vehicle growth as long as free cash flows stayed positive, given the ability to monetize products like FSD. I'm curious how you're thinking about pricing from here as a potential tool to drive increased volumes, given where you stand with FSD, as well as the fact that the IRA purchase tax credits are poised to go away in the US starting in Q4. So should we expect more meaningful price reductions given that monetization potential, or do you envision price reductions being more limited compared to cost downs given where free cash flow now stands? Thanks.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, we're in this weird transition period where we'll lose a lot of incentives in the US. We still have incentives, actually, in many other parts of the world, but we'll lose them in the US. And we'll still be at the relatively early stages of autonomy. On the other hand, autonomy is most advanced and most available from a regulatory standpoint in the US. So I mean, does that mean we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah. We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could. Q4, Q1, maybe Q2. But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I think I'll be surprised if Tesla's economics are not very compelling.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. The next question is going to come from Will from Truist. Will, please feel free to unmute yourself when you're ready.\n\n[Analyst] (Truist)\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I'd like to ask for a little bit more detail about the lower-cost model that you talked about having, I think, started production in the first half, but you said will ramp later. At the last analyst day, as I recall, you talked about some aspects of this, like 2/3 or 3/4 reduction in Silicon Carbide, and not using rare earths in the motor, and perhaps other cost downs. You also had this Unboxed Architecture that I think you said would not be part of this sort of interim approach. Can you update us on what we should expect this thing to actually look like?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nWell, we won't get into the look because.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWhat's the model like? Just leave the cat out of the bag there. Dancing cat that can sing a dance. But it can talk and sing a dance, though. That's the cool part. Yeah. I mean, fundamentally, the biggest obstacle remains that people just don't have an—some people don't want. The desire to buy the car is very high. Just people don't have enough money in their bank account to buy it. Literally, that is the issue. Not a lack of desire, but a lack of ability. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better. I think it's going to be—it will be a very big deal when people can release their car to the fleet and have it earn money for them, which, like I said, I think I feel confident in saying that'll happen next year in the US, at least.\nIn the US, we're legally allowed appropriate disclaimers. That'll make the affordability dramatically greater. Just like if you have an Airbnb and you can rent out your home when you're not there or rent out a guest room or guest house or something like that, the affordability of your home is much greater.\n\n[Analyst] (Truist)\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nOkay. Trying another topic then. We see all these wonderful developments at xAI like Grok. And obviously, Tesla is trying to do quite a bit in AI. Elon, how do you manage the division of efforts, recruiting, talent, and capital between these two that seem like there's a very high potential that they could, in fact, compete?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, they're doing different things here. So xAI is doing terabyte-scale models and multi-terabyte-scale models. Tesla's 100 times smaller models. So one's real-world AI and one's kind of, I guess, artificial superintelligence type of thing. I mean, really kind of the genesis for xAI was that there were certain people who simply would not join Tesla, AI engineers, because they wanted to work on ASI. They would join Tesla. And I was like, \"Well, maybe they'll join a new company.\" And I think the Tesla problem is extremely important, but not everyone agrees with me on that. And so rather than have them join OpenAI, Google, or some other company, it's like, \"Well, have them create a company in that regard,\" which is xAI. So that's, and people can make a decision. Do they want to work on superintelligence at data center or real-world AI?\nKind of, they're both compelling problems, but some people want to work on one and some want to work on the other. Yeah.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. Thank you, everyone, so much for your questions. We will see you next quarter.",

My name is Travis Axelrod, the Head of Investor Relations here at Tesla, and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00PM Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.\nBefore we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nThank you. So, in summary, in Q4, we set a record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year. So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries. Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024. That's worth noting. Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth, number one, was Model Y. We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down, or I don't know what really, I was going to say doubling down on autonomy, but really, it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing, frankly. Doubling is not even enough. We made many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing, AI, and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense. Like, it's in fact to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend.\nI've said this before, and I'll stand by it. I see a path. I'm not saying it's an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far, not even close. Like, maybe several times more than, I mean, there is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined. There's a path to that. I mean, I think it's like an incredibly, it's like a difficult path, but it is an achievable path. So, and that is overwhelmingly due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots. So, our focus is actually building towards that. And that's what we're laying the groundwork. We laid the groundwork for that in 2024. We'll continue to lay the groundwork for that in 2025. In fact, more than lay the groundwork, actually we'll be building the structure.\nWe're building the manufacturing lines. Yeah, I'd like setting up for what I think will be an epic 2026 and a ridiculous 2027 and 2028, ridiculously good. That is my prediction. As yet, very few people understand the value of Full Self-Driving and are able to monetize the fleet. Some of these things I've said for quite a long time, and I know people have said, well, you know, Elon's the boy who cried wolf like several times, but I'm telling you there's a damn wolf this time. You can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf. You know, for a lot of people, their experience of Tesla Autonomy is like, if it's even a year old, if it's even two years old, it's like meeting someone when they're like a toddler and thinking that they're going to be a toddler forever.\nBut obviously, they're not going to be a toddler forever. They grow up. But if their last experience was like, oh, FSD was a toddler, it's like, well, it's grown up now. Have you seen it? It's like walks and talks. And that's really what we've got. And it's difficult for people to understand this because human intuition is linear, as opposed to what we're seeing is exponential progress. So, that's why my number one recommendation for anyone who doubts is simply try it. Have you tried it? When's the last time you tried it? And the only people who are skeptical, the only people who are skeptical are those who have not tried it. So, you know, a car goes, a passenger car typically has only about 10 hours of utility per week out of 168, a very small percentage.\nOnce that car is autonomous, my rough estimate is that it is in use for at least 1/3 of the hours of the week, so call it 50, maybe 55 hours of the week. And it can be used for both cargo delivery and people delivery. So, even let's say people are asleep, but you can deliver packages in the middle of the night, or resupply restaurants, or whatever the case may be, whatever people need at all hours of the day or night. That same asset, the thing that these things that already exist with no incremental cost change, just a software update, now have 5x or more the utility than they currently have. I think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history. Maybe there's something bigger, but I just don't know what it is.\nPeople who look in the rearview mirror are looking for past precedent, except I don't think there is one. So but, you know, the reality of autonomy is upon us. And I repeat my advice, try driving the car or let it drive you. So now it works very well in the US, but of course, it will over time work just as well everywhere else. Yeah. So we're working hard to grow our annual volumes. Our constraint this year, our current constraint is battery packs this year, but we're working on addressing that constraint. And I think we will make progress on addressing that constraint. And then things are really going to go ballistic next year and really ballistic in 2027 and 2028. So yeah. So a bit more on Full Self-Driving. Our Q4 vehicle safety report shows continued year-over-year improvements in safety for vehicles.\nSo, the safety numbers, if somebody has supervised Full Self-Driving turned on or not, the safety differences are gigantic. So, and people have seen the immense improvement with Version 13 and with incremental versions in Version 13. And then Version 14 is going to be yet another step beyond that that is very significant. We launched the Cortex training cluster at Gigafactory Austin, which was a significant contributor to FSD advancement. And we continue to invest in training infrastructure at our Texas headquarters. So, the training needs for Optimus, for Optimus humanoid robot are probably at least ultimately 10x what's needed for the car, at least to get to the full range of useful roles. You can see like how many different roles are there for a humanoid robot versus a car. A humanoid robot has probably, well, a 1000x more uses and more complex things than a car.\nThat doesn't mean the training scales by a 1000, but it's probably, you know, 10x. Now, you can do this progressively. So, it doesn't mean like Tesla is going to spend like $500 billion on training compute because we'll obviously train Optimus to do enough tasks to match the output of Optimus robots. And obviously, the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time. So, but it is like one of those things where I think long-term Optimus will be. Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue. Like, it's really bananas. So, then you can obviously afford a lot of training compute in that situation. In fact, even $500 billion of training compute in that situation would be quite a good deal. Yeah. The future is going to be incredibly different from the past, that's for sure.\nWe live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history. So, yeah. So, the proof is in the pudding. So, we're going to be launching unsupervised Full Self-Driving as a paid service in Austin in June. So, you know, talk with the team. We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, Full Self-Driving in Austin in June. We already have Tesla's operating autonomously unsupervised Full Self-Driving at our factory in Fremont, and we'll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas. So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California. They will soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world for the rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.\nAnd the cars aren't just driving to exactly the same spot because obviously it won't glide at the same spot. The cars are actually programmed with what lane they need to park into to be picked up for delivery. So, they drive from the factory end of line to their destination parking spot to be picked up for delivery to customers. And they're doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day. It's pretty cool. Like I said, Tesla's will be in the wild with no one in them in June in Austin. So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation. It's literally, you know, five, six months away, five months away, type of thing.\nWhile we're stepping into putting our toe in the water gently at first, just to make sure everything's cool, our solution, our sort of our solution is a generalized AI solution. It does not require high precision maps of a locality. So, we just want to be cautious. It's not that it doesn't work beyond Austin. In fact, it does. We just want to put a toe in the water, make sure everything is okay, then, you know, put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in the water with safety of the general public and those in the car as our top priority. With regard to Optimus, obviously, I'm making, you know, these revenue predictions that sound absolutely insane. I realize that. But they are, I think they will prove to be accurate. Yeah.\nNow, with Optimus, there's a lot of uncertainty on the exact timing because it's not like a train arriving at the station for Optimus. We are designing the train and the station, and in real time, while also building the tracks. So they're like, why didn't the train arrive exactly at 12:05? I'm like, we're literally designing the train, the tracks, and the station in real time while you're like, how can we predict this thing with absolute precision? It's impossible. You know, the normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year. Will we succeed in building 10,000 exactly by the end of December this year? Probably not. But will we succeed in making several thousand? Yes, I think we will. Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of year?\nYes, I'm confident they will do useful things. Optimus in use at the Tesla factories for production design one will inform how it will be changed for production design two, which we expect to launch next year. Our goal is to ramp Optimus production faster than maybe anything's ever been ramped, meaning like aspirationally an order of magnitude ramp per year. Now, if we aspire to an order of magnitude ramp per year, perhaps we only end up with a half order of magnitude per year. But that's the kind of growth that we're talking about. It doesn't take very many years before, you know, we're making 100 million of these things a year. If you go up by, let's say, a factor, you know, by 5x per year. Insane. Not 50%, 500%. So, you know, these are big growth numbers. Yeah.\nBut we do need to. This is an entirely new supply chain. It's entirely new technology. There's nothing off the shelf to use. We tried desperately with Optimus to use any existing motors, you know, any actuators, sensors. Nothing worked for a humanoid robot at any price. We had to design everything from physics-first principles to work for a humanoid robot and with the most sophisticated hand that has ever been made before, by far. Optimus will be able to like play the piano and be able to thread a needle. I mean, this is the level of precision no one has been able to achieve. And so it's really something special. So, yeah. So, and my prediction long-term is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of the company. Regarding energy, back to Earth. Earth, Elon. Have you come back there for a minute? Okay. Back to Earth.\nEnergy storage is a big deal and will become, it's already super important, will become incredibly important in the future. And it is something that enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible because the grid, the vast majority of the grid has no energy storage capability. So, they have to design the power plants to, you know, for very high peaks and assuming that there's no energy storage. Once you have grid energy storage and home-based energy storage, the actual total energy output per year of the grid is dramatically greater than people think. Maybe it's at least double. This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to insane, basically as much demand as we can possibly make. So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation and we're building a third factory.\nSo, we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible. Now, there is a challenge here where we have to be careful that we're not rubbing from one pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, we have to say, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications? It can't go both; it's both. So, we have to make that trade-off. Yeah. But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time. So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla.\nAnd when people look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised Full Self-Driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think they may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Optimus car, the Roadster or the Model S or the Model 3 or Model Y. In fact, I think it probably will be viewed 2025 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history. There is no company in the world that is as good at real-world AI as Tesla. I don't even know who's in second place. Like you say, like who's in second place for real-world AI? I would need a very big telescope to see them. That's how far behind they are.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah, I'll talk about things on Earth.\nAs Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records in vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro environment. We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality and our customers who helped us achieve this feat. Coming into the Q4, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business. We accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years. This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options, but also other discounts and programs which impacted ASPs. While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the greater China market.\nThis is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market. On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs and due to the recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases. Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000 driven primarily by material costs. This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for which we recently started taking orders in all markets. All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.\nWhile we feel confident in our team's abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change, and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time. This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter. As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch, but will be overcome as production is ramped. We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025. We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025, and we'll continue to expand our lineup from there. On a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it will continue to get better from here.\nAs always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features, and capable of full autonomy in the future. Despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to mass market, less premium competitors. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, but declined sequentially. This was a result of, sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall. Both businesses continue to be supply constrained and, like Elon mentioned, we're trying to ramp up production with Megafactory, Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards. While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least 50% growth in deployments year-over-year in 2025. Gross profit and margins in the Services and Other business was up year-over-year, but declined sequentially. This was a result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.\nThe businesses within services and other primarily support our new car business, especially through their impact on total cost of ownership. Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the business. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs. Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any sort of supply chain disruption will have an impact on our business and profitability. Our operating expenses grew both year-over-year and sequentially. The biggest driver of the increase was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives. The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.\nFor 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives. It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will take mark-to-market adjustments to other income every reporting period going forward. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite CapEx increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year. CapEx efficiency is something we are extremely focused on. While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize this spend to get immediate benefits. The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role actually helped accelerate the rollout of FSD Version 13.\nAccumulative AI-related CapEx, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately 5 billion. And for 2025, we expect our CapEx to be flat on a year-over-year basis. In conclusion, you know, like Elon says, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla. There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the pace for the next phase of growth. And, you know, it is something which now I'm getting out of Earth, it is going to be out of this world. And we just are putting the right foundation. And that's all I have.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now we will move over to investor questions, and we will start with say.com. The first question is, is unsupervised FSD still planned to be released in Texas and California this year?\nWhat hurdles still exist to make that happen? You addressed the Texas piece, I think, already, so.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, I'm confident that we will release unsupervised FSD in California this year as well. You know, yeah. In fact, I think we will most likely release unsupervised FSD in many regions of the country, of the US, by the end of this year. Like I said, we're just putting a toe in the water, then a few toes, then a foot, then leg, then, you know, make sure everything's cool. And we're looking for a safety level that is significantly above the average human driver. So it's not anywhere like much safer, not like a little bit safer than human, way safer than human.\nSo the standard has to be very high because the moment there's any kind of, you know, accident with an autonomous car, this immediately gets worldwide headlines, even though about 40,000 people die every year in car accidents in the US. And most of them don't even get a mention anywhere. But if somebody scrapes a shin with an autonomous car, it's headline news.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nWe want to avoid that.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So it's really, the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.\nBut people can suddenly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car, allowing a car to drive you around your city, and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were a little concerned, but how many times did you have to intervene for definite safety reasons. You will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYes. What we're seeing is, at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla Full Self-Driving technology.\nWhat we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart, and then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer. That's better than us, you know, sending some CAD drawings. We're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very high. Otherwise, it's just not worth the complexity. We will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised Full Self-Driving working throughout the United States. I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless you have FSD, you're dead.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nYeah. Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Optimus now mostly design locked for 2025 production?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nOptimus is not design locked. So when I say like we're designing the train as it's going to, we're redesigning the train as it's going down the tracks while redesigning the tracks and the train stations.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nEveryone will be on it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, it's rapidly evolving. It's rapidly evolving in a good direction. You know, it's pretty damn amazing, actually. The team's doing a fantastic job. We really have, I think, by far the best team of humanoid robotics engineers in the world. And we also have all the other ingredients necessary, you know, because you need a great battery pack, you need great power electronics, you need great charging capability, you need, you know, great communications, great Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity. And of course, you need real-world AI. And then the ability to scale that production to huge levels. So you have to design for manufacturing.\nThe things that, I mean, really what other companies are missing is they're missing the real-world AI and they're missing the ability to scale manufacturing to millions of units a year.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI think that is an underappreciated thing that industrialization of design is a whole different thing than making design.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, prototypes are trivial, basically. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. I've said that for many years. The problem is that there's like those who have never been involved in production or manufacturing somehow think that once you come up with some eureka design that you magically can make a million units a year. And this is totally false. There needs to be some Hollywood story or where they show actually the problem is manufacturing. I've never even heard of one. You know, it just doesn't fit the narrative.\nThe Hollywood thing is like, it's like some lone inventor in a garage goes eureka and suddenly it files a patent and suddenly there's millions of units. I'm like, I'm listening, guys, we're missing really 99% of the story. 1% is, you know, the old saying of 1%, like a product is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. The Hollywood search is 1% inspiration and minus, but forgets about the 99% perspiration of actually figuring out how to make that initial prototype manufacturable and then manufactured at high volume such that the product is reliable, low cost, consistent, doesn't break down all the time. And that is 100 times harder, at least, than the prototype.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThen you have to get it there, deliver it back and yeah.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, you're going to meet all these regulations, and there's a million regulators around the world. It's very difficult.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you.\nThe next question is also Optimus related. When will Tesla start selling Optimus and what will the price be?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, maybe for this year, we expect to just close the loop with Optimus being used internally at Tesla because we obviously can easily use several thousand humanoid robots at Tesla for, you know, like the most boring, annoying tasks in the factory, like the tasks nobody wants to do where we have to like beg people to do those tasks. And then it's like, like the robots are totally happy to do the boring, dangerous, and repetitive tasks that no humans want to do.\nAnd that's also actually some of the easiest use cases for us to, you know, have Optimus do things like, you know, like load the hopper, like for, you know, like say in the body line, if you're like transporting, you know, pieces of sheet metal to the robot, which is already a robot, the robot welding line for the body, and you just have to nonstop take things out of a, from one fixture to another fixture. And it's a very boring job. That's the kind of thing that Optimus could do.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThe guy who runs around and pumps all the weld studs in the bins.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, there's a ton of boring jobs, tedious jobs, you know, slightly dangerous jobs that are perfect for Optimus. So we expect to use Optimus for those tasks at our factories, and that'll help us close the loop for improvement this year.\nIt's really with production Version Two, which I think launches sometime next year. I'd like it to be the beginning of next year, but maybe it's more like the middle of next year. And then we have to just with a production line that is designed for, you know, on the order of 10,000 units a month versus 1,000 units a month. So when you design a unit for like, when you design a production line for 1,000 units a month, it takes you a while to actually reach anywhere close to 1,000 units a month. When you design, and for any given production output, it takes you a while to actually reach its potential. The current line that we're designing is for roughly 1,000 units a month of Optimus robots. The next line would be for 10,000 units a month.\nThe line after that would be for 100,000 units a month. And I think probably with Version Two, and it's a very rough guess because there's so much uncertainty here, very rough guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next year, something like that. But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it'll go from no one's receiving humanoid robots to these things like coming out like crazy. So we can't build enough. Well, we're always going to be in the we can't build enough situation. Demand will not be a problem, even at a high price.\nThen, as I said, like once we start, once we're at a steady state of above a million units a year, I think the production, and I'm confident at a million units a year that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000. If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less than a car. So I would expect that at similar volumes to, say, the Model Y, which is over a million units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that. What the price of Optimus is, is a different matter. The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nThe next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi and how will it impact revenue and scale?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI can take that one. So we just closed up the Semi factory roof and walls last week in Reno. That has scheduled, which is great with the weather. In Reno, you never know what's going to happen, but we're prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months. The first builds of the high volume Semi design will come late this year in 2025 and begin ramping early in 2026. But as we've said before, you know, the Semi is a TCO no-brainer. It gets really similar to the Optimus, you know, set by how much people pay. And then, you know, as a total cost of ownership, it's much, much cheaper than any other transportation you can have.\nSo at that point, when we're at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to, you know, Tesla's revenue. Well, I think it's difficult to say how much. Anything you want to add, Elon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nNo, I mean, I do think the Tesla Semi, again, with autonomy is going to be incredibly valuable. You know, we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America. That's one of the limiting factors on transport. And, you know, people are human, so they get tired and sometimes, and, you know, there's, you know, I have a lot of respect for truck drivers because it's a tough job. But because it's a tough job, there's not that many people that want to do it. And there's actually fewer, I believe my understanding is correct, there are fewer people entering truck driving as a profession than are leaving it. Yes. So when you think, yeah, exactly.\nSo when you consider, okay, there's more people leaving truck driving as a profession than entering it, well, we're going to have a real logistics problem as time goes by. So autonomy will be very important to meet that need. So like, yeah, it'll, I don't know. It's a several billion a year opportunity, which I don't know in this context is that these days, does several billion a year matter? I think it does. Not nothing. It's probably, you know, it's probably like a $10 billion year thing. Yeah, it's a $1 billion a month at some point, probably. But it's, you know, all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus. So yeah, a billion a month is a lot, but it's not, it's going to be like 1% of Optimus or something, you know.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nWe already covered the next question in opening remarks. So moving on, is it expected that Tesla will need to upgrade Hardware Three vehicles? And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's CapEx? I'm going to refer to cost there.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThey're really asking the tough questions all day.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI guess we at least, you know, we haven't stopped working on Hardware Three yet. We are still making software releases. We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously. And, you know, people are still finding ways, there's still larger models and there's smaller models. So we're not giving up on Hardware Three. We're still working on it. Just the releases will trail the Hardware Four releases.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thanks, Joe.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\nI mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware Three computer for those that have bought Full Self-Driving. And that is the honest answer. And that's going to be painful and difficult, but we'll get it done. Now I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.\nGreat. Thanks, Elon. The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their Solar Roof product?\n\n[Company Representative] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative, Tesla\n\nNo, we're back.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nSorry. Mike. Oh, Mike, go ahead. Yeah.\n\n[Company Representative] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative, Tesla\n\nOh, yeah, I can take it. Yeah, Solar Roof remains a core part of the residential product portfolio, and it still remains or it draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products. We've worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing the SKU count.\nYou know, more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of certified installers. And many of those, they've been installing Solar Roof with us for many years.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, that's actually turned out to be a much better way for the, like, it's just let the roofers just supply product to the roofing industry. And especially when somebody's going to, is getting a new roof anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously this is by far the most efficient time to put in a Solar Roof as opposed to putting a Solar Roof on a house where the roof still has, you know, 20 years of life. That's not economically sensible. But if it's a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then Solar Roof can make a lot of sense. And it is a premium product.\nIt's like the, you know, it's kind of like Model S, Model X or something. It's like a premium product. I think it looks really cool. And your house, I mean, your house generates electricity. And if you combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient. So even if the grid turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works. And your roof looks awesome. So it's like, I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla Solar Roof and the Powerwall. Your family's life might depend on it. Get enough power. And just in terms of convenience, you know, your kids are not going to yell at you because their computers don't work because the power went out and you can't charge your phone. True story. Actually happens. Yeah.\nYou literally can't even cool anyone because your phone's energy.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question was covered in opening remarks, so we will skip that. And the last question from say.com, what technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD given that V13 already covered photons to controls?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, we've got a hell of a lot further than photons to output. We've been in sort of the nothing but nets situation, nothing but neural nets from photons to controls for a while now. So we're just improving the neural nets. I guess we could get into some of the technical details to some degree. I have to say, I continue to be amazed by just how effective autoregressive transformers are at solving a wide range of problems. I mean, Ashok, something you'd like to add there without giving away the sort of family secrets.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nDirector of Autopilot Software, Tesla\n\nI mean, except for things we've put on X already. Yeah, it's continuing to scale the model size a lot. You know, we scale a bunch in V13, but then there's still room to grow. So we're going to continue to scale the model size. We're going to increase the context length even more. The memory is sort of like limited right now. We want to increase the amount of memory in both, like even minutes of context for driving. We're going to add audio and emergency videos better, add like data of the tricky corner cases that we get from the entire fleet, you know, any interventions or any kind of like, you know, user intervention. We just add that to the data, the data set.\nSo scaling in basically every aspect, like training compute, data set size, model size, model context, and also all the reinforcement learning objectives.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. All right. With that, we will move over to analyst questions. So just as a reminder, you will need to unmute yourself to ask your question. And the first question will be coming from Daniel Roeska from Bernstein. Daniel, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nHey, good evening, everybody. It's Daniel from Bernstein. Elon, Tesla's share price clearly already includes quite a few of the anticipated benefits you talked about today, yet realizing what you call kind of difficult but achievable will take some time. What are you pushing the Tesla executive team to do differently now to accelerate the innovation in order to realize the value you described for the company?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, I mean, we're working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month, you know, certainly month over month, but often week over week. I spend a lot of time with the Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimus team. I mean, I go where the problem is, essentially. Like, not, you know, if something's working, this is, you know, unfortunately, sometimes like, you know, talk to a Tesla executive, I'm like, hey, we don't see you very often. I'm like, that's because your stuff is working awesome. Your stuff is working really great. Unfortunately, I don't see them very often because I go where the problem is. So, you know, we're not where the problem is, but like what's the greatest challenge that lies ahead? So obviously there are many challenges with the Optimus. It's a hard problem to solve.\nMany challenges with the vehicle autonomy. But we're making rapid progress in both. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOkay. I mean, it sounds like you've got a conviction that the pieces you need, right, are in place.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nDaniel Roeska\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nIf we kind of go 12 months down the line and we look back and you had some of those, but maybe what are the kind of two or three KPIs that would tell you that, you know, you're on track and it's going the right way and the pieces you've put in place are the right pieces, right? That's kind of what I'm looking for. Or other way around, where would it be most likely in your mind that you say, hey, I need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, I mean, I think the predictions that I'm making here are going to be pretty accurate. You know, and it's worth noting sometimes people say, oh, Elon's always late. Well, actually, no, the problem is that the media reports on when I'm late, but never reports on when I'm early. So sure, I'm optimistic, but I'm not that optimistic. You know, there are many cases in the past where I actually would have been early, you know, such as completion of the Shanghai factory, or factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind. So yeah, so the, but like I said, I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised Full Self-Driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin, and several other cities in America by the end of this year. That's probably everywhere in America next year, and everywhere in North America at least.\nI think in terms of next year, our constraint, I think it's likely to be just regulatory. You know, like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed. You know, there's this, you know, joke like America innovates, Europe regulates. It's like, guys, there's too many refs on the field. I mean, for example, for us just to release, just to release supervised Full Self-Driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority. Then the Netherlands presents this to the EU in, I think, May. And there's like this big EU country committee. We expect it to be approved at that time, but there's nothing we can do to make that May happen sooner.\nIn fact, nobody seems to do. I guess all the countries would have to somehow vote in some way to have it happen sooner than May. Otherwise, we wouldn't have it sooner than May. So then when is unsupervised FSD allowed in Europe? I'm like, maybe next year maybe. I don't know. Well, to find out when the EU is meeting again. Sometimes it's a 12-month cadence, sometimes a six-month cadence. Then in China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they won't, you know, currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won't let us do training in China. So we're in a bit of a bind there. So like a bit of a quandary.\nSo what we're resolving then is by literally looking at videos of streets in China that are available on the internet to understand and then feeding that into our video training so that publicly available video of street signs and traffic rules in China can be used for training. And then also putting it in a very accurate simulator. And so it will train using SIM for, you know, bus lanes in China. Like bus lanes in China, by the way, one of our biggest challenges in making FSD work in China is the bus lanes are very complicated. And there's like literally like hours of the day that you're allowed to be there and not be there. And then if you accidentally go in that bus lane at the wrong time, you get an automatic ticket instantly. So it's kind of a big deal, bus lanes in China.\nSo we're going to put that into our simulator, train on that. The car has to know what time of day it is, read the sign. Anyway, we'll get the salt. But, you know, I think we'll have unsupervised FSD in almost every market this year, limited simply by regulatory issues, not technical capability. And then unsupervised FSD in the US this year, in many cities, but nationwide next year. And hopefully we have unsupervised FSD in most countries by the end of next year. That's my prediction with the best data that I have right now.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, everybody. So Elon, you've said in the past about LiDAR, that for AVs at least, that LiDAR is a crutch that pulls errant.\nI think you even told me once, even if it was free, you'd say you wouldn't use it. You still feel that way?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYes.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nCare to elaborate or just I have another question.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nLook, we even have a radar in the car and we turned it off.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI got it. All right. So you're still, yeah, people think you're crazy, you know, but for now,\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nobviously humans drive without shooting lasers out of their eyes. I mean, unless you're Superman, you know, but like humans drive just with passive visual, humans drive with eyes and a neural net and a brain neural net. So sort of biological, which is so the digital equivalent of eyes and a brain are cameras and digital neural nets or AI. So that's the entire road system was designed for passive optical neural nets.\nThat's how the whole road system was not designed and what everyone's expecting other cars. That's how we expect other cars to behave. So therefore that is very obviously the solution for Full Self-Driving as a generalized, but the generalized solution for Full Self-Driving as opposed to the very specific, you know, neighborhood by neighborhood solution, which is very difficult to maintain, which is what our competitors are doing. Yeah, yeah.\n\n[Company Representative] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative, Tesla\n\nI mean, LiDAR doesn't work in the fog, guys.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nLiDAR has a lot of issues. Like I don't have something like the SpaceX Dragon docks with the space station using LiDAR, that's a program that I've personally spearheaded. I don't have some fundamental bizarre dislike of LiDAR. It's simply the wrong solution for driving cars on roads.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nRight. You understand how LiDAR works. I get it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nLiterally designed and built our own red LiDAR.\nI oversaw the project, the engineering of the thing. It was my decision to use LiDAR on Dragon. And I oversaw that engineering project directly. So I'm like, we literally designed and made a radar, a LiDAR to dock with the space station. If I thought it was the right solution for cars, I would do that, but it isn't.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. All right. Just as a follow-up at CES, you said, I'm paraphrasing, that any AI will be able to do any cognitive task not involving atoms within the next three or four years. And that would imply, Elon, that before the end of President Trump's term in office, that AI would be moving pretty damn quickly into the physical world, into the world of photons and atoms.\nI'm thinking, given your work with the administration, how confident are you that the US will have the manufacturing and the supply base to make good on your excitement about physical AI by the, you know, end of, by the latter of this decade? We seem pretty vulnerable right now. I've seen you tweeting about, or sorry, X saying, excuse me, Elon, about China, Freudian slip, about China having like making more drones in a day than the US makes in a year and all the entanglement of the supply. So what has to happen in the US to make that possible? What's your message, what can you do about it, and what's relevant for Tesla shareholders? Thanks, Elon.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, at Tesla, obviously we think manufacturing is cool. SpaceX, we think manufacturing is cool.\nBut in general, for talented Americans, they need to go beyond, you know, beyond my companies, beyond me and the people in my teams here. In general, we need to make manufacturing cool again in America. And, you know, like I honestly think people should move from like law and finance into manufacturing. That's my honest opinion. We have too much; this is both a compliment and a criticism. We have too much talent in law and engineering, law and finance in America. And there should be more of that talent in manufacturing. So, yeah. I mean, at Tesla, we're making sure that we can continue to manufacture our stuff even in the event of geopolitical tensions rising to very high levels.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Pierre Ferragu at New Street. Pierre, please feel free to unmute yourself.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nHey, thanks guys.\nI'll take the question. So I have a question, Elon, on deploying like robotaxis in June in Austin. So that's great news. And I was wondering if it means I can, you know, drive down to Austin in June and try and try unsupervised by myself with my car. Or it's going to be more like your fleet testing it?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla",
    "content2": "It'll be our fleet testing it. So that's our sort of toe in the water. You know, we scrutinize any very carefully, make sure it's not something we missed. But it will be, you know, autonomous ride-hailing for money in Austin in June. And then as swiftly as possible, other cities in America. And I expect us to be operating, doing unsupervised activity with our internal fleet in several cities by the end of the year.\nThen it's probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet. So, you know, kind of like Airbnb where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guest room. You know, you can say like add it to the Airbnb inventory or don't add it to the Airbnb inventory. You know, if you're traveling for a month, you can, or whatever, in case maybe you can let other people use your house. And then you can, anyway, so like that's probably next year because we want to just make sure we've ironed out any kinks. And a lot of it is, it's not like we're not splitting the atom here. It's just a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently, that people can order the car.\nIt comes, you know, to the right spot, does exactly the right thing. All the payment systems work, the billing works. Yeah.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nOkay. But then, like, so my sort of question would be, you know, I have a Tesla, I have FSD, and I have to keep my eyes on the road all the time. It's super boring because I don't really need to intervene anymore. But the really annoying thing is that I can't just check my emails. And so are you working also on introducing, you know, like a kind of like FSD unsupervised where I could be eyes off and I would be able to check my email and would just need to, with a five-second notice, have to go back and keep an eye on what's happening? Or is that something you're working on as well? Because it feels so close.\nWe're certain that I wonder if it's something we could expect for this year. It's a very selfish question. I ask for myself, to be honest.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYes. We need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before we're able to check their email and text messages. In fact, right now we're in this perverse situation, which you may have encountered yourself, where people will actually go to manual driving to check their text messages so the computer doesn't yell at them and then put it back on autonomous mode once they've checked their text messages, which is obviously less safe,\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nsignificantly less safe,\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nsignificantly less safe than just letting people check their text once in a while without the computer yelling at them. But we just want to be cautious about that at the advent of that.\nWe're in this sort of, you know, neither here nor there. But just for, I mean, I think it's not for many months longer. But yeah, we're in this perverse situation where people will turn the car off autopilot so the computer doesn't yell at them, check their text messages while steering the car with their knee, and not looking out the window.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nDirector of Autopilot Software, Tesla\n\nAnd yeah, like Elon said, right? If you have any problems with the system, and when people are not looking, that is a dangerous thing. And that's what we're trying to avoid. It's the capability is getting there, but it's not fully there. That's why he was using the term of dipping a toe in the water, then getting comfortable, then keep going.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nAnyway, it's not far off.\nBut we want to prove to ourselves, prove to ourselves, and obviously prove to regulators that the car is unequivocally safer in autonomous mode than not. And we're not far off. So this is like low single-digit months.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nDirector of Autopilot Software, Tesla\n\nTo the safety aspect, we did publish our vehicle safety report today. And Q4 was one crash for every 5.9 million miles driven compared to a crash every 700,000 miles without qualifying.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nRight. So we're getting to the point where it's an order of magnitude.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nDirector of Autopilot Software, Tesla\n\nYeah, it's like 8.5x safely now. So it's just about there.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah,\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nManaging Partner, New Street\n\nit's amazing.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. All righty. And our last question will be coming from Dan Levy at Barclays. Dan, feel free to unmute yourself.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question.\nElon, you've talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as part of sort of broader push to sustainable energy. I know we've heard a lot about President Trump's plans to reverse the EV mandate. And I think there's a view that given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the US. So what would be your view on the right policy in the US given your comments in the past of the need to push for sustainable transport?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYou know, at this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable. I'm highly confident that all transport will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it simply, it can't be stopped any more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, the steam engine, or one could have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine.\nLike even if you've been the biggest horse advocate on earth, like all the horses are the way, not these newfangled car automobiles, you can't stop the advent of the automobile. It's going to happen. You can't stop the advent of electric cars. It's going to happen. The only thing holding back electric cars was range, and that is a solved problem.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. As a follow-up, you know, in the past, Elon, you had made a comment that, you know, you'd be willing to sell cars at effectively no margin to get the cars out there. There's a comment in the release today of the rate of acceleration of autonomy efforts does impact volume growth.\nSo perhaps you could just talk about, you know, with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nSo I'm not sure I understand the question. We have a lot of cars. I mean, we've got millions of cars out there.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nDirector of Autopilot Software, Tesla\n\nSo is there a question then that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAnd go ahead and unmute yourself, Dan.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, more so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to, you know, sell your cars versus, you know, in light of your improvements on FSD?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, right now the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.\nSo now Q1, we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example, that obviously has a short-term impact on output. But the problem we're wrestling with, in fact, that the executive team and I were talking about just before this call, was how we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one way or another. That's the constraint on our output.\n\nTravis Axelrod\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nGreat. All righty. And with that, I think we are all done for today. So thanks everyone so much for all of your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. Goodbye."

These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThank you. So to recap, we saw large adoption acceleration in EVs and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs. So there have been quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market, and mostly they have not done well, but they have discounted their EVs quite substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla. We don't see this as a long-term issue, but really as fairly short-term. And we still firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just of cars, but also of aircraft and boats.\nDespite many challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing, and we did achieve record quarterly revenues. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business. We're investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and a great deal of infrastructure to support future products. We won't get too much into the product roadmap here because that is reserved for product announcement events. But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.\nReally, by far, the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. In addition to that, we have scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world. So while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotics stack, we are pursuing all of them. This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.\nRegarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2, and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well-supervised Full Self-Driving works. Version 12.5 has five times the parameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks. So the highway stack is still, at this point, pretty old. So often the issues people encounter are on the highway, but with 12.5, we finally merged the two stacks.\nI still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand the system better to simply try it out and let the car drive you around. One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car, and when picking up a car for service, to just show people how to use it and just drive them around the block. Once people use it at all, they tend to continue using it. So it's very compelling. And then this, I think, will be a massive demand driver.\nEven unsupervised Full Self-Driving will be a massive demand driver. And as we increase the mile between intervention, it will transition from supervised Full Self-Driving to unsupervised Full Self-Driving, and we can unlock massive potential in the fleet. We postponed the Robotaxi product unveil by a couple of months, where it's shifted to 10/10, so the 10 October 2024.\nI wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the Robotaxi, the main thing that we're going to show. We're also going to show a couple of other things. Moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple of other things for the product unveil. We're also nearing completion of the south expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date.\nThis will be an incrementAI50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our Hardware 4.0 AI5 Tesla AI computer. With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory, and we expect to have Optimus production version one in limited production starting early next year. This will be for Tesla consumption. It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.\nWe expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories. And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point, we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers. They'll be production version two of Optimus. For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else. We are really demand constrained rather than production constrained. So we're ramping up production in our US factory as well as building our Megafactory in China that should roughly double our output. Maybe more than double, maybe triple potentially.\nSo in conclusion, we're super excited about the progress across the board. We're changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy. The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright. I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.\nAlthough the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet. It takes valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number. ARK Invest thinks on the order of $5 trillion. I think they're probably not wrong. Long-term Optimus, I think, achieves a valuation several times that number. I want to thank the Tesla team for strong execution, and looking forward to exciting years ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Elon. Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks. As Elon mentioned, the Tesla team rose to the occasion yet again and delivered on all fronts with some notable records. In addition to those records, we saw our automotive deliveries go sequentially. I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts in delivering a great quarter. On the auto business front, affordability remains top of mind for customers, and in response, in Q2, we offered attractive financing options to offset sustained high interest rates. These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter.\nThese impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs. We're now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world. This is the best time to buy a Tesla. I mean, if you're waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car. We had a record quarter on Regulatory Credits revenues as well. On net, our auto margins remain flat sequentially. It is important to note that the demand for Regulatory Credits is dependent on other OEMs' plans for the kind of vehicles they're manufacturing and selling, as well as changes in regulations.\nWe pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the US, but in Europe, and China as well for the respective factories. As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price. We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have an estimated range of more than 300mi on a single charge. We believe this, along with the expansion of our Supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.\nSince the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen adoption rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further. Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck. While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side, and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.\nAdditionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3, and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods. While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately, it may have an impact on the cost in the near term.\nWe previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results. Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profits for the energy business. Energy storage backlog is strong.\nAs discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period, with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline. Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness, and in case of EPC projects on construction activities. Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.\nThe impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring and other on the income statement. Just to level set, this was about $642 million of charge, which got recorded in the period. I want people to remember that we've called it out separately on the financials. Sequentially, our operating expenses, excluding surcharges, reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related activities and higher legal, and other costs.\nOn the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50,000 GPU cluster online. This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives. We reverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2.\nThis was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter, and we ended the quarter with over $30 billion of cash and investments. Once again, we've begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed. It will take some time, but it will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now let's go to investor questions. The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWith respect to the Roadster, we've completed most of the engineering, and I think there's still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with the Roadster next year.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt'll be something special, like a whole thing, I think.\n\nOperator\n\nFantastic. The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we've already covered. We'll go to the next question. When do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI guess that's really just a question of when do I expect the first, when can we do unsupervised Full Self-Driving? It's difficult. Obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that it's far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised, possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year. So next year seems highly probable to me based on simply plotting the points on the curve of miles between interventions that trend exceeds humans for sure next year. So yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it. Do you have plans to expand the Cyber vehicle lineup to a Cyber SUV or Cyber van?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a specific product announcement event rather than earnings calls.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp-up progressing?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. 4680 production ranks strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly. We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive costs down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.\nWe built our first validation Cybertruck with Dry Cathode Process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone, and we're super proud of that. We're on track for production launch with the Dry Cathode Process in Q4, and this will enable cell costs to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is: Any update on Dojo?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware. What we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs. There just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them. I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to ensure that we've got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo.\nI think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high, and it's obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high. I think we've really got to make Dojo work, and we will.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. The next question is, what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nOptimus tends to be a generalized humanoid robot with a lot of intelligence. So it's like saying what kind of accessories would be offered with a human. It's just really intense to be able to be backwards compatible with human tasks. So it would use any accessories that a human would use.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is, do you feel you're cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe are doing some advertising. So you wanna say something?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah, I'll say something. Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best product at a reasonable price to the consumers. Just to give you a fact, in the US alone in Q2, over 2/3 of our sales were to people who had never owned a Tesla before, which is encouraging. We spent money on advertising and other awareness programs, and we have adjusted our strategy. We're not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play, and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting in the later half of this year as well.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks. So we'll move on to the next one. What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico, and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, we currently are poised on Giga Mexico. I think we need to see just where things stand after the election. Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico. So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case. So we kind of need to see where things play out politically. However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly. And I should say that the Cyber Taxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nAs will Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production version two, the high-volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just a couple more. Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThere are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla Full Self-Driving. I suspect there will be more over time, but we can't comment on the details of those discussions.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you. And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI should say that Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI. It's been actually helpful in advancing Full Self-Driving and in building up the new Tesla data center. With regard to investing in xAI, I think we'd need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment. But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, but I think we need a vote on that. And I think that there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla software, yes.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. Now we will move on to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist. Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nWill Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Truist\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking my question. This relates a little bit to the last one that was asked. Elon, I share your strong enthusiasm about AI, and I recognize Tesla's opportunity to do some great things with the technology. But there are some concerns I have about Tesla's commercialization, and that's what I'd like to ask about.\nSpecifically, there were some news stories through the quarter that indicated that you redirected some AI compute systems that were destined for Tesla instead to xAI, or perhaps it was to x. I'm not sure. Similarly, a few quarters ago, if you recall, I asked about your ability to hire engineers in this area, and you noted that there was a great desire for some of these engineers to work on projects that you were involved with, but some of them weren't at Tesla.\nThey were instead at xAI or perhaps even x again. So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures, and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them? Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, I think you're referring to an old article regarding GPUs. I think that's like six or seven months old. Tesla said we had no place to turn them on. So it would have been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to order H100s and have no place to turn them on. So it was just that this wasn't a, \"Let's pick xAI over Tesla.\" There was no that the Tesla data centers were full.\nThere was no place to actually put them. We've been working 24/7 to complete the south extension on the Tesla Giga Texas here in Texas. That south extension is what will house the 50,000 H100s. And we're beginning to move the H100 server racks into place there. But we really needed that to be complete physically.\nYou can't just order GPUs and turn them on with no; you need a data center. It's not possible. So I want to be clear that that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest. Does Tesla want GPUs that can't turn on? The split second that south extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week, we are moving GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.\nWith regard to xAI, there are people that only want to work on AGI. So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI, not Tesla-specific problems, and they want to start doing a startup. So it was a case of either they go to a startup and I'm involved, or they do a startup and I'm not involved. Those are the two choices. This wasn't, oh, they would come to Tesla. They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances. So yeah.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum, and there are a lot of things which we are focused on Full Self-Driving as Tesla and also Optimus. But there's the other spectrum of AI which we're not working on, and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do, in this case, xAI. So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum. It's not just one specific thing.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. And once again, I want to just repeat myself here. I tried to recruit them to Tesla, including to say, You can work on AGI if you want, and they refused. Only then was xAI created.\n\nWill Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Truist\n\nI really appreciate that clarification. If I can ask one follow-up, it relates to the new vehicles that you're planning to introduce next year. I understand this is not the venue for product announcements, but when we think about the focus, I've heard on the one hand that the focus is on cost reduction. On the other hand, you also said that the Roadster would come out. Should we expect other maybe more limited variants, like similar to the cars that you make today, but with some changes or improvements or some other variability in the form factors? Should we expect that to be a significant part of the strategy in the next year or two?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI don't want to get into the details of product announcements, and we have to be careful of the Osborne Effect here. So if you start announcing some great thing, it affects our near-term sales. We're going to make great products in the future just like we have in the past. End of story.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nBen Kallo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term? And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue? And then my follow-up is just on the last call, you talked about distributing compute on your new hardware. Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it, and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power in their cars? Thanks.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else with Tesla combined. So it's simply just something to consider the usefulness, utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you ask of it. I think everyone I know that's going to want one. There's 8 billion people I know, so that's 8 billion right there. Then you've got all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more.\nSo I suspect that the long-term demand for general-purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units. And Tesla is the most advanced humanoid robot in the world and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not. And we've got a lot of experience with the most experience with the world leaders in real-world AI.\nWe have all of the ingredients. I think we're unique in having all of the ingredients necessary for large-scale, high-utility generalized humanoid robots. But that's why my rough estimate long-term is in accordance with the ARK Invest analysis of market cap of on the order of $5 trillion, maybe more, for autonomous transport. And it's several times that number for general-purpose humanoid robots. I mean, at that point, I'm not sure what money even means. But in the benign AI scenario, we're headed for an age of abundance where there is no shortage of goods and services. Anyone can have pretty much anything they want. It's a very wild future we're headed for.\n\nBen Kallo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nAnd on the distributed compute?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Distributed compute, that seems like a pretty obvious thing to do. I think where the distributed compute becomes interesting is with our next-generation Tesla AI chip, which is Hardware 5 or what we're calling AI5, which is from the standpoint of inference capability comparable to a V200, an embedded V200. We're aiming to have that in production at the end of next year and scale production in 2026. So it does seem like if you've got autonomous vehicles that are operating for 50 or 60 hours a week, there's 168 hours in a week. So you have somewhere above, I think, 100 neural net computing. I think we need a better word than GPU because GPU means graphics plus in units.\nSo there's 100 hours plus per week of AI inference compute from the fleet, from the vehicles, and probably some percentage from the humanoid robots that it would make sense to do distributed inference. And if there's a fleet of, at some point, 100 million vehicles with AI5 and beyond, AI6 and AI7 and whatnot, and there may be billions of humanoid robots, that is just a staggering amount of inference compute that could be used for general-purpose computing. It doesn't have to be used for the humanoid robot or for the car. So I think that's a pretty obvious thing to say, like, \"Well, it's more useful than having to do nothing.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper. Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper\n\nPerfect. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing. You mentioned that in passing previously. I was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that would work. I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug-and-play proposition. Presumably, an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on FSD.\nI imagine they would need to adopt Tesla's electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack. So correct me if I'm sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you'd be able to recognize licensing revenue from that agreement. Is that the right way to think about that?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYes. The OEMs do not move fast. There's not really a sensor suite. It's just cameras. But they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a 360-degree view. And at least the gateway, like what talks to the internet and communicates with the Tesla system, you need kind of a gateway computer too. So it's really gateway computer with the cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, the Tesla AI computer, and seven cameras or enough cameras to get a 360-degree view. But given the speed at which the auto industry moves, it would be several years before you would see this in volume.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper\n\nOkay. Good. That's more or less what I expected. So then the follow-up here is, if you did sign an FSD licensing agreement with another automaker, when do you think you would disclose that? Would you do it right when you sign the agreement or only after that multiple years have passed and the vehicle is ready to be rolled out?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI think it depends on the OEM. The OEM, I guess, would be happy either way.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It depends on what kind of arrangement we enter into. A lot of those things are not ironed out yet. We'll make that determination as and when we get to that point.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThe kind of deals that are obviously relevant are only if some OEM is willing to do this in a million cars a year or something significant, not if it's like 10,000 or 100,000 cars a year. We could just make that ourselves.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I wanted to start with a question on Shanghai. You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center, really due to its low cost. That makes sense. Maybe you can just give us a sense of how the strategy changes, if at all, given the implementation of tariffs in Europe. Also, to what extent your import of batteries from China into the US, how that might change given the tariffs. Thank you.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being imported from China into Europe. While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second round.\nThey visited our factory. We worked with them, provided them all the information. As a result, we are adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe. And one other thing to note is in Q2 itself, we started building right-hand Model Ys out of Berlin, and we also delivered it in the UK. And we're adjusting as needed, but we will keep adjusting. We're still importing Model 3s into Europe out of Shanghai.\nWe are still evaluating what is the best alternate demand. There's all this. Just on the examination by the European authorities, like I said, we cooperated with them well. We are confident that we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now. But this is literally evolving, and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this. I would also add that because of this, you've seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into places like Taiwan as well as the UK, I just mentioned. So it will keep changing, and we will keep adapting as we go about it.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thanks. [Unaudible]\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah. Thank you. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the Robotaxi strategy. And specifically, the shareholder deck here notes that the release is going to be one of the gating factors, is regulatory approval. So maybe you can help us understand which regulations specifically are the ones that we should be looking for. Is it FMVSS? That's a standard. And then to what extent does the strategy shift? You've done with FSD more of a nationwide no-boundary approach. Is the Robotaxi approach one that's more geofenced, so to speak, and is more driven by a state-by-state approach?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, our solution is a generalized solution like what everybody else has. If you see a Waymo and whatnot, they have a very localized solution that requires high-density mapping. It's quite fragile. So their ability to expand rapidly is limited. Our solution is a general solution that works anywhere. It would even work on a different Earth. So if you rendered a new Earth, it would work on a new Earth. So there's capability. I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human, we find that regulators are supportive of deployment of that capability.\nIt's difficult to argue with if you've got billions of miles that show that in the future, Unsupervised FSD is safer than human. What regulator could really stand in the way of that? They're morally obligated to approve. So I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor. I should also say that the self-driving capabilities that are deployed outside of North America are far behind that in North America. So with version 12.5 and maybe 12.6, but pretty soon, we will ask for regulatory approval of the Tesla-supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries. And I think we're likely to receive that before the end of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWhich will be a helpful demand driver in those regions, obviously.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Tesla\n\nJust a heads up, Travis. In terms of, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in the US, which is NHTSA, which is the same across all 50 states. The road rules are the same across all 50 states. So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all 50 states reasonably. Of course, there are state and even local municipal-level regulations that may apply to being a transportation company or deploying taxis. But as far as getting the vehicle on the road, that's all federal, and that's very much in line with what Elon was just suggesting about the data and the vehicle itself.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nTo add to the technology point, the end-to-end network basically makes no assumption about the location. You could add data from different countries, and it would just perform equally well there. There's almost close to zero US-specific code in there. It's all just the data that comes from the US.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Tesla\n\nYeah. To that end, the show gets like we can go as humans to other countries and drive with some reasonable amount of assessment in those countries. That's how you design the FSD software.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nGeorge Gianarikas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Canaccord\n\nHi everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second. I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal-less, wheel-less vehicle. According to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory environment.\nFrom what we understand, and again, maybe I'm wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown, at least in images of the public, is also pedal-less and wheel-less. Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn't have pedals or a wheel? May that be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle? Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, obviously, the real reason that they canceled it is because GM can't make it work, not because of regulators. They're blaming regulators. That's misleading attempts to do so because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets. So it's just that their technology is not up to PAR.\n\nGeorge Gianarikas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Canaccord\n\nRight. And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the price. Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means exactly? Thank you.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, we've shared that we've seen a meaningful increase. I don't want to get into specifics because we started from a low base, but we are seeing encouraging results. And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can't describe it till the time we actually use it. And that's why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being sure how this thing is working. Because when you see it working, you realize how great it is.\nI mean, just to give you one example, so again, there's a biased example, but I have a more than 20-mile commute into the factory almost every day. I have zero interventions on the latest app. And the car just literally drives me over. Especially with the latest version wherein we're also tracking your eye movement, the steering wheel lag is almost not there as long as you're not wearing sunglasses.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, we're fixing the sunglasses. It's coming soon. So you will be able to drive. You will be able to have sunglasses on and have the car drive. So there's been a number of times I've talked with smart people who live in New York or maybe downtown Boston and don't ever drive and then are asking me about FSD. And I'm like, \"You can just get a car and drive it.\" And if you're not doing that, you have no idea what's going on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Pierre from New Street. Pierre, please unmute yourself.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nAnalyst, New Street\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So it's on Robotaxi again, and I completely get it that with a universal solution, we will get regulatory approval. We get there eventually, clicking at miles and compute, etc. And my question is more, how you think about deployments? Because I'm still like, I'm thinking once you have a car that can drive everywhere, that can replace me, it can replace the taxi. But then to do the ride-hailing service, you need a certain scale.\nThat means a lot of cars on the road. And so you need an infrastructure to just maintain the cars, take care of them, etc. And so my question is, are you already working on that? Do you have already an idea of what your plan to deploy looks like? Is that like a Tesla-only plan, or are you looking at partners, local partners, global partners to do that? I'll have a quick follow-up.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThis would just be the Tesla network. You just literally open the Tesla app and summon a car and send a car to pick you up and take you somewhere. We'll have a fleet that's, I don't know, on the order of 7 million that are capable of autonomy soon. In the years to come, it'll be over 10 million, then over 20 million. This is immense scale. The car is able to operate 24/7, unlike the human driver. So there's basically instant scale with a software update. Now this is for a customer-owned fleet. You can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb. You can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet or cancel that and bring it back. It can be used by the fleet all the time.\nIt can be used by the fleet some of the time. Then Tesla would share in the revenue with the customer. But you can think of the giant fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet, Airbnb on wheels. I mean, then in addition, we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be added to the fleet. I guess that would be a bit more like Uber. But this would all be a Tesla network. And there's an important clause we've put in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be used in the Tesla fleet. They cannot be used by a third party for autonomy.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nAnalyst, New Street\n\nOkay. And do you think that scales progressively so you can start in a city with just a handful of cars and you grow the number of cars over time? Or do you think there is a critical mass you need to get to be able to offer a service that is of competitive quality compared to what Uber would be typically delivering already?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI guess I'm not conveying this correctly. The entire Tesla fleet basically becomes active. Now, this is obviously maybe there's some number of people who don't want their car to earn money, but I think most people will. It's instant scale.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, please unmute yourself.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nHead of Sustainable Growth and Resource Optimization, Oppenheimer\n\nSorry about that, guys. I've got two questions around energy storage. With the tight supply and the stationary storage, can you talk about your pricing strategy and how you're thinking about saturation and given geographies, given that some of these larger systems are starting to shift wholesale power markets in a pretty meaningful way quickly?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nSo yeah, I mean, we are working with a large set of players in the market, and our pipeline is actually pretty long. And there's actually a long end in terms of where you enter into a contract to where delivery starts happening. And so far, we have good pricing leverage. And I'll have Mike chime in on this too.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, there's a lot of competition from Chinese OEMs, just like there is in the vehicle space. So we're in close contact with our customers and making sure that we're remaining competitive in where they're needing to be competitive to secure contracts to sell power and energy in the markets. We had a really strong contract in quarter and continue to build our backlog for 2025 and 2026. So we feel pretty good about where we are in the market. We realize that competition is strong, but we have a pretty strong value proposition with offering a fully integrated product with our own power electronics and site-level controls, so.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Again, the aspect which people do not fully understand is that there's also a whole software stack which comes with our Megapack. That is a unique proposition which is only available to us. We're using it with other stuff too, but that gives us a much more of an edge as compared to the competition.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Yeah. We find customers that they can sort of put together a hodgepodge solution, and then sometimes they'll pick that solution, and then that doesn't work. And then they come back to us.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nYeah. And we're not really seeing saturation on a global scale. There's little pockets of saturation in different markets, but we're more seeing that there's markets opening up given demand on the grid just continues to increase more than anyone expects. So that just opens up markets really across the world in different pockets.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Just even on the AI computer side, these GPUs are really powerful. And the amount of new pipeline which we're getting for people for data center backup and things like that is increasing at a pretty large scale.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nHead of Sustainable Growth and Resource Optimization, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks so much. Then the follow-up here is around the 4680 process technology and the roll-to-roll process. There's some news around your equipment suppliers. Can you talk about how far along you are in potentially qualifying an incremental supplier around some of those critical process technology steps?\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nYeah. I can talk about that. As you're probably referring to the lawsuit that we have with one of our suppliers, look, I don't think this is going to affect our ability to roll out 4680. We have a very strong IP position in the technology, and the majority of the equipment that we use is in-house designed, and some of it's in-house built. And so we can take our IP stack and have someone else build it if we need to. So that's not really a concern right now.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think people don't understand just how much demand there will be for storage. It really is the people, I think, are underestimating this demand by probably orders of magnitude. So the actual total energy output of, say, the US grid, if the power plants can operate at steady state, is at least two to three times the amount of energy it currently produces because there are huge gaps.\nThere's a huge difference from peak to trough in terms of energy or power generation. So in order for a grid to not have blackouts, it must be able to support the load at the worst minute of the worst day of the year, the coldest or hottest day, which means that for the rest of the time, the rest of the year, it's got massive excess power generation capability, but it has no way to store that energy.\nOnce you add battery packs, you can now run the power plants at steady state. Steady state means that basically any given grid anywhere in the world can produce in terms of cumulative energy in the course of the year at least twice what it is currently producing. In some cases, maybe three times.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThe next very profound thing.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Elon. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, please unmute yourself.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Do you hear me?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYep.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Oh, okay. Sorry. I guess I'm going to ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut. I think, Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn't survive on EV subsidies. But wouldn't Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away? I think Model Y, Model 3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your batteries get production tax credits. So just one, can you clarify if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near term? Why might it not be a negative? And then any framing of the current support you get IRA-related.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, I guess that there would be some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors, and it would hurt Tesla slightly. But long-term, probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess. Yeah. But I've said this before in these calls. The value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy. So I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla will sell vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. If you believe Tesla will sell autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are in the noise.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, I'll ask this just to clarify a few things. That, at the end of the day, when we are looking at our business, we've always been looking at it whether or not IRA is there. And we want our business to grow healthy without having any subsidies coming in, whichever way you look at it. And that's the way we have always modeled everything. And that is the way internally also, even when we're looking at battery costs, yes, there are manufacturing credits which we get, but we always drive ourselves to say, \"Okay, what if there's no IRA benefit? And how do we operate in that kind of an environment?\"\nLike Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to our competition on that front. We've delivered it, and we can see it in the numbers over the years. You cannot ignore the fundamental size of the business. On top of it, once you add autonomy to it, like Elon said, it becomes meaningless to even think about the short term.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThanks, Axel.",

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00PM Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThanks, Martin. So to recap, in Q1, we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp for the updated Model 3 in Fremont. There was, as we've all seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure, and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead. We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market. Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment, and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business. And that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead. It will increase. We actually know that it will. So significantly faster than the car business, as we expected.\nWe also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially. In terms of the new product roadmap, there's been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the past several weeks. We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025. So we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year. These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line. It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.\nWe think this should allow us to get to over three million vehicles of capacity when we realize the full extent. Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out. It's profound. The rate of improvement is rapid. We've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer, everything from Hardware 3 on in North America. It's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles. We're seeing about half of people use it so far. That percentage is increasing with each passing week. We now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.\nSince the launch of Full Self-Driving, Supervised Full Self-Driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy. It's really how humans drive. Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes. So naturally, cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system. To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out. And as we've announced, we'll be showcasing our purpose-built robotaxi or Cybercab in August. Yeah. Regarding AI compute, over the past few months, we've been actively working on expanding Tesla's core AI infrastructure. For a while there, we were training constrained in our progress. We are, at this point, no longer training constrained. And so we're making rapid progress.\nWe've installed and commissioned, meaning they're actually working, 35,000 H100 computers or GPUs. GPU is the wrong word. They need a new word. I always feel like a wince when I say GPU because it's not GPU, G stands for graphics, and it's a new graphics. But anyway, roughly 35,000 H100s are active. And we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year. And training, just for training. We are making sure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training. It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used. So in conclusion, we're super excited about our autonomy roadmap. I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving Version 12 in a Tesla that it is only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans. And not much time at that.\nWe're really headed for an electric vehicle and autonomous future. I'll go back to something I said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone. That will become very obvious in hindsight. We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future. I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead. Thanks.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you very much. And Vaibhav has some comments as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks. You know, it's important to acknowledge what Elon said. From our auto business perspective, we did see a decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter. Those were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons which Elon had mentioned earlier. Auto margins declined from 18.9% to 18.5. Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per-unit costs and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the US that previously did not have that functionality. Additionally, while we did experience higher costs due to the ramp of Model 3 in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives. In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model 3 ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark auto margins improved slightly.\nCurrently, normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont. Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team in executing Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business. We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite for credits. That means a steady stream of revenue for us. Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want. We would prefer it the whole industry went all in. On the demand front, we have undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD, launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the US for $299 a month, and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.\nWe believe that our awareness activities paired with attractive financing will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products. Our energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%. We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023. Accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability. Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control. Deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing, and other activities. We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.\nThe primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries, as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute. We expect the inventory build to reverse in Q2 and free cash flow to return to positive again. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our headcount by over 10%. The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis. We are also getting hyper-focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner. The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions, will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.\nIn conclusion, the future is extremely bright, and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding. Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results. We can open it up to Q&A.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Okay. Let's start with investor Q&A. The first question is, what is the status of 4680? What is the current output? Lars?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nSure. 4680 production increased about 18% to 20 from Q4, reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about 7 GWh per year, as we posted on X. We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2, as we ramp the third to fourth lines in phase one, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we're ahead of the ramp. Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week, driven by yield improvements throughout the lines and production volume increases. So our goal, and we expect to do this, is to beat supplier costs of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The second question is on Optimus. So what is the current status of Optimus? Are they currently performing any factory tasks? When do you expect to start mass production?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe are able to do simple factory tasks, or at least I should say factory tasks in the lab. In terms of actually, we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the factory, in the actual factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year. Then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year. These are just guesses. As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined. Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robot that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy. So that's what's going to happen. I think Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with efficient inference on the robot itself.\nI mean, this passes a point that is worth emphasizing. Tesla's AI inference efficiency is vastly better than any other company. There's no company even close to the inference efficiency of Tesla. We've had to do that because we were constrained by the inference hardware in the car. We had no choice. But that will pay dividends in many ways.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The third question is, what is Tesla's current assessment of the pathway towards regulatory approval for unsupervised FSD in the US? And how should we think about the appropriate safety threshold compared to human drivers?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI can start. There are a handful of states that already have adopted autonomous vehicle laws. These states are paving the way for operations while the data for such operations guides a broader adoption of driverless vehicles. I think your show can talk a little bit about our safety methodology, but we expect that these states and the work ongoing, as well as the data that we're providing, will pave the way for a broad-based regulatory approval in the US, at least, and then other countries as well.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's actually been pretty helpful that other autonomous car companies have been cutting a path through the regulatory jungle. So that's actually quite helpful. And they have obviously been operating in San Francisco for a while. I think they got approval for City of LA. So these approvals are happening rapidly.\nI think if you've got at scale a statistically significant amount of data that shows conclusively that the autonomous car has, let's say, half the accident rate of a human-driven car, I think that's difficult to ignore because at that point stopping autonomy means killing people. So I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers provided there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car. In my view, this will be much like elevators. Elevators used to be operated by a guy with a lever switch. But sometimes that guy would get tired or drunk or just make a mistake and shear somebody in half between floors. So now we just get in an elevator and press a button. We don't think about it. In fact, it's kind of weird if somebody's standing there with a lever switch.\nThat'll be how cars work. You just summon a car using your phone. You get in. It takes you to a destination. You get out.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYou don't even think about it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYou don't even think about it. Just like an elevator. It takes you to a floor. That's it. Don't think about how the elevator is working or anything like that. And something I should clarify is that Tesla will be operating the fleet. So you can think of how Tesla think of Tesla like some combination of Airbnb and Uber, meaning that there'll be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet. There'll be some number of cars, and then there'll be a bunch of cars where they're owned by the end user, but that end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want. And they can decide if they want to only let the car be used by friends and family, or only by five-star users, or by anyone.\nAt any time, they could have the car come back to them and be exclusively theirs. Like an Airbnb. You could rent out your guest room or not anytime you want. So as our fleet grows, we have seven million cars going to nine million cars, going to eventually tens of millions of cars worldwide. With a constant feedback loop, every time something goes wrong, that gets added to the training data, and you get this training flywheel happening in the same way that Google search has the sort of flywheel. It's very difficult to compete with Google because people are constantly doing searches and clicking, and Google's getting that feedback loop. It's the same with Tesla, but at a scale that is maybe difficult to comprehend, but ultimately it'd be tens of millions.\nI think there's also some potential here for an AWS element down the road where if we've got very powerful inference because we've got a Hardware 3 in the cars, but now all cars are being made with Hardware 4. Hardware 5 is pretty much designed and should be in cars hopefully towards the end of next year. There's a potential for the run when the car is not moving to actually run distributed inference. So kind of like AWS, but distributed inference. It takes a lot of computers to train an AI model, but many orders of magnitude less compute to run it. So if you can imagine a future perhaps where there's a fleet of 100 million Teslas, and on average, they've got maybe a kilowatt of inference compute, that's 100 GW of inference compute distributed all around the world.\nIt's pretty hard to put together 100 GW of AI compute. Even in an autonomous future where the car is perhaps used instead of being used 10 hours a week, it's used 50 hours a week, that still leaves over 100 hours a week where the car inference computer could be doing something else. It seems like it would be a waste not to use it.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAshok, do you want to chime in on the process and safety?\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. We are like multiple tiers of validating the safety. In any given week, we train hundreds of neural networks that can produce different trajectories for how to drive the car. We replay them through the millions of clips that we have already collected from our users and our own QA. Those are critical events, like someone jumping out in front or other critical events that we have gathered a database over many, many years. We replay through all of them to make sure that we are net improving safety. On top of it, we have simulation systems that also try to recreate this and test this in closed loop fashion. Once all of this is validated, we give it to our own QA drivers. We have hundreds of them in different cities in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, New York, and a lot of different locations.\nThey are also driving this and collecting real-world miles. We have an estimate of what the critical events are. Are they a net improvement compared to the previous week's builds? Once we have confidence that the build is a net improvement, we start shipping to early users, like 2,000 employees initially, that they would get the build. They would give feedback on if it's an improvement or are they noticing some new issues that we did not capture in our own QA process. Only after all of this is validated, we go to external customers. Even when we go external, we have live dashboards of monitoring every critical event that's happening in the fleet, sorted by the criticality of it. We are having a constant pulse on the build's quality and the safety improvement along the way.\nAnd then any failures, like Elon alluded to, you'd get the data back, add it to the training, and that improves the model in the next cycle. So we have this constant feedback loop of issues, fixes, evaluations, and then rinse and repeat. And especially with the new V12 architecture, all of this is automatically improving without requiring much engineering interventions in the sense that engineers don't have to be creative in how they code the algorithms. It's mostly learning on its own based on data. So you see that, okay, we fail here, or this is how a person shows this is how you drive this intersection or something like that.\nWe get the data back, we add it to the neural network, and it learns from that training data automatically instead of some engineer saying that, \"Oh, here, you must rotate the steering wheel by this much or something like that.\" There's no hard impulse conditions. If everything is neural network, it's very soft, it's probabilistic. And so it will adapt its probability distribution based on the new data that it's getting.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We do have some insight into how good things will be in, let's say, three or four months because we have advanced models that are far more capable than what is in the car, but have some issues with them that we need to fix. There'll be a step-change improvement in the capabilities of the car, but it'll have some quirks that need to be addressed in order to release it. As Ashok was saying, we have to be very careful in what we release to the fleet or to customers in general. If we look at, say, 12.4 and 12.5, which could arguably even be Version 13 and Version 14 because it's pretty close to total retrain of the neural nets in each case, or substantially different. We have good insight into how well the car will perform in, say, three or four months.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. And sorry, scaling loss. People in AI community generally talk about model scaling loss where they increase the model size a lot, and then they have corresponding gains in performance. But we have also figured out scaling loss in other access. In addition to the model size scaling, we can also have data scaling. You can increase the amount of data you use to train the neural network, and that also gives similar gains. And you can also scale up by training compute. You can train it for much longer and get on more GPUs or more Dojo nodes, and that also gives better performance. And you can also have architecture scaling where you count the better architectures that for the same amount of compute produce better results.\nSo, a combination of model size scaling, data scaling, training compute scaling, and the architecture scaling, we can basically extrapolate. Okay, if the continuous scaling based on this ratio, we can sort of predict future performance. Obviously, it takes time to do the experiments because it takes a few weeks to train. It takes a few weeks to collect tens of millions of video clips and process all of them. But you can estimate what's going to be the future progress based on the trends that we have seen in the past. And they've generally held true based on the past data.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. I'll go to the next question, which is, can we get an official announcement of the timeline for the $25,000 vehicle?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI think Elon mentioned it in the opening remarks, but as you mentioned, we're updating our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of our low-cost vehicles in a more CapEx efficient way. That's our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible. These new vehicles, we built on our existing lines and open capacity. That's a major shift to utilize all our capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We'll talk about this more on 8 August. But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet. And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation in history when that day happens, when you can do unsupervised full self-driving.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\n5 million cars?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nOh, a little less.\nA little less, yeah.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It'll be seven million cars in a year or so. And then 10 million. And then eventually, we're talking about tens of millions of cars. Not eventually. It's before the end of this.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nDecade.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Before the end of the decade, it's several tens of millions of cars, I think.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI can take that one too. Cybertruck hit 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago. This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP'd late last year. Of course, volume production is what matters. That's what drives costs. And so our costs are dropping. But the ramp still faces a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, etc., and will continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you. The next question: have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe're in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question is about the robotaxi unveil. Elon already talked about that. So we'll have to wait till August. The following question is about the next generation vehicle. We already talked about that. So let's go to the semi. What is the timeline for scaling semi?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI think.\nSure. So we're finalizing the engineering of the Semi to enable a super cost-effective, high-volume production with our learnings from our fleet, our pilot fleet, and Pepsi's fleet, which we're expanding this year marginally. In parallel, as we showed in the shareholders' deck, we have started construction on the factory in Reno. Our first vehicles are planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Couple more questions. So our favorites, can we make FSD transfer permanent until FSD is fully delivered with Level 5 autonomy?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nNo.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Next question. What is getting the production ramp at Lathrop? Where do you see the Megapack run rate at the end of the year? Mike?\n\nMike Snyder\n\nVP of Energy and Charging, Tesla\n\nYes. Yeah. Lathrop is ramping as planned. We have our second GA line allowing us to increase our exit rate from 20 GWh per year to, at the start of this year, to 40 GWh per year by the end of the year. That line is commissioned. There's really nothing limiting the ramp. Given the longer sales cycles for these large projects, we typically have order visibility 12 to 24 months prior to ship date. So we're able to plan the build plan several quarters in advance. So this allows us to ramp the factory to align with the business and order growth. Lastly, we'd like to thank our customers globally for their trust in Tesla as a partner for these incredible projects.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. Let's go to Emily's questions. The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Toni, please go ahead and unmute.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today. Are these tweaks on existing models, given that they're going to be running on the same lines, or are these new models? And how should we think about them in the context of the Model 3 Highland update? What will these models be like relative to that? And given the quick timeframe, Model 3 Highland has required a lot of work and a lot of retooling. Maybe you can help put that all in context. Thank you. And I have a follow-up, please.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI think we've said all we will on that front. So what's your follow-up?\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nIt's a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you're leading many important companies right now. Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests. Do you expect to lessen your involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time. I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off. I'm going to make sure Tesla is very prosperous. I think it is prosperous, and it will be very much so in the future.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you. Let's go to Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, please go ahead and unmute.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Hey, Elon. So you and your team on volume expect a 2024 growth rate notably lower than that achieved in 2023. But what's your team's degree of confidence on growth above 0%? Or in other words, does that statement leave room for potentially lower sales year-on-year?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nNo. I think we'll have higher sales this year than last year.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. My follow-up, Elon, on future product. If you had nailed execution, assuming that you nail execution on your next-gen cheaper vehicles, more aggressive gigacastings, I don't want to say one piece, but getting closer to one piece, structural pack, unboxed, 300mi range, $25,000 price point, putting aside robotaxi, those features unique to you, how long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy a cheaper and better vehicle that you could offer a couple of years from now? How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy that? Thanks.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, I don't know what our competitors could do, except we've done relatively better than they have. If you look at the drop in our competitors in China's sales versus our drop in sales, our drop was less than theirs. So we're doing well. But I think Cathie Wood say it best. Really, we should be thought of as an AI robotics company. If you value Tesla as just an auto company, you would just have to fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework. And it will come to be. If you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible. So I mean, if somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company. But we will, and we are.\nYou have a car that goes from 10 hours of use a week, like an hour and a half a day, to probably 50. It costs the same.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI think that's the key thing to remember, especially if you look at FSD Supervised. If you didn't believe in autonomy, this should give you a preview that this is coming. It's actually getting better day by day.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. If you've not tried the FSD 12.3, and like I said, 12.4 is going to be significantly better, and 12.5, even better than that. And we have visibility into those things. Then you really don't understand what's going on. It's not possible.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. And that's why we can't just look at it just as a car company because a car company would just have a car. But here, we have more than a car company because the cars can be autonomous. And like I said, it's happening.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. This is all in addition to Tesla's work. The overall AI community is just improving rapidly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, we're putting the actual auto in automobile. So, sort of, we're like, \"Well, sort of, tell us about future horse carriages you're making.\" I'm like, \"Well, actually, it doesn't need a horse. That's the whole point.\" That's really the whole point.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Alex, please go ahead and unmute.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat. Thanks. Yeah. So couldn't agree more. The thesis hinges completely on AI, the future of AI, Full Self-Driving, neural net training, all of these things. In that context, Elon, you've spoken about your desire to obtain 25% voting control of a company. And I understand completely why that would be. So I'm not necessarily asking about that. I'm asking if you've come up with any mechanism by which you can ensure that you'll obtain that level of voting control. Because if not, then the core part of the thesis could potentially be at risk. So any additional commentary you might have on that topic?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, I think no matter what, Tesla, even if I get kidnapped by aliens tomorrow, Tesla will solve autonomy. Maybe a little slower, but it would solve autonomy for vehicles at least. I don't know if it would win with respect to Optimus or with respect to future products. But there's enough momentum for Tesla to solve autonomy, even if I disappeared, for vehicles. Now, there's a whole range of things we can do in the future. Beyond that, I'd be more reticent with respect to Optimus. If we have a super sentient humanoid robot that can follow you indoors and you bet you can't escape, we're talking Terminator-level risk, then yeah, I'd be uncomfortable if there's not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed. And if shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or re-ratify the sort of competition, I guess I can't say that.\nBut that is a fact. They have an opportunity.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Very good.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, we'll see. If a company generates a lot of positive cash flow, we could obviously buy back shares.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right. That's actually all very helpful context. Thank you. Maybe one final question, then I'll pass it on. OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there. I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions. What are the types of activities that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks? Thanks very much.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nSo like we said, we've done these headcount reductions across the board. And as companies grow over time, there are certain redundancies. There's some duplication of efforts, which happens in certain areas. So you need to go back and look at where all these pockets are, get rid of it. So we're basically going through that exercise wherein we're like, \"Hey, how do we set this company right for the next phase of growth?\" And the way to think about it is any tree which grows, it needs pruning. This is the pruning exercise which we went through. And at the end of it, we'll be much stronger and much more resilient to deal with the future. Because the future is really bright, like I said in my opening remarks. We just have to get through this period and get there.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We're not giving up anything that it's significant that I'm aware of. So we've had a long period of prosperity from 2019 to now. And so if a company sort of organizationally is 5% wrong per year, that accumulates to 25% to 30 of inefficiency. We've made some corrections along the way, but it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth. And you really need to reorganize it. Just like a human, when we start off with one cell and kind of zygote and blastocyst, and you start growing arms and legs, and briefly you have a tail. And so.\n\nAlex Potter\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nBut you shed the tail.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYou shed the tail, hopefully. Then you're a baby, and you basically have to be different. A company is kind of like a creature growing. If you don't reorganize it for different phases of growth, it will fail. You can't have the same organizational structure if you're 10 cells versus 100 versus a million versus a billion versus a trillion, where humans are around 35 trillion cells. It doesn't feel like it feels like one person, but you're basically a walking cell colony of roughly 35 trillion, depending on your body mass, and about three times that number in bacteria. So anyway, you've got to reorganize the company for a new phase of growth, or it will fail to achieve that growth.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Let's go to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark, please go ahead and unmute.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. The company had previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions as in the early phase, and some OEMs had not really been believing in it. Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed? And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement, in your view?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, I think it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach. I think it is. I think now with 12.3, if you just have the car drive you around, it is obvious that our solution with a relatively low cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving. No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonics, nothing.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nNo heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's so it would really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software. But it's once it becomes obvious that if you don't have this in a car, nobody wants your car. It's a smart car. I mean, I still remember back when Nokia was king of the hill.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\n[inaudible] cell phones.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, crushing. And I saw them come out with a smartphone that was basically a brick with limited functionality. And then the iPhone and Android. But people still did not understand that all the phones are going to be that way. There's not going to be any flip phones. There'll be a niche product.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nOr home phones.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Not even exactly. When was the last time you saw a home phone?\nIt's like an acronym.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nNo idea.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nIn a hotel. Sometimes in a hotel.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, the hotel's have them. Yeah. So, people don't understand all cars will need to be smart cars, or you will not sell the car, nobody will buy it. Once that becomes obvious, I think licensing becomes not optional.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nBecomes a method of survival.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's license it or nobody will buy your car.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI mean, one other thing which I'll add is in the conversations which we've had with some of these OEMs. I just want to also point out that they take a lot of time in their product lifecycle. They're talking about years before they will put it in their product. We might have a licensing deal earlier than that, but it takes a while. So this is where the big difference between us and them is, right?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, really, a deal signed now would result in it being in a car in probably three years.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThat would be early.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. That's like lightning, basically.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThat'd be an eager OEM.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we do sign a deal. I think we're a good chance we do sign a deal this year, maybe more than one. But yeah, it would be probably three years before it's integrated with a car, even though all you need is cameras and our inference compute. So it's not a massive design change.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. And again, just to clarify, it's not the work which we have to do. It's the work which they have to do, which will take the time.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. Mark, do you have a follow-up?\n\nMark Delaney\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Yeah. Very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward. Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand. With how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has in place, do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products? And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis with the current product set? Thanks.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully. Yeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThe thing Vaibhav said in his opening remarks, our cost-down efforts, basically, we're offsetting the price cuts.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nSo I was going to say.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWe're trying to give it back to the customers.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, at the end of the day, for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price, if you have a great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent. That's true of any arena. So over time, we do need to keep making sure that it's a great product at a great price and more of that price is accessible to people. So it's not you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question. The fundamental affordability question is sometimes overlooked. If somebody's earning several hundred thousand dollars a year, they don't think of a car from a fundamental affordability standpoint. But for the vast majority of people, they are living paycheck to paycheck. So it actually makes a difference if the cost per month for lease or financing is $10 one way or the other.\nSo it is important to keep improving the affordability and to keep making the price.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nMore accessible.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Exactly. Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nBut also to make kick-ass cash if people want to buy.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's got to be a great product at a great price. And the standards for what constitutes a great product at a great price keep increasing. So you can't just be static. You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production. And that's what we're doing.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, the updated Model 3 is a fantastic car. I don't think people fully even understand the amount of engineering effort which has gone in. Lars and team have actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different. I mean, it looks and feels different. Not only does it look and feel different, we've added so much value to it, but you can lease it for as low as $299 a month.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. Without gas.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go and unmute.\n\nGeorge Gianarikas\n\nSustainability Research Analyst, Canaccord\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. First, could you please help us understand some of the timing of launching FSD in additional geographies, including maybe clarifying your recent comment about China? Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, new markets. Yeah. There are a bunch of markets where we don't currently sell cars that we should be selling cars in. We'll see some acceleration of that.\n\nGeorge Gianarikas\n\nSustainability Research Analyst, Canaccord\n\nFSD in new markets?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So the thing about the end-to-end neural net-based autonomy is that just like a human, it actually works pretty well without modification in almost any market. So we plan on, with the approval of the regulators, releasing it as a supervised autonomy system in any market where we can get regulatory approval for that, which we think includes China. So yeah, it's just like a human. You can go rent a car in a foreign country, and you can drive pretty well. Obviously, if you live in that country, you'll drive better. And so we'll make the car drive better in these other countries with country-specific training. But it can drive quite well almost everywhere.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nThe basics of driving are basically the same everywhere. A car is a car. Traffic light, road is a road.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It understands that it shouldn't hit things no matter where it is.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nExactly. There are some road rules that you need to follow. In China, you shouldn't cross over a solid line to do a lane change. The US is a recommendation, I think. China, yeah, you get fined heavily if you do that. You have to do some adaptations, but it's mostly smaller adaptations, not an entire change of stack or something like that.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nHey, George, do you have a follow-up?\n\nGeorge Gianarikas\n\nSustainability Research Analyst, Canaccord\n\nYeah. So my follow-up has to do with the Q1 deliveries. And I'm curious as to whether or not you feel that supply constraints that you mentioned throughout the release impacted the results. And maybe can you help us quantify that? And is that why you have some confidence in unit growth in 2024?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think we did cover this a little bit in the opening remarks too. Q1 had a lot of different things which were happening. Seasonality was a big one. Continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment. We had attacks at our factory. We had Red Sea attacks. We were ramping Model 3. We were ramping Cybertruck. All these things are happening. I mean, it almost feels like a culmination of all those activities in a constrained period. That gives us that confidence that, hey, we don't expect these things to recur.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We think Q2 will be a lot better.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. It was just one thing after another. Our sales are crazy.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Exactly. If you've got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot be delivered to people. And if you've got excess demand for Model 3 or Model Y in one market, but you don't have it there, it's an extremely complex logistics situation. So I'd say also that we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we've just in the past week or so have greatly simplified. So it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be you can buy the car in under a minute. So we're getting back to the you can buy a Tesla in under a minute interface from what was quite complex.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you. Let's go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go ahead and unmute, please.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nManaging Director and Head of Sustainable Growth and Resource Optimization Research, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks so much, guys. Given the pursuit of Tesla really as a leader in AI for the physical world and your comments around distributed inference, can you talk about what that approach is unlocking beyond what's happening in the vehicle right now?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nDo you want to say something?\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. Again, I mentioned the car, even when it's a full robotaxi, it's probably going to be used around 50 hours a week.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThat's my guess. Like 1/3 of the hours a week.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. It could be more or less, but then there's certainly going to be some hours left for charging, cleaning, and maintenance. In that world, it can do a lot of other workloads. Even right now, we are seeing, for example, these LLM companies have these batch workloads where they send a bunch of documents, and those are run through pretty large neural networks. It takes a lot of compute to chunk through those workloads. And now that we have already paid for this compute in these cars, it might be wise to use them and not let them be like buying a lot of expensive machinery and letting them be idle. We don't want that. We want to use the computer as much as possible and close to basically 100% of the time, make effective use of it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThat's right. I think it's analogous to Amazon Web Services, where people didn't expect that AWS would be the most valuable part of Amazon when it started out as a bookstore. So that was on nobody's radar. But they found that they had excess compute because the compute needs would spike to extreme levels for brief periods of the year, and then they had idle compute for the rest of the year. So then what should they do with all that excess compute for the rest of the year? That's kind of.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nMonetize it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, monetize it. So it seems like kind of a no-brainer to say, \"Okay, if we've got millions and then tens of millions of vehicles out there where the computers are idle most of the time, that we might as well have them do something useful.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. Exactly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nAnd then, I mean, if you get to the 100 million vehicle level, which I think we will at some point get to, and you've got a kilowatt of usable compute, and maybe you're on Hardware 6 or 7 by that time, then I think you'd have on the order of 100 GW of usable compute, which might be more than anyone, more than any company, probably more than any company.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah, probably. Because it takes a lot of intelligence to drive the car anyway. And when it's not driving the car, you just put this intelligence to other uses, just solving scientific problems.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nJust like a human.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nOr answering dumb questions for someone else.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nBefore, you learned a lot about deploying workloads to these compute nodes.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. Unlike laptops and our cell phones, it is totally under Tesla's control. It's easier to distribute the workload across different nodes as opposed to asking users for permission on their own cell phones, would be very tedious.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, you're just draining the battery on the phone.\n\nAshok Elluswamy",
    "content2": "VP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. Exactly. The battery is also draining.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nSo technically, I suppose Apple would have the most amount of distributed compute, but you can't use it because you can't just run the phone at full power and drain the battery. Whereas for the car, even if you're a kilowatt-level inference computer, which is crazy power compared to a phone, if you've got a 50 kWh or 60 pack, it's still not a big deal to run.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nManaging Director and Head of Sustainable Growth and Resource Optimization Research, Oppenheimer\n\nWith yours plugged in as well.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWith yours plugged in or not, it could be plugged in or not plugged in. You could run for 10 hours and use 10 kWh of your kilowatt of compute.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nManaging Director and Head of Sustainable Growth and Resource Optimization Research, Oppenheimer\n\nPer hour?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWhere you have a built-in liquid cooled thermal management?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's exactly\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWhat happens for data centers. It's already there in the car.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nExactly. So it's distributed power generation. It's distributed access to power and distributed cooling. And it's already paid for.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, that distributed power and cooling, people underestimate that costs a lot of money.\n\nAshok Elluswamy\n\nVP of AI Software, Tesla\n\nYeah. The CapEx is shared by the entire world. Everyone wants a small chunk, and they get a small profit out of it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nManaging Director and Head of Sustainable Growth and Resource Optimization Research, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks so much, guys. Just my follow-up is a little bit more mundane. Looking at the 4680 ramp, can you talk about how close you are to target yield and when you might start to accelerate incremental capacity expansions on that technology?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe're making good progress on that, but I don't think it's super important for at least the near term. As Lars said, we think it'll exceed the competitiveness of suppliers by the end of this year. And then we'll continue to improve.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, I think it's important to note also that the ramp right now is relevant to the Cybertruck ramp. And so we're not going to just randomly build 4680s unless we have a place to put them. And so we're going to make sure we're prudent about that. But we also have a lot of investments with all our cell suppliers and vendors. They're great partners, and they've done great development work with us. And a lot of the advancements in technology and chemistry we found in 4680, they're also putting into their cells.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, a big part of the 4680, Tesla doing internal sales was a hedge against what would happen with our suppliers. Because for a while there, it was very difficult because every big car maker put in massive battery orders. And so the price per kilowatt-hour of lithium-ion batteries went to crazy numbers, crazy levels.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nBonkers.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Just bonkers. So, like, \"Okay, we've got to have some hedge here to deal with cost per kilowatt-hours numbers that were double what we anticipated.\" If we have an internal cell production, then we have that hedge against demand shocks where there's too much demand. That's really the way to think about it. It's not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems just for the hell of it. We did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt-hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every car maker on earth. So.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you. The last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, go ahead and unmute. Ben, you're still muted.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, I once again would just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive FSD 12.3. It's impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. So since Ben is not unmuting, let's try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research. Final question.\n\nShreyas Patil\n\nVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, hey. Thanks so much. Just Elon, during the investor day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would decline by 50% versus the current Model 3 and Y. I think that was implying something around $20,000 of COGS. About 1/3 of that was coming from the Unboxed manufacturing process. But I'm curious if you see an opportunity that some of the other drivers around powertrain cost reduction or material cost savings would those be largely transferable to some of the new products that you're now talking about introducing?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. Yeah. Sure. I mean, in short, yes. I mean, the unboxed manufacturing method is certainly great and revolutionary, but with it comes some risk because it's new production lines and not. But all the subsystems we developed, whether it was powertrains, drive units, battery improvements in manufacturing and automation, thermal systems, seating, the integration of interior components, and reduction of LV controllers, all that's transferable. And that's what we're doing, trying to get it in their products as fast as possible. And so, yeah, that engineering work, we're not trying to just throw it away and put it in a coffin. We're going to take it and utilize it and utilize it to the best advantage of the cars we make and the future cars we make.\n\nShreyas Patil\n\nVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. And then just on that topic of 4680 cells, I know you mentioned it. You really thought of it more as a hedge against rising battery costs from other OEMs. But it seems even today, it seems like you would have a cost advantage against some of those other automakers. And I'm wondering, given the rationalizing of your vehicle manufacturing plans that you're talking about now, if there's an opportunity to maybe convert the 4680 cells and maybe sell those to other automakers and really generate an additional revenue stream. I'm just curious if you have any thoughts about that.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWhat seems to be happening is that, unless I'm missing something, the orders for batteries from other automakers have declined dramatically. So we're seeing much more competitive prices for cells from our suppliers, dramatically more competitive than in the past. It is clear that a lot of our suppliers have excess capacity.\n\nMike Snyder\n\nVP of Energy and Charging, Tesla\n\nYeah. In addition to what Elon—this is kind of out of the way—in addition to what Elon said about 4680s, what 4680 did for us from a supply chain perspective was help us understand the supply chain that's upstream of our cell suppliers. So a lot of the deals that we had struck for 4680, we can also supply those materials to our partners, help reducing the overall cost back to Tesla. So we're basically inserting ourselves in the upstream supply chain by doing that. So that's also been beneficial in reducing the overall pricing in addition to the excess capacity that these suppliers have.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Now, I mean, this is going to wax and wane, obviously. So there's going to be a boom and bust in battery cell production where production exceeds supply, and then supply exceeds production back and forth, kind of like, I don't know, DRAM or something. But yeah, so it's like what is true today will not be true in the future. There's going to be somewhat of a boom and bust cycle here. And then there are additional complications with government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA. It's always sounded like a funny name for a.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nChemical name.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Is it like the Irish Republican Army? The Internet Research Agency from Russia?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nIndividual Retirement Account?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Exactly. Roth IRA. And it's like Forrest Friday man situations, which IRA wins. But it does complicate the incentive structure so that there is a stronger demand for cells that are produced in the US than outside the US. But then how long does the IRA last? I don't know.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWhich is why it's important that we have built-in cells and vendor cells to hedge against all of this.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. That's all the time we have today. But at the same time, I would like to make a short announcement. And I wanted to let the investment community know that about a month ago, I met up with Elon and Vaibhav and announced that I'll be moving on from the world of investor relations. I'll be hanging around for another couple of months or so, so feel free to reach out anytime. But after this seven-year sprint, I'm going to be taking a break and spending some good quality time with my family. And I wanted to say that these seven years have been the greatest privilege of my professional life. I'll never forget the memories from I started literally at the beginning of production hell and just watching the company from the inside to see what it's become today.\nI'm especially super thankful to the people in this room and dozens of people outside of this room that I've worked for over the years. I think that the team strength and teamwork at Tesla is unlike anything else I've seen in my career. Elon, thank you very much for this opportunity that I got back in 2017. Thank you for seeking investor feedback and regularly debating it with me.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, the reason I reached out to you was because I thought your analysis of Tesla was the best that I'd seen.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nSo yeah, thank you for helping Tesla get to where it is today over seven years. It's been a pleasure working with you.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you so much. Yeah, thank you for all the thousands of shareholders that we've met over the years, walked around factories, and loved all the interactions, even the tough ones. Yeah, looking forward to the call in the next three months, but I'll be on the other side listening in. Thank you very much.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks."

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00PM Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance. In Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really a phenomenal achievement. Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America. People are often surprised that the highest output car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps. It's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It was derelict when we got it.\nNow it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. It's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. I'm super proud of the people that work there. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted. The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles, with over 1.2 million units delivered. The energy storage business delivered nearly 15 GWh of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 GWh the year before. Tremendous year-over-year growth, triple digits. Yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted. I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that. Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.\nSo we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D. This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between two major growth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, and other projects, is executed as well as possible. For full self-driving, we've released version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So another neural net, basically photons in and controls out. And it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the US who request full self-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.\nSo this is the first time AI is being used not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quite remarkable. As a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference. Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas. So the new Model 3 is now available globally. So we did an updated Model 3.\nWhile the car looks similar, a lot of work's gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range, and many other improvements. And I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, you should really try the new one. So steady improvements. And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not a product announcement. So there'll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new products coming. But we reserve product announcements for product announcements, not earnings calls. But we're very excited about this. And this is really going to be profound, not just in the design of the vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.\nThis is a revolutionary manufacturing system, far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin. Several years ago, I said that perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology. And you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle. The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas. And then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world. Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second. And then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next, outside of North America. In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong Free Cash Flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment.\nAnd we are focused on exciting new projects that will, I think, ultimately, if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, it's not a sure thing, but I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world. I do want to emphasize that is not an easy path. It's a very difficult one. But it is now in the set of possible outcomes. And previously, I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes. And thank you again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year. And looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come. Thank you.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business, as well as record deployments in our energy business. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation. Big thanks to our customers for being with us through this challenging period. I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout. In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand. Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.\nThis was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recently gone through a similar change in their accounting. Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per-unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck ramp. As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control, like the change in tariffs or local incentives, to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms. On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023.\nWe fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase. Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles. The key among them being total cost of ownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost. We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support the overall demand. There are two additional things I would like to mention as this relates to the US market.\nFirst, for customers who qualify for the higher buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y, which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer. Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our partner leasing program. Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales. Our energy storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%. This business is poised to, again, surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024. This has been in the works for quite some time, with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in Lathrop.\nI would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality. Our services and other business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets as our fleet goals. As we expect the fleet-based revenues from Supercharging, Used Cars, and Services to continue to increase. For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives. Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion. We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth. Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey. We can open it up to questions, Martin.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Let's go through investor questions. Question number one is from Michael. Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see the next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, I would certainly say things that should be taken with a grain of salt, since I'm often optimistic. I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule says that we will start production towards the end of 2025, so sometime in the second half. That's just what our current schedule says. There's a lot of new technology, like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here. The reason I want to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of an off-the-shelf, just works type of thing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live on the line if it's in Austin versus elsewhere. But we are currently expecting to start production second half of next year.\nThat will be a challenging production ramp. I can't say we'll be sleeping on the line, practically. In fact, not practically, we will be. But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficult to predict what that S curve of manufacturing looks like. So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially. And predicting that intermediate S curve is difficult. So I don't know. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make any predictions on that front. But it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question is from Michael again. What has been the barrier to ramping 4680 cells into multi-million cells per week, RAIF? And when do you expect to get there?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp, because I've seen some people commenting about that. To date, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory. The goal is to keep it that way, not only for Cyber, but for our future vehicle programs. As Elon said, it is an S curve here, too. It's hard to predict these things. But I'm just describing our goals.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt's a hard problem. There are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells. That's like all they do.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nIndeed.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe do a lot of other things. We've got a lot of breakthrough technologies that take time to figure out with 4680. It's not just that it's a 46mm diameter by 80mm tall cell. That's just the dimensions. There's a tremendous amount of new technology in the cell itself.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nManufacturing techniques.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nJust regarding what the team was able to do in Q4, Texas successfully swapped line one from the Model Y design of the cell to the Cybertruck design of the cell, which was the 10% cell energy increase I've mentioned before. As with any major new product introduction, the factory and engineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design, and the process changes as their first priority. Now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1. In terms of what we're doing, we're currently running one production line, one assembly line, using two assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials. We have a fourth in commissioning. Four more will be installed starting in Q3 this year. So definitely, this is a big year for ramping 4680.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nBut we also do want to emphasize that we also expect to ramp orders from our suppliers. So this is not about replacing our suppliers. It's about supplementing our suppliers. So we are very appreciative of our suppliers. Panasonic, obviously, is our longest supplier. They're an amazing company. We've got CATL. We've got LG and BYD.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question is from Adam. Should retail shareholders be concerned that Elon has stated that he is uncomfortable expanding AI and robotics at Tesla if he doesn't have 25% of voting?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. I guess let me explain what my concern is here, which is that I see a path to creating an artificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power. My concern would be I don't want to control it, but if I have so little influence over the company at that stage that I could sort of be voted out by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm. We've had a lot of challenges with Institutional Shareholder Services, ISS. I call them ISIS and Glasgow. There's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have strange ideas about what should be done. So I want to have enough to be influential. If we could do a dual-class stock, that would be ideal. I'm not looking for additional economics. I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology.\nThe reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that that's not so much that I can control the company, even if I go bonkers. If I'm mad, they can throw me out. But it's enough that I have a strong influence. That's what I'm aiming for, is a strong influence but not control. If there's some way to achieve that, that would be great.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the full year?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nLike I said in my opening remarks, we're focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles. This is a very extensive and involved exercise, whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the packaging used to get the materials to the production floor. Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further. A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things, which I mentioned, leads to cost reduction. This is a constant exercise, and we just have to chase down every penny possible. We have a strong team, which is hyper-focused on this. However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are a lot of.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI don't know. We don't have a crystal ball, so it's difficult for us to predict this with precision. If interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good. And if they don't come down quickly, they won't be that good. Yeah. It's always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. It's not that people don't want it. We have tons of lots of people who want to buy a car but simply cannot afford it. And as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it, and they buy the car. It's pretty straightforward. And there are no tricks around to get around this.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay. Thank you. The next question is, does the company anticipate 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either 2024 or 2025? If not, why not?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nAs we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before. We are between two major growth waves. The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y. We believe the next one will be initiated with the next-generation platform. In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we're trying to focus the team on the launch of the next-generation vehicle.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. The next question is from Michael. When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico? And when can we expect each of these to produce their first products, such as 4680 cells, semi, and the next-gen vehicles?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWe have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate semi, and other projects. But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction. Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont, and ramped really quickly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, exactly. It's important to emphasize that, I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, honestly, before some of the really worst years of my life, frankly. I just left mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many. And then Model Y was somewhat of a variance on Model 3, so a much easier situation. And then we were able to actually do slightly improved versions, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin. And that's the right, I think, the sensible way to go about things, is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses. And we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet. I think that will become obvious probably this year. And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla Full Self-Driving Technology. It's definitely the smart move.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question from Sidhart. What is the timeline for Optimus' first production of a volume production line, and what are the barriers to getting there?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nOptimus, obviously, is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product, and something that I think has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else at Tesla combined. When you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita. But what if there's no limit to capital? There's no limit to the economy. The technologies that we've developed for the car translate quite well to a humanoid robot, because the car is just a robot on four wheels. Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world. It's just a four-wheeled robot. Optimus is a humanoid robot with arms and legs. It's by far the most sophisticated humanoid robot that's being developed anywhere in the world. I think we've got a good chance of shipping some number of Optimus units next year.\nBut like I said, this is a brand new product. A lot of uncertainty. When there's a lot of uncertainty in your uncharted territory, it's obviously impossible to make a precise prediction. But we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus every few months. And you can see that it's advancing very quickly. I was just in the Optimus lab, actually, until late last night. I think it's like midnight or something. I finally left the Optimus lab. The team is doing amazing work. That's obviously a case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe, especially at scale, and that it should be impossible for any centralized control to upload malware to a humanoid robot. So we're going to want to build in localized shutdown that cannot be updated from a central server.\nThat's a case where we really have to give extreme thought to safety. But like I said, I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable product of any kind ever, by far.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nJust to comment on the barrier, I think the barrier, and we've talked about this, is getting it to actually do something useful. We can get it to walk around. We can get it to do things. But it's like that utility part.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt can already do some useful things.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nBut to making millions of these things, it's like utility. Got to get the utility up.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. A smart robot that's capable of doing generalized tasks is what it will be. In terms of doing moderately specialized tasks, it can already do that. It'll just get better through the course of the year. As we improve the technology in the car, we improve the technology in Optimus at the same time. It runs the same AI-inference computer that's on the car, same training technology. I mean, we're really building the future. I mean, the Optimus lab looks like the set of Westworld. Admittedly, that was not a super utopian situation.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah, not the best reference.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. The creators of Westworld, Jonah Nolan, at least Jonah Nolan, old friends of mine, actually. I invited them to come see the lab. I think they'll come see it hopefully soon. It's pretty wild, especially the sort of subsystem test stands where you've just got one leg on a test stand, just doing repetitive exercises, and one arm on a test stand. It's pretty wild. Yeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nWe're not entering Westworld anytime soon.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nRight, right. They take safety very, very seriously.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nWell, thank you. The next question from Nermin is, how many Cybertruck orders are in the queue, and when do you anticipate to be able to fulfill existing orders?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nFirst of all, I want to thank all of the Cybertruck reservation holders for their patience. The reservation to order conversion rate so far has been very, very encouraging. If the trend continues, as it's very likely to be, we will soon sort out all the builds in 2024. Also, we have new orders come in after the launch. The order numbers keep growing. So we're now all hands on deck focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands and reduce the wait time.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained situation. And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn't feel right to us to sort of gouge people for early delivery. But really, the demand is off the hook. As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of a quarter million, something like a quarter million Cybertrucks a year in North America. Maybe more, but give or take roughly on that timeframe. And I mean, it sure is a head-turner.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nDefinitely, yes. Anywhere you go, people look at you. They give you thumbs up.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's funny that the future looks like the future. It's just that for the other trucks on the road there, which there's some very good trucks on the road, but if you were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn't hardly know which company made them. But you definitely would know the Cybertruck.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThat's our best product ever.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. Thank you. The next question is, can we get Tesla energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. We will strive to do so starting from this quarter. Just a brief update from the business perspective. Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through 2024 and 2025. We want to thank all of our partners who've put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical infrastructure around the world. I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong 2023 execution. Lathrop continues to ramp through 2024 with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from 20 to 40 GWh by the end of the year.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The last investor question is from Sidhart. What are the preliminary results on return on investment of your ads and education campaign? Given that many people still lack awareness that Tesla average price is less than the average non-luxury car price of $45,000, will you expand educational ads?\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nAs Elon mentioned, the ultimate solution to increase EV adoption is really to address the affordability issue. But at the same time, we are aware there's an awareness issue as well. So in Q4, we ran a series of digital campaigns, very targeted digital campaigns across different geos and different channels. The target of these tasks is really just to drive awareness and ultimately measure the return on investment on those digital channels. And the messaging we're driving is really focused on our product and also tries to address some of the misconceptions of the EV, such as safety, affordability. And one particular awareness campaign we've run in Texas reached the audience of about 10 million unique viewers and generated close to half a million visits to our website. A large number of these viewers are first-time visitors to our website.\nThe traffic through these digital channels actually behaves very similar to those organic traffic coming to our website. So going forward, we're just going to keep exploring different channels and doing our trials to get a better understanding of the effectiveness of these digital campaigns.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nBut I would also like to caution that we'll be very careful that we don't want to overspend on this side. We want to make sure people are aware, but that's where we'll keep tweaking our methodology about how and where we spend the money, because we understand the importance of increasing awareness, but at the same token, we don't want to spend a lot of money on just creating awareness.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, there are some geographies where our market share is remarkably low, like Japan, for example. Now, we obviously need to make sure that we have superchargers in the right locations and the service centers are there and the product works well in Japan. But Japan is the third largest car market in the world of any country. And we should at least have a market share proportionate to, say, other non-Japanese car makers like Mercedes or BMW, which we do not currently have. So I think that's a case. When I talk to friends of mine in Japan, they're like, \"There is quite a lack of awareness of Tesla.\" So that's a case where we definitely need to increase awareness in countries and regions where there is, yeah, not that much awareness.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Let's go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, go ahead, please. Feel free to unmute. Pierre, can you hear us?\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nHead of Global Technology Infrastructure, New Street Research\n\nOkay. Well, it's really tough to find the unmute button on Teams, guys. I'm sorry for being late. So yes, my question would be on the cost reduction. You've talked about it already a lot. If I look at it over the last five, six quarters, on average, the cost per car has been coming down more than 2% sequentially on average. So that means you're on a trajectory of cost per car going down 10% a year. So that's probably unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any car manufacturer ever achieved that. But that's very mundane and very, it's a good performance, but it's a very normal performance in a lot of other manufacturing industries like microelectronics or consumer electronics.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter, to a microelectronics business where you have this ability to actually always improve costs, you have more control on how things are pulled together into your files, and you see yourself sustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace? Or do you think your ability to take down costs is actually going to become more in line with the rest in the industry over time?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think I covered this in pretty lengthy detail, even in my opening remarks and in the previous question. But just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reduce costs. And like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team is constantly going and checking where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we will have the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not, because remember, we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising. So then we did see benefits coming from that. So those are more or less taken care of. But there is more which we're still chasing.\nI would say a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supply chain team, because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure out whatever they can to take out further costs. But yes, like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous cost reductions at the same pace completely in the future, because with our current platform, we are getting to a place wherein there are limitations.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. The increased scale also sort of helps us there. As we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing. We're looking at every penny, like Vaibhav and Elon mentioned. Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has come down by 22% year over year. And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging as opposed to cardboard, which is even better for the environment, optimizing trucking routes, negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking companies, going with full truckloads, and just doing that sort of, the bigger we become, the more we put thought into these things and the more efficient we become as a result of it. So those workstreams are going to continue.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe're also getting into the tiers of supply chain to see if there are opportunities. Getting into the tier twos, tier threes, tier four levels, and then negotiate those pricing as well to get more efficiency out of the system.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nAnd then on the design side, we're not static, right? Especially in areas where the technology is still improving rapidly. Power electronics is a great example. We continue to bring improvements there that are fundamentals, sort of driven from the device up, that result in cost reductions generation over generation. And they don't only go into the new vehicles; they come to the old vehicles as well. So that's closer to what you were talking about with the microelectronics space. Some of that exists in the vehicle.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nYeah. Certainly, our car is more computer than car in many ways and has a lot of new tech over the last 100 years of automotive production that everyone's trying to scrape pennies from.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe have a crazy amount of computer now in cars compared to anyone else. It's like orders of magnitude.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nAnd we get to ride that down, right?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nA thousand times more. I don't know. Some nutty number.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nI mean, if I just look at the main microcontroller that makes the motor go, for example, when I think about what it costs when we stuck it in a Roadster in 2006, it costs now. It's like there's no comparison. So we've definitely been riding that electronics cost wave.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nAnd then even on the non, what you call, traditional vehicle side, we do things that no other automakers do to bring costs down through breaking down the way structures are built and the way we put our cars together. And I think that mindset that we have is very much closer to the microprocessor or power electronics industry than the automotive industry.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Pierre, do you have a follow-up?\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nHead of Global Technology Infrastructure, New Street Research\n\nGreat. Yes, a quick one. You mentioned this phase in which you are between two big growth periods. I'd love to hear from you about what you consider the size of your addressable market with the portfolio you have today, like the 3, the Y, the X, and the S. What's your estimate of your addressable market? You're shipping probably about a 2 million unit run rate today. And given the price points of these cars, what kind of market share of what you address with these cars do you think you've already achieved today?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI don't know if we've. I actually don't think we have a firm idea of this. It's hard to say exactly.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I would say there's, I mean, one way to think about it is look at the automotive industry as well. EVs still contribute a very small market share. So yes, our goal is to try and take as much market share out of that pie. But do I have a specific number to give you? I don't think we can say that with certainty.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nIt's a growing pie as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nExactly.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nIt's 9% today, but it could be 20% in a couple of years or in the future.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nAnd certainly, the way we've looked at it, and we've always said this, it's not about how many EVs can we sell, it's how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell. And that market's 100 million a year, and we're barely 2% of that. I still think there's 98% more to get.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, it's worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-selling vehicles in the world, they are much lower priced than the Model Y. So Toyota RAV4.\nCorolla. Corolla, Honda Civic, that kind of thing. They're a much lower price than ours. So people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It's quite a difficult thing for them to do. Remarkable that it's the best-selling car in unit volume despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, everybody. So I can't wait to see the Optimus Lab. I'm sure everybody on this call feels the same way. Your last AI Day, Elon, was September 2022. Can we expect a Tesla AI Day this year? It seems like a lot's changed in that realm. Is this year the time?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. That's a good question. We have found that when we do these AI Days, some of our competitors literally look at what we do on a frame-by-frame basis.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThey do.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWe find these things being copied.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nSame thing with Battery Day.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nSame thing with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe of the secret sauce. But I think some kind of update would be good to do. I'll talk it over with the team, and yeah, I think we might do something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting. So sort of change the perception of Tesla, as people think of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nMaybe as a follow-up, Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expanding into Western markets as the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendous growth in the supply. How much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition to achieve in Western markets? And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with a Chinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States? Thanks.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. So I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. So they're extremely good. We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner. Certainly, we're happy to, except on the Supercharger front, we're obviously happy to give any electric car company access to our Supercharger network. We're also happy to license Full Self-Driving, perhaps license other technologies, and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform. You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain. Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand. And do you believe in—we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48-volt architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries. To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?\n\nAdam Jonas\n\nHead of Global Auto & Shared Mobility Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's a good place to start.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. I don't think that anything in Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform. We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle. When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out. You don't just throw it on the line and just build it. So we're going through those validation phases for all of those new manufacturing technologies now. Sure, 48-volt was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well. We're also open to partnering on that if everyone wants to do that.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Definitely, man. The people that really know that this is like an inside baseball thing, but man, it's so high time that the auto industry moved from 12, the random number of 12 to 48.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nRandom number of 48.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Well, it's much less random.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nSlightly less random based on human injury, but.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, it dramatically reduces the amount of copper you need in the vehicle. And also moving to sort of higher bandwidth communications, sort of Ethernet-level communications versus CAN bus, which is pretty. Pretty slow. Pretty slow. So it's really just bringing cars to. The 21st century. Yeah, pretty much.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSo certainly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt's like normal for a laptop.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah. Certainly, bringing that is an evolution in our architectures of vehicles, but it's not gating by any means. The gating work is just to finish the design and manufacturing of the car, test them out, and get them going.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. And programs and execution mode, right?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYep.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nRight. So it's talking about tooling lead time, manufacturing lead time.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nFactory lead time.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. Factory lead time and executing those programs.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThere's a lot of specialized machines that make the machine for a next-gen vehicle. So these are not machines you can just order from anyone. We have to design a machine that has never existed to build a car in a way that has never existed.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. So you don't just have a design validation phase, but you have an equipment design validation phase as well.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt does make it very hard to copy us because you have to copy the machine that makes the machine that makes the machine.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nWe're talking about tiers.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's exactly a manufacturing exception. So I do think it's quite a powerful sustainable advantage because there just is no place to go to order the machines that make our next-gen car that don't exist.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. As a follow-up, your release did not mention Dojo. So if you could just provide us an update on where Dojo stands and at what point you expect Dojo to be a resource in improving FSD, or do you think that you now have sufficient supply of NVIDIA GPUs needed for the training of the system?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI mean, the AI part of the question is, that is a deep one. So we're obviously hedging our bets here with significant orders of NVIDIA GPUs. Or GPU is the wrong word. There really needs to be, you can't produce graphics. So it's not a graphic processing unit. Neural net processing unit or something like that.\n\nDan Levy\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nInteresting.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. GPU is a funny word, vestigial. And a lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited. Something that's important with training, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need in inference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of classic 10,000 hours, the less mental effort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive, how much of your mental capacity it took to drive, you had to be focused completely on driving. And after you've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive, and you can think about other things and still drive safely. So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot of training.\nWe're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo. But I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high, but it's not something that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs. And we're scaling it up, and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3, and whatnot. So I think it's got potential, but can't emphasize enough, high risk, high payoff. So I think it still makes sense, given even if it's a low probability of success for the very, yeah. I think anyway, I'm belaboring the subject. It's a very interesting program. It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardware in the car.\nSo we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip. And we're about to complete design of, the terminology is a bit confusing. We're about to complete design of Hardware 5, which is actually version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip because the version 1 was Mobileye, version 2 was NVIDIA, and then version 3 was Tesla. And we're making gigantic improvements from Hardware 3 to 4 to 5. I mean, there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future, that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT-4 or 3 or something like that.\nIf you've got tens of millions of vehicles out there, even in a robotaxi scenario, where they're in heavy use, maybe they're used 50 out of 168 hours, that still leaves well over 100 hours of compute hours. It's possible with the right architectural decisions that Tesla may in the future have more compute than everyone else combined.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive & Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. As we're thinking about going into 2024, the press release talks about hitting 36,000 or slightly above in Q4. The comments of the release talk about approaching the natural limits, and it sounds like you're continuing to try to whittle that away, but that sort of implies there's not much left. In addition, you have the hourly wage increase, I guess; we'll add to that into next year. I thought you said raw material costs are kind of that benefit is sort of almost played out. So is there an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000, or should we kind of be modeling that it kind of stays at this level into 2024?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nWe are definitely aware of the cost increases which are coming through because of the wage increases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out where else can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won't specifically guide to a number which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunity there.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla",
    "content2": "Yeah. We're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024. North of eight figures is what we're targeting just in my organization, and Lars has got a bunch. Then from a commodities perspective, it's such a long.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nLong lead.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nCycle time through the whole material supply chain, that even with what we've already seen to this point, there's more to come on commodities reductions.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive & Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThere's still some tailwind left on the commodities.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nThat's what I mean.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAluminum and steel.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. And battery materials.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in costs, that's $1 billion.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nVP of Vehicle Engineering, Tesla\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nSo it's like on average, if we reduce the cost by $0.01, $1 billion. What? And we started off not long ago that we're only making like 10 cars a week. And yeah. So where does it lead ultimately? With good execution, like I said, it's not a slam dunk, but if we execute very well, I think Tesla could be the most valuable company in the world.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Colin, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Just a quick follow-up. In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500 level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think it's typically 25%-ish. Is that going to, should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year, or would it be a gradual change over the next few years? And any cash impact from that tax change as well that we should be considering?\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nYeah. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation allowance, which I spoke about. What it does is it's how you account for taxes on your books. So it's basically an accounting change wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, etc., wherein we didn't have to accrue taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we have recognized different tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up.\nOkay. I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for all of your questions. We'll speak to you again in three months. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Q3 2023 Tesla Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ3 2023 Tesla Inc Earnings Call\n\nTSLANASDAQOCT 18, 5:30 PM\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nOf new factories and we believe there's still meaningful room for improvement there regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicle's now driven over half a billion miles with FSD Beta, Full Self-Driving Beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPU cluster of H100s, we think probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's ever brought that much compute per unit time into production. Since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with Full Self-Driving and vehicle autonomy.\nWe're also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it's photon count in, controls out. Or really you can think of it as there's just a large bit stream coming in and a tiny bit stream going out. Compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work. The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.\nAnd so we are like the car, photons in, controls out, with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle. So interesting to think about that, we will continue to invest significantly in AI development as this is really the massive game changer.\nI mean success in this regard in the long term. I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far, If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it's not clear what the limit is.\nRegarding energy storage. We deployed 4 GWh of energy storage products in Q3 and as this business grows, the energy vision is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute over $500 million to quarterly profit.\nThe Cybertruck, A lot of people excited about the Cybertruck. I am too. I've driven the car. It's an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This is, this is simply normal for when you've got a product with a lot of new technology or any new brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is.\nAs different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve at scale. So I just want to emphasize that one. I think this is potentially our best product ever, and I think it is our best product ever. It is going to require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.\nOften, people do not understand what is truly hard. That is why I say prototypes are easy. Production is hard. People think it's the idea or you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon as though designing a car is.\nJust anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype. But the difficulty going from a prototype to volume production is like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make the prototype in the first place. Then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful.\nFor 100 years, apart from Tesla. So you know, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product, but financially it will take, I don't know, a year to 18 months before it is a Significant positive cash flow contributor.\nI wish there was some way for that to be different, but that's my best guess. Really, the demand is off the charts. We have over a million people who have reserved the car, so it's not a demand issue. But we have to make it, and we need to make it at a price that people can afford. Insanely difficult things.\nIn conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow. We continue to target and expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries. As stated earlier this year. The Tesla AI team is, I think, one of the world's best, and I think it is actually by far the world's best when it comes to real world AI.\nI'll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on Earth, period. And it's getting better and lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you're making.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you very much, Elon. Our CFO Vaibhav had some opening remarks as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks, Martin. Wake up. Deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment. As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downturns for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases. Despite those factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority. On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continue to rise.\nDue to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing, combined with spend on AI technologies like Full Self-Driving, Optimus, and Dojo, we have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term. However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion. Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis, with Energy business leading the charge primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments. Our Services and other businesses on a year-over-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet.\nAs regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer, and therefore as interest costs in the US have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity. We try to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs. However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions which in turn impacts margins to that extent. We recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the US whereby you can get a standard range Model Y for as low as $399 a month.\nIn conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we'll focus on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future. In particular, AI and other next-generation platform. We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term. Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you very much. Now let's go to investor questions. The first investor question comes from Craig. How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nIt's difficult to make an accurate guess at this point. Going back to what I said earlier, that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult and like I said, there's no way around that. If we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world.\nJust distinctions without a difference, then you know, it's really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical, innovative, and something really special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there's nothing to copy. You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.\nSo the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome. Now I can say that if you say, well, where will things end up? I think we'll end up with roughly a quarter million Cybertrucks a year and i don't think we're going to reach that output rate next year. I think probably reach it sometime in 2025. That's my best guess.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell? Particularly progress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day. Thank you.\n\nDrew Baglino\n\nSVP of Powertrain and Energy, Tesla\n\nSure thing. Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Congrats to the Texas team for producing their 20 millionth cell off of line one. Texas now our primary 4680 facility. We're heavily focused on quality, scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter with the increased volume and yield improvements. Cell costs consistently improved month over month within the quarter.\nAlthough we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals, and that is our priority. The Cybertruck cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas. This quarter we convert to building 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in phase one over the next three quarters. Phase two of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction.\nThe additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over phase one, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024. Lastly, in Kato Road, we're retooling to enable large-scale pallet runs of our next-generation cell designs. Kato Road's long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells one generation ahead of our mass production facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp-ups of new designs.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question from institutional investors. Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company's factories in Berlin and Austin, and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nBerlin and Austin factory.\nThe current priority is actually to maximize the output from our existing lines by laser focus on efficiency improvements. As always, maintaining a high quality, and reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing production volume for Mexico. We're working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering development of the new product that will be manufacturing there. That's all I can share for now.\nMexico. We're laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items. But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory. I'm worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in. I just can't emphasize enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment, i.e., interest increases naturally so.\nThat's If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply cannot afford it.\nWe are tracking, I believe, at this point for Model Y to be the selling car in North America, but not just in revenue but in unit volume. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are, you know, number two and number three and whatnot, they, they cost much less than our car.\nSo you know, we're just hitting law of large numbers situations here. I know people want us advertising; we are advertising. I think there is some. there is something to be gained on the advertising front. I don't think it's nothing but informing people of a car that is great that they cannot afford doesn't really help.\nSo that is really the thing that must be solved: to make the car portable. The average person cannot buy it for any amount of money, they can't afford it, they can't afford it. So this is a big deal.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nOkay, thank you very much. The next question is when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the US. I just wanted to address that. Unfortunately, we don't answer product related questions and timings on earnings call. So let's go to the next one.\nCurrent sell-side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance. Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024? And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks for the question. When you look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces. Elon just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment. So we're focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner, and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we'll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, I mean, the risk of stating the obvious. It's not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever or you will exceed the mass of the known universe. So I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Next question is, do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the Robotaxi driven or non driven? What excites you most about how this project is progressing?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, Robotaxi's like necessarily non-driven. the I guess I'm very excited about our progress with autonomy. The end-to-end neural net self-driving software is amazing.\nDrives me all around Austin with no interventions. So it's clearly the right move. so it's really, really pretty amazing. And robotics, that's the same Software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn. How to do things simply by looking. So extremely exciting in the long term as I mentioned before.\nGiven that economic output is number of people times productivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively you've got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you'd like. Your economy is quite the incentive for investment for all intents and purposes.\nAnd I don't think anyone's going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot. Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a brain. Sort of like the Wizard of Oz or whatever.\nYeah, likes the brain and then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a way that it can be mass manufactured. Then at some point the robots will manufacture the robots. Now obviously we need to make sure that there's a good place for humans in that future that we do not create some variance of the Terminator outcome.\nWe're going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the humanoid robot. So basically anyone will be able to shut it off locally. You can't change that. Even if you like a software update, you can't change that. It has to be hard-coded.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you.The next question is why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and Robotaxi is expected so soon?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, we just wanted to make it more affordable so more people try it. Yeah, I think over time the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value. So regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you.The next question is again on FSD. Mercedes-Benz is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system, DRIVE PILOT, is active. Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD and if so, when?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWell, there's a lot of people that assume we have legal liability. Judging by the lawsuits.We're certainly not being let off the hook on that front, whether we would like to or wouldn't like to.\nI mean, I think it's important to remember for everyone that Mercedes system is limited to a few roads in Nevada and certain cities in California. It doesn't work in the snow or the fog. It must have well-marked lanes, only 40mph. Our system is meant to be holistic and driving in any conditions. So we obviously have a much more capable approach, but with those kind of limitations.\nReally not very useful. You know, I think some people understand the profundity of the Tesla AI system, mostly, but very, very few it's basically baby AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive maybe AGI.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. The next question on Optimus. Will Optimus be working on Gigafactory lines next year? If so, how many would you guess will be deployed?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nI think at this point we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but we will provide periodic updates online. So as you can see, whereas Optimus a year ago could barely walk and now it can do yoga. So, a few years from now can probably do valet.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nSounds good. And the last question from investors is: Neural net path planning represent a significant advance in capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the US.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, our approach has been to try to get it like the more places we try to make it work, the harder the problem is. So the reason we don't do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work anywhere at all. So, that's why it's currently just North America.\nAlso for most parts of the world you have to get approval before deploying things. Whereas in the US you can deploy things at risk or at least take liability for your deploy. So it's whereas most countries require some sort of extensive approval program. We only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it's kind of ready for primetime in that country. I apologize, it's not in those countries. But we keep finding ways to make it better. And i really, it needs to drive. It needs to be driven such that it exceeds the even unsupervised significantly exceeds the probability of injury of a human, significantly better. A lower probability of injury than a human by far.\nI think we're tracking to that point very quickly. Obviously in the past I've been overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimistic is that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have rapid initial improvements that if you were to extrapolate that sort of rapid, fairly linear rate of improvement. You get to self-driving quite quickly. But then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmically and starts to asymptote.\nThat's happened several times. I would characterize our progress in real-world AI as a series of stacked log curves. I think that is also true in other parts of AI like LLMs and what not. Series of stacked log curves each log curve gets higher than the last one. So if you keep stacking them, you keep scaling up and eventually get to FSD.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Let's now go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist. Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.\n\nWill Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Truist\n\nGreat.Thanks so much for taking my question and thanks for all the updates today.\nWe learned earlier on the call, it sounds like you don't think the truck will ramp to significant volume until its third year of production. Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of the next gen platform? Or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there? Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production. It's kind of like the 18th month of production is roughly. My guess. So it's just that it happens to be that this year spans next year and gets to 2025. So technically there are three calendar years in there, but there's actually only 18 months, not three years. I would be very disappointed if it took us, and that would be shocking if it took us three years, but 18 months from initial deliveries.\nTo have to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense. I can't tell you how much the blood, sweat, and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering. I've been through it many times, and then here we go again. You know.\n\nWill Stein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Truist\n\nSimilar path for the next gen platform.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI mean, there's like unique complexity to Cybertruck.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck. You know nobody and in generally, I probably drink the exhort gray better than themselves and so. You know, it is. You know, Cybertruck is one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.\nSpecial products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market. To reach volume to be prosperous. It's fundamental to the nature of the newness. So now the sort of high volume, low cost.\nsmaller vehicle is actually much more conventional. Yeah. In terms of, like, the technologies we're putting into it. We didn't have to invent how to bend full-hard stainless steel or have Giga 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world, or new high [inaudible] Cybertruck. I think it will be quite a fast ramp.\nAs Liz was saying, we're doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.\n\nDrew Baglino\n\nSVP of Powertrain and Energy, Tesla\n\nThe simplification makes it easier to automate. It also makes it lower cost. That's intrinsically lower cost.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, just to be clear is it'll be cool, but it's utilitarian. It's not meant to be, you know, fill you with, you know, awe and magic. It can get you from A to B. It'll be so beautiful, but it's utilitarian. It's a utility doesn't have 14 in of travel under suspension as an example. Yes i mean the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right, thank you very much. Let's go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nLead Analyst, New Street Research\n\nHey, can you hear me fine?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYes, yes.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nLead Analyst, New Street Research\n\nHey, I have a first, like a follow-up question on FSD, pricing, and adoption. So I agree with you that as FSD improves, which should see its value increasing, but I guess like the ultimate.\nValue of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi, is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself but you still have to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands-on, eyes-on version of the service.\nI guess you know, There should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variants of the service that could have a very large penetration on your install base, and more expensive one that would remain at the lower penetration level. So I'm just wondering if you're taking that, and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available and are going to work from a technical perspective probably before like the ultimate Robotaxi version can work, if ever. So I'm wondering how you take that into account in how you're thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tier to increase adoption.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. A fully autonomous vehicle, I think fewer, you know, sort of the economics of a fully autonomous vehicle are truly astounding in a positive way.\nWhen you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about 10 to 12 hours of usage per week. That's if you drive an hour and a half a day on average. That's roughly 10 hours a week out of 168 hours. And then there's also, you got to have parking and insurance.\nYou got to take care of the car. Like there's a lot of overhead. So i mean, It's like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car, like all of the cars we're making and have made for a while, we believe are capable of full autonomy.\nSo then if you, if you're able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of five, which slowly means that you being used for maybe 50 hours a week out of 168. So it's still not as you're still assuming that still assumes less than 1/3 of the hours of the week are doing something useful.\nYou've increased the value of that by five. But it still costs the same like you have something then. We're a hardware company with software margins.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nPierre, do you have a follow up?\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nLead Analyst, New Street Research\n\nYes, I have actually a follow-up on a different topic for you, Vaibhav, if that's okay. It's about like your gross margin in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially? How much was the impact of idle cost? How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin. And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage. Very strong positive surprise. So if you can give us the background on that and tell us, you know, how you should think about that gross margin going forward.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThanks for that question. So in terms of, you have a few different aspects of your question. So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, you know, obviously factory idle time had an impact. It did impact by. I mean I won't give you the exact percentage, but it had decent impacts for the quarter.\nYou know, when you look at the other pieces which we're trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well. Right. And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter. In fact, one of the factories came pretty close, in terms of per unit cost, to where we are for some of our other established factories, which is Fremont. So that was a positive in the quarter when it comes to energy margins. You know, Megapack deployment was the key driver there, and that product has done well. I mean, on the cost side also, we've been able to do a lot there. But I do want to caution that, you know, Megapack deployments are a bit lumpy. So yes, we had a great quarter this period.\nBut depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods wherein it would be downward pressure on deployment because of us trying to get the product to that place where.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nPierre Ferragu\n\nLead Analyst, New Street Research\n\nProduct in transit.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYes.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you very much. Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod, feel free to unmute yourself.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took. You've taken now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle cost over the past year. Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded to? Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here, and then related to that, can you share the timing of your next gen that the lower priced product that you talked about earlier this year?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes. When you look into this, you know, there are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don't control. You know, we get, we expect that we get some benefits from cost reduction efforts which are all underway. On the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrade late in Q3. Some of these factors are still in the early ramp phase. In Q4, we're still not up to where we want those factors to be, so they'll impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we're going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind which we will be dealing with.\nOn top of all this, you know, there's overall improvement uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to predict precisely as to where we land. But yes, this is something which, you know, it's an evolving thing which we're observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nI would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional cost downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering.\nSite and the factory operations side. And you know, our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw. We're trying as hard as we possibly can.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThe timing of the next gen product. Can you share that?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nNot at this time.\n\nRod Lache\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Just as a follow-up, obviously price is also a driver of demand, but that's obviously not happening in a vacuum.\nYou mentioned that, I think you mentioned it at some point during this call, that you're also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you just share how you're thinking about price elasticity just at this point, in this macro environment, and any thoughts along those lines?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nI think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean, to be totally frank, if our car costs the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they're very unlikely to. It's worth noting that a lot of these incentives like the tax credit and whatnot, they're actually very difficult for the average person to access because they, most people do not have $10,000, you know, or even $7,500 burning a hole in their bank account.\nLarge number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and with a lot of debt. They've got credit card debt, mortgage debt. So yeah, that's reality for most people. It's sometimes difficult for people who are high income earners and I'd say high; it'd be like someone who's earning over $200,000 a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 a year, which is most people.\nSo for a lot of people, like, these tax credits just, they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even six months to get for the tax credit. And they actually don't in some cases even have that $75 in taxes. So it's really just the vast majority of people, it's how much money do they have to pay immediately, and how much per month? That's it, and can stop right there. A car is still much more expensive than a RAV4 when you look at it that way.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. One other thing I'll add, you know, when you look at, you know, car buying in general, we're trying to get to the next set of EV adopters.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nNot an EV adapter, just next. Who wants a great car?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nExactly.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYou know, sometimes you get these like, you know, honestly, I'd say it's like somewhat correlates with the why doesn't everyone work from home crowd. I'm like, I mean, this is like some real Marie Antoinette vibes from people who say why does everyone work from home? Like, what about all the people that have to come to the factory and fill up the cars? What about all the people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food and deliver your food? It's like, what are you talking about? You? I mean, how detached from reality does the work from home crowd have to be?\nWhile they take advantage of all those who cannot work from home. So I mean, you have to say, like, why did I sleep in the factory so many times? Because it mattered so i just can't emphasize how important cost is it's not an optional thing for most people. It is a necessary thing.\nWe have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy it. I, you know, I keep harping on this interest thing, but I mean, it's just, it just raises the cost of the car. I mean, we're looking at an internal analysis which we think is more or less on track, that when you look at the cost or the price reductions we've made in, say, the Model Y. You compare that to how much people's monthly payment has risen due to interest rates. The price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nif you factor. In the interest rate.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYes. Which is what I'm trying to say. The thing that matters is the monthly. It's how much that money do you have to put down. And do they literally have that in their bank account or will it check balance? And then what is the monthly payment? And it doesn't matter how that monthly payment is, principal, interest, or whatever. It's just a number. And that number has to not cause their bank account to go negative. That's it. so you know, going from near zero interest rates to the current very high interest rates.\nThe actual monthly payment is basically the same. It's just a bunch more of it has gone to interest. And there are some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all, has increased. And so the number of people who simply cannot get credit, period.\nEven if they've got a job and everything's solid. The banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit, given that a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.\n\nDrew Baglino\n\nSVP of Powertrain and Energy, Tesla\n\nYeah. There's also just fewer options. Even if they hand out credit, there's.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nFewer banks to go there. Does your bank still exist? Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish a relationship with a new bank. And so a lot of regional banks have died. And I mean, even Credit Suisse. I mean, geez, that was a shocker. 160-year-old-ish Swiss institution.\nThat doesn't exist anymore. That's mind blowing, I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation. Commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape. You know, credit card debt has been rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are usurious. It's over 20% interest rates, meaning, like, which over time is just becomes.\nExtremely punishing because if somebody's paying 20% interest on their credit card means they cannot pay them off. You cannot pay them off and you're still accruing interest of 20%.That's headed to a bad place.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nThank you. Let's go to next question from George from Canaccord.\n\nGeorge Gianarikas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Canaccord\n\nThank you for taking my question. Just to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters as you discussed in your written remarks, I'm curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factory utilization? Is it material cost reductions? Is it things like Gigacasting? I mean can you just kind of give us some data points to give us confidence that that's going to come down over time? And if I can sneak one in, please. There are press reports and I know how perilous it is to believe some of these.\nThey say that you've included radar as an option, and some Model Ys in China. I'm just here to ask if that's true and if so, why. Thank you.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nWe've not included radar. We have radar as a Tesla-designed radar as an experiment in the Model S and X. That's it. We'll see whether that experiment is worth it. If there are no plans to integrate radar into Model 3. And yeah.\nJust as humans drive well, and in fact an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just with vision, far, far, far. Because, I mean, the car is looking in all directions at once. We don't have eyes in the back of our head.\nThe computer never gets tired and never gets distracted. Get drunk hopefully and so, radar is you know, what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. In order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar only braking. You have to do actions that are radar only. Otherwise you get this disambiguation problem between vision and radar.\nThat's why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had, Model 3 and Y, used to have radar, but we turned it off because the radar actually generated more noise than signal. Now the Tesla designed radar is a high resolution radar that has some potential to be useful, but the jury is still very much out on whether that is in fact the case.\nOn the cost question, I guess, from the vehicle side, like, you know, as Drew mentioned earlier, we are always trying to engineer our products to be cheaper to make and more efficient to make. That comes obviously on the engineering side as we come up with new innovations, but as well on the supply chain side with our partners. We work with them to automate some of their lines, remove their, you know, bottlenecks and their high costs as well. On the logistics side, getting parts to the factory, it's not. It's not like a one thing that you have to. It's like cost everywhere. And we do it ruthlessly at all times. Operations efficiency. All of the. All of the above, yeah.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nI mean, I would say there's a whole laundry list of things which we are chasing, we internally call it the cost attack, where we're literally going line by line and saying, how can we make it better? And it's a grind.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nA grind. Game of pennies. It's like Game of Thrones, but pennies. I mean, first approximation, if you've got a $40,000 car and roughly 10,000 items in that car, that means each thing, on average, costs four bucks. So in order to get the cost down, say by 10%, you have to get $0.40 out of each part, on average. It is a game of pennies. We play it willingly. Yeah, we've done it many, many times. And, you know, even something as simple as, like a sticker.\nLike, there's too many stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees. There's, you know, something as simple as a QR code. You might think, well, putting a QR code on a part, why not just put them. Put them on there? It's like, well, are we actually going to use that QR code also, Penny? Yeah, exactly. And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn't go on properly or you can't read it properly, and then it stops the line. It's more than a penny. Yeah, absolutely.\nIt's chipping away. I mean, it is trying to. It does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times very much. Escaping prison. Yeah.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYou know, on top of it, like we said, you know, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up. That would also bring some savings from high production. But then on the flip side, we're going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about. So, yeah, so those are the real puts and takes which we are working through.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, but there's not like some accidentally, you know, some brick of gold that we've shot and left in the car, unfortunately. We try to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car. Because any tool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability.\nThat's what I call this. Any tool. If you want to lose weight and you say, well, I need to lose. 15 right away. Well, you could chop your arm off, but then you're sitting there with one arm, you're still fat. So. Sort of like. Yeah, yeah. You actually have to eat less food and work out. That's the actual way. Doctor's advice. Yeah. It's not, you know, super fun because food is delicious. And I personally am not a he. I don't love working out. I know some people do. I wish I did, but I don't. Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case I love moving the mouse.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right, let's go to Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.\nColin, Colin, can you unmute yourselves?\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOh, sorry about that.\nCan you hear me now? Yeah, thanks for my question. You said in the commentary that you're not going full tilt on the plant in Mexico until there's signs that the economy is strong. Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? Where would that come from? Any color on what you mean?\nSort of not going full tilt? Could that plant get delayed indefinitely, or are we kind of talking about?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nNo, we're definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We put a lot of effort into looking at different locations, and we feel very good about that location. We are going to build a factory there, and it's going to be great.\nThe question is really just one of timing and there's going to be a broken record on the interest front. It's just interest rates have to come down. If interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability. It is just the same as increasing the price of the car. So I just don't have visibility into. If you can tell me what the interest rates are, I can tell you.\nWhen we should build the factory. We are going to build it, and I mean, I think we'll. We'll start the, you know, initial phases of construction next year. But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009, when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. So, well, that's now 14 years ago.\nThat is seared into my mind with a branding iron. Because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time. I mean, we closed off a financing round in 2008 at 6:00PM, 24 December Christmas Eve. If we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas.\nSo we actually closed that round on the last hour of the last day that it was possible. Stressful to say the least, and then barely made it through 2009. So I'm like, I want to just. I don't want to be going at top speed into uncertainty. A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well so.\nWe have room here like in Giga Texas, you said we still have it in this building. It's not full with Cybertruck and Model Y. You know, there's plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is. We also have 2,000 acres here. There's also a lot. We're actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we own. So you know, we could technically do all the scaling necessary just here so.\nI mean, personnel is our biggest challenge. The greater Austin area only has 2 million people. So people are moving here, and they're willing to move here. But there's somewhat of a housing crisis. They got to live somewhere.\nSo I don't know. I mean, I'm just curious. Like, I just, I'm not saying things will be bad, I'm just saying they might be. And I think like Tesla is an incredibly capable ship.\nBut we need to make sure. If the macroeconomic conditions are stormy. Even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships will sink. We're not going to sink. But even a great ship in a storm has challenges. That storm will apply to everyone, not just us, and not just the auto industry, apply to everyone, I think. You know, apart from necessary sort of staples like food and stuff. I just, I don't know. If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate.\n\nColin Langan\n\nAutomotive and Mobility Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nIf anyone's got any guesses on this, you know, I'd love to be less wrong. I apologize if I'm perhaps more paranoid than I should be because that might also be the case because I am. I have PTSD from 2009 big time.\nIn 2017 through 2019 were not picnic either. That was very tough going. The auto industry is also somewhat cyclic because people tend to hesitate to buy a new car. If there's uncertainty in the economy.\nYou know, product companies do very well in good economic times, and they don't do as well in tough economic times. It's just, you know, whereas if somebody's selling bread, then I think, you know, people still need to have bread. Yeah. You need bread, you need food all the time. New car, you don't have to have bread cemented.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nEspecially if there's wars going on, and then that impacts your sentiment.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCo-Founder and CEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, I mean, if people are reading about wars all over the world. Buying a new car tends to not be front of mind.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Tesla\n\nAll right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have today. Thank you very much for all of your good questions, and we'll see you again in three months. Thank you very much.",

So just a Q2 recap. In Q2, we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So it was the number one vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that sell at a far lower price. This is, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their support. This came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. Nonetheless, we managed to achieve an operating margin of about 10%.\nWe continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year, although we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we've got summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades. So just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades. In the long term, autonomy, we think, is going to just drive volume through the ceiling next level. And our sort of future robotaxi products, dedicated robotaxi products, we think have quasi-infinite demand. So the way we're going to manufacture the robotaxi is also itself a revolution. So it's revolutionary design made in a revolutionary way. It'll be by far the highest units per hour of any vehicle production ever. So we're very excited about that. With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural net with data from millions of vehicles.\nI mean, this has been proven over and over again. The more training data you have, the better the results. And I mean, there are times where we see basically in a neural net, basically it's sort of at a million training examples, it barely works. At 2 million, it slightly works. At 3 million, it's like, \"Wow, okay, we're seeing something.\" But then you get to like 10 million training examples, it becomes incredible. So there's just no substitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all other companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order of magnitude. So I think we might have 90% of all, or a very big number. So the success in AI and dev is a function of talent, sort of unique data, and computing resources.\nAnd we have outstanding capabilities in all three arenas. And I really just don't know how anyone could do what we're doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have the training data. So speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training. It is designed to, it's somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is video training. So we just see that the need for neural net training tools being quasi-infinite things is just enormous. So I think having, we expect to use both NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear. But we just see a demand for really vast training resources. And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of 100 exaflops by the end of next year.\nSo to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD Beta. That 300 million-mile number is going to seem small very quickly. It'll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles. And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver. And between Autopilot, our Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of hardware 3.4, but it's really dedicated. It's a high-efficiency inference computer that's in the car. And our Optimus robot, Tesla is clearly at the cutting edge of AI development. With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin. I'm actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.\nThis is the first truck that we're aware of that will have four doors, over a six-foot bed, and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So it's sort of biggest on the outside, but it's even bigger on the inside. So I think that's one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter. So we're trying to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone. Not too big, not too small, and then really maximize the utility of the volume. And we can't wait to start delivering it later this year. Some other highlights are global Supercharging network. It now stands at over 50,000, roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations.\nAs I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla charging standard, which we made open source and is now called the North American Charging Standard, we're deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes, and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general. So that's our goal there. Then something I think I want to emphasize very strongly, this is a very important point, is that Tesla, just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we're not licensing, in that case, not licensing, we're just making it available. But we are very open to licensing our Full Self-Driving software and hardware to other car companies.\nWe are already in discussions, early discussions with a major OEM about using the Tesla FSD. So we're not trying to keep this to ourselves. We're more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well. Now, in conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can while maintaining healthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era, and we're incredibly excited about what's to come. Our other businesses, such as Megapack, Supercharging service, and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter. And then lastly, I'd just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact you're making.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach gives some opening remarks as well.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah, thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for energy, services, and other businesses. Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress. As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence, and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach. First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. This includes increasing spending on AI-related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus, and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next-generation platform, and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend.\nThis also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, Services, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future. Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both our vehicle and energy business, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per-unit cost reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, working process inventory, and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2. If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.\nWe realized per-unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material costs and commodities, manufacturing costs, and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions in deal economics, particularly with Megapack. As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones. As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon's comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible. It's also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near term.\nRegardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook. Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much, Zach. Let's go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD, we've already answered, so let's go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of 4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on battery day? When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on battery day?\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Tesla\n\nYeah, first, I'll just start with a little bit of a production update. So in Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here in Texas. So congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter over quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS. Here in Texas, we're preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization. As we scale Cybertruck cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, the Cybertruck cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis.\nWe're yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on battery day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day. Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on at battery day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost, and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla's AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin from Autobidder as the segment accelerates?\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Tesla\n\nWe can't comment on future product roadmap, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update. Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place in line with our vehicle target margins. The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several projects in California, and one here at Gigafactory Texas, as I toured today, actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities, and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.\nOn the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK, and California with over 6 GWh under Tesla's dispatch next year. In the UK, our project performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it's a relatively small contributor to revenues given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It's important to remember that these large capital projects have lifetimes of 20 years, so recurring revenues on an analyzed basis relative to upfront CapEx are small. On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 500,000 Powerwalls installed.\nJust this week, we were launching ChargeOn Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower our median customer's annual bill by 1/3 and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expands market access. Today, we are expanding Tesla Electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter. Unfortunately, and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla Electric and VPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.\nIn the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access that utilities, market operators, and regulators permit. For Powerwalls eligible to provide the full stack of energy services like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing incentives? And secondly, battery raw material declines year to date.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nAll right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, we provided previous guidance that we expect these to be for the course of this year in the range of $150 million to 250 million per quarter. We are staying within that boundary as we guided previously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we've mentioned this before, that this includes a 50/50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner, Panasonic. On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there as we've discussed previously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the last call because typically we see this coming about a quarter before it actually is realized in our financials.\nAlso, just as a reminder, we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with a bunch of other companies to put in place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down. We're also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it's about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received. Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there's two things to keep in mind there.\nThe first is that our FX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. So as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it's important to adjust for that. And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin costs, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin-related builds increased. And so that's something to consider as you model out the impact from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit. I do want to ask Karn if there's anything else on the commodity side or just more generally you want to add here.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nYeah, as you mentioned, Zach, we've naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term contracts we have in place. We have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries, such as nickel, cobalt, and graphite. The reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per vehicle impact. We're taking advantage. Extend some of those fixed-price contracts through the end of the decade. It's a playbook that we'll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question on FSD. Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah, this is a question we get asked a lot. So we're excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a one-time amnesty. So you need to take advantage of it in Q3, or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery timeframes. So yeah, yeah, yeah, I hope this makes people happy. But we don't get to do it. This is a one-time thing. It's doing okay.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. The next question. When will you give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing, and specifications?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThe demand is so far off the hook, you can't even see the hook. So that's really not an issue. I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot. It doesn't look like it doesn't look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. And the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely element of the entire supply chain and internal production. So I wouldn't expect it. I hope it's smooth. We're certainly better at production ramps than we've got a lot of experience with production ramps. But first-order approximation, there's like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck. And if any one of it'll go as fast as the least lucky least well-executed element of the 10,000.\nAlways very difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we'll be making them in high volume next year. We will be delivering the car this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is, critics of Giga Casting have contended that process makes vehicles harder and more costly to repair, essentially pushing costs onto the customer. Could you share some details about the initial repair experience with Giga Casting vehicles?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThat must be why everyone's copying us.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nYeah. Thank you. This is Lars. That's simply not true. There's a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they're made of multiple materials and multiple joining methods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and structural adhesive have to be chiseled out. Dried adhesive has to be removed. Stampings cut, blah, blah, blah.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt's a crazy patchwork quilt.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nYeah. So putting that back together means time and money. Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail on a Model Y, to do that versus what we replaced it with from the Model 3, it's 10 times cheaper and three times faster to do it with a cast rail. My design team works with our collision repair team since we're closed loop on this with insurance, and we design specific parts that make it easier and faster to repair. We have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops. We expect that we'll continue to do this and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time. We already make this available to all body shops through our Tesla-approved body shop training.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nIt's crucial. I don't think anyone else can do it with the ecosystem that we have, so.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts. And we actually do that all the time. So the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway. So we can actually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings. But the cast, basically, cast rear body or front body is lighter, cheaper, better for noise, vibration, and harshness, much easier to manufacture.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nIt's better in every way.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThat's why so many other car companies are copying us.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nProbably.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThey don't know. Well, they certainly put out a lot of press releases about it. I think it's basically going to be how all cars are made in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question. How many Optimus bots have been made and when will they be able to start performing useful tasks?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\n10 million.\nYeah. I think we're around five or six bots. We're at 10, I guess. It depends on how many are working and what phase. But it's sort of, yeah, there's more every month. There's a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for a humanoid robot at any price.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly not compelling.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYes. Not a humanoid robot that can do stuff that the things that a human could do. So we've actually had to design our own actuators that integrate the motor, the power electronics, the controller, the sensors, and really every one of them is custom design. And then, of course, we'll be using the same inference hardware as the car. But we are in designing these actuators, designing them for volume production. So they're not just lighter, tighter, and more capable than any other actuators that we're aware of that exist in the world. It's also actually manufacturable. So we should be able to make them in volume. The first Optimus that will have all of the Tesla-designed actuators, sort of production candidate actuators integrated and working should be around November-ish. And then we'll start ramping up after that.\nIn terms of when we'll be able to do some useful things, we'll first be trying this out in our own factories and just proving out its utility. But I think we'll be able to have it do something useful in our factories sometime next year. I would be, yeah, I'm pretty confident of that. So yeah, and it's going well. I should say another cool thing about Optimus is that just in the US alone, there are 2 million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team. And by combining a Neuralink implant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arms or leg or all arms and legs amputated, we believe we can give you basically a cyborg body that is incredibly capable. $6 million man in real life. But don't worry, it costs $6 million. $60,000 man.\nIt doesn't sound impressive, but it'll actually, so that actually could be a really, I think, would be incredible to potentially help millions of people around the world and give them a robot arm or leg that is as good, maybe long-term better than a biological one.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is, how has the order intake trended relatively to production levels during Q2, and how is it trended in the quarter-to-date period? Conceptually, how does Tesla decide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or add other sales incentives to increase demand?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I guess demand is roughly tracked production, which is what we aim for. We look at something that we have that really, I think, no other car maker has is that we have real-time demand and real-time production. So seven days a week, I get an email, an order-generated email that shows output from all factories and orders globally. So it's like a real-time thing on the pulse of Earth, basically. We adjust costs according to what the mood of the public is. But buying a new car is a big decision for the vast majority of people. So anytime there's economic uncertainty, people will generally pause on a new car buying at least to see what happens. Obviously another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with debt decreases. So effectively increasing the price of the car.\nWhen interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car. This is at least up until recently. It was just, I believe, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. We had to do something about that. If somebody's got a crystal ball for the global economy, I really appreciate it if I could borrow that crystal ball.\n\nOperator\n\nDM us.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Exactly. DM me. It should be not on Twitter. So I mean, one day it seems like the world economy is falling apart, and the next day everything's fine. I don't know what the hell's going on, to be totally frank. I wish I did. So I mean, that's why I say I always on Twitter, I posted just really advising because I care a lot about the sort of the small shareholders, especially ones that are stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you guys. And so we can't control these macro shocks or the manic-depressive nature of the stock market. So that's why I recommend against margin loans in times that are turbulent. If times are not that turbulent, actually a margin loan can be a smart move within reason. But we're in, I would call it, turbulent times.\nI have very high confidence in the long-term value of Tesla. I see a path to a 10x. Well, maybe not 10x. These days, a 5x increase in the value of the company, maybe a 10x. But where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations, and the mood of the markets, one cannot predict. The old adage of buy and hold is right. For investment advice, I say identify a company as products you love. See if they does it seem like they'll continue to make good products or great products? Buy that stock and hold it. That's it. You will win. The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally great goods and services. They don't exist for any other reason. They shouldn't.\nSo that's why you should buy a stock of a company that makes great products and has a great future pipeline. It's common sense, actually. And then generally, if you're confident about what that company's products or services are, when the market panics, buy. And when the market is overly exuberant, you can sell. I'm not recommending you sell Tesla, but buy low, sell high. Warren Buffett, actually, I think has a saying. I'm paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like imagine you're living in your house and some crazy manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices at you. And it's a different price every day. But the house is still the same house. So this is the stock market. Credit that to Warren Buffett.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Let's go to the next question. With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts? And if so, when?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nOh, man. Who is that crystal ball again? If I may, it's like, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture. Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly. I'd recommend looking at ARK Invest. I think their analysis is very good. It's the best. I mean, and generally, FinTwit or the finance, the smart finance people on Twitter, follow their accounts. They're great. So that's, in my opinion, where you'll get the best info. So I strongly believe Tesla is an epic long-term investment. And don't sweat it when things go up and down. In fact, if the market panics, buy. If the market's a little too exuberant, sell at the time. But just generally, I feel confident we'll deliver over the long term, but can't control the short term. And autonomy is really where it's at.\nI mean, Zach, what do you?\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nOh, I fully agree with you. I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is, are we generating enough money to continue to invest? The portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense. It's intense in terms of investment. It's intense in terms of potential.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nFrankly, I think it's ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business while investing massive amounts of money in new technology. That is super hard.\n\nOperator\n\nVertical integration. It's not even just like new products, but also.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We actually make our shit. We don't outsource to others, but sorry. That's incorrect. I'm going to school.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nAt least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest. That means continuing to be hyper-focused on near-term cost reduction, because everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest. We're hyper-focused on working capital management, which we've made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and WIP side of that. We've been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest the cash. This is what we're focused on. There's a set of this that we control. We have a pipeline of cost reductions. We are getting tailwinds in the commodity space right now, as Karn mentioned. That's helpful. Variability around average selling prices goes back to Elon's point. We don't control interest rates. We don't control macro consumer sentiment.\nWe have an obligation to be responsive to that, to ensure that we're matching supply and demand and keeping things balanced. This is how we're managing the next handful of quarters. Soon enough, these quarters will be behind us. They won't be part of the present value of future cash flows of the business. We want to make sure we keep that view and make sure that the long term of the business is exactly the way that we want it to be.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell said.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. Now let's go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Dan, feel free to unmute yourself.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good evening. Thank you. I wanted to start first with a question about your efforts in AI and Dojo. It's pretty clear. It sounds like you're accelerating your focus. Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what the process is of refining a product? Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense of when the payout starts to when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is, what should we expect on the OpEx front as a result of this?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nSorry. Are you saying how much are we going to spend on Dojo, or?\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nYeah.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThe R&D of Dojo.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nYes.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, we're not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditure. But I mean, I think we will be spending to the north of a billion over the next year on through the end of next year. It's well over a billion dollars in Dojo. And yeah. So I mean, we've got a truly staggering amount of video data to do training on. And this is another thing. In order to copy us, you also need to spend billions of dollars on training compute. I mean, it's like, and it's also hard, too. You need the data. You need the training compute. It's like, I think, all things needed to actually achieve this at scale to a more generalized solution for autonomy. This is one of the hardest problems ever. You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot.\nI'm saying, if they're so great, why can't they make a self-driving car? Because it's harder. That's why. But I do think that's it. I think there's some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we've got to process is going to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that's what Dojo is designed to do, is optimize for video training. It's not optimized for LLMs. It's optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute to memory bandwidth. So whereas LLMs tend to be memory bandwidth choked. So that's it. I mean, but like I said, we have some. We're using a lot of NVIDIA hardware, and we continue to. We'll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us.\nTremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They've done an incredible job. And frankly, I don't know. If they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can't. So they got so many customers. They've been kind enough to nonetheless prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yeah, the sheer magnitude of video training, because like I said, we're not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than humans, maybe 100 times better than human. Right now, I believe there's something on the order of a million automotive deaths per year. And then if you say permanent serious injuries, I think it's probably closer to 10 million per year. And so it matters if you're twice as good as human, 10 times better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and a million severe permanent injuries.\nSo it's like, okay, well, we'd rather be 100 times better. So there's really, it's a march of miles. And we want to achieve as perfect a safety as possible. And vast, truly mind-boggling amounts of video and compute are needed for that. And then I do think there's other applications for Dojo, but we just desperately need it for video training.\nGreat. Just to add to what Elon mentioned. So the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend and capital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so we provide a three-year outlook on our capital expense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we'll continue to update our guidance in the Q.\nYeah. I want to say the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of Full Self-Driving is training. If we had more training compute, we would get it done faster. So that's it.\nIt's just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.\n\nDan Levy\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there's some incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you're sticking with your near-term, your volume target of 50% CAGR. As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution. There's going to be some help from further EV penetration growth. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact? Or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nIt's not about getting more share. It's just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as five times what it is today. Because average passenger vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week. If it's sort of let's say it's one and a half hours a day on average, that's 10 hours a week-ish. If you've got an autonomous if that vehicle is able to operate autonomously and be used in either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous, like Airbnb, maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others. Sometimes you want to use it exclusively, just like doing Airbnb with a room in your house. The value is just tremendous.\nSo I think it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase. I think the Tesla fleet value increase to the point in which we can upload Full Self-Driving and it's approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much. Two questions for me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles on existing vehicles, you're improving FSD incrementally. What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving Full Self-Driving have been optimistic in the past. The reason they've been optimistic is what it tends to look like is we'll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So first, a logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up. And so if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing. But then it's actually logarithmic and curves over. And then there've been a series of stacked logarithmic curves. Now, I know I'm the boy who cried FSD, but man, I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year. That's not to say we're approved by regulators.\nI'm saying that would be in the US because we've got to focus on one market first. But I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year. I've been wrong in the past. I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD, so the weird thing is, the price of FSD is actually very low. It's not high. When you go back to what I was saying earlier, the value of the car increases dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 is actually a low price, not a high price. And now we will offer, and I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription, although most people don't know that. So I'd recommend maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don't have to go with the $15,000 thing.\nBut I think, yeah, obviously, if a car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price for FSD.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist. William, go ahead and unmute.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I'd like to ask, to stick on this AI topic. We've read with great interest the developments in Dojo today, and you've spoken about FSD. But you've also, Elon, you've started this xAI company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI features and products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is the focus. So can you talk about how xAI might overlap, might perhaps compete with Tesla, or in other ways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does? Thanks very much.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I think it will actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world's best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So that's actually how it got started. I was interviewing a few people, and they're like, \"No, we want to do a startup.\" I was like, \"And that's all.\" I couldn't convince them to join Tesla. So I was like, \"Okay, well, better it's a startup that I run than they go work somewhere else.\" That's kind of the genesis of xAI. And xAI is focused on sort of AGI. Yeah. But like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings to Tesla.\nAlso, for some of the best, for the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interesting problems. And if you take, say, our materials science group, really what convinced Charlie Kuehmann to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at where we think is the best materials science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla and SpaceX. He wasn't willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he was willing to do it if it was Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent in the world. That's the kind of thing you need to do. And that actually has been very beneficial to Tesla. So.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nIf I can squeeze one more mundane question in, I wonder if you think you can hit the 1.8 million unit number with current pricing, or do you anticipate needing to continue to lower prices? Because it seems like they've stabilized. The trends have stabilized in the last maybe month and a half. Should we expect sort of continued decreases or more stabilization for the rest of the year?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nSure. We have sort of started the referral program, which I think will be quite effective. As Zach was saying earlier, we don't control the macroeconomic conditions. So if interest rates continue to rise, that reduces the affordability of cars. And for a lot of people, they're really trying to balance, just barely breaking even every month. In fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are in fact not breaking even every month. Credit card debt is looking scary. So we just don't control macro conditions. If macro conditions are stable, I think prices will be stable. And if they're not stable, then we would have to lower prices. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Let's go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks so much, guys. As you're building out Dojo and implementing what surely is going to be a highly complex set of software, can you speak to the maturity of the operating system and how much outsourced software you're expecting to use in that system?\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThis is a custom software stack, but it is designed such that you can run at a high level, PyTorch and JAX. But then we have to customize it to actually run on custom silicon. So the software stack is a combination of open source software and then Tesla software all the way to the bare silicon, which is the case for the inference computer in the car.\n\nColin Rusch\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay. Thanks so much. That's super helpful. Then can you speak to how you're managing some of the geopolitical risks relative to your capacity expansion? Obviously, as you guys continue to grow at this rate, you're going to be putting some folks out of business, and there's going to be some impacts around regional economies. So I just want to understand how you're thinking about that in terms of some of your CapEx plans and how you're managing some of those relationships with different countries and regions.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nWell, this is a period of unusual geopolitical risk. So I think the best we can do is have factories in many parts of the world such that if things get difficult in one part of the world, we can still keep things going in the rest of the world.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much for taking the question. Tesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an update on when you think automotive costs per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehicle level, and what are the key puts and takes to get there?\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nThis is, I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There's a series of costs that we manage. There's a series of costs in which we don't control. And so particularly on the commodity side where labor costs go, etc., it's just hard to say.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We saw very inflationary pressures, like strong inflationary pressures, for a while last year. And now, which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce costs. And now we're seeing what seemed to be deflationary pressures, certainly deflationary if deflation is a pressure. But we're seeing commodity prices dropping, as was mentioned, as Karn mentioned a moment ago. And I mean, what do you think? I mean, basically, the trend seems to be deflationary at the commodity level.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nDefinitely. There's that. And then there's also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That's the other thing we're seeing as we're becoming a bigger and bigger part of a lot of suppliers. The economies of scale come into play. There's equipment depreciation that comes into play, equipment that was commissioned five to seven years ago that used to be a part of the piece price that's completely amortized. So we'll see situations where the piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away. And then just we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continuing to get better at what we do. So we have seen, I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Of course, the commodities spiked up and down. Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. I totally agree.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. We're looking at prices went absolutely insane there for a while.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. And they're recovering now.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nCobalts are clearer than what it used to be.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nYeah. And we're still early in the ramp. Well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost-down curve of Austin and Berlin. And so it takes time to work the cost out. At first, it's focused on ramp. Ramp brings cost out.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nRamp and quality. And then, yeah, ramp and quality cost.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nYeah. And then once that stabilizes, we can divert bandwidth to cost reduction. And so Austin and Berlin saw quite a decent amount of cost reduction on a fundamental basis from Q1 to Q2. We'll continue to do that work. That will be helpful. And so we're just going to keep chipping away at it.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nYeah. Packaging is a big element to that.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. Packaging logistics too.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Tesla\n\nLogistics is normalizing, which is great.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nQ-box utilization, something that the team has been very focused on. So every bit of it.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's hard. Logistics is underappreciated. It's the old saying goes like, \"Bell is the one with tactics, the wood is the one with logistics.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Tesla)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Tesla\n\nYeah. We made tremendous improvements in cost and on fronts. On expected costs, we have down pre-pandemic expected cost levels now. Our goal is to go further down.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla\n\nYeah. So when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, the way that we look at it internally, normalized for the impacts of mix shift with Austin and Berlin being a higher percentage of our mix, normalized for SNX being a higher percentage of our mix in Q2 versus Q1, the sequential cost reduction, it might be the largest we've had in a while. So I think it's great work on behalf of the Tesla team, and we just got to keep it up.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nYeah. It's game of pennies. It's like Game of Thrones but pennies.\n\nOperator\n\nMark, do you have a follow-up question? I think you're muted.\n\nMark Delaney\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYep. Yeah. Thank you very much for all the details on that. Maybe you could put a finer point on the downtime impact that you spoke about in your prepared comments in terms of production impact, and then also to what extent there's a margin impact from those factory upgrades that you're planning this quarter. Thank you.\n\nZach Kirkhorn\n\nCFO, Tesla",
    "content2": "Yeah. The downtime, we don't know exactly the number of cars impacted because kind of the way that we go into downtime windows for upgrades is we set aside a period of time, but then the team is challenged to go as quickly as possible so that we can get the factories up and running again and minimize that. So it's not profound reduction. Hopefully, it's quite small.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nI think we're getting too much into the weeds here. I mean, we're asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer. So let's move on.\n\nOperator\n\nYeah. I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today. We'll speak to you all in the next three months. Thank you very much.\n\nElon Musk\n\nCEO, Tesla\n\nThank you."

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nChairman, Tesla Motors, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. So just a Q1 recap. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States. And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery, so it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results. The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain. I don't think I'm telling anyone anything people don't already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.\nAnd while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry. We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and that it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This is an extremely important point.\nLet's see. Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes. It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.\nAs with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates. So the Cybertruck is no different. So it's -- there's tremendous amount of demand for the product, obviously. And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer. But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going. And this is, really, a very radical product. It's not made in the way that other cars are made.\nSo let's see, with regards to Megapack, we're making great progress. Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. There's still some way to go to reach the full run rates of 40 gigawatt hours per year. And then we additionally announced the start of a new Megafactory in Shanghai. So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.\nRegarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. We've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially. We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has. Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.\nSo yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting factors of achieving full autonomy. So we're continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training. And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore. So I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.\nIn conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible. Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again. And yes, super appreciated.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much. And Zach has some remarks as well.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries. And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.\nThere are 3 main points I want to make. First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially. But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels. In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and onetime items, most notably, warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.\nProgress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized. Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes. However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes.\nNote that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries. As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows. This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.\nSecond, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus. This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.\nThird, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year. Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses. We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our Autonomy and AI-enabled products. And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry-leading. To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital, and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.\nI want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.",

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)\nBut before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. It was our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.\nSo in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges. So it's worth noting that all these records were in the face of massive difficulties. Credit to the team for achieving that.\nThe most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So I mean that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.\nSo we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole. So basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer. And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is. And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so. And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on cost control. And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yes.\nWith respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data shows that improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.\nRegarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energy density.\nSo energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worth remembering that the 3 pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind, because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So you have those 3 things. You can convert all of earth to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually.\nSo I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and we -- our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible. So yes, so we were ramping up Megapack production. And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our legal output.\nSo in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins. As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer. But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength. And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1 Investor Day. And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year. Congratulations, guys.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nSenior Director for IR, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThanks, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Martin. So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla. I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.\nOn a full year basis, revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading. Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further.\nFor Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S. and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.\nAdditionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by 3 factors: first is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls; second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.\nPartially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles. The energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage. While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.\nAs we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost. There are 3 key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.\nIn particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where inefficiencies are the highest. But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability. This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.\nAs the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well. In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure. Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term. However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.\nThird, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map. This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business. We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month. Thank you.",

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update that we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today's call, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. (Operator Instructions) But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. So just to do a Q3 recap. Q3 was another record quarter on many levels. We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%. And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we're looking forward to a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year. So Q4 is looking extremely good.\nOn the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon. And in fact just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday's hold rate, it would be 2,000.\nOur production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months. We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.\nThe Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.\nRegarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and showed the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range of improvements of full self-driving software.\nOur vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially. Our goal with that AI Day was to post recruiting, and we've seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume. So it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world. I can't emphasize the importance of this enough because I think it finally has become clear to the smallest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.\nSo this quarter, we expect to go to wide release of full self-driving beta in North America. So anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now. So and then, obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchase a full self-driving option will immediately have that available to them.\nSo the safety that we're seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we're seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.\nLet's see, with respect to demand. We've got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can't emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far in the future as we can see. So the factories are running at full speed, and we're delivering a recovery make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road. Of the 2 billion trucks on the road, we only have about 3.5 million. So we're about a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet.\nLet's see. Kind of based on my -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get on Twitter about buybacks. And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions about buybacks. The -- we've debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level. The Board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. But we want to work through the right process to do a buyback, but it's certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion. Even in the downside scenario next year, even given if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback. This is obviously pending Board review and approval. So it's likely that we'll do some meaningful buyback.\nSo in conclusion, while the market theme revolve around the short term, it's very important to focus on the long term. I can't emphasize this enough with investors. And I think long-time investors, obviously recognize this with Tesla. We have our sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trend has been extremely good. And several years ago I said, I think, on our earnings call, that I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest cap company, I think, in the market. And Apple, at that time, I think was around $700 billion. And I said it required incredible execution, at least some luck.\nAnd we didn't only achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple's market cap at the time. And now I am of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap. In fact, I see a potential path with Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So now that doesn't mean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difficult. It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, managed expansion and, always, luck.\nBut for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let's say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco. I think that's -- I haven't quite seen that yet. I mean this is the first time I've seen that potential.\nSo we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we've got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you've heard about, some of which you haven't. We're in the final lap for Cybertruck. We're building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas Austin and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.\nAnd then with respect to batteries, we're moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated. And our cap load refining, we're moving a ton of speed to do that.\nSo I think it's an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future. None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla. So I'd like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team. You guys rock. You're the ones that make it happen. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nSenior Director for IR, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you very much. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to continue on Elon's theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.\nOn automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross margin at 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage. However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.\nRemoving regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%. Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.\nWe also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed at length on prior calls, In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.\nOn energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.\nSpecifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2, we've started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn't anticipate. This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter. Just to put this in perspective, roughly 2/3 of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and 1/3 in the final 2 weeks. As a result, we have begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.\nAs we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control. On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.\nBoston and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3. And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins. Thank you.",

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)\nBut before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. So just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolonged shutdown of our Shanghai factory. But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongest quarters in our history. Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai. And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.\nI do want to emphasize this is obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control. The past few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it's been kind of supply chain hell for several years. Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming in saving difficult challenges. And huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacrificed a lot to get the factory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.\nSo also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin. We achieved an important milestone of 1,000 cars a week in June. And we're expecting -- sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the 1,000-vehicle per week milestone and hopefully in the next few months.\nTo be clear, we're currently making the cars with the 2170 cells, and Drew Baglino will address some of the 4680 questions later in this call. But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year. So we're not dependent on 4680. 4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.\nThat said, we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas. And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.\nRegarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD Beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners. They're very happy with the capability of the system and we'll continue to improve it every week. We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta. That's more autonomous miles than any company we're aware of, I think probably more than -- it might be more than any -- all other companies combined. So -- and that mileage is growing exponentially.\nWith regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage. We're super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla. And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing. And in general, I think it is a very important thing to do. We need to make stuff and make it efficiently and that's manufacturing.\nSo we've made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes. As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our -- the large castings, we make the world's largest castings. We reduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin. So that's, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case. And I should say it's also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness. So it's good on every level.\nBut this journey is not over. We'll bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we're not quite ready to talk about now but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.\nOur safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before. So you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact, you have very little time to tension the seatbelt. If you've got to be -- the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner. But because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.\nAnd so we can tension the seat belts, and we can even adjust the airbag deployment because we can see, not just feel. This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer. And there's also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.\nIn conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before. Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design. We are expecting to be -- still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year. And we're very, very excited about that product. I think it might actually be our best product ever.\nLet's see. FSD Beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year. And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we'll also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts of the world.\nWe're hosting our AI Day in a few months. I think people will be amazed at what we're able to show off in AI Day. So basically, there's a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year. And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times. Super appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nSenior Director for IR, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you very much. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter. Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter.\nOur Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records. The Shanghai factory resumed full production, and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through their initial ramps.\nAdditionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years. I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening. You've embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission. I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.\nOn GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%. The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.\nAdditionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online. While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and logistics.\nThe energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit economics. Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year. We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these challenges.\nWithin operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related start-up costs have wound down as these factories have moved into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS. Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within restructuring and other. We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing reductions.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes, actually, it should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of our Bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate. So it was important for us to maximize our cash position, given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China.\nWe are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin. It's just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company, given COVID shutdowns in China. And we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nWe still have it.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nWe still have our Dogecoin.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nDespite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest operating margins of 14.6%. Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown. However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our working capital-related cash flows restabilize.\nAs we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking second half of the year. We're quite excited about this. A couple of things to keep in mind as we progress. Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on our margins for the balance of the year. However, the impact should reduce as we increase ramp.\nSecond, as we've mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global pricing to increase as our backlog flows through. However, macroeconomic-related cost increases will also continue to be part of our story.\nAnd finally, despite losing more builds in Q3 than expected, we're still pushing to reach 50% growth this year. This target has become more difficult but it remains possible with strong execution. And as Elon mentioned, no more force majeure events for the balance of the year.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes, a lot of force majeure in the last several years, that's for sure.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.\n(Operator Instructions) Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks. Zach?\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the company. Numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, we've continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.\nLast quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin and bottom line profitability. GAAP automotive gross margin reached 32.9% and first time exceeded $0.30 when excluding regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing backlog. Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long. Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being ordered today.\nOur per unit vehicle cost increased as well. Inflation, raw material prices, expedites and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice. Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner. Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y. We also recognized a onetime benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.\nThe energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business. Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.\nOpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items. As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%. Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April. These costs will be in automotive COGS going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable cars.\nOur free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production. Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly 0.\nLooking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2. First, we've lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns. Production is resuming at limited levels, and we're working to get back to full production as quickly as possible. This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2. Second, as I've mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps. And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2. Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.\nWe continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 50% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year.\nI want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nSenior Director for IR, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you very much. And Elon has opening remarks as well.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nSure. Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach's, but it's maybe worth repeating. Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter. So I'd really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many difficult headwinds. And especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory, they really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles. And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.\nSo as Zach said, we remain confident of a 40% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus '21. I think we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year. So let's see. Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months. So with 2 fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly. Now with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So I have very high confidence in the teams in both factories, and we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.\nSo we're also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi. That's highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. And so it's, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. So I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla's growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.\nLet's see. So it's basically, once again, I'd like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I'd like to thank our suppliers who have really gone the extra mile. They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.\nAnd we're really at the early stage of that journey. We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently. And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year, so we're basically 5% along the way towards our goal. And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year. And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes.\nAnd then there's, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program. The importance of Optimus will become apparent in the coming years. Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD. That's my firm belief. So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well. We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar. So we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.\nAnd basically, the future is very exciting. I've never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla's future than I am right now. Thank you.",

My name is Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions) But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThanks, Martin. So just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general. And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year, we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year. This level of growth didn't happen by coincidence. It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout the company.\nAdditionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reported quarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin. Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of -- million, small finger (inaudible) now, $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.\nThis is a critical milestone for the company. So after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin. So we've begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter. But that's not the most important thing. We'll focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers. But I think it is worth noting that we, and as the Internet has observed, we've been making quite a few cars in Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.\nSo in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we will start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon. Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new locations in the future. Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through 2022, look at new locations and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of the year, I expect.\nIn 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories. So the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue. And yes, so that's -- there are multiple supply chain challenges. And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020. Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in 2022 over 2021, comfortably above [50%] growth in 2022.\nFull self-driving. So over time, we think Full self-driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla. It's great. Actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty. It's nutty good from a financial standpoint. And I think we are completely confident at this point that it will be achieved. And my personal guess is that we'll achieve full self-driving this year, yes, with data safety level significantly greater than present.\nSo it's -- the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving by a software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history. We shall see. It would also have a profound impact on improving safety and on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy through vastly better asset utilization.\nLet's see. So on the product road map front, there's quite a lot to talk about. I'm not going to go through every sort of thing that we're working on because I think a lot of them deserve product launches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call, so I'll talk kind of at a high level, yes, mostly at a high level.\nThe fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output. So both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease. This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand. So last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.\nSo that was not the only supply chain issue. So there's just hundreds of things. And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year. So that's a good result. But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly. So if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.\nAnd the same is true of this year so we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year. It would not make any sense because we'll still be parts constrained. We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and could be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year. That is most likely. But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?\nSo in terms of priority of products, I think the -- I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot. This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time. If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor. Capital equipment is distilled labor. So what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage? I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point. That's what Optimus is about. So very important.\nLet's see. Drew, do you want to talk about the 4680 program? Or is this a good right, the right time?\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nSVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering, Tesla, Inc.\n\nSure. Yes, yes. Sure. So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680 effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible. As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022 or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans based on the information we have.\nBut we are making meaningful progress of the ramp curve in Kato. We're building 4680 structural packs every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas. I was driving 1 yesterday and the day before. And we believe our first 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter. Our focus on the cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year.\nAnd the 4680 and pack tool installations here at Austin are progressing well with some areas producing first parts and the Internet has also noticed that. Yes, I was touring the factory -- the cell factory here. I'm super pumped. It's like a really exciting accomplishment for us to bring everything into 1 awesome factory here in Texas.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nAbsolutely. And just to repeat Drew's point, we are still -- we still expect to be part or primarily chip-limited this year. So that's the thing that's actually the driver, yes, and that chip limitation should alleviate next year. And then probably, we transition into a cell limitation battery, total gigawatt-hours of cell limitation, which is when the 4680 will become very (inaudible)\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nSVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering, Tesla, Inc.\n\nAgreed.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nSenior Director for IR, Tesla, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, and now Zach has some opening remarks as well.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nLong opening remarks.\n\nZachary J. Kirkhorn\n\nMaster of Coin & CFO, Tesla, Inc.\n\nYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a financially transformative year for the company. If we look across the full year '21 and compare that to 2020, our automotive gross margin, excluding credits, rose by over 600 basis points, enabled by work on cost reduction, utilization of our Shanghai factory for exports and accelerating demand.\nOpEx as a percentage of revenue reduced despite the impact of onetime items and unique items. And operating income more than tripled, with operating margin reaching our guidance of mid-teens and these margins are trending up. We also saw regulatory credits accounting for a relatively small portion of our 2021 profitability, which we expect to continue to reduce in materiality going forward.\nFor Q4 specifically, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is our highest yet. We do continue to see some impact of fire pricing on certain models and trims as was the case in prior quarters. But please keep in mind that due to backlogs, changes in pricing will generally impact our financials in future quarters.\nSupply chain challenges and port congestion resulted in a significant increase in our expedited costs in Q4. We also took reserves associated with warranty and recall costs. Operating expenses were meaningfully impacted by stock-based compensation from the final 2 tranches of the CEO stock grant becoming probable and payroll taxes associated with the exercise of the 2012 CEO options. The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs and excess expedites was just over $700 million in the quarter.\nOur free cash flows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $2.8 billion despite increased CapEx. In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have been retiring legacy and high interest debt. Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market for product-specific financing.\nAs we look forward, we expect 2022 to be another significant and exciting year for the company. We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above 50%, as Elon mentioned, and our plans show that this is actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories. For quite some time now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supply and logistics. As Elon mentioned as well, from what we're seeing, the pace of growth in 2022 will again be determined by supply chain and logistics, which is quite difficult for us to forecast.\nDespite these constraints, it's important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we are prepared once limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future. This will result in higher fixed and semi-variable costs in the near term, in addition to the usual inefficiencies as we ramp a new factory. We are also seeing inflation and rising commodity prices, which we expect to continue to put pressure on our costs. How this specifically impacts gross margins in the near term is uncertain, given a mix of both tailwinds and headwinds. However, we do expect to continue to see stronger operating margins as we grow our volumes and improve operating leverage.\nOver a longer-term horizon, we are quite optimistic about the expansion of margins, though. From the hardware side, we are aggressively driving manufacturing innovations and operational efficiency to reduce cost. And with the rapid development of FSD, software-based profits will ultimately become a strong addition to the profits generated by selling hardware.\nSo congratulations to the Tesla team for a terrific 2021, and thank you to our suppliers who supported us. Looking forward to another great year.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nTechnoking of Tesla, CEO & Director, Tesla, Inc.\n\nI'd like to just second the thank you to suppliers. A lot of suppliers worked late nights, weekends, vacations around the world, and we're very grateful for that.",

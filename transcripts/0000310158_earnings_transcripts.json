[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note that at our customers' request, this conference will be recorded. I'm now handing over to Florian Schraeder, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nFlorian Schraeder\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you so much, [ Kara ] and a sincere welcome to everyone joining the Merck Q3 '25 Results Call. I'm Florian Schraeder, the Head of Investor Relations at Merck. I'm delighted to be here today with Belén Garijo, our Group CEO; and Helene von Roeder, our Group CFO. During the Q&A part of this call, we will also be joined by [indiscernible] CEO of Electronics and Deputy Chair of the Executive Board; Jean Chan Wilde, CEO of Life Science; and Denis Bazaar, CEO of Healthcare.\nIn the first few minutes, we will walk you through the key slides of our presentation. After that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nNow I will turn it over to Belen to get started.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Florian. Good afternoon, and welcome, everybody, to our Q3 earnings call. I am now on Slide #5, starting with the highlights of this quarter. So as you have seen during the morning in Q3, we delivered solid organic growth across all 3 sectors.\nOrganically, the group revenues increased by 5.2% and EBITDA pre went up by 8.8%. Life Science delivered the strongest organic sales growth at 6%, followed by our health care and electronics businesses, which both delivered solid organic growth of 5%. One key highlight of the quarter is the continuation of the strong performance of our Process Solutions business, which showed organic growth above 10% for the third consecutive quarter despite rising comparables.\nWe saw a very strong order growth year-over-year and a book-to-bill ratio that is still comfortably above one. In Science and Lab Solutions, we returned to organic growth, and that despite continued near-term headwinds. In Health Care, organic growth was largely driven by the CME franchise, up 7% and solid NNI performance of 6%, driven by Mavenclad which reached double-digit growth in this quarter.\nOncology showed moderate organic growth despite heavy competitive headwinds for Bavencio and rising competition for Erbitux in China from noncomparable biologics. Following the closing of the SpringWorks acquisition on July 1, this is the first quarter in which we are consolidating our rare disease franchise, which has contributed 4% portfolio growth for health care and has performed well in line with our expectations.\nMoving into electronics, we saw organic growth of 5%, driven by our semi-material business, and in this context, please note that Q3 includes 1 final month of Surface Solutions since we have now successfully divested as of July 31. Regarding full year 2025, we are now confirming and narrowing our absolute guidance ranges for net sales, EBITDA pre and EPS pre. We are maintaining the midpoints for net sales and EBITDA pre, while slightly increasing the midpoint for EPS pre.\nSo turning to Slide 6 for an overview of our performance by business sector. Once again, organic sales growth in the third quarter was plus 5.2% and Life Science was the largest contributor with organic sales growth of almost 6%, driven once again by the stellar performance of Process Solutions. Health care grew 4.6% organically, driven by strong growth of our C&I franchise alongside contribution from Mavenclad and fertility, which has returned to growth, supported by Pergoveris.\nElectronics also showed the solid organic sales growth with semi materials up high single digits, while DS&S was down in the low teens range as was expected. Regarding our earnings, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 1.69 billion, up plus 8.8% organically versus the same quarter of last year. The currencies had a negative effect across all sectors, while the portfolio effect was slightly positive driven by the contribution of Supreme works. As flagged in our Q2 earnings call, EBITDA pre in Q3 was supported by the sale of a priority review voucher resulting in a gain of plus EUR 60 million in health care and legislative changes in South America, adding another $59 million of income in CO. Our underlying EBITDA margin, excluding these 2 effects, was stable at around 29%, fully aligned with our expectation for the full year.\nAnd with this, let me hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of our financials.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and also a warm welcome from my side. And with that, I'm now on Slide 8, and we'll start with an overview of our key figures in the third quarter.\nNet sales increased by 1% to EUR 5.318 billion. Organic growth of EUR 273 million and a portfolio effect of EUR 34 million were largely offset by FX headwinds of minus EUR 256 million. EBITDA pre was up by 3.1% to EUR 1.669 billion with a margin of 31.4%, and that is up 70 basis points year-on-year. The group margin benefited from the sale of a priority review voucher and legislative changes in Latin America, which together contributed EUR 119 million supporting the margin by 220 basis points.\nEPS pre increased slightly by 0.9% to EUR 2.32 per share. The gains resulting from the aforementioned priority review voucher and legislative changes have supported EPS pre growth and overcompensate the higher interest related to the SpringWorks acquisition.\nOur operating cash flow increased moderately by 4.1% to EUR 1.518 billion. Net financial debt rose 29.8% to EUR 9.228 billion, primarily reflecting financing for the SpringWorks acquisition via a U.S. dollar bond issuance. Our return to the U.S. dollar bond market after 10 years was highly successful and further diversified our fixed income investor base. We were over 4x oversubscribed and that enabled us around 25 basis points of pricing tension underlining the strong confidence from fixed income investors.\nLet me also briefly comment on our reported results. And with that, I'm now on Slide 9. EBIT was up by 11.3% year-on-year. The financial results declined significantly from minus EUR 54 million to minus EUR 99 million, and that is primarily due to higher interest costs from the U.S. dollar bond related to the SpringWorks acquisition. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 21.2%, and that is within our guidance range and reflects normal quarterly fluctuations throughout the year.\nTurning to EPS. Reported EPS was EUR 2.07, which is up 11.3% year-on-year and is on par with our EBIT growth. With that, let's move to the business sector review, and I'm beginning with Life Science on Slide 10.\nLife Science grew organically by plus 5.9% in Q3. Growth accelerated versus prior quarters with Process Solutions maintaining its momentum and Science and Lab Solutions returning to growth. As projected, Process Solutions continued its strong momentum with organic sales up by 10.3%. That is the third consecutive quarter of low teens growth despite increasing comps. Order intake remained strong in Q3 and the book-to-bill ratio stayed comfortably above one.\nTo further strengthen our Process Solutions downstream offering we announced on October 15, the acquisition of JSR chromatography business. This adds advanced protein A chromatography capabilities, enhancing our ability to offer more efficient, scalable protein purification solutions that support accelerated biopharmaceutical production.\nTurning to Science & Lab Solutions. Sales grew by 2.5% organically despite continued headwinds from U.S. policy changes weighing on academic and government lab spending and still challenging market conditions in China. While the U.S. government shutdown had no impact in Q3, we do expect some effects to materialize in Q4. Life Science reported organic sales growth of 5.2% against the low comp, driven by our CDMO business, and that is notably bioconjugation for ADCs.\nAs noted at our recent Capital Markets Day, Life Science intends to gradually increase R&D investment towards roughly 5% of sales over the midterm. And the R&D increase in Q3 is absolutely in line with this goal. EBITDA pre increased by 6.1% organically, with the margin up by 20 basis points year-over-year, reflecting operational leverage.\nI'm now on Slide 11 with an overview of the Healthcare business sector's performance. Healthcare delivered solid organic sales growth of 4.6% in Q3, about 1% of the growth resulted from a pull-in from Q4. For the first time this year, we consolidated our rare disease franchise contributing a plus 4 percentage point portfolio effect well in line with expectations. CM&E was once again the largest contributor of Healthcare's organic growth, delivering 7% organic growth with all therapeutic areas contributing.\nFertility sales were up 2% organically, mainly driven by very strong growth of Pergoveris, up 37%. Meanwhile, we announced on October 15, a voluntary agreement with the U.S. government to accelerate the U.S. review time lines for Pergoveris and access to our IVF therapies via trumprx.gov.\nOur oncology franchise delivered 3% organic sales growth as Erbitux sales rose by 10.3%. The Erbitux's performance was driven by strong growth in Latin America and Europe, more than offsetting tougher competition for noncomparable biologics in China where sales declined in the low teens. Our NNI business grew by 5.6% organically in Q3. Mavenclad delivered stellar organic growth of 20.4% and supported by continued strong commercial execution. I want to briefly comment on the recent decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which has affirmed the conclusion by the U.S. Patent Office that our Mavenclad dosing regimen patents are invalid. We are disappointed by the ruling and intend to file a petition for rehearing or rehearing on bank.\nBelen will comment on implications later. Regarding our pipeline, longer-term results from Part 2 of the Phase III piricotinib study were presented at ESMO, showing increasing ORR over time and ongoing improvements in key secondary endpoints. We intend to launch pemicotinib in 2026 in TGCT. On R&D spend, as mentioned in our Q2 earnings call and the Capital Markets Day, we are increasing our R&D ratio in H2. The key drivers are project ramp-up costs and a small effect from the SpringWorks acquisition.\nOur Q3 ratio of 20.9% is in line with our midterm ambition of around 20%. Overall, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 818 million in Q3, which represents a margin of 37%. Please keep in mind that this includes the EUR 60 million gained from a sale of a priority review voucher and only a modest dilution from SpringWorks. Furthermore, please note that the margin in health care tends to be lower in Q4 due to seasonality.\nLet us move to electronics on Slide 12. Organically, sales increased by 4.8% in Q3. Semiconductor Solutions sales were up in the high single-digit percentages organically over compensating lower DSS sales. In semi materials, AI and advanced nodes continue to drive growth. In addition, we see demand from mature nodes in Asia, where we have been able to gain market share with new qualifications. On business, the quarter was in line with our expectations. As we communicated in Q2, we expect a very muted year 2025. Considering the usual back end loaded seasonality of DS&S, we're calling out Q4 '25 as the bottom. We're more constructive on the outlook for 3D NAND driven by eSSDs. This is consistent with the [indiscernible] and his team shared at the Capital Market Day '25.\nOur Optronics business achieved moderate organic growth of 2.9%. Resilience in our offerings for liquid crystal and OLED drove organic growth complemented by a strong portfolio contribution from Unity SC. The EBITDA pre margin went up by 150 basis points year-on-year to 27%. We mainly driven by the accretion from the divestment of Surface Solutions. We see gradual improvement of electronics margins from here onwards. Before handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement.\nNow as you can see on Slide 13, our balance sheet decreased by EUR 700 million compared with the end of December '24. Taking a closer look on the asset side. Cash and cash equivalents increased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the U.S. dollar bond issuance and receipt of proceeds from the divestment of Surface Solutions. Inventories were stable, while receivables rose by EUR 300 million, following a quarter of strong focus on cash collection efforts.\nIntangible assets increased slightly by EUR 100 million due to goodwill created by the SpringWorks acquisition, partially offset by negative FX. Property, plant and equipment decreased slightly by EUR 200 million, which is mainly due to FX translational differences. And lastly, other assets were down by EUR 700 million, mainly due to the divestment of Surface Solutions and revaluation effects.\nOn the liability side, financial debt increased by EUR 1.8 billion with the issuance of the U.S. dollar bonds. Pension provisions were slightly down, driven by actuarial gains. Payables decreased by EUR 100 million as we saw declines in current payables across all 3 sectors. And net equity decreased by EUR 1 billion as the increase in retained earnings was more than offset by FX differences, primarily reflecting a weakening U.S. dollar.\nIn summary, our equity ratio declined from 58% at the end of December '24 to 57% at the end of Q3.\nTurning to cash flow on Slide 14. Operating cash flow increased to EUR 1.518 billion in Q3 '25, up from EUR 1.456 billion in Q3 of last year. Profit after tax rose driven primarily by the gain of the sale of a priority review voucher and changes in local legislation in Latin America. The EUR 166 million year-over-year delta in other assets and liabilities reflect variable compensation and tax adjustment. Other operating activities decreased by EUR 181 million year-over-year in Q3 '25, largely due to the neutralization of gains from the PRV voucher and the Surface Solutions divestment.\nNet cash used in investing activity reflects the SpringWorks acquisitions and the Surface Solutions divestment. CapEx on PPE was EUR 63 million lower, in line with the updated full year guidance of EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 1.7 billion, down from previously EUR 1.6 billion to EUR 1.8 billion. The change in financing cash flow is explained by the proceeds from the U.S. dollar bond issuance.\nLastly, consistent with my comments at the Capital Markets Day. Within CDMO, we are actively reviewing our mRNA and fire vector activities with potential financial implications in the next quarters.\nAnd with that, let me hand back to Belen for the outlook.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you very much, Helen. Let's now move into taking a closer look at our full year guidance on Slide 16 before we open for Q&A. As you may have seen in the press release, we have sharpened our group sales guidance to a range of EUR 20.8 million to EUR 21.4 billion with an unchanged midpoint at EUR 21.1 billion.\nFX remains a strong headwind and has been refined to minus 5% to minus 3% from the earlier minus 5% to minus 2%. Our organic net sales growth guidance is now set at around 3%, staying within the previously communicated range. Turning to EBITDA pre, we have also kept the midpoint at EUR 6.1 billion and narrowed the absolute range to between EUR 6 billion and EUR 6.2 billion.\nOrganic sales growth has been narrowed from previously plus 4% to plus 8% to now plus 5% to plus 7%. For EBITDA pre, we anticipate an FX between minus 6% and minus 4%, adjusted from the previous minus 6% to minus 3% and we have raised the midpoint of our EPS pre guidance by $0.05, now guiding a range of EUR 8.20 to EUR 8.6.\nFor some additional color, let's take a look at Slide 17. Consistent with our group-wide approach, we are narrowing our organic sales growth guidance to plus 4% to plus 5%, while reaffirming the midpoint at 4.5% for the full year. We're also maintaining the midpoint at 5% for EBITDA pre and narrowed the guidance to a core of plus 4% to plus 6%.\nIn Healthcare, we anticipate organic sales growth of around 3% at the lower end of our previously communicated guidance range of plus 3% to plus 5%. This reflects the underlying year-to-date trends and some uncertainty for Q4 related to the recent Mavenplad news Helene referred to earlier. For organic EBITDA pre, the guidance has been updated to plus 9% to plus 11%, consistent with the adjustment to sales and within the corridor communicated in August.\nAs portfolio effects we now expect the SpringWorks to contribute EUR 180 million in sales, up from EUR 170 million previously guided an EBITDA pre of between zero and minus EUR 20 million, which is significantly better than the prior minus EUR 70 million to minus EUR 90 million communicated before. For Electronics, we forecast organic sales development between minus 3% to minus 1%, tightened from the prior range of minus 5% to minus 1%. Organic EBITDA pre for electronics is now expected to be between minus 11 to minus 7, compared to the earlier guidance of minus 15 to minus 7.\nNow turning to 2026 in which I am sure you are expecting a bit more transparency. We recently provided you at our Capital Markets Day with an early indication of group sales and margin for 2026. You may now be wondering about the potential impact of the recent Mavenclad news regarding the upcoming loss of exclusivity in the U.S. To no surprise, this will impact the 2026 sales and earnings projections for health care. To what spend is going to be influenced by the phasing of U.S. generic launches and our ability to drive volume also outside of the U.S. and Danny can provide further information later during Q&A.\nHence, we will closely monitor the developments in these respects means U.S. generic launches an update due in Q4 with the full year guidance. In any case, you should assume for your modeling that health care margins should remain north of 30%. And -- coming to the group. First of all, we see our early 2026 indication for the group during the Capital Markets Day for sales within the range we provided trending to the lower end. When it comes to group margins, you can ensure that we stay laser focused to mitigate the potential impact of the Mavenclad erosion in the U.S. While acknowledging state cost mitigation measures, you could assume for 2026 a margin of around 28%.\nAs mentioned, more to come at Q4 earnings when we will provide a full year guidance to all of you. And with that, Florian, over to you to lead us through the Q&A session for today.\n\nFlorian Schraeder\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Belen and Elena, for leading us through the slides. Actually, there's one small amendment to what we have set it is on group level, the organic EBITDA growth, which has been narrowed from previously quarter 8 to now 5% to 7%, not the organic sales growth.\nWith that, Sarah, I'm very happy to hand over to you to manage the Q&A part of the call.",

[Operator Instructions] I now hand it over to Florian Schraeder, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nFlorian Schraeder\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Heidi, and hard felt welcome to the Merck Q2 '25 Results Call. I am Florian Schraeder, the Head of Investor Relations at Merck. It is my pleasure to be joined today by Belen Garijo, our Group CEO; and Helene von Roeder, our Group CFO. For the Q&A segment of this call, we will also have an Chart CEO Life Science; Danny Bar-Zohar, CEO of Healthcare; and Kai Beckmann, CEO Electronics, with us. In the initial minutes of this call, we will guide you through the key slides of the presentation. Following that, we will be glad to address your questions. With that, I would like to hand it over to Belen to begin. .\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Florian. Welcome, everybody, to our Q2 earnings call. And before starting with the highlights of the quarter, I'm happy to remind everybody that we just announced the closing of the divestiture of Surface Solutions last week. The closure of this transaction will allow us to sharpen our focus on high-tech application within electronics. So that is an important milestone achieved recently. And this sums just 1 month after we closed the acquisition of SpringWorks in a record time, immediately accelerating the growth of health care and securing the sustainability of our self-care pillar in the mid- to long term. .\nSo we are actively working on and executing our portfolio composition to enhance Merck's position as a globally diversified science and technology company with attractive growth. Returning to the quarter. I'm now on Slide 5 of the presentation to go through the highlights. The global economic landscape continues to change very rapidly this quarter, generating some volatility across various business sectors and regions. We continued to sustain our organic sales growth momentum in this challenging environment. Even though these economic conditions are also affecting to a certain extent, some of our business sectors.\nOrganically, our group sales increased by 2% and EBITDA pre went up by 5%. We, therefore, continued to grow profitably on an organic basis. Healthcare and Life Science showed the strongest organic sales growth at 4% each, while electronic sales were down organically by minus EUR 6 million driven mostly by the DS&S business. The highlight of the quarter was the acceleration of the organic sales growth momentum in Life Science. And this is driven by Process Solutions, which once again delivered 11% against rising comparables.\nA very strong order intake growth continues and the book-to-bill ratio was again comfortably above 1. Sales in Health Care grew organically by 4%, driven by double-digit growth of Mavenclad solid growth of 5% in our CME portfolio as well as double-digit growth of Erbitux, respectively. Moving into electronics, we observed an organic decline of 6%, and this is primarily attributable to our the F&S delivery systems and service business within Semiconductor Solutions, which experienced a decline in the low to mid-double digits in relation to big project pacing. Semiconductor Materials continued to grow this quarter, driven by our strength in artificial intelligence and advanced notes. Turning to our guidance.\nWe are now narrowing our organic sales growth range to plus 2% to plus 5%, staying within our previously communicated guidance, communicated range. Reported sales have been adjusted to mostly reflect the currency impact. We are also maintaining the midpoint of our absolute EBITDA pre guidance range despite increasing headwinds from FX and despite negative portfolio effects from the SpringWorks acquisition as well as the divestiture of Surface Solutions as we have lifted our organic growth guidance on EBITDA pre to plus 4% to plus 8%. Therefore, we now anticipate net sales in a range of $20.5 billion to EUR 21.7 billion an EBITDA pre of EUR 5.9 billion to EUR 6.3 billion. Hence, we are committed to growing even more profitably than we have forecasted previously.\nI will provide more details on our assumptions for the guidance at the end of this call. So let's now turn to Slide 6 for an overview of our performance by business sector. Organic sales growth in the second quarter was 2%, plus 2% with organic sales growth of 3.7%, Life Science was the largest contributor this quarter driven once again by the stellar performance of Process Solutions. Healthcare delivered 3.6% organically, organic growth with Mavenclad, our CME portfolio and Erbitux having been the key drivers. Electronics was down by minus 5.6% organically as the growth of semi materials was not able to offset the decline in our DS&S business.\nFor the group, and as we predicted, now turn into a headwind of minus 4.2% in Q2 after having been a slight tailwind in Q1 2025. I was a mid-single-digit percentage headwind for all business sectors during the quarter. Together with a portfolio effect of plus 0.4% for the group, in Q2, driven mainly by the acquisition of Unity SC, Group sales -- reported group sales declined by minus 1.8% in Q2. It is important to note that we closed the SpringWorks acquisition on July 1. Hence, there is no SpringWork revenues in Q2. Regarding earnings, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 1.46 billion, growing organically more than twice as fast as sales and delivering plus organic growth compared to the year earlier period.\nCurrency also had a negative effect on EBITDA pre, which was more pronounced than on sales at minus 7.2%. The portfolio effect was slightly dilutive on EBITDA pre. And with this, let me hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of the financials of Q2\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and a warm welcome from my side also. I'm now on Slide 8 for an overview of our key figures in the second quarter. Net sales decreased by 1.8% to EUR 6.255 billion. as FX was a headwind of minus EUR 227 million. Portfolio effects were a slight tailwind in Q2 of plus EUR 23 million. EBITDA was down by 3.1% to EUR 1.462 billion while EBITDA pre was up 8.8% year-on-year in Healthcare, it was down by minus 1.3% in Life Science and 47.6% in electronics. The decline in EBITDA pre in electronics was mainly due to 2 nonrecurring items we recognized in our second quarter results. as well as foreign exchange headwinds.\nI will provide more details later during the presentation. FX was a stronger headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales. while portfolio effects had a slightly dilutive impact on EBITDA pre. EPS pre declined by 8.2% to EUR 2.02 per share. The decline in EPS pre was higher than in EBITDA pre, which was primarily driven by a more negative financial result. This, in turn, was mainly due to tax items in the financial results amid a lower interest income, in turn, reflecting lower cash balances. Operating cash flow decreased to EUR 567 million.\nThe decline was mainly driven by higher tax and bonus payments. Net financial debt increased by EUR 818 million, compared with the end of December 24 and reflecting the payment of our dividends. So let me also briefly comment on our reported results. And with that, I'm now on Slide 9. EBIT was up by 12.4% year-on-year. This was higher than the increase in EBITDA pre due to mainly a decrease in D&A from a high level in Q2 '24. Now as a reminder, we took the impairment on [ Civinapant ] in Q2 of last year. The financial result declined significantly by minus EUR 55 from minus EUR 7 million to minus EUR 62 million due to primarily a more negative interest result. This reflects tax items as well as a reduction in interest income on a lower cash balance.\nThe effective tax rate came in at 21.0% in which is actually at the lower end of our guidance range of 21% to 23% and below the effective tax rate of 22.9% in the year-earlier period. The tax rate usually fluctuates over the quarter during the year. For the first 6 months of '25, our effective tax rate stands at 21.9%, which is right in the middle of our tax rate guidance. As a reminder, please be aware that this year is a year of additional uncertainty with all of the debates around tax and tariffs. Reported EPS came in at EUR 1.50 a which is an increase of 7.1% year-on-year, which is below EBIT growth as it reflects a more negative financial result compared with the year earlier period.\nAnd with that, let's move on to the review by business sector, and I'm starting with Life Science on Page 10. Life Science grew organically by plus 3.7% in Q2. We -- this does represent a further acceleration compared with the previous quarter as Process Solutions kept its momentum and Science & Lab Solutions showed improving momentum. So turning to Process Solutions first. Sales grew by 11.5% organically in the second quarter. Therefore, it maintained its growth momentum from the previous quarter, which is now compared against a growing base.\nCustomer destocking is finally now behind us. Order intake continued to show very strong growth and book-to-bill was at similar levels compared with the last 2 quarters, staying comfortably above 1. We have not seen any significant preordering effect in Q2 '20. Now let us take a closer look at Science & Lab Solutions. Sales were flat organically. While U.S. policy changes continue to affect academic and government lab spending, we did see some green shoots with our pharma and larger biotech customers. We increasingly feel comfortable to move towards our midterm growth aspiration of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit organic growth in signs and Lab Solutions by Q4 of this year.\nIn Life Science Services, sales were down 8.2% organically. -- which was primarily due to an approximately low teens percentage decline in our contract testing services business due to demand fluctuations from key customers. Additionally, faced the highest comparison base from 24. Our CDMO business was organically up in the quarter, excluding a sales effect in connection with the disposal of the Martiaxide, which was closed on August 1. EBITDA pre increased by 3.7% organically in Q2, in line with organic sales growth. The positive operating performance and mix effects were offset by production cost phasing.\nWhile our EBITDA pre margin was flat year-on-year on an organic basis, both FX and portfolio effects were dilutive. And with that, I'm now on Slide 11 for an overview of the performance of the Healthcare business sector. Health care, again, delivered solid organic sales growth of 3.6% in Q2, which is very similar to what we actually saw in Q1. By franchise, our CM&E portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in healthcare. It was up 4.7% organically and in line with our medium-term growth ambition of a mid-single-digit CAGR. We saw organic growth across all therapeutic areas. Oncology was up 3.9% organically in Q2. 10.9% organic growth of Erbitux and 41.4% growth in TepMetco more than compensated for the anticipated decline of Bavencio which was down minus 12.1% in Q2 in a competitive environment. Almost all regions contributed to the growth of Erbitux, although we saw China slowing.\nTEPMETKO mainly benefited from very strong demand in North America and APAC, including benefits from a recently signed distribution agreement. Our N&I franchise grew by 2.6% organically in Q2. Declines of Rebif in line with the interferon market were more than offset by Mavenclad which delivered a stellar growth of 20.7% organically. This was mainly driven by North America and supported by positive channel mix. Fertility sales were down by minus 3.4% in Q2 against the still elevated comps reflecting prior year competitor stock-outs and amid a slightly softening market. Regarding our pipeline. Detailed results of -- from Part 1 of the Phase III maneuver study were presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting. -- showing pimecotinib significantly improved objective response rate versus placebo at the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints.\nMerck holds the rights to commercialize pimicotinib worldwide, and we intend to launch in 2026. Also at ASCO, we presented Phase Ib data for M9140 with its efficacy and safety encouraging further development of this anti-C5 ADC. The robust organic sales growth in Q2 in combination with temporarily lower R&D spending and a favorable mix. helped us to achieve an EBITDA pre margin of 37.2% in the quarter. Compared with the year earlier quarter, our EBITDA pre margin improved by 350 basis points implying organic growth of plus 20% in part also due to a soft comp, including a mid-double-digit million R&D impairment last year.\nOverall, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 783 million in Q2. On the further evolution of our R&D spending, let me remind you that we expect underlying R&D costs to increase gradually over the coming quarters, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. Adding SpringWorks on top, we expect the R&D ratio in H2 to be around 20% of sales. So let us move to electronics on Slide 12. Organically, sales went down by minus 5.6% in Q2 as semiconductor solutions declined by 5.6% organically. The key reason is the performance of our DS&S business with semiconductor solutions, which declined by more than 30% organically in Q2.\nSemiconductor materials continued to grow in the quarter at a low single-digit rate against stronger comps. Following the divestiture of Surface Solutions, this business now accounts for around 2/3 of our electronic sales. Despite this, it was not able to offset the significant decline of Idea Net business in Q2 and where customers have informed us that projects have been pushed out even further. AI and advanced nodes continue to drive the growth of semiconductor materials. However, a near-term recovery of the wider market, especially in and memory is still not in sight. Our optronics business was down 5.3% organically in Q2 and but showed slight growth of plus 0.3% on a reported basis, including the consolidation benefit of Unity SC.\nSurface Solutions was down minus 6.4% organically, which was mainly due to weaker cosmetics demand. I'm sure you have seen our announcement of the divestment of Surface Solutions closed on July 31. Hence, Q2 was the last quarter in which we fully consolidate Surface Solutions. The EBITDA pre margin decline of minus 41.3% organically in Q2 was impacted by 2 special onetime effects. First, we recognized a onetime noncash adjustment of a PPA entry related to manufacturing know-how from the 2014 acquisition of AZ Electronic Materials which amounts to a low double-digit million euro amount.\nThis entry properly reflects the expired useful life of the know-how associated with the original PPA entry and does not reflect our ongoing operating performance. Furthermore, a provision in the mid-double-digit million euro was recorded for customer compensation related to a historical supplier mislabeling that caused a pricing issue. There were no quality concerns and the customer relationship remains strong with ongoing orders. We are seeking appropriate remedies. Both items had a combined negative effect on our EBITDA pre-margin in electronics around minus 7 percentage points. Additionally, other elements, mainly the significant decline in our DS&S business and FX further reduced the margin by around 4.5 percentage points.\nOverall, the EBITDA pre margin was 15.1% in the quarter, and that equates to an EBITDA pre of EUR 134 million. For the further margin evolution during the remainder of '25, please do note that we sold Surface Solutions, which had a margin dilutive effect of electronics. I also want to stress that the 2 previously described special effects recorded in our Q2 results were limited to Q2 and will not recur.\nBefore handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. As you can see on Slide 13, our balance sheet decreased by EUR 4.2 billion compared with the end of December 2024. Let's take a closer look on the asset side. Cash and cash equivalents went down to EUR 1.2 billion from EUR 2.5 billion at the end of December '24 due to the repayment of a U.S. dollar bond, which took place in March of this year. Inventories were stable, while receivables went up by EUR 300 million following a quarter of strong cash collection at the end of last year. Property, plant and equipment decreased by EUR 300 million due to mainly FX translation differences. Intangible assets decreased by EUR 2.6 billion due to FX effects and D&A.\nAnd lastly, other assets were down by EUR 300 million due mainly to divestments and revaluation effects. Switching to the liability side. Financial debt decreased by EUR 900 million, reflecting the repayment of the U.S. dollar bond in March this year. This was partially offset by a decline in other liabilities, in turn affected by the dividend payment in Q2. Pension provisions were down which was driven by actuarial gains. Payables decreased from EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 2.9 billion as we saw declines in current payables across our 3 business sectors. And net equity decreased by EUR 1.7 billion as the increase in retained earnings was more than offset by FX differences, mainly resulting from the weakening of the U.S. dollar. In summary, our equity ratio strengthened further from 58% at the end of December 2024 to 60% at the end of Q2. EBIT declined slightly from 61% at the end of Q1 this year following the payment of the annual dividend.\nTurning to cash flow on Slide 14. The Operating cash flow went down from EUR 861 million in Q2 of last year to EUR 567 million in Q2 25 -- this is mainly due to changes in other assets and liabilities, driven in turn by higher bonus payouts and tax cash-outs in the quarter. The increase in tax cash-outs mainly reflects the phasing of a tax payment in Switzerland, which occurred in Q2 of this year as opposed to Q3 of last year. D&A experienced a notable year-on-year decline this quarter, primarily attributed to the absence of last year's EUR 140 million impairment associated with Serena pan and a decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nThis reduction is not entirely reflected in the increase in profit after tax due largely to a year-on-year decline in financial results and significant currency headwinds that impacted our sales and in return profits. Cash out for investing activities increased by EUR 113 million, which mainly reflected the payment to Aviso for the global commercialization rights of [indiscernible] . Last but not least, the difference in financing cash flows driven by proceeds from short-term investments in the quarter. And with that, let me hand back to Belen for the outlook.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Helene. And let's now turn our attention to our updated guidance on Slide #16. Reflecting on my earlier comments regarding currency impacts, we have now included a stronger currency headwind, which comes as no surprise. On group net sales, we now factor in unexpected effects headwind of minus 5% to minus 2%. Consequently, we are revising our 2025 reported corridor for group net sales to a range of EUR 20.5 billion to EUR 21.7 billion. Our organic net sales growth guidance is set at plus 2% to plus 5%. Spain, as I said before, within the previously communicated range. .\nTurning to our EBITDA pre and despite the increasing FX headwinds as well as the estimated negative portfolio effects of minus EUR 120 million to minus EUR 80 million resulting from the acquisition of SpringWorks as well as the divestment of Surface Solutions, we are maintaining the midpoint of our absolute EBITDA pre guidance and narrowing the range to EUR 5.9 billion to EUR 6.3 billion. We have also raised our organic growth corridor for EBITDA pre to plus 4 to plus 8, up from plus 2 to plus 7. Furthermore, despite the inclusion of SpringWorks, we are guiding for an EPS pre range of between EUR 8 and EUR 8.70 slightly reducing the midpoint only by EUR 0.10.\nOur guidance accounts for the full impact of tariffs based on our current knowledge. Please go to Slide #17 for additional color by business sector. Starting with Slide in, we are upgrading our organic sales growth guidance, now projecting a range of plus 3% to plus 6% for 2025, leaning towards the upper hub the upper half of the previous corridor. We anticipate that Process Solutions will come in line with the midterm target of a CAGR of around 10% growth already in 2025. We expect EBITDA pre to demonstrate organic growth between plus 3% and plus 7%, thereby adjusting and abating the lower half of our guidance range.\nThis upgrade aligns with our narrowed top line guidance, and we are confident in delivering an improvement in organic EBITDA pre margin in 2025, as indicated by the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Moving on to health care. We are narrowing our guidance for organic sales growth to a range of plus 3 to plus 5, maintaining the midpoint. Key contributors to this organic sales performance remains our CM&E portfolio, Maven Club and Erbitux. We also expect a contribution to net sales from portfolio effects in the amount of EUR 170 million coming from the acquisition of SpringWorks. We are pleased with the Q2 performance of SpringWorks. [indiscernible] had USD 67 million sales in the quarter, which is up quarter-on-quarter and the strongest quarter since launch, while [indiscernible] generated USD 15 million sales in the quarter.\nOur guidance for EBITDA pre organic growth is being raised to plus 9% to plus 13% driven by robust leverage growth, coupled with disciplined cost management and the divestment of an FDA priority review voucher, which we agreed at the end of July and which impacts the earnings of the health care business sector in a mid-double-digit million euro amount in the second half of the year. For electronics, we are revising our forecast down for organic sales growth to a range of minus 5% to minus 1%, and this primarily reflects further delays in customer projects now moving beyond 2025, which impacts our DS&S business.\nWhile we expect semi materials to deliver continuous growth in 2025, this growth will not compensate the anticipated decline in our DS&S business. The F&S pacing along with a nonrecurring one-timers from Q2 has led to reduced expectations in our organic growth guidance for EBITDA pre now expected to be in a range of minus 15% to minus 7%. While not included in the guidance update I just presented, I would also like to highlight that we have adjusted down corporate and other EBITDA pre guidance from EUR 500 million to EUR 550 million to EUR 350 million to EUR 400 million, this adjustment is mainly driven by hedging gains and also due to a mid-double-digit euro million onetime impact driven by changes in local regulations in Latin America.\nOverall, Q2 has been a robust quarter in which we once again deliver profitable organic growth despite the continuously challenging macroeconomic environment. On top, we executed 2 major strategic milestones, the closing of SpringWorks and Surface Solutions and we stay highly confident to deliver an even stronger profitable organic growth in 2025 than expected before. And with this, thank you so much for your attention, and we will be happy to start taking your questions. Florian, over to you.\n\nFlorian Schraeder\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Belen and Helena, for guiding us through the slides. I will now pass it over to Heidi, who will facilitate the Q&A segment of the call. .",

[Operator Instructions]. I am now handing over to Florian Schraeder, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nFlorian Schraeder\n\nThank you so much, Heidi, and a very warm welcome to this Merck Q1 '25 Results Call. My name is Florian Schraeder. I'm the Head of Investor Relations here at Merck. I'm delighted to be joined today by Belen Garijo, our Group CEO; as well as Helene von Roeder, our Group CFO.\nFor the Q&A part of this call, we will also have Matthias Heinzel, CEO, Life Science; Jean-Charles Wirth, designated CEO, Life Science; Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; Danny Bar-Zohar, Designated CEO Healthcare; as well as Kai Beckmann, CEO, Electronics.\nIn the first couple of minutes of this call, we would like to guide you through the key slides of the presentation. After that, we will be more than happy to take your questions.\nWith this, I would now like to hand over to Belen to start.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Florian, and welcome, everybody, from my side to our Q1 earnings call. I am now on Slide #5 of the presentation, starting with the highlights.\nFirst of all, you would agree with me that this quarter was characterized by a rapidly changing global economic landscape to say the least, and we delivered very solidly, achieving profitable growth across our 3 business sectors in Q1.\nOrganically, group revenues increased by 3% and EBITDA went up by 6%. The Healthcare and Life Science showed the strongest organic sales growth at 3%, while Electronic sales were up by 1%.\nNow I would like to draw your attention to the highlights of the quarter, which is the remarkable progress in Solutions that is crossing to the double-digit growth level and delivering plus 11% in Q1 as the market conditions, mainly customer destocking, have been put behind.\nOrder intake grew also very strongly and book-to-bill was again comfortably above 1. Healthcare also delivered organic sales growth of 3%, driven by a strong performance of plus 11% in our CM&E portfolio, as well as mid- to high single-digit growth of Erbitux and Mavenclad, respectively.\nWith the recently announced acquisition of SpringWorks Therapeutics we are securing the mid- to long-term sustainability of our pharma pillar and positioning the pharma sector to accelerate growth immediately after closing.\nSpringWorks is fully aligned with the business and the M&A priorities of our health care sector, which is to continue to rely on external innovation via in-licensing primarily of later-stage assets.\nMoving to Electronics. It also showed a positive organic sales development in Q1. Once again, this was driven by the strong growth in semiconductor materials. At the same time, we saw some projects being pushed out further in our DS&S business as our customers are equally trying to manage their rapidly evolving business environment in which we operate.\nOn the guidance for full year 2025, I want to remind you that we submitted a quantitative guidance for the first time already with our full year 2024 results back in March. Since then, we have gained more visibility on the macro, mainly FX and tariffs, and therefore, we are reflecting these developments in our 2025 outlook.\nFirst, I want to let you know that around 80%, 8-0 percent, of the adjustment to the absolute corridors is related to our assumptions on FX. Second, on the tariffs, it includes a scenario where this week's trade agreement between the U.S. and China is restricted to 90 days and no more.\nWe have clearly proven our adaptability in this evolving macroeconomic environment already in Q1, and we are confident to achieve profitable organic growth in 2025. I will come back with more details on our assumptions for the guidance later.\nSo let's move to Slide #6 for an overview of our performance by business sector. As you may see on the slide, organic sales growth in Q1 was plus 2.5%. Life Science delivered organic sales growth of 2.5%, driven by stellar performance of Process Solutions.\nWith 3.4% organic sales growth, Healthcare was the largest contributor; and within Healthcare, our CM&E portfolio was the strongest franchise. Electronics grew slightly by 0.6% organically as our semi business was up plus 2%, driven by semi materials.\nFor the group, FX represented a slight tailwind of plus 0.4% on sales due to Life Science and Electronics. Together with the portfolio effect of plus 0.2% for the group in Q1, which is driven by the acquisition of Mirus Bio and UnitySC, group sales increased by a total of 3.1% in the quarter.\nRegarding earnings, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 1.535 billion, growing more than twice as fast as organic sales and delivering growth compared to the same quarter of last year. FX also had a slight positive effect on EBITDApre in the quarter, while the portfolio effect was slightly dilutive.\nWith this, I would like to hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of our financials.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and a warm welcome also from my side from Sunny Darmstadt. And with that, I'm now on Slide 8 for an overview of our key figures in the first quarter.\nI would like to emphasize that we had a solid start to 2025 in what is indeed a rapidly evolving economic environment. Net sales increased by 3.1% to EUR 5.208 billion, supported by the acquisitions of Mirus Bio and UnitySC, while FX was still a slight tailwind in Q1.\nEBITDApre was up by 5.6% to EUR 1.535 billion. Importantly, all 3 business sectors contributed to EBITDA pre growth, both on an absolute and an organic basis. FX was slightly -- a slightly lower tailwind on EBITDA pre than on sales, where portfolio had a slightly dilutive effect on EBITDA pre.\nEPS pre increased by 2.9% to EUR 2.12 per share. Operating cash flow decreased by EUR 556 million, also compared against the higher base. The decline was mainly driven by an increase in receivables and inventories in anticipation of a changing tariff environment, higher bonus payments and higher tax payments. Net financial debt decreased slightly compared with end of December last year, as operating cash flow was largely consumed by investing cash flow.\nLet me also briefly comment on our reported results. So I'm now on Slide 9. EBIT was up by 8% year-on-year. This was higher than the increase in EBITDA pre as D&A increased at a smaller rate compared with EBITDA pre, while adjustments were lower than in Q1 last year.\nThe financial results are an adverse change of EUR 18 million from minus EUR 32 million to minus EUR 50 million, which was mainly driven by higher interest expenses and lower results from financial investments. In general, please remember that our financial results consists of more than just the interest results. It also includes, for example, outcomes from financial investments, changes in our pension and other long-term provisions as well as adjustments to the time value of the long-term incentive plan.\nThe effective tax rate came in at 22.8% which is at the upper end of our guidance range of 21% to 23% and slightly above the effective tax rate of 22.2% in the year earlier period. The tax rate usually fluctuates over the quarters during the year. For example, Q4 is usually the lowest tax rate quarter for us, bringing down the average from the first 9 months.\nIn addition, please be aware that this year is a year of additional uncertainty with all the debates around tax. Reported EPS came in at EUR 1.69, which represents an increase of 5.6% year-on-year.\nAnd with that, let's move on to the review by business sector and I'm starting with Life Science on Slide 10. Life Science grew organically at 2.5% in Q1. As projected, this is driven by Process Solutions, which grew organically by 11.4% in the first quarter. The vast majority of our customers have started reorder, and we're now seeing our large pharma customers back to normal order and patterns.\nConsequently, order intake showed a very strong growth again in Q1 '25 and book-to-bill stayed comfortably above 1 at a similar level to Q4 of last year. Process Solutions is carried by strong demand for consumables, which form more than 90% of our sales in this business segment. We have not seen preordering effects in Q1 '25.\nNow taking a closer look at Science & Lab Solutions. Sales were down by minus 2.5% organically. U.S. policy changes are, in particular, affecting academic and government lab spending amid a still cautious pharma research spending environment, as pharmaceutical customers are still prioritizing late-stage development projects. In addition, China has remained a challenging market for Science & Lab Solutions.\nAnd turning to Life Science Services, our third and smallest business within Life Science. Sales were down by 6.2% organically, mainly driven by our CDMO activities as new project starts were impacted by funding constraints and project phasing was unfavorable. EBITDA pre was up by 3.1% organically in Q1. While our EBITDA pre margin increased on an organic basis, FX and portfolio effects were slightly dilutive.\nI'm now on Slide 11 for an overview of the performance of our Healthcare business sector. Healthcare delivered solid organic sales growth of plus 3.4% in Q1, well in line with our full year guidance, which we gave in March. By franchise, our CM&E portfolio was the largest contributor to growth, up 10.6% organically against an easy comp. We saw double-digit organic growth across all therapeutic areas, supported by some favorable phasing.\nOncology was down by minus 1.9% organically in Q1. While declined in the mid-teens percentage range amid increasing competition, this was largely offset by a solid growth in Erbitux, which was up by 6.2% organically. All key regions contributed to the growth of Erbitux with Europe and China up in the double-digit percentage range.\nOur N&I franchise declined by minus 3.7% organically in Q1. Declines of Rebif, in line with the interferon market, were largely offset by strong growth of Mavenclad, which is up 9.2% organically. Fertility was roughly stable in Q1 despite still high comps reflecting competitor stock-outs.\nLooking at our pipeline. For pimicotinib, we announced that we exercised the option with for its commercialization in the U.S. and the rest of the world. We now hold commercialization rights for pimicotinib worldwide. For M9140, our CEACAM-5 ADC and Phase Ib expansion, we have seen an encouraging activity so far, and we will present the data at ASCO 2025.\nThe robust organic sales growth in Q1 in combination with temporarily lower R&D spend, as projected, helped us achieve 11.7% organic growth in EBITDA pre. Overall, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 796 million in Q1, resulting in a margin of 37.6% and which is an increase of 300 basis points above Q1 '24.\nOn the further evolution of our R&D spending, let me say the following: We do expect a gradual increase of R&D costs over the coming quarters, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales.\nMoving on to Electronics on Slide 12. Organically, sales increased slightly by 0.6% in Q1. The Electronics sector showed organic growth, thanks to the strong demand in our semiconductor materials business, driven by growth in AI and advanced node technologies in particular.\nBear in mind, semiconductor materials is well over 50% of the sales in our Electronics business sector, and it is growing. The strong organic sales growth in semiconductor materials helped semiconductor solutions to grow at 2% organically, amid a low double-digit percentage decline in our DS&S business. Customer projects have been pushed out further as our customers try to manage a very dynamic market environment.\nOur Optronics business was organically flat in Q1 with some stabilization in the liquid crystal market. Surface Solutions was down 6.9% organically. The completion of the divestment is on track for the second half of this year. The EBITDA pre margin went up by 30 basis points year-on-year to 25.8%, thanks to cost efficiency, positive mix effects, partially offset by start-up costs on new sites.\nFor the further margin evolution during 2025, please note that volume growth would be the most important margin driver. And as we also have said repeatedly, we continue to be convinced of the long-term secular growth of semiconductors, and therefore, sustain a high level of R&D activities and are continuing with our capacity expansions in that fast-growing segment.\nBefore handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. As you can see on Slide 13, our balance sheet decreased by EUR 2.2 billion compared with the end of December 2024.\nNow taking a closer look at the asset side. Cash and cash equivalents went down by EUR 1 billion from EUR 2.5 billion at the end of December '24 due to the repayment of the U.S. dollar bond, which took place in March of this year. Inventories were stable, while receivables went up by EUR 400 million following a quarter of strong cash collection at the end of last year.\nProperty, Plant & Equipment decreased slightly due mainly to FX translation differences. Intangible assets decreased by EUR 800 million due to FX effects and G&A.\nAnd lastly, other assets were down by EUR 100 million, due mainly to divestments and revaluation effects.\nLooking at the liability side. Financial debt decreased by EUR 1.6 billion, which largely reflects the repayment of the U.S. dollar bond. Pension provisions were down driven by actuarial gains. Payables decreased from EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.0 billion, as we saw declines in current payables across our 3 business sectors.\nOther liabilities were around flat. And net equity decreased slightly by EUR 100 million as the increase in retained earnings was more than offset by FX differences, mainly resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar.\nIn summary, our equity ratio strengthened further from 58% at the end of December '24 to 61% at the end of Q1.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 14. Operating cash flow went down from EUR 1.035 billion in Q1 of last year to EUR 556 million in Q1 '25, despite an increase in profit after tax. That was mainly due to changes in other assets and liabilities in turn, driven by higher bonus payers and taxes in the quarter as well as an increase in working capital.\nThe increase in working capital was mainly due to an increase in trade receivables, reflecting the phasing after a particularly strong quarter of cash collection in Q4 '24 and compared with the quarter of tight receivable management in Q1 of last year.\nCash out for investing activities decreased primarily due to lower payments for investments in intangible assets compared to the same quarter of last year, which were related to health care investments at that time as well as lower CapEx on Property, Plant & Equipment.\nLast, but not least, the difference in financing cash flow can be explained by the repayment of the aforementioned U.S. dollar bond in Q1 this year.\nAnd with that, let me hand back to Belen for the outlook.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Helene. Let us now take a closer look at our guidance on Slide #16. So back to my initial comments on currency and tariffs. We are adjusting our 2025 target corridors for the group, now expecting EUR 20.9 billion to EUR 22.4 billion in sales and EBITDA pre in the range of EUR 5.8 billion to EUR 6.4 billion. The majority of this adjustment I mentioned already 80% is the result of our assumptions regarding currency movements, which we now anticipate will be a headwind for both sales and EBITDA pre, particularly a weak U.S. dollar.\nWe forecast that FX will have an impact of minus 3 to 0 on revenues and minus 5 to minus 2 on EBITDA pre. Organically, we have slightly widened the corridor for sales, and now we see plus 2 to plus 6 growth on the top line. And this reflects the current volatility primarily associated with a very dynamic evolution of the tariff environment.\nKeeping the our organic growth guidance on EBITDA pre is therefore slightly adjusted to a corridor of plus 2 to plus 7. As usual, at this time of the year, we are issuing our first EPS pre guidance expecting it to be in a range of EUR 7.90 to EUR 9.0. I repeat, our guidance considers the impact of tariffs, including our mitigation measures and integrates the recently announced agreement between the U.S. and China only on a duration of 3 months.\nLooking at our 3 business sectors, specifically for Healthcare, the policy situation is a moving target, and we are well positioned. As you can imagine, we are working closely with trade associations in the U.S. and in Europe to improve the chances to land an acceptable deal with government.\nFor Life Science, we have developed both proactive and reactive action plans, and that includes implementing a temporary surcharge in selected markets. While our mitigation measures are designed to protect our profit, profit margins are temporarily affected to a limited extent.\nIn Electronics, our goal is to mitigate the vast majority of the potential tariff impact through our well-known level up program, we invested in localization and supply chain resiliency and this largely balanced the tariff situation. While we have reflected the remaining risk, which we quantify a low double-digit euro million cost, we are confident that we can mitigate the remaining part, mostly via supply chain optimizations. We include this risk at the extended bottom end of our EBITDA pre organic guidance while at the midpoint will reflect only minor tariff costs.\nLast, but not least, rest assured that we are prepared to act on our cost structure if the macro pressure further increased. For some additional color by business sector, please go with me to Slide #17.\nStarting with Life Science, we are slightly narrowing the organic sales growth guidance corridor to plus 2% to plus 6% for 2025. As in particular, U.S. policy changes affecting our SLS business make it unlikely that the previous high end of the guidance will be reached.\nWe now expect EBITDA pre to show an organic development of between plus 1% and plus 7%, which also includes the net impact of tariffs, including our mitigation measures. We expect those to have a slightly margin-diluted effect.\nMoving into Healthcare. We are raising our guidance for organic growth and sales to plus 2% to plus 6% plastic. And the main drivers are the continued strong performance of our CM&E portfolio, coupled with a solid performance of Erbitux and strong performance of Mavenclad.\nOur EBITDA pre organic growth guidance is increasing to plus 4% to plus 10% -- between plus 4% and plus 10%, driven by leverage growth paired with cost discipline in the value of pharma business sector.\nFor electronics, we are widening our forecast range for organic sales to plus 1% to plus 6%. And for the organic development of EBITDA pre from minus 3% to plus 8%. We once again had a strong quarter in semiconductor materials in Q1. But as mentioned already a couple of times, customer projects have been pushed out a bit further.\nA tariff-related economic recession is not included in our guidance. Overall, I would like to conclude by emphasizing that Q1 was a very solid start into the year in a challenging macroeconomic environment, and we remain confident to deliver profitable organic growth also in 2025.\nAnd with that, we will be very happy to take your questions. Thank you.\n\nFlorian Schraeder\n\nThank you, Belen. And Haidi, we are ready to take the first question, please.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI am now handing over to Florian Schraeder, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you very much, Heidi, and warm welcome to everyone joining us for this Q4 and full year '24 earnings call. My name is Florian Schraeser, I'm Head of Investor Relations at Merck. I am delighted to be joined by Belen Garijo, Co-CEO; as well as Helene von Roeder, Group CFO. For the Q&A part of the call, we will also have with us here in the room, Matthias Heinzel, CEO of Life Science; Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; and Kai Beckmann, CEO of Electronics.\nAs you surely have noticed, we recently announced upcoming changes to the Executive Board. I'm pleased to share that both Jean-Charles Wirth, appointed CEO, Life Science as of June 1; as well as Danny Bar-Zohar, appointed CEO, Healthcare as of June 1, will join us later today for a brief introduction.\nWith this introduction, I believe we are ready to begin. Over to you, Belen, to kick us off.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Florian, and welcome, everybody, to our full year 2024 earnings call. I am starting on Slide 5 of the presentation. And my main message on this slide is very clear. We delivered on our guidance and our ambition to return to profitable growth in 2024. Life Science returned to organic growth during 2024 with a continued sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter in the second half of the year. Healthcare continued to show a strong organic performance. And Electronics grew, thanks to AI-driven demand in Semiconductor Solutions.\nAs we mentioned during our Q3 earnings call, we expected the group to trend in the lower half of the sales corridor and around the midpoint of the earnings corridors, and we have delivered on our expectations for net sales, EBITDA pre and EPS pre, both for the group and for the business sectors.\nLet's move to the highlights for the Q4 2024 on Slide 6. We had a very solid organic -- a very solid Q4 with organic sales growth of plus 4% for the group and we delivered a strong profitable growth, supported by all 3 sectors. Healthcare was once again the best performer with 7% organic sales growth. Life Science confirmed return to growth in Q4 with plus 2% organic sales growth. I am particularly pleased with a very strong order intake in Process Solutions with registered low teens growth sequentially in Q4 and even higher growth year-on-year. Electronics showed organic sales growth of 2% in Q4, driven once again by Semiconductor Solutions as the semi market for AI and advanced nodes continues to perform very well.\nBack to the group, while sales increased by 4% organically in Q4, EBITDA pre achieved very strong growth of plus 20% organically in the fourth quarter. Given our strong cash generation, we have improved our net leverage despite having made significant investment in both CapEx and M&A during 2024.\nAs communicated in our press release this morning, we will propose a stable dividend of EUR 2.20 per share to the Annual General Meeting on April '25. As a reminder, for the dividend, we aim for the target corridor of 20% to 25% of EPS pre and the proposed dividend of EUR 2.20 per share is marginally above that corridor. As you also see on the slide, we are moving for the first time from guiding on a qualitative basis towards the quantitative guidance already with our full year results and expect sales in a range of EUR 21.5 billion to EUR 22.9 billion and EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 6.1 billion to EUR 6.5 billion. More details will follow on the guidance later on the presentation.\nLet me now provide a more detailed review of 2024, starting with Life Science on Slide 8. The positive news is that we saw growth inflecting in the second half of the year, both for Process Solutions and for Life Science as a whole as we move past the period of customer destocking. In fact, growth in Process Solutions inflected already in Q3 and kept growing in Q4. Non-repeat COVID-19-related sales fell to negligible levels and as a result, we saw a headwind in 2024 as sales declined by 3% organically.\nWhile sales in SLS, Science and Lab Solutions, were flat organically in 2024, Process Solutions declined by minus 6% because of the soft H1 2024. As customer destocking in Life Science has contractually phased out, the EBITDA pre margin improved quarter-on-quarter throughout 2024, reaching 29.4% in Q4.\nOur focus in Life Science is clear. We aim to reaccelerate growth towards our midterm growth ambition in 2025. And this is going to be driven by PS, Process Solutions, as we expect the recovery to continue in 2025. We have strong confidence in our midterm growth ambition driven by our innovative portfolio across our businesses and across various growth drivers in the industry.\nProcess Solutions continues to innovate monoclonal antibodies manufacturing with breakthrough products and technologies, especially in the areas of intensification, perfusion, digital solutions and novel modalities. We drive innovation through our own internal capabilities and at the same time, continue to look at external opportunities. The acquisition of Mirus Bio is an excellent example in this context. It is an important step for us towards completing our portfolio in Process Solutions for vector based cell and gene therapy applications, and it very well complements our existing commercialized portfolio.\nTurning to Healthcare on Slide 9. Organically, our sales were up 7%. Growth was driven by our oncology portfolio once again, which delivered organic growth of plus 13% fueled by Erbitux and supported by Tepmetko. Bavencio also grew in 2024 despite growing competitive result. Our CM&E portfolio delivered a strong 8% organic growth supported by contributions across all regions and all segments. Our N&I portfolio, neurology and immunology, showed plus 2% organic growth with a strong performance of Mavenclad growing by 12% organically, being offset by the expected decline of Rebif. Fertility sales increased 1% organically against very tough comps related to former competitor stock-outs.\nWe achieved a strong profitable growth in 2024. Our EBITDA margin -- our EBITDA pre margin increased by 380 bps to 35.4%, mainly driven by revenue growth and temporarily lower R&D expenses, coupled with a strict cost control. From a strategic perspective, we have a strong confidence in our ability to drive long-term growth through internal and external innovation with around 50% of launches to be sourced through external innovation. And as you have seen, we have a very resilient base to build on with our very well-established franchises expected to be the backbone of a slight growth in the midterm.\nMoving on to Electronics on Slide 10. Organically, sales grew by 5% in 2024. This was mainly driven by Semiconductor Solutions, which was up 8% organically as Semi Materials saw low teens growth fueled once again by AI-related demand. We have grown faster than MSI yet again. MSI is less meaningful this year due to under shipping of [indiscernible]. Yet our internal estimates show mid- to high single-digit growth in wafer starts, which we outperformed, demonstrating the strength of our Semiconductor Materials portfolio.\nDisplay Solutions saw a sales decline of 3% organically as our growth areas in premium liquid crystals and OLED only partially offset the decline in general liquid crystals applications.\nThe EBITDA pre margin was 25.6%, which represents an increase of plus 60 basis points compared with last year. This was mainly driven by revenue growth and supported by our 2024 efficiency program. Remember, EBITDA pre in 2023 was held by a patent agreement with UDC.\nWe continue to see excellent mid- to long-term growth prospects of this business, having tech leadership in key high-value materials.\nOn the short-term basis, while we continue to see growth in demand for Semi Materials needed for AI and advanced nodes, the broader market still has to rebound.\nAnd with that, let me hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of our financials.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and welcome also from my side. I'm now on Slide 12, and we'll start with an overview of our performance by business sector in Q4. Organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was 3.8%. Our key growth engine was Healthcare, while Life Science and Electronics also contributed. Life Science delivered organic sales growth of 1.9%, which is largely driven by Process Solutions. The 6.7% organic sales growth in Healthcare, it was the largest contributor, and oncology was the strongest franchise. Electronics grew 2.2% organically as our Semi business was up 5%.\nFor the group, FX represented a headwind of minus 0.5% on sales, which is mainly seen in Healthcare. Together, with a portfolio effect of plus 0.4% for the group in Q4, which was driven by the acquisitions of Mirus Bio and UnitySC, sales increased by 3.7% in the fourth quarter.\nRegarding earnings, EBITDA pre came in at EUR 1.491 billion, driven by very strong organic growth of 19.7%, which is an increase of EUR 198 million on an absolute basis. Healthcare was a key contributor with an organic EBITDA pre increase of 34.2% or [ EUR 167 million ] on an absolute basis with Life Science and Electronics also contributing. FX was a stronger headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales, mainly due to negative FX effects from hedging as well as operationally, across various currencies, mainly in Healthcare.\nAnd with that, let's move on to the review by business sector, starting with Life Science on Page 13. Overall, Life Science confirmed its return to organic growth in Q4. Sales increased by 1.9% organically, and Process Solutions was the main growth driver, also showing a positive trajectory with sales up quarter-on-quarter. While Science and Lab Solutions sales increased organically comparing with a low base in the year earlier period, Life Science Services was down organically, but yet against a higher base.\nSo looking at Process Solutions first. Sales were up 4.1% organically. Order intake showed very strong year-on-year growth and increased by a low teens percentage rate quarter-on-quarter, and book-to-bill is now above 1. At 2.7%, Science and Lab Solutions achieved organic sales growth in Q4. Excluding the SAP migration effect, which impacted the business by a low to mid-double-digit euro million amount in Q4 of last year, Science and Lab Solutions would have shown a flat performance organically. The overall spending environment remains soft.\nRegarding margins, EBITDA pre increased by 16% organically in Q4, well above organic sales growth. The key driver here was an increase in the gross margin against a low base.\nAnd with that, I'm now moving on to Slide 14 for an overview of the performance of the Healthcare business sector. Healthcare showed strong organic sales growth and was up 6.7% in Q4. With franchise, there were 2 portfolios with the strongest growth again. Oncology with 14% organic growth and CM&E with an 8% organic growth. Our N&I franchise achieved organic growth of plus 3%, and that was driven by a very strong Mavenclad performance of 18% organically, reaching record sales in Q4. Oncology is mainly driven by Erbitux, which showed a stellar performance of plus 22% again organically in Q4, driven by growth in all major regions. Bavencio was up slightly in Q4 with an organic performance of plus 1%. Similar to the previous quarters, we delivered double-digit growth in all regions except North America, where competitive pressures led to an organic decline.\nTurning to our CM&E portfolio. This continues to show a strong performance with plus 8% organic growth in Q4, supported by all therapeutic areas.\nLet's look at the pipeline. In N&I, we now have all the data from the WILLOW study of enpatoran, both for CLE and SLE cohorts. Even though this SLE price did not meet the primary endpoint, the previous success of the CLE cohort and the performance of certain predefined populations in the SLE cohort make us optimistic about the potential for further development.\nRegarding [indiscernible], which we have been informed by our partner about negative top line data from the ongoing Phase II trial, meaning we will not exercise the U.S. option. Accordingly, we expect around EUR 15 million, which is EUR 15 million impairment in Q1 2025.\nOn EBITDA pre, we showed a very strong 640 basis points margin improvement in Q4. While that was driven by, on one hand, by the decline in R&D expenses, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales, and on the other hand, by strong sales growth amid strict cost control. Overall, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 731 million in Q4, and that was up 34.2% organically.\nNow on Slide 15 for Electronics. Sales increased organically by plus 2.3% in Q4. Semiconductor Solutions sales were up 5.3% organically driven by low teens growth in Semiconductor Materials. We are seeing strong demand for differentiated materials driven by trends in AI and in Asia-centric mature nodes, while the wider market has not yet recovered.\nThe DS&S business declined year-on-year in the fourth quarter, as anticipated, as projects have been pushed at least to '25. Sales in Display Solutions decreased by 6% organically as the decline in liquid crystals was faster than contributions from growth areas. EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 242 million, resulting in a margin of 24.8%, which represents an increase of 300 basis points compared with the year earlier period, which had the lowest EBITDA pre margin last year. This is mainly due to higher volumes driving the gross margin compared with the year earlier period. Therefore, EBITDA pre increased organically by 14.9%.\nAnd with that, let's turn to a more detailed review of our group figures for the full year '24, which you will find on Slide 16. On a reported basis, group net sales increased by 0.8% to EUR 21.16 billion. EBITDA pre was up 3.3% to EUR 6.07 billion and EPS pre increased by 1.6% to EUR 8.63 per share. The group EBITDA pre margin came in at 28.7%, which is an increase of 70 basis points versus last year's EBITDA pre margin of 28%. EPS pre grew slower than EBITDA pre in '24, that was mainly due to higher regular D&A and impairments not adjusted for mainly in Healthcare.\nOperating cash flow increased meaningfully by 21.2% to EUR 4.59 billion, up from EUR 3.78 billion of last year. Overall, we were able to further reduce our net debt by more than EUR 300 million in '24 to EUR 7.16 billion and that is despite the acquisitions of Mirus Bio and UnitySC, which we closed in '24.\nSo let me also briefly comment on our reported results. And with that, I'm now on Slide 17. EBIT was up 1% year-on-year. That was below the increase in EBITDA pre, mainly due to the high level of D&A, in turn mainly driven by the EUR 140 million asset impairment we took on [indiscernible] plant in Q2 this year. The financial report result improved by EUR 17 million, and that is mainly due to a better interest result, in turn driven by lower interest expenses.\nThe effective tax rate came in at 21.2% in the bottom half of our guidance range of 21% to 23%. Please be aware that the potential changes to tax regulations being discussed on both sides of the Atlantic. The implications of these changes are not yet clear.\nTurning to EPS. Reported EPS came in at EUR 6.39 in '23, which is -- in ' 24, which is a decline of 1.5% year-on-year amid a higher tax rate compared to the full year of '23.\nNow let's quickly turn to our cash flow statement, which you'll find on Slide 18. Operating cash flow came in strong at EUR 4.586 billion and was up by EUR 802 million compared with the full year of '23, while profit after tax was down by EUR 48 million. The increase in operating cash flow was mainly driven by, number one, compared to last year, an improvement in other assets and liabilities, which is in turn mainly due to lower bonus payouts and taxes. Number two, higher D&A versus last year, which is mainly due to higher impairments in Healthcare, as well as higher regular D&A directly resulting from an elevated CapEx spend over the last -- over the past couple of years. And number three, a favorable change in other operating assets and liability versus last year, a year which contained a number of nonrecurring items.\nInvesting cash flow increased to EUR 3.05 billion, up from EUR 1.89 billion, mainly due to higher cash outs for the announced acquisitions while the financing cash flow improved in '24 compared with last year.\nSo before handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet, which is on Slide 19. Our balance sheet expanded by around EUR 3.1 billion compared with the end of December '23. On the asset side, cash and cash equivalents increased to EUR 2.5 billion from EUR 2 billion at the end of December '23. Inventories and receivables decreased by around EUR 100 million each. Property, plant and equipment increased driven by investments. Intangible assets increased due to FX and our acquisitions. And lastly, other assets increased mainly due to the reclassification of Surface Solutions, which is now classified as an asset held for sale.\nOn the liability side, financial debt increased by around EUR 400 million due to net new borrowings, namely the EUR 800 million hybrid bond, which we issued in Q3 of '24. Pension provisions were down due to interest rate changes and net equity increased, thanks to growth in profit after tax and currency translation differences. As a result, our equity ratio strengthened further from 55% at the year end of '23 to 58% at year end of '24.\nAnd with that, let me hand back to Belen for the guidance.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Helene. I am -- before the guidance, I am on Slide 21 to show our progress in sustainability for the year 2024. We are doing this for the first time, fully applying the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. As you see on the slide, Merck is on a path to achieving its sustainability ambitions. The amount of people treated with our Healthcare products continue to grow, and we just recently announced the treatment of the first [indiscernible] filed with our new formulation, [indiscernible] against schistosomiasis, meaning that for the first time, medication is available for all ages. .\nIn addition, we have made good progress in sustainable patents, supplier management and on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Since 2020, we have been able to nearly half our emissions. And the key reason is the successful rollout of the NF3 abatement technology, which led to a significant reduction in process emissions. We, therefore, remain confident to achieve our 50% reduction target well ahead of 2030.\nGoing on to the guidance on Slide 23. We feel very confident to provide quantitative targets for net sales and EBITDA pre with our 2024 results today. As usual, we will provide quantitative targets on EPS pre as part of our Q1 reporting in May. In that context, we forecast group revenues in a range of EUR 21.5 billion to EUR 22.9 billion and EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 6.1 billion to EUR 6.6 billion. This is based on organic sales growth between plus 3% to 6%.\nWe aim to show profitable underlying growth and forecast the group EBITDA pre to grow in a range between 3% and 8% organically. While for sales, we expect an FX effect of between minus 1% and plus 2%, we anticipate the currency effect on EBITDA pre between minus 2% and plus 1%.\nMoving into Slide 24 for some additional details on the sectors. We have, as you see, moved to a quantitative guidance for our 3 business sectors. For Life Science, we anticipate an organic sales growth between plus 2% and plus 7%. For organic EBITDA pre, we guide to a corridor between plus 2% to 9%, thereby expecting Life Science to return to a profitable growth path in 2025. We anticipate the growth of Life Science to be mostly driven by Process Solutions where we have seen order intake and sales having sequentially improved throughout 2024. We also expect a more normal seasonal sales pattern for Life Science overall.\nMoving to Healthcare, we guide revenue growth between plus 1% and plus 5%. We forecast profitable organic growth and guide EBITDA pre to grow organically between 3% and 9%.\nFor Electronics, we anticipate an organic sales development between plus 2% and plus 6% and an organic EBITDA pre development between 3% and 9%. We forecast the trend to AI and advanced nodes to continue to drive our growth in Electronics, particularly in Semiconductor Materials, while the general market inflection is yet to come with the timing challenging to predict, and this is reflected in our guidance. Please note as well that our Electronics guidance still includes Surface Solutions. However, we are on track to close the transaction in the second half of this year.\nAnd with this, let me thank you for your attention. And Florian, over to you to lead us through the Q&A.",

As a reminder, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. I am now handing over to Constantin Fest, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of IR, MERCK Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien\n\nThank you very much, Heidi, and a very warm welcome from my side to this Merck 2024 results call, my name is Constantin Fest, I'm Head of Investor Relations here at Merck, and I'm delighted to have today here with me Belen Garijo, the Group CEO, as well as Helene von Roeder, Group CFO. Also joining for the Q&A part of this call, we have Matthias Heinzel, CEO of Life Science, as well as Peter Guenter, CEO of Health, and Kai Beckmann CEO of Electronics.\nIn the first few minutes of this call, we would like to guide you through the key slides of this presentation, after that, we're happy to take all of your questions. With this, we are ready to directly start, and I'd like now hand over to you Belen to kick us off, Over to you Belen.\n\nBelén Garijo\n\nThank you, Constantin. Welcome everybody to our Q2 earnings call, please stay on slide number five of the presentation, where we have the highlights of the quarter. First of all, we had a very strong second quarter, significantly beating expectations, as you saw in our ad hoc release from Friday of last week. Healthcare continues to show excellent performance across the portfolio, at very attractive underlying margins, in electronics, the good news is the semi market for AI and advanced nodes has inflected driving sales in EBITDA pre of the business, while life science perform within expectations.\nAnd I am happy to say that Merck has already returned to organic and reported sales growth in Q2, the low light of the quarter was certainly the termination of our XEVINAPANT program. While you may have questions on it, after the introduction, I want to say very clearly that a-priori, it does not change our capital allocation priorities. Turning to our operating performance, the group sales increased by 2% organically and as a result of one-timers, primarily EBITDA pre went down by -1% organically. Life Science showed an organic sales decline of -4%, with the magnitude of the year-on-year decline being less pronounced than in Q1.\nBe reminded that while we no longer segregate the effect of COVID-related sales, it still represents a headwind for life science as a business, as well as for the group in 2024, since we delivered 250 million of COVID sales in 2023. Healthcare again contributed to the positive organic performance of the group with +5% organic sales growth driven primarily by our CM&E and oncology franchises. Electronics was the best performer this quarter with 8% organic sales growth driven by semiconductor solutions, which showed GR and GR growth for the second quarter in a row at an accelerated pace.\nReported sales were $5.352 billion, which is an increase of 1% as the currency was a one percentage point headwind, reported EBITDA pre of 1.509 billion was down by 3%, including a slightly dilutive effect from FX. On EPS pre, we are back at the level of Q2 2023 of €2.20 cents. Beyond our strong operational execution, you have also seen a number of portfolio announcements for Merck overall.\nFirst of all, the diversity of Surface Solution, and even though Surface Solutions only represents a little more than 10% of our sales in electronics and around 2% of the group sales, the diversity of Surface Solutions is strategically relevant since it will help us further sharpen our focus on high-tech applications in electronics. It follows a suite of different activities, both in electronics and life science over the last few months, which expand our portfolio in the breakthrough technologies of the future, and as well supports our long term growth journey.\nMirus Bio complements our offering for the development and production of novel modalities such as cell and gene therapy. Unity SC adds metrology and inspection tools that increase our relevance to customers for AI in semiconductors. Now, turning to the guidance, we are upgrading our forecast and now anticipate net sales in a range of $20.7 billion to $22.1 billion, EBITDA pre of 45.8 to $6.4 billion, an EPS pre of €8.20 to €9.30, thereby slightly improving our guidance corridor for organic growth in sales and lifting our organic growth guidance range for EBITDA pre. I will cover more details on our assumptions at the end of the presentation.\nAnd now on page number six for an overview of our performance by business sector. As announced last Friday in our ad hoc, our key growth engines in the quarter with Electronics and Healthcare, while Life Science performed within expectations. Life Science showed a decline of 4% organically, still against a somewhat strong base in 2023. While Science and Lab Solutions and Life Science services were up in the quarter, process solution was still down organically, but also to a lesser extent than in Q1.\nOrder intake in process solution grew sequentially and year on year for the second quarter in a row, book to bill stayed at around 1, as we have projected, and this is giving us confidence that Life Science will return to organic sales growth in the second half of this year. Healthcare delivered a robust organic sales performance in Q2, and raised revenues by 5%, this was mainly driven by the CM&E portfolio, as I mentioned before, which was up 14%, one-four, and our oncology portfolio that grew 9% in the quarter with both, ERBITUX up 8% organically and BAVENCIO with 6% organic sales growth having contributed.\nMAVENCLAD hit record sales ever in a quarter, however, you have seen that organic growth was muted because of a particularly strong Q2 2023 when we saw some channel dynamics that distorted that quarter in 23. At 8%, electronics showed the strongest organic growth of all the three business sectors in Q2, as our semi business was up by 11%, driving the growth of the electronics sector. Display solution was slightly down organically year on year, and for the group, FX was a headwind on sales across the board with a -1% impact.\nRegarding earnings now, EBITDA pre came in at $1.509 billion, only slightly down organically by -1% or -€12 million in absolute terms, this was due to Life Science, where organic EBITDA pre was down by 6% or -€44 million in quarter two. For healthcare, we were able to show an organic EBITDA pre-growth of 5%, in Q2 about about in line with organic sales growth, even though we book a termination provision of a mid double digit million euros amount on XEVINAPANT in Q2 this year.\nEBITDA Pre in Electronics was down by 3% organically, and this is in relation to the one time impact from the UDC patent agreement that you may remember, we landed in the year earlier quarter, so in 2023. FX was a stronger headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales, mainly due to Healthcare and Life Science. I would also like to highlight that excluding the UDC patent agreement one-timer from Q2 last year and the termination provision of XEVINAPANT from Q2 this year, reported EBITDA pre for the group which has shown robust growth in the mid-single-digit percentages. With this, I'm going to hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of our finances.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nMember-Management Board & Chief Financial Officer, Vonovia SE\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and a warm welcome also from my side. I am now on slide eight for an overview of our key figures in the first quarter, let me emphasize, we not only returned to organic sales growth in Q2, but we also made it back to reported sales growth. Taking into account currency headwinds of -0.7%, net sales did increase by 0.9% to €5.352 billion. On the back of the XEVINAPANT termination provision, EBITDA pre was down by 2.9%, to €1.509 billion, with a slightly higher FX headwind on EBITDA pre compared to sales. EPS pre was flat at €2.20.\nOperating cash flow came in strong at €861 million, which represents an increase of 38.4% over the year earlier period, that was mainly due to lower bonus payments as well as LTIP. Net financial debt increased by €450 million compared to the end of December 23, which is mainly due to the payment of a dividend which took place in the second quarter. So let me also briefly comment on our reported results, and with that, I am now on slide nine.\nEBIT was down by 18.3% year on year, this was above the decline in EBITDA pre, mainly as a result of the high level of DNA, which was in turn due to the 140 million impairment we are taking on XEVINAPANT, as well as the operating performance on Life Science. The financial result was markedly up by €69 million to just -€7 million in the quarter, this is mainly driven by tax items and lower provisions for a long-term incentive plan, alongside higher interest income.\nThe effective tax rate came in at 22.9%, which is at the top end of our guidance range of 21% to 23%, and reflects a slight shift in the overall tax rate for the full year due to the XEVINAPANT program termination, and as well, due to a slight increase in the expected pillar 2 expenses. Reported EPS came in at €1.40, which represents a decline of 13.6% year-on-year. Now, with that, let's move on to the review by business sector, and I'm starting with Life Science on slide 10.\nOverall, Life Science did deliver on our expectations in Q2. Sales were still down 3.7% organically year-on-year in the quarter, but remember, we only started to see the full effect of customer destocking and process solutions over the course of Q2 of last year. In Q1-'24, we still had an organic sales decline of 12.6%, so we saw a trend reversal, and importantly, Life Science improved sequentially across the board. Supported by a broad and diversified position, we continue to expect a further recovery during 2024. Now two of the three businesses in LifeScience also showed organic sales growth year on year in Q2.\nSo with that, looking at process solutions first, the business, which faced the toughest comps in Q2, sales were down 12% organically, which represents an improvement versus the -19% which we have seen in Q1. Sales showed a positive sequential trend and went up by 7% quarter on quarter. Order intake again went up sequentially as well as year on year. Book-to-bill remained at around 1. We continue to expect a sequential improvement in order intake throughout the year, and that book-to-bill will remain at around 1 during 2024. Now we will take a closer look at Science and Lab Solutions.\nSales were up 1% organically, the first positive organic sales development year-on-year since Q1 2023, and it was driven by demand from industrial and testing as well as diagnosis. Demand from pharma companies has remained soft, especially in North America, while academic research spending is experiencing more novelized growth now in 2024. Sequentially, sales and science and lab solutions were up in Q2 and therefore grew for the third quarter in a row. Turning to Life Science Services, our third and smallest business within Life Science. Sales increased by 8% organically, driven by our clinical testing business, which went up in the mid-teens, our CDMO activities also increased slightly.\nLooking to the coming quarters, I would like to mention that our CDMO business can be volatile on a quarterly basis, as project phasing has a significant impact on the performance. When modeling Q3, it should also be remembered that we benefited from an end of a contract payment of a low to mid-double-digit Euro-million amount relating to COVID in Q3 of last year. EBITDA pre-declined 6.1% organically in Q2, which was mainly due to lower volumes with idle costs from underutilization. Sequentially, however, EBITDA pre-increased, with the margin having moved up by 50 basis points as a result of stringent cost control, as well as some operational leverage.\nI am now on slide 11 for an overview of the performance of a Healthcare business sector. Healthcare delivered a robust organic sales growth of 5.3% in Q2. By franchise, it was a CM&E portfolio which was a star performer at plus 14% organically with strong growth supported by contributions across all segments and all regions. The growth has been amplified by successful tender business and the prior year's slowdown in the diabetes market in China. Oncology showed a strong performance in Q2, growing 9% organically, this is also driven by all brands.\nERBITUX was up 8% supported by nearly all regions, and also BAVENCIO grew by 6% in line with our expectations. With all regions up, expect North America, where competitive pressures led to a decline in the mid-teens. As a reminder, BAVENCIO sales in North America make up less than 30% of the global BAVENCIO sales, and furthermore, TEPMETKO also contributed to the organic growth of the oncology franchise. Our NNI franchise was down 7% organically this quarter, MAVENCLAD grew only 1% organically versus a high basis last year, this is also the case for REBIF, which declined by 18% organically this quarter, looking at the H1 numbers, the NNI franchise has been stable.\nRegarding MAVENCLAD, we hit record sales this quarter, US prescriptions continue to expand both in breadth and in depth. Concerning the pipeline, as announced in June, we decided to discontinue the XEVINAPANT Phase III program, based on the insight into the data we gained from the interim analysis of the trilings study in Q2. In NNI, we initiated a new Phase III program to investigate CLADRIBINE in generalized myasthenia gravis, the recruitment to the study is now open. At ASCO, we have presented strong data for our ATR inhibitor TUVUSERTIB and ADC M9140 and are now moving on to the execution of our DDR and ADC strategy.\nSo with that coming to EBITDA Pre, I am happy to say that even though we booked a mid-double-digit-million-euro termination provision on XEVINAPANT in Q2, Our EBITDA pre-margin declined only slightly from 34.3% to 33.7%. It was a strong sales growth which supported the growth margin, paired with lower underlying R&D and a positive effect of the BAVENCIO repatriation, which is now coming close to it's first anniversary. For modeling, we expect underlying R&D to remain structurally lower also for the remainder of 2024.\nPlease do have in mind that the provisions for both EVOBRUTINIB and XEVINAPANT have an impact on our absolute R&D costs in 2024. We also expect gross margin levels to normalize more in line with the last quarters amid rebate dynamics. Overall, EBITDA pre amounted to 720 million euros in Q2, and was up 4.6% organically, only slightly below the organic growth and sales, and with that, we will now move on to electronics on slide 12. Electronics showed an acceleration of organic growth to 7.6% in Q2, the key driver was semiconductor solutions, which was up 11% organically.\nAll semiconductor materials businesses drove organic growth in the quarter, driven by AI and advanced nodes, while our DS&S business was largely flat sequentially and year on year. As we mentioned in our last earnings call in May, we generated revenues until the completion of the large US project in Q1, which did support our Q1 DS&F sales. However, contrary to our expectations, we did see an unanticipated increase in demand for delivery equipment during Q2, which compensated for the large project we knew that was ending in Q1 in the US.\nOur semiconductor materials business continues to deliver sequential growth at a stronger pace, while a wider inflection of mainstream semiconductor end markets, particularly in the areas of 3D NAND and analog is not yet visible, the semi-market for advanced nodes and AI has inflected. We've seen an acceleration in demand for thin-film materials for advanced logic nodes and semiconductors, which is driving sales. Turning to Display Solutions, we saw a slight organic sales decline of -2%. volume growth was again not able to offset continuous price pressure in liquid crystals.\nBelen has already spoken about the strategic rationale to sell surface solutions, so let me also say a few words about the financial implications. As the expected completion of the transaction is more than 12 months away, it will remain part of the reporting end group guidance, we will not define Surface Solutions as a discontinued business or as it held for sale as of now. Returning to our performance in the quarter, the EBITDA pre-margin declined by -240 basis points year-on-year to 26.7%, but please do bear in mind that the EBITDA pre-margin in Q2 of last year benefited from the patent agreement with UDC, which contributed around 60 million euros to EBITDA pre back then.\nSequentially, the EBITDA pre-margin increased by 120 basis points. This is mainly driven by the sales increase in semiconductor materials and resulting leverage and positive mix effects within semiconductor materials from products associated with advanced nodes. For the further evolution of sales, please bear in mind that the dynamics in the semiconductor market have diverged from our previous expectations. While the semi-market for advanced nodes and AI has inflected earlier, the broader semi-market is developing at a more gradual pace.\nRegarding the further evolution of EBITDA pre-margins, I want to stress that we continue to be convinced of the long-term secular growth of semiconductors. Therefore, we do sustain high level of R&D and are already bringing capacity expansions online. So before handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement, as you can see on slide 13, our balance sheet increased by €1.4 billion, compared with the end of December 2023.\nNow let's take a closer look at the asset side, cash and cash equivalents increased to €2.7 billion, from €2.0 billion at the end of December '23, driven by the strong operating cash flow, inventories went up slightly as did receivables. Property plant and equipment increased driven by our investments, and lastly, intangible assets increased slightly due to the FX effect on our goodwill. In the liability side, financial debt increased, which was largely offset by a decline in other liabilities, in turn affected by the dividend payment in Q2, pension provisions were down due to interest rate changes.\nPayables decreased from €3.4 billion to €3.0 billion due to in-license deals signed in the prior period, which resulted in payments this year. And net equity increased by €1.8 billion, thanks to growth in profit after tax and higher gains recognized in equity driven mainly by FX. As a result, our equity ratio strengthened yet again from 55% at the end of December 2023 to 57% now. Now we will turn to cash flows which are on slide 14. Operating cash flow came in strong at €861 million, and was up by €239 million compared with Q2 of last year despite the decline in profit after tax.\nThis was mainly due to changes in other assets and liabilities, which were in turn driven by lower bonus payouts and taxes in the quarter, amid a high level of DNA, including the one-off impairments in relation to healthcare R&D. Cash out for investing activities increased, primarily due to higher investment of our excess liquidity in non-financial assets, and slightly increased capex on property, plant and equipment, as we continue to invest in capacity expansions in a responsible manner. Last but not least, the difference in financing cash flow can be explained mainly by proceeds from bank loans, and with that, let me hand back to Belen for the outlook.\n\nBelén Garijo\n\nThank you, Helene, let's take a closer look at our guidance on slide number 16. We are raising our full year 2024 guidance for the group on higher expectations for healthcare, and for the semi-business within electronics. And we now expect group net sales in a range of €20.7 to €22.1 billion, EBITDA pre in a range of €5.8 to €6.4 billion, and EPS pre in a range of €8.20 to €9.30. With our first quantitative guidance in May, we confirmed to you our goal to return to return to organic growth in 2024, and forecasted organic sales growth between +1 and +5.\nWe underline this goal with Q2 and are now lifting the lower end of the guidance train, and therefore expect an overall organic sales development between +2 and +5 for 2024. Regarding EBITDA pre, we are increasing the guidance range for organic growth to+4 to +10, driven by the strong operational performance of both our healthcare and our electronics business sectors. We continue to expect effects to have an impact of, -3% to 0% percent on sales, but we are expanding the guidance span for EBITDA to a slightly higher -5 to -1.\nEven though we now expect a slightly stronger headwind from FX on EBITDA pre, we are able to lift the guidance bands for EBITDA pre and consequently also for EPS pre. For some additional color by business sectors, let's take a look at slide number 17. Our Q2 performance reinforces confidence in our 2024 return to growth trajectory, we have raised our expectations for Healthcare and Electronics while we fully confirm our guidance for Life Science. For healthcare, our guidance now anticipates organic sales growth between +6% to +9% above the quantitative guidance from May. And there are a number of drivers that continue to play in our favor.\nOur CM&E franchise continues to perform very well, MAVENCLAD keeps gaining market share in the US, and our oncology franchise is showing a strong growth. We are raising our guidance also for organic EBITDA growth, and even further to between +18% and 23%, and this is mainly driven by a strongly leveraged growth, paired with cost discipline and a lower R&D spend, on an underlying basis already visible in Q2. Moving on to electronics, we are increasing our guidance for the organic sales development to +4 to +8, driven by the performance of our semiconductor solutions business as we see the semi-materials market for advanced nodes and AI inflecting already.\nA sales increase and positive mixed effects from advanced semiconductor nodes are driving increased anticipated organic EBITDA pre-growth of +5 to +11 and offset last year's UDC patent effect of around 60 million. For life science, we are staying the course and confirm our guidance for an organic sales development between -2% to +2%, and for organic EBITDA pre, we also confirm our guidance for an organic year on year change between -6 to +1%. Staying on life science, Q2 has developed fully in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect a further gradual recovery during 2024, with organic sales growth now turning positive in the second half of the year.\nOverall, I'm very pleased to say that we have already returned to organic growth in Q2. In May, I mentioned to you that as a group, we also have the ambition to return to profitable organic growth in 2024, and we are now more confident that we will deliver on this ambition, as our increased guidance already shows. And with this, we will be happy to now take your questions. Thank you.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of IR, MERCK Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien\n\nThank you very much, Belen, thank you very much, Helene. Heidi, if we could have the first question, please, that would be great. Thank you.\n\nBelén Garijo\n\nThank you, we will now begin our question and answer session. If you have a question for our speakers, please dial star 11 on your telephone keypad now to enter the queue. Once your name has been announced, you can ask a question. If you are using speaker equipment today, please lift the handset before making your selection, one moment please for the first question.

[Operator Instructions]\nI am now handing over to Constantin Fest, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of IR, MERCK Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien\n\nThank you very much, Heidi, and a very warm welcome to this Merck Q1 2024 Results Call. My name is Constantin Fest, I'm Head of Investor Relations here, and I'm delighted to be joined by Belen Garijo, Group CEO; as well as Helene von Roeder, Group CFO. For the Q&A part of this call, we will also be joined by Matthias Heinzel, CEO of Life Science; by Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; as well as Kai Beckmann, CEO of Electronics. The first couple of minutes of this call, we'd like to run you through the key slides of this presentation, which will then be followed by Q&A.\nWith this, I'd like to hand over now to Belen to start. Over to you, Belen.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThanks, Constantin, and welcome, everybody, to our Q1 earnings call. I am now on Slide #5 of the presentation, and we'll start with the highlights.\nSo as you have seen earlier today, we delivered a very solid quarter despite the observed slight organic revenue decline, and we are trending in the right direction with 2 of our 3 business sectors having shown a very strong performance in Q1. And we expect growth to continue to improve from here.\nOrganically, group sales declined by 1% and EBITDA pre went down by 5%. This, paired with a 2 percentage point currency headwind, leads to reported sales of EUR 5.120 billion, which is a decline of 3%. The currency had a slightly dilutive effect on EBITDA pre, which was down by 8% to EUR 1.454 billion. EPS pre of EUR 2.06 decreased 13% year-on-year.\nHealthcare was the top performer, with 10% organic sales growth driven by Erbitux, by Mavenclad and Bavencio. Electronics also showed a positive organic sales development in Q1, up 6%, and this was driven by Semiconductor Solutions, which returned to growth year-on-year at an increase of 8%. As expected, Life Science showed an organic sales decline again, a particularly high base. As you may remember, we have not yet seen the full impact of the customer destocking in our Process Solutions business in Q1 last year. Therefore, Life Science was down by 13%. While we no longer segregate the effect of COVID-related sales, it still represents a headwind for Life Science as well as for the group in 2024.\nIn Life Science, we also saw positive signals from order intake in our Process Solutions business in quarter 1. Order intake grew both sequentially and year-on-year. Book-to-bill went up to around 1, reflecting the sequential increase in order intake.\nWith the presentation of our financial results last year, we confirmed our goal of returning to growth in 2024. Q1 showed an overall positive business momentum and confirmed our previously anticipated trajectory for the remainder of the year and the guidance. I'm talking about the guidance. And as usual, at this time of the year, we are further specifying that we now anticipate net sales in a range of EUR 20.6 billion to EUR 22.1 billion, EBITDA pre of EUR 5.7 billion to EUR 6.3 billion, and EPS pre of EUR 8.05 to EUR 9.10, thereby confirming our qualitative guidance with a slightly more positive tonality on EBITDA pre. We will share more details on our assumptions later.\nTurning to Slide #6. We will provide a bit more color on our business sector. As you can see, Healthcare and Electronics contributed positively to organic sales growth in Q1, largely offsetting the decline in Life Science. Our key growth engines in the quarter were: first, our new Healthcare products, our new launches, as well as Semiconductor Solutions within the Electronics business sector.\nIn fact, in a still challenging operating environment in Q1, Healthcare took the lead with a strong organic growth of 10%. And this was driven by 15% growth from recent launches, with Bavencio up by 14% and Mavenclad up 12% in Q1, and further supported by a strong performance of our established product portfolio with a stellar performance of Erbitux. Our established product portfolio increased by 9%.\nFrom a franchise perspective, Oncology was the highlight, again, with an organic growth of 19%. Life Science showed a decline of 13% organically against a strong base as we flagged already in March, with all 3 business being down in the quarter. Process Solutions declined organically by 19%. Science and Lab Solutions was down by 7%, both against very tough comparables in Q1 2023.\nIn Electronics, our semi business was up 8% in the quarter, driving the growth of the sector, which was up 6% organically in Q1. Display Solutions and Surface also showed positive organic growth in Q1. FX was a headwind across the board on sales with a minus a 2% impact on sales at group level, in line with the guidance that we provided in March.\nOn earnings, EBITDA pre came in at EUR 1.45 billion, down organically by 5% or minus EUR 82 million in absolute values. And this was due to Life Science, where organic EBITDA pre was down by minus 30% in Q1 against high comparables. EBITDA pre in Healthcare was up strongly by more than 28% organically in quarter 1, driven by a strongly leverage growth as well as the positive impact of the Bavencio repatriation. EBITDA pre in Electronics was up by 4% organically due to positive mix in advanced nodes in semi materials and in the S&S combined with volume effects. Last, FX was a stronger headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales, and this is mainly due to Healthcare.\nAnd with this, let me hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of our financials.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and a warm welcome also from my side. I'm now on Slide 8 for an overview of our key figures in the first quarter.\nLet me emphasize, we had a solid start to 2024 in a still challenging business environment. Taking into account currency headwinds, net sales declined by 3.3% to EUR 5.1200 billion -- no, EUR 5.120 billion. EBITDA pre was down by 8.4% to EUR 1.454 billion, with a slightly higher FX headwind on EBITDA pre compared with sales, and EPS pre declined by 12.7% to [ EUR 2.06 ]. Operating cash flow came in strong at EUR 1.035 billion, which is an increase of 21.4% over the year-earlier period. Now that's attributable mainly to lower bonus payments, lower tax payments as well as a lower cash outflow from net working capital. Net financial debt was stable compared with the end of December, mainly due to short-term investments in nonfinancial assets.\nLet me also briefly comment on our reported results. So -- and with that, I'm now on Slide 9. EBIT was down by 10% year-on-year. This was above the decline in EBITDA pre, mainly due to the high level of DNA. The financial result was down by EUR 11 million, mainly driven by lower income from financial investments. The effective tax rate came in at 22.2%, which is in line with our guidance range of [ 21% to 23% ], but above the effective tax rate of 21% of the earlier year period. Now as mentioned previously, this was mainly due to additional Pillar 2 tax expense, having increased our effective tax rate by roughly 1 percentage point. Reported EPS came in at EUR 1.60, which represents a decline of 12.6% year-on-year.\nAnd with that, let's move on to the review by business sector. I'm starting with Life Science, which is on Slide 10. As we mentioned in our qualitative guidance for March, H1 compares against a high base. Hence, overall, sales in Life Science were down 12.6% organically in Q1. We do expect Q1 to be the softest quarter for our Life Science business sector in 2024. In fact, it also had the toughest comparative quarter in Q1 of last year. Also bear in mind that while we no longer specify the effect of COVID headwinds, COVID-related sales still represent a headwind for Life Science in 2024.\nAll 3 businesses in Life Science declined organically in Q1. So looking at Process Solutions first. Sales were down 19% organically in Q1, which is actually a similar level compared with Q4 2023. We are comparing against tough comps as we only started to see the first effect of customer destocking during Q1 last year. But as we already mentioned in March, we've seen positive signals from order intake. Order intake this quarter was solid and went up sequentially as well as year-on-year. I am happy to state that book-to-bill increased to around 1.\nSo taking a closer look at Science & Lab Solutions. Here, sales were down by 6.9% organically. That is because of demand from pharma companies remaining soft, both in North America as well as China. China overall has remained a challenge, but we saw signs of stabilization sequentially. In addition, academic research spending was impacted in North America by Q1 and the delayed signing of the NIH budget. And do not forget that Q1 last year was unaffected by the temporary headwinds, such as the muted spending behavior by pharma companies and the macro environment in China we have been experiencing since Q2 2023. Notably, sales in Science and Lab Solutions were up sequential, underlining our expectation of a gradual recovery during 2024.\nTurning to the third sector, which is Life Science Services, our third and smallest business, which is within Life Science. Sales were down 16.6% organically, driven by the streamlining of the supply chain by one of our CDMO customers and an organic sales decline in our CDMO activities, which was mainly due to negative project phasing. EBITDA pre declined 30% organically in Q1, mainly due to lower volumes and negative mix effect. Q1 '24 had the highest margin comparator also. Sequentially, EBITDA pre increased slightly with the margin having moved up by [ 220 ] basis points, which is mainly on positive product mix effects driven -- driving gross margin.\n[indiscernible] now on Slide 11 for an overview of the performance of the Healthcare business sector. Healthcare did deliver strong organic sales growth of 10.1% in Q1, which is above the level we have guided for, for the full year in our qualitative guidance from early March. Wave 1 projects grew by 15% organically, and the established portfolio was up 9% organically.\nBy franchise, Oncology was the star performer, with 19% increase organically which is mainly driven by Erbitux growing 19%. Here, China, in particular, stood out positively, with prior year sales impacted by a spike in COVID infection rates while supported by continued strong commercial uptake. Bavencio was up 14% in line with our expectations.\nOur N&I franchise was also up by 9% in Q1, that was driven by Mavenclad, which actually increased 12% organically. [indiscernible] grew as well by 4% organically in Q1. That was due to channel dynamics, which led to a low base. On the latter, I do want to reiterate that we are not seeing a trend change for the interferon market.\nFertility performed strongly again, with an 8% organic sales growth against a lower base in China. In general, and as projected, we are also seeing that stock out effects of our competitor products are beginning to moderate.\nWe are also very pleased with the performance of our CM&E portfolio, resulting in 4% organic growth, supported by a positive contribution across all segments.\nWithin Endocrinology, the strong growth of the past quarters was driven by stock outs of a major competitor. As we are at manufacturing capacity for [ Saizen ], we do not expect a continuation of double-digit growth rates, even if the market supply remains constrained.\nNow regarding our pipeline, for xevinapant, we are on track for the interim analysis of TrilynX, our Phase III study in locally advanced [indiscernible] cell carcinoma of the head and neck in [indiscernible] eligible population. In addition, we have seen positive momentum built in our early oncology pipeline for ADC and DDR assets. We will present new data at ASCO. And in addition, I can recommend that you join our R&D update call on June 3, which will focus on early oncology assets.\nThe strong organic sales growth in Q1 helped us to achieve an even stronger performance on EBITDA pre. EBITDA pre was boosted by higher operating leverage and benefited from the repatriation of Bavencio, which came into effect only as of July 1, 2023, and amid ongoing cost discipline. Overall, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 708 million in Q1, which resulted in a margin of 34.6%, which is 370 basis points above Q1 '23. As a result, organic EBITDA pre increased by 28.3%, which is well above the organic increase in sales.\nSo moving on to our third sector, Electronics, which is on Slide 12. The Electronics sector had a strong start to the year, with all business having performed positively. Organically, sales increased by 6.3% in Q1. The key driver was the core business within Electronics, Semiconductor Solutions, which was up by 8% organically. Both our DS&S and our Semi materials businesses contributed to this development. In DS&S, we generated revenues towards the end of a large project in the U.S. We have seen customers push out the timing of new fabs, but we are already building a strong pipeline for '25 and '26.\nOur Semiconductor Materials business has now delivered 3 quarters of sequential growth in a row, driven by [indiscernible] applications in advanced logic nodes in semiconductors. Mainstream semiconductor end markets, particularly [ 3D LAND ] and Analog have, however, remained weak in Q1. There was early buying behavior from some customers, which has yet to become a broader trend. Therefore, we did see an encouraging start to the year, but we do not call it an inflection yet.\nOur Display Solutions business also saw a sales increase of 4% organically. That was mainly due to volume growth having overcompensated continuous price pressure against low comps for Q1 '23. And Surface Solutions was up by 2% organically, driven by increased demand for cosmetic pigments and automotive coatings, which overcompensated weaker demand for the industrial pigments.\nWhile the EBITDA pre margin went down by 19 basis points year-over-year to 25.5% compared to a still high base in Q1 '23, we did see a 370 basis point margin increase sequentially. The sequential margin increase was mainly driven by positive mix effects from advanced semiconductor nodes and the sales increase, especially in semi materials and the resulting positive leverage amongst amid strict cost discipline.\nFor the further margin evolution during 2024 please do have in mind that we continue to have ongoing price pressure in the liquid crystal business and higher underutilization costs due to the ongoing site ramp-up in semi. As we continue to be convinced of the long-term secular growth of semiconductors, we also sustained higher R&D and are continuing with our capacity expansions.\nSo before handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet as well as cash flow statement. As you can see on Slide 13, our balance sheet increased by EUR 1 billion compared with the end of December 2023. So let's take a closer look on the asset side. Cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 2.2 billion from EUR 2 billion at the end of December '23, and that was driven by strong operating cash flow in this quarter. Inventories went slightly up as did receivables. Property, plant and equipment increased driven by investments. And lastly, intangible assets increased due to FX effects on our goodwill.\nTurning to the liability side. Financial debt increased slightly, [indiscernible] provisions were down due to changes in interest rates. Payables decreased from EUR 3.4 billion to EUR 3 billion due to in-license deals which were signed in the prior period, and resulted in payments in Q1 of this year. And net equity increased by EUR 1.3 billion, thanks to growth in profit after tax and higher gains recognized in equity, mainly driven by FX. As a result, our equity ratio strengthened further from 55% at the end of December 2023, now to 57%.\nSo turning to cash flow on Slide 14. Operating cash flow came in strong at EUR 1.035 billion, and was up more than EUR 180 million compared with Q1 last year despite a decline in profit after tax. This was mainly due to changes in other assets and liabilities in turn, driven by lower bonus payouts and taxes in the quarter amid a slower increase in working capital.\nCash out for investing activities decreased primarily due to lower investment of our excess liquidity in nonfinancial assets. CapEx on property, plant and equipment went down slightly, while we do continue to invest for capacity expansions. And last but not least, the difference in financing cash flow can be explained mainly by proceeds from bank loans in the year earlier quarter.\nNow with that, let me hand back to Belen for the outlook.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Helene. So let's take a look at our guidance on Slide #16. Let me emphasize that back in March, when we provided qualitative targets for 2024, we also confirm our confidence to return to organic growth in 2024. I am happy to confirm this goal with our first quantitative guidance for 2024.\nWe are now expecting group net sales in 2024 in a range of EUR 20.6 billion to EUR 22.1 billion, EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 5.7 billion to EUR 6.3 billion and EPS pre in a range of [ 8.05 to 9.10 ], and this is based on organic sales growth of plus 1% to plus 5%, in line with our qualitative outlook provided in March.\nRegarding organic EBITDA predevelopment, we have become slightly more optimistic than we were in our qualitative outlook for March, and we expect plus 1% to plus 7%, and this is mainly driven by the strong performance of our Healthcare business sector. We continue to expect effects to have an impact of minus 3% to 0% on revenues and minus 4% to minus 1% on EBITDA pre.\nFor some additional detail by business sector, please take a look at Slide 17. Our Q1 performance is providing increased confidence in the 2024 period. Therefore, we broadly confirm our qualitative guidance from March for Life Science and Electronics, and we have become more optimistic about Healthcare. So for Healthcare, we now guide for organic sales growth of plus 4% to plus 7%, slightly above the qualitative guidance from March, with a number of drivers playing in our favor, including the continued strong performance of our established product businesses. We raised our guidance on organic EBITDA growth to plus 13% to 18%, and this is mainly in relation to the strong leverage growth, combined with continued cost discipline in the Healthcare business sector.\nMoving on to Life Science. We confirm our guidance for organic sales growth and expect an organic sales development between minus 2% and plus 2%. For organic EBITDA pre, we guide to an organic year-on-year change of minus 6% to plus 1%, thereby broadly confirming our qualitative guidance from March. We continue to expect [indiscernible] recovery during 2024, with organic sales growth turning positive in the second half of the year. We see Q1 as the softest quarter in 2024, both in absolute terms as well as on a year-on-year basis, given the high comparables in 2023 that we mentioned several times.\nFor Electronics, we forecast an organic sales development between 0% and 4% and an organic EBITDA predevelopment between minus 3% to plus 4%. Once again, broadly confirming our previous qualitative guidance range. We have had a positive start to the year, but the general market inflection is yet to come in semiconductors. And you know that we continue to base our guidance on the semiconductor market returning in early [ H2 ].\nOverall, I'm very pleased to say that Q1 is providing increased confidence in our return to organic growth in 2024. And as a group, we also have the ambition to return to profitable organic growth in 2024 as our guidance ranges imply.\nWith this, let me thank you for your attention, and we will be happy to take your questions.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI'm now handing over to Constantin Fest, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Heidi, and a very warm welcome to this Merck Full Year 2023 Results Call. My name is Constantin Fest. I'm Head of Investor Relations here at Merck, and I'm delighted to be joined today by Belen Garijo, CEO of the group; as well as Helene von Roeder, CFO of the group. Also for the Q&A part of this call will be joined by Matthias Heinzel, CEO, Life Science; Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; as well as Kai Beckmann, CEO of Electronics.\nIn the next couple of minutes, we would like to run you through the key slides of this presentation. And after that, we are happy to take all of your questions in the Q&A.\nWith this, I'd like to directly hand over to Belen to kick off the presentation. Over to you.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Constantin, and welcome, everybody, to our full year 2023 earnings call. I am on Slide #5 of the presentation and would like to start with some key messages for 2023.\nFirst of all, we have landed expected and delivered on our guidance, not only that, but we have also delivered to market expectations for fiscal year 2023. I hope you would agree with me that we were confronted with major market headwinds and have operated our business in a very, very challenging environment.\nIn that context, we have shown great resilience with a strong support from our multi-industry business model. As we already mentioned during our Q3 earnings call, the scale with opportunities on one side and the challenges on the other side was tilting more towards the challenges. So we have met our guidance corridors for net sales, EBITDA pre and EPS pre, and this is not only good news, but it reflects our great anticipation of the way the business environment was going to be moving in 2023, but also a very disciplined execution of our plans.\nNow let's move to the highlights for 2023 in the next slide, Slide #6. The strong performance of Healthcare partially compensated for the challenges that we had for Life Science and Electronics Organically, our group sales were down by 2% and EBITDA pre declined by 9%. Healthcare was once again the best performer with 9% organic sales growth. This was driven by both our [ wave 1 ] launches, in particular, Bavencio and Mavenclad and our Fertility franchise. Life Science recorded a 2% decline in the core business, driven by continued customer destocking in Process Solutions and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment in China amid a complex SAP migration, which impact we already discussed with you in Q3 last year.\nAgainst the backdrop of the share decline in the COVID-19 business, total sales in Life Science were down by 8% organically in 2023. This decline also had a negative effect on the EBITDA pre margin in Life Science and consequently, that of the group. Sales in Electronics were down by 5% organically due to the prolonged well-known down cycle in the semiconductor market. All that together with significant currency headwinds and a very small portfolio effect, sales declined by EUR 1.2 billion year-on-year to EUR 21 billion while EBITDA pre came in at EUR 5.9 billion, once again within our guidance corridor.\nMoving on to Slide #7 to show you the proposed dividend. As communicated in our press release this morning, we will propose a dividend of EUR 2.20 per share to the general assembly on April 28. As you see, this is stable versus last year, speaking of the great confidence that we have on the long-term growth of our business. While it is part of our policy that the current dividend constitutes the minimum level, this assumes a stable economic environment. And as I as laid out, our businesses were confronted with major headwinds and operated in a very challenging environment. Once again, in keeping our dividend stable, we signal strong confidence in our future growth.\nLet me now provide a bit more color on 2023 on a business-by-business basis, starting with Life Science on Slide #9. Life Science [indiscernible] transitional year where sales were down by 2% organically in the quarter. While COVID-related sales decline as anticipated, with an additional dampening effect of minus 6%. Therefore, total sales in Life Science declined by 8% organically. In line with our guidance, COVID-related sales fell from around EUR 800 million in 2022 to around EUR 250 million in 2023. Process Solution decreased by 8%, mainly contributing to the organic sales decline in the [ quarter ].\nTurning to profitability. The EBITDA pre margin was down to 30.4% from a high 36.2% last year, mainly driven by lower volumes and negative mix effects mainly due to the decline of the COVID-related sales, which you may remember were highly profitable. Our focus in Life Science is very clear. We aim to return to growth during 2024 while leveraging our innovative portfolio across our three business units within Life Science. Process Solutions is a key enabler of next-generation [indiscernible] manufacturing and the production of novel modalities. Here, we can leverage our know-how to drive Life Science services in parallel. We bring new solutions to the market, taking a very active role in the area of digitalization of labs and research.\nIn summary, 2023 was a transitional year for Life Science with significant market headwinds for nonrepeating -- from nonrepeating COVID-related sales coupled with [ pronounced ] customer destocking. While book-to-bill was below 1 throughout 2023, it was trending in the right direction in the second half. Underlying market fundamentals remain attractive beyond temporary developments, and we have a strong confidence in the midterm growth prospects for our business in Life Science.\nMoving into Healthcare, Slide #10. Sales were up by 8.5% organically, and the EBITDA pre margin has remained stable at 31.6%. Regarding EBITDA pre, positive effects from stringent cost management and half a year of full Bavencio profit repatriation were masked by additional prelaunch cost and the evobrutinib termination provision of a high double-digit million amount that Helene will confirm later. Growth in Healthcare was driven by our Oncology portfolio, which delivered organic growth of 17%, fueled by the continued ramp-up of Bavencio as well as Erbitux.\nOur NNI portfolio neurology and immunology remained organically stable with a strong performance of Mavenclad, especially in the U.S., offsetting the expected Rebif decline. Our strategic franchise grew by 15% organically due to a strong underlying growth, which was amplified by competitors' stock-outs.\nFrom a strategic perspective, we are confident that our focused leadership approach is solid and provide a promising basis for long-term growth. While the sale of EVO was no doubt a disappointment, our pipeline continues to have significant potential in all stages of development, we have compounds with novel mechanisms that could redefine the standard of care in key therapeutic areas like oncology and immunology. Development of xevinapant is going on. Our latest -- I mean, as you know, xevinapant is our latest stage blockbuster candidate in [indiscernible]. And the next step is the interim analysis of the three [ LINX ] study, the Phase III study in unresectable patients who are eligible for treatment, which is [ platin ].\nOur TLR7/8 inhibitor enpatoran has written an important milestone in 2023 by completing the futility analysis in our Phase II program in systemic and in cutaneous lupus. We signed new collaborations and license agreement to increase the optionality of our pipeline. And all in all, we feel pretty solid and good about our positioning in Healthcare despite the [ sector ] with evobrutinib. We will remain focused on stringent execution of our strategy to both drive our existing product portfolio and to continue to increase optionality for our pipeline.\nMoving into Electronics on Slide #11. Organically, sales fell by 5% in 2023, while EBITDA pre declined by 17%. Our Semi Solutions business was down 4% organically, yet outperforming the market. Our Display Solutions business saw a sales decline of 9% organically, and this was mainly due to volume losses against high comparables from H1 2022 and price reductions in liquid crystals. Surface Solutions was down by 4% due to volume declines in automotive, coatings and industrial pigment demand. The EBITDA pre margin of Electronics landed at 25% with some headwinds from currency.\nThe sales decline in Semiconductor Solutions driven by semiconductors materials led to underutilization cost and negative mix effects. Display Solution experienced increasing price pressure, mainly in the liquid crystal business. This affects cost an adverse underlying margin development.\nObviously, in this context, we have to take some cost actions to mitigate the impact of this effect from profitability while enabling continued investment in key growth areas. We see in Electronics excellent long-term growth prospects. Structural growth drivers such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and Internet of Things, all demand more material solution and cutting edge innovation for the next generation of chips. Our Semiconductor Materials business delivered two quarters of sequential growth in the second half of 2023.\nWe have also seen the first positive signals in the market. Chips inventories are being reduced, chip pricing is recovering, and we observed an early cycle recovery in leading-edge memory and logic chips. We anticipate sequential quarterly growth across 2024 with H2 expected stronger than H1.\nTo sum up, 2023 was also challenging for Electronics due to the prolonged down cycle in the semiconductor market. However, we are convinced that we will emerge stronger from this transitional year.\nAnd with that, let me hand it over to Helene for a more detailed review of our financials.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and a warm welcome also from my side.\nOn Slide 13 for an overview of our key figures for 2023. On a reported basis, group net sales declined by 5.6% to [ EUR 20.99 billion ] EBITDA pre was down [ 14.2% ] to EUR 5.88 billion and EPS pre declined by 15.5% to EUR 8.49 per share. The group EBITDA pre margin came in at 28%, which represents a decrease of 280 basis points versus last year's EBITDA pre margin, which ended at 30.8%.\nOperating cash flow declined by 11.2% to EUR 3.78 billion, which is down from EUR 4.26 billion last year and was hence favorable versus EBITDA pre, mainly due to lower net working capital. Trade receivables declined and inventories have remained stable. Overall, we were able to further reduce our net debt by more than EUR 800 million in 2023 to around EUR 7.5 billion.\nSo with that, moving on to Slide 14 for a summary of our performance of the business sector. Now Belen already walked you through the highlights, so let me just add the following.\nHealthcare contributed positively to organic sales growth, which was more than offset by organic sales declines, especially in Life Science, but also in Electronics. The organic EBITDA pre decline was mainly driven by Life Science, electronics having added to the development. And on top of this, FX was a headwind for all three business sectors. However, most pronounced in Healthcare.\nNow let me also briefly comment on our reported results. So with that, I'm now on Slide 15. EBIT was down by 19.3% year-on-year. This was above the decline in EBITDA pre, mainly due to the high level of D&A and restructuring [indiscernible] The financial results improved [indiscernible], which was mainly driven by higher yields [indiscernible]. The effective tax rate came in at 18.7%, which is actually below our guidance range of 21% to 23%. This was driven by a nonrecurring deferred tax benefit, which occurred in quarter 4.\nWe expect our effective tax rate to remain in the guidance corridor going forward, we are actually keeping our guidance range unchanged, which is 21% to 23%. Reported EPS came in at EUR 6.49 in '23, which represents a decline of 15.2% year-on-year.\nSo with that, let's now take a closer look at Q4. Before I go into the details by business sector, let me briefly share some headline figures for the group. You will find these in the appendix of the presentation. Organically, group net sales decreased by 1.7% in Q4. EBITDA pre was down by 13.7%. The disproportionate decline of EBITDA pre was mainly driven by the margin decline in Life Science. FX headwinds had an effect of minus 6% on group sales and minus 6.5% on group EBITDA pre.\nSo with that, let's take a closer look at our three business sectors, and I'm starting with Life Science, which you'll find on Slide [indiscernible]. Sales in the Life Science core business were down 4% organically in Q4, while COVID-related sales continued to decline and had an additional dampening effect. Overall, sales in Life Science declined organically by 9.7% in the fourth quarter.\nSo looking at Process Solutions first, the core business decreased by 11% organically in quarter 4, a slight improvement from the minus 15% in quarter 3, further amplified by the COVID-related decline of 8%. The pronounced decline in the core business was mainly driven by customer destocking. Overall, we would describe the situation in Process Solutions as hoovering around the trough.\nNow taking a closer look at Science & Lab solution. Sales were down 2.1% organically, including an immaterial COVID headwind. Demand from pharma companies has remained soft in North America. And the softness in China has identified -- intensified, sorry, in Q3 with the new anticorruption campaign having added [indiscernible]. And on top of that, the SAP migration impacted our Science & Lab Solutions business by a residual low to mid-double-digit euro million amount in Q4.\nTurning to our third business, Life Science Services. Sales in the core were up 14% organically, driven by positive project phasing in CDMO. Amid a significant drop off in COVID-related sales, as expected, sales in total were down 8% organically. EBITDA pre declined 26% organically in the fourth quarter, mainly due to lower volumes and negative mix effects.\nAnd with that, let's move to Healthcare on Slide 17. Healthcare delivered organic sales growth of 9.2% in Q4. Wave 1 launches grew 17% organically. And additionally, the established portfolio was up 7% organically. By franchise, oncology was a star performer yet again at plus 18% organically, which was mainly driven by Bavencio, which is up 17%, Erbitux, which grew 16% organically on a strong performance in China.\nFertility also performed strongly again at plus 14% organic sales growth. Our N&I franchise was stable in Q4. Organic EBITDA pre was up 9.6% in the fourth quarter, which is slightly above the organic increase [indiscernible] EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 565 million, resulting in a margin of 27.8%. This is 340 basis points below Q4 '22 and also 540 basis points below the margin in Q3 '23.\nWith that in mind, please remember that the EBITDA pre margin in Q4 '23 was impacted by a provision for [indiscernible] of the evobrutinib clinical trial program, which was around EUR 95 million, while FX also materialized a significant headwind on EBITDA pre with an effect of minus 20.4%. Here, the largest contribution comes from the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, where the December rate was applied for a full revaluation within Q4. Besides that, also the U.S. dollar and the Asian currencies had a pronounced effect on our EBITDA pre.\nSo let's move to Electronics on Slide 18. Sales were organically down by 3.2% in Q4, while FX had a negative effect of minus 5%. Semiconductor Solutions were down 3% organically, however, outperforming the market yet again. Sequentially, they were up 8% with both DS&S and semi materials having contributed to that development. Sales in Display Solutions declined 4% organically due to price pressure in liquid crystals. Surface Solutions fell organically by 6% on a softer sales in industrial [indiscernible] EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 206 million, resulting in a margin of 21.8%, down from 30.1% in Q4 of last year. And organically, EBITDA pre declined minus 25.3% due to unfavorable mix effects and lower sales in semiconductor [indiscernible] as well as negative pricing in liquid crystals. FX was also a stronger headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales, having had a minus 6.8% impact.\nSo before handing back to Belen, let me also briefly comment on our balance sheet on Slide 19. Our balance sheet is basically stable compared to the end of December 2022. On the asset side, cash and cash equivalents [indiscernible] to EUR 2 billion from EUR 1.9 billion at the end of December 2022. Inventories were stable, while receivables decreased to EUR 4 billion from EUR 4.1 billion of the previous year. Property, plant and equipment increased driven by our investments. And last, intangible assets decreased due to amortization as well as FX.\nNow looking to the liability side. Financial debt decreased by around EUR 500 million due to net repayment and pension provisions were up as a result of interest rate changes. Net equity increased, thanks to growth and profit after tax, partially offset, however, by negative FX effects. And as a result, our equity ratio strengthened further from 54% to 55%.\nAnd with that, let me hand back to Belen.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Helene. Please go with me to Slide #21 where as every quarter, I'd like to provide a very brief progress update on our sustainability efforts. As part of our nonfinancial statements in the annual report that we have published this morning, you may have seen already some of the targets at some of the sustainability targets and the progress we have made against those targets. In addition to our focus area of human progress, supply chain management and diversity, we also report on our environmental targets as regards emissions, green energy, water and waste.\nAnd I am pleased to report that we have overachieved our targets to reduce the negative impact of our water use and waste production well ahead of schedule. We managed a 24.8% reduction in our water intensity score in 2023 versus a targeted reduction of 10% by 2025. Our waste score was reduced by 11.5% in 2023 versus the base year 2016 compared with our goal to achieve a 5% reduction. So we have actually delivered twice as much reduction as expected. For this reason, we have decided to replace these targets with new ambitions and please move to Slide 22 for more details.\nAs a new environmental target for water, we are introducing the water intake ratio with the goal to reduce our water intake per revenues by 50% by 2030 versus the base year of 2020. On the waste metric, we now are also emphasizing the recycling component and are introducing the circularity rate with the goal of achieving a circularity rate of 70% by 2030. So overall, we made significant progress in 2023 and, of course, remain strongly committed to our sustainability ambitions.\nNow moving into the outlook and guidance. Please move into Slide 24. Let me conclude the call with the guidance for 2024. As always, at this time of the year, we are providing qualitative targets. This will be followed by a quantification of these targets as part of our Q1 reporting in May. Overall, we confirm our return to organic growth in 2024. For group net sales, we forecast a slight to moderate organic growth. We no longer provide guidance excluding the effect of COVID headwinds. For group EBITDA pre, we also forecast a range from a slight to moderate organic growth. While for sales, we expect adverse currency effects of between 0 and minus 3%, we anticipate a slightly more [ pronounced versus currency ] effect on EBITDA pre of minus 1% to minus 4%.\nIn the following slide, Slide #25, you will find additional color by business sector. We expect in 2024 different growth dynamics across our three business sectors. These dynamics depend on the speed of recovery of our end markets and our assumptions on other critical business levers that we can discuss during the Q&A.\nFor Life Science, we anticipate a slight organic decline to slight organic growth and EBITDA pre [indiscernible] from a moderate organic decline to a slight organic growth. And remember, while we no longer provide guidance excluding the effect of COVID headwinds, we expect COVID-related sales to fall to negligible levels in 2024, down from around EUR 250 million in 2023. This means that COVID-related sales will still be a headwind in 2024 of around 2.5 percentage points year-on-year for Life Science. We expect a gradual recovery of Life Science during 2024 with -- the second half of the year anticipated to come in stronger than the first half. Don't forget, H1 '24 compares against a very high base, especially in Process Solutions as the full impact of the customer restocking only became visible to us during Q2 '23. Therefore, we anticipate H1 to decline year-on-year.\nMoving into Healthcare. We guide for moderate to solid organic sales growth and low teens organic EBITDA pre growth. We expect organic sales growth to be mainly driven by Mavenclad supported by our oncology franchise as well as by our cardio metabolic and endocrinology product portfolio.\nWhy do we expect a stronger organic growth on EBITDA pre than on sales for Healthcare? First of all, the evobrutinib termination provision of EUR 95 million will not repeat. Further, there will be no [ prelaunched ] cost for evobrutinib as in 2023. And as we already mentioned before, the impact on EBITDA pre of the loss of evobrutinib was turning positive in 2024 due to the significant prelaunch costs that we have foreseen.\nAnd also remember, we will benefit from the first full year of Bavencio profit repatriation versus only 6 months in 2023.\nFor the Electronics business sector, we anticipate an about a stable organic sales development to moderate organic growth and for EBITDA pre, we guide for a moderate organic decline to moderate organic growth. Please note that our guidance is based on a semi market inflection in early H2 2024.\nAnd with this, we will be all very happy to start the question-and-answer session. Thank you.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nFirst question, please. Thank you very much.",

[Operator Instructions] I am now handing over to Constantin Fest, Head of Investor Relations. He will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sharon. Dear, ladies and gentlemen, a very warm welcome to this Merck Q3 2023 Results Call. My name is Constantin Fest, I'm the Head of Investor Relations here at Merck. And I'm delighted to have here today with me Belen Garijo, Group CEO as well as Helene von Roeder, Group CFO. Also joining me for the Q&A part of this call are Matthias Heinzel, CEO, Life Science; Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; as well as Kai Beckmann, CEO Electronics. In the first few minutes of this call, we will guide you through the key slides of this presentation, which will then be followed by Q&A. With this, I'd like to directly hand over to Belen to start the presentation. Over to you, Belen.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Constantin, and welcome, everybody, to our Q3 earnings call. I'm going to start on Slide #5. Q3 has again shown the benefits of our multi-industry business model with the temporary challenges having continued, of course, to affect some of our business sectors, especially in Life Science during this transitional year. Organically, group sales were down 4% and an EBITDA pre declined by 13%, mainly reflecting the temporary challenges affecting Life Science. The strong performance of healthcare partially compensated for life science and for electronics. .\nLooking at Q3, the currency has become more of a headwind versus previous quarter, and this was as expected. And this paired with a very minor portfolio effect lead to reported sales decreasing by 11% and totaling EUR 5.2 billion. FX had a similar dilutive effect on EBITDA as on sales. Accordingly, reported EBITDA pre of EUR 1.4 billion was down by 20%. EPS free of 2.07% was down 23% year-on-year. Healthcare has been once again the best performer, delivering 7% organic sales growth, and this is driven by our Wave 1 product launches in particular, Bavencio and also related to the growth of the Fertility franchise.\nOur oncology franchise performed strongly, also supported by [indiscernible] in Q3. Life Science registered an 8% decline in the core business, mainly in relation to the stocking in process solutions for which we saw the trough in Q3 as we communicated before. This was a need a softer market environment in China and a major SAP migration project, which turned out to be complex, affecting mainly SLS. Against the backdrop of a continuing decline in the COVID-19 business, total sales in Life Science were down 13% organically in Q3. This decline also had a negative effect on the EBITDA pre margin in Life Science and consequently, that of the group. In electronics, display solutions increased by 12% organically in relation to a recovery in liquid crystals materials volumes against easy comparables in 2022, partially offsetting a decline in Semiconductor Solutions, which decreased by 9% organically, continuously outperforming the growth of the semiconductor market.\nOverall, organic sales were down 4% in Electronics in the quarter. While the temporary challenges for Life Science and electronics persisted in Q3, Healthcare performed very strongly. Therefore, our multi-industry business model continues to demonstrate resilience through this transitional year 2023. And therefore, please to say that we are living at our absolute sales and earnings target corridors for 2023 unchanged using the full flexibility of our guidance. We have added more color in order to reflect the developments in the business sectors and to provide more transparency to all of you as we are heading towards the end of the year. We continue to expect net sales in a range of EUR 20.5 billion to EUR 21.9 billion, trending slightly below the midpoint. We are also leaving our guidance ranges for EBITDA pre of EUR 5.8 billion to EUR 6.4 billion and for EPS of EUR 8.25 to EUR 9.35 unchanged.\nOn our target earning corridors, we expect to trend in the lower half of the range, and I will provide more details on our assumptions later in the presentation. Turning to Slide #6 for an overview of our performance by business sectors, you can see that healthcare contributed strongly to the organic development of sales and healthcare was able to partially offset the decline that we have seen in life sciences and electronics. Our key growth engines in the quarter were our oncology franchise, including both Bavencio and Erbitux and the fertility franchise within our healthcare business sectors, but also display solutions within electronics, which benefited from a volume recovery in liquid crystal materials. Taking a closer look at the business sectors, healthcare showed strong organic growth of 7%, mainly driven by 13% growth from Wave 1 launches. In particular, Bavencio, which was up by 22%. From a franchise perspective, oncology was the highlight with organic growth of almost 18% driven by Bavencio, paired with a strong performance of Erbitux, particularly in China. That was followed by fertility with organic growth of 14%.\nLife Science was down 8% in the core business in Q3 on the pronounced destocking in Process Solutions, media softer market environment in China and the major SAP migration project, as I mentioned before, mainly affecting science and lab solutions. As expected, COVID sales continued to be highly dilutive to our growth and were significantly down both year-on-year and sequentially. This resulted in sales decreasing 13% organically in Life Science in Q3. On China, I would like to say that our exposure is lower than that of our major life science peers. In Electronics, our semi business continues to outperform a declining market as the business environment continued to be challenging in Q3 as expected, our semiconductor sales declined by 9% organically in Q3. The Display Solutions performed strongly with organic growth of 12%, thanks to a recovery of volumes in liquid Pistol materials, partially compensating for the performance of semiconductor solutions in Q3.\nOverall, sales in electronics declined by 4% organically in Q3. FX served as a headwind across the board on sales with the strongest effect on healthcare and on electronics. Regarding earnings, EBITDA pre came in at EUR 1.45 billion, down organically by 13%. And this was mainly due to Life Science, where the organic EBITDA pre was down by 32% in Q3 on underutilization and associated idle costs resulting from lower volumes in Process Solutions. EBITDA pre in healthcare was up strongly again at 17% organically versus last year in Q3, mainly driven by a very good cost conciseness, so lower SG&A which also reflects the new [indiscernible] deal structured with Pfizer as well as lower R&D costs due to our focused leadership approach. EBITDA pre in electronics was down 18% organically in Q3, mainly reflecting lower volumes in semiconductor materials during the downturn in the semiconductors industry having resulted as well in underutilization and associated idle costs, as we mentioned for Life Science. The currency was a slightly lower headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales for the group. Looking at the business sectors, FX was more of a headwind on EBITDA pre for self-care and electronics with less impact on Life Science. And this was balanced by hedging gains in our corporate and other segments.\nMoving to the regional view on Slide #7. In Q2, I'm sorry, our 3 larger regions were down organically. North America declined by 8.7%, while Europe was down 6.8% organically, both mainly in relation to the drop in Life Science sales. APAC was down by 2.6% organically in Q3 mainly due to electronics, but also Life Science. Overall, Q3 once again demonstrated the benefits of our globally diversified business setup with the geographical diversification, adding to our resilience of our 2 smallest regions, LatAm grew strongly at 21% organically mainly thanks to healthcare with Middle East and Africa declining slightly by minus 1%, mainly due to Life Science. And with this, I'm going to hand it over to Helene for additional details on our Q3 financial results.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nSo thank you very much, Belen, and also a warm welcome from my side. I am now on Slide 9 for an overview of our key figures for the third quarter. Our sales declined organically in Q3 by 4.1%, thereby continuing to show resilience in a challenging business environment, thanks to our multi-industry business model. Taking into account currency headwinds of minus 6.8% as well as a minor portfolio effect, net sales declined by 10.9% to EUR 5.173 billion in Q3. EBITDA pre was down by 20.2% to EUR 1.446 billion with the FX headwind of minus 6.6%, slightly less pronounced than for sales. EPS pre declined by 22.8% to EUR 2.07. Operating cash flow came in at EUR 1.255 billion, which represents a decrease of 19.1% over Q3 '22, mainly driven by the decline in EBITDA pre. .\nNet financial debt increased slightly by 1.2% to EUR 8.426 billion at the end of Q3. However, keep in mind that this compares with a net debt of increase of about EUR 1 billion at the end of Q2 '23. This improvement in net debt during Q3 was driven by operating cash flow generation and lower investing cash flow. We, as management, are monitoring very closely the quarter-on-quarter performance of the group, and you will find more details in the appendix of this presentation. So let me also briefly comment on our reported results. So I'm now on Slide 10.\nEBIT was down by 20.3% in Q3. In absolute terms, the decrease was EUR 251 million, hence, lower than the decline of EUR 365 million in EBITDA pre. This was mainly due to lower D&A and higher adjustments on EBIT in Q3 '22. The decline in EBITDA and therefore also EBIT was mainly driven by the EBITDA pre decline in Life Science. And this in turn was driven in particular by the impact of destocking and process solutions. The financial result was minus EUR 46 million in Q3 versus minus EUR 47 million in Q3 of last year. You may recall from Q3 '22, that we had an improved financial results driven primarily by the buyback of our hybrid bonds. The effective tax rate came in at 21% at the lower end of our guidance range and below the 22% in Q3 last year.\nIn fact, the effective tax rate has been at 21% year-to-date, pointing to the low end of our guidance range. Now allow me to say a few words on the global minimum taxation initiative aligning to the OECD model rules, which is the so-called pillar [indiscernible]. It will be applicable for a group, and we've already started comprehensive actions in this regard to fulfill the necessary reporting obligations. If we assume that the draft legislation will be adopted until year-end, we currently estimate an additional Pillar 2 tax expense for 2024, which would increase our effective tax rate by roughly 1 percentage point.\nAs Merck Group currently meets bottom end of our tax rate guidance of 21% to 23%, we do not expect an adjustment of the tax rate guidance for '24 from today's perspective. Due to the improved effective tax rate, net income was only down 20% and EPS was down 19.8%, slightly less than the decline in EBIT.\nSo that said, let's move on to the review by business sector, starting with Life Science on Page 11. Sales in the Life Science core business were down 8% organically in Q3, while COVID related sales continued to decline and had a dampening effect of minus 5%. Accordingly, the sales in Life Science declined organically by 13.2% in Q3. From a portfolio perspective, all 3 businesses in Life Science, which are process solutions, life Science Services and Science and Lab Solutions were down organically. So let's look at Process Solutions first. The core business decreased by 15% organically in Q3 from a 7% decline in Q2. This is further amplified by the COVID-related decline of 8%. From our perspective today, we see this as a trough quarter for Process Solutions, as we already shared with you in early August. The pronounced decline in the core business was mainly driven by destocking. Order intake continued to decline year-on-year in Q3, but on a meaningfully reduced scale compared with Q2, book-to-bill improved slightly. We reiterate our view of an observed inflection point for order intake in mid-Q4 '23 to Q1 '24 and an inflection point for sales, hence in H1 '24.\nSo with that, let's turn to Life Science Services. Sales in the core were up 12% organically, in line with our midterm growth ambitions. Amid a significant drop off in COVID-related sales, as expected, sales were down minus 10% organically. Now with that, let's take a closer look at Science & Lab Solutions. Sales were down 4% organically in the core declining from the flat performance observed in Q2. This was mainly driven by softer demand from pharma companies in North America as well as softness in China in Q3. In addition, a major SAP migration project temporarily affected our production and distribution capabilities in particularly in North America. The SAP migration impacted our Science & Lab Solutions business by a mid-double-digit euro million amount in Q3. Excluding this effect, the performance of Science and Lab Solutions in the core would have been similar to Q2. I Overall, signs and Lab Solutions declined by 5% organically, including a small 1% core headwind. EBITDA pre was down 31.5% organically in Q3 and the margin decreased from a still high level of 36.4% in Q3 last year to now 28.1% in Q3 this year.\nThe margin decline reflects lower volumes, mainly due to lower COVID sales and destocking and process solutions as well as negative mix effects. So if we now take a look at the remainder of '23, I would like to make 2 comments. First, you heard us mentioning the trough and Process Solutions in Q3 due to the pronounced destocking and our previously communicated expected time lines for an inflection point in order intake in Process Solutions, both of which we confirm.\nSecondly, we expect our sales in science and lab solutions to be impacted by a residual low to mid-double-digit euro million amount from the SAP migration in Q4. And with that, let's now move to Healthcare on Slide 12.\nHealthcare delivered organic sales growth of 7.4% in Q3, in line with the guidance range from early August. Wave 1 launches grew 13% organically, the established portfolio was up 6.1% organically. Now let's look at this by franchise. Oncology was the star performer at 18% plus organically, which was mainly driven by Bavencio, up 22% and supported by Erbitux, which grew 13% organically on strong performance in China, driven by post COVID catch-up effect and the National Reimbursement Drug List expansion. At the end of March, we announced that we would regain exclusive worldwide rights for Bavencio and have now taken full control of global commercialization effective June 30.\nThe Fertility performed strongly again plus at plus 14% organic sales growth. Competitors stock-outs continued in Q3, driving stronger performance in various regions. This was paired with a strong underlying performance. Our N&I franchise was down 12% organically in Q3. MAb and Clad was up 3% organically. The continued uptake in the U.S. was partially offset by pricing pressures and increasing competitive intensity in Europe. Rebuilds declined by 25% against high comps of last year, which benefited from positive one-off channel dynamics. So regarding our pipeline. For enpatoran, we have reached an important milestone by completing a futility analysis in Willow, our Phase II program in systemic and cutaneous lupus. The study will continue without modification and the final results shall be available in late '24, early '25. So evoprutinib, we have shown at ACTRIMS 23 very compelling Phase II open-label extension data. With 9 out of 10 patients on evoprutinib treatment having no evidence of clinical worsening in year 5. Our Phase III RMS program will read out in Q4 as planned. For even pant, the next step is the interim analysis and trialing likely to take place in the first few months of '24.\nAnd then finally, last week, we announced a strategic collaboration with Henry to develop, manufacture and commercialize a next-gen selective PARP 1 inhibitor, which bolsters our DNA damage response portfolio via external innovation. So regarding earnings, EBITDA free amounted to EUR 685 million, resulting in a strong margin of 33.2%. Organic EBITDA pre was up 17.2%, driven by operating leverage and in general, good cost control of operating expenses. However, FX was a significant headwind of minus 20.8% on EBITDA in Q3, significantly higher than the 8.5% on sales. This was mainly due to the decline in value of the U.S. dollar and Asian currencies, which had a pronounced effect on our EBITDA pre.\nOn top of this, emerging market currencies added to the headwinds. So looking to 2023, we generally expect the sales momentum to prevail for our Wave 1 launches. Q3 was again helped by continued competitor stock-out, which started emerging in Q4 last year. From our current perspective, we do not expect a meaningful change in the situation for the remainder of '23. Regarding the EBITDA pre-margin bear in mind that launch preparation cost for evoprutinib will start to kick in Q4. And on income from active portfolio management, we expect no significant contribution as well.\nSo I will continue with Electronics on Slide 13. Sales were down organically by 4% in Q3 with FX having becoming a significant headwind in Q3 at minus 7.9%. We had a small positive portfolio effect of 0.3% from the acquisition of Korea-based Macao. The Semiconductor Solutions was down 9% organically in a difficult environment, but performed slightly better than the market. Display Solutions was up 12% organically with a partial recovery in liquid crystals driven by volume against low comps. Surface Solutions was up 3% organically, mainly due to strong growth in cosmetics and met weak demand for automotive coatings. EBITDA premounted to EUR 208 million, implying a margin of 22.7%, down from the 29.1% in Q3 of last year. Organically, EBITDA pre declined by 17.8%, and FX was a stronger headwind on EBITDA than on sales with a negative effect of 12.6% in Q3.\nThe EBITDA pre margin reflects idle costs caused by lower volumes, negative mix effect and inflationary pressures, mirroring in particular down cycle in semiconductor. Ramp-up costs for new sites and FX movements also affected the EBITDA pre margin. As a reminder, the EBITDA pre margin in Q2 '23 included a mid-double-digit million amount from the patent agreement with UDC. Excluding this effect, the EBITDA pre margin in Q3 was actually comparable to Q2. So that said, let me also briefly comment on Q4. Looking at semiconductor solutions, we continue to expect an equally difficult market in Q4 compared to Q3. MSI expectations for '23 now stand down by a mid-teens amount, and we continue to see the market downturn in semiconductors extending into '24.\nOn display solutions, please note, panel makers have been adjusting down utilization in the first weeks of Q4, and seasonally Q4 tends to be a lower following Q3 Christmas demand. The recovery in liquid crystal volumes will be pushed into '24 and price pressure does continue. This brings me to EBITDA pre. In order to be ready for the end of the down cycle, we have ramped up new sites, which started to impact the EBITDA pre margin in Q3. This also creates idle costs in Q4. All other factors having an impact on our EBITDA pre margin in Q3 will hence also remain in Q2.\nSo before handing back to Belen, let me also comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. As you can see on Slide 14, our balance sheet total is above the level at the end of December 22. The main driver behind this development was actually business growth. On the asset side, inventories increased in all 3 business sectors, driven by lower sales volumes in life science and electronics and by increased safety stocks in health care. Receivables were slightly up. and intangible assets decreased during FX and amortization effect. Other assets increased due to short-term investments. With cash and cash equivalents having gone up proportionally to the increase in financial debt.\nLet's look at the liability side. Provisions for employee benefits are lower, driven by actual gains due to higher interest rates. Financial debt increased, however, more than offset by a decline in other liabilities, which was affected by the dividend payment in Q2, and net equity increased, thanks to higher retail earnings. The equity ratio improved to 57% from 54% compared to December '22. So with that, turning to cash flow on Slide 15. Operating cash flow came in at EUR 1.255 billion and was down 19% with Q3 of [indiscernible]. This was mainly due to the decline in profit after tax changes in provisions and changes in other assets and liabilities, in turn, mainly due to lower provisions for personnel expenses. Working capital outflow in Q3 was reduced compared with Q3 of last year. While CapEx increased in line with our midterm growth ambitions, investing cash flow was lower compared to Q3 of the year earlier period. This was mainly due to increased proceeds from the disposals of other financial assets, while at the same time, purchases of financial assets decreased.\nAnd last, but not least, the difference in financing cash flow can be explained mainly by the repayment of bank liabilities in Q3 of last year. And with that, let me hand back to Belen for an update on ESG as well as the guidance.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Helene. So let me give you a snapshot on the progress we continue to make in sustainability, this time focused on our energy management. I am on Slide #17. So as discussed with many of you in prior occasions, we continuously stepped up our sustainability efforts and I'm pleased to report that we continue to make good progress. Here, you have some of the achievements in increasing the sourcing of electricity from renewable sources in order to further improve our share of renewable energy consumption. Just to remind you once again, we are aiming to gain 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030 on our way to climate neutrality in 2040. .\nThis year, we have taken important steps towards this ambition. We signed a 16-year virtual power purchase agreement for a solar park in Texas, and as announced just last week, a 10-year virtual power purchase agreement for a wind and solar park in Spain. These agreements add to the BPPA from 2021 for wind park in Texas. In order to give you some additional color on what this means for Merck, once these virtual power price agreements are up and running by '25, we will be able to increase our consumption of purchased electricity from renewable sources to 100% in the European Union and Switzerland, 90% in the U.S. and 70% globally based on our current energy consumption.\nWith this, let's move now into our guidance on Page #19. We leave our full year 2023 guidance corridor for the group unchanged, as I already anticipated during the introduction and continue to expect group net sales in a range of EUR 20.5 billion to EUR 21.9 billion. EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 5.8 billion to EUR 6.4 billion and EPS in a range of EUR 8.25 to EUR 9.35.\nAs we mentioned at our Capital Markets Day, this guidance ranges from early August included opportunities and challenges. In early August, the balance was very much in the middle. Now the scale is tilting more towards the challenges. The stocking in Process Solutions amid continued cautious spending behavior by pharma companies in combination with the disruption cost -- with the temporary disruption cost by our SAP migration tilts the scale more towards challenges in life science, specifically, this cautious spending behavior is now also more visible in China and is impacting our Science and Lab Solutions business in particular because the percentage of our business in China in -- within life science is higher for SLS.\nThe same holds true for electronics where mainly the extent of the down cycle in the semiconductor market is tilt in the scale also towards the challenges side. Accordingly, we have become more precise and see the group net sales trending slightly below the midpoint. We expect organic net sales growth for the group to trend towards the lower end of the range, both for group sales overall and also ex-COVID. FX is during Q3 versus the guidance we gave with Q2 in early August, and we expect currencies trending in the upper half of the corridors for net sales and EBITDA brief from today's perspective. We see EBITDA pre trending towards the lower half of the EUR 5.8 billion to EUR 6.4 billion range with the organic EBITDA predevelopment at around the bottom end of the range.\nEPS pre, we see trending towards the lower half of the range. In summary, I'm happy to say that we confirm our guidance ranges in net sales, EBITDA and EPS pre supported by our multi-industry business model. For some additional color by business sector that I'm sure we will further discuss during the Q&A. Please move to Page #20. We confirm our guidance ranges for Life Science and expect net sales between EUR 9.1 billion and EUR 9.95 billion. Due to the challenges I already mentioned to you on the slide before, we are trending to the lower half of the absolute corridor with the organic development trending towards the low end. On FX, we saw a slight easing during Q3 versus our guidance assumptions with currency pointing towards the top end of the respective guidance range for Life Science, which is, by the way, also the case for electronics.\nWe reiterate our expectation for COVID-related sales of around EUR 250 million in 2023 -- EUR 600 million less than in 2024 therefore, expecting this to be dilutive to growth in 2023, obviously. On EBITDA pre for Life Science, we also anticipate being in the lower half of the absolute guidance corridor with the organic development trending around the lower end of the range. For healthcare, we leave our guidance ranges unchanged on both sales and EBITDA pre, guiding for sales of between EUR 7.75 billion and EUR 8.3 billion and EBITDA of between EUR 2.45 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. For Healthcare, the scale tilts towards the opportunity side with a number of drivers continuing to play in our favor. These include the strong performance of our Wave 1 launches, also complemented by an upside from these competitor shortages in our fertility and endocrinology portfolio.\nIn addition, our EBITDA pre now benefits from regaining the exclusive worldwide rights to Bavencio, which became effective in June 30 of this year. By contrast, cost for the launch preparation for evobrutinib will start kicking in, in Q4. With the foresee sales in healthcare trending slightly above the midpoint of the absolute corridor and towards the upper end of the range in organic terms. EBITDA pre is trending towards the top end of the absolute corridor and is trending towards the upper end of the range organically.\nFor electronics, we continue to guide for net sales of between EUR 3.5 billion and EUR 3.8 billion and for an EBITDA pre of between EUR 870 million and EUR 980 million. We are trending around the midpoint of the absolute range for net sales and towards the low end on an organic basis, reflecting support from projects and equipment in the DS&S business as well as a pronounced downturn in the semiconductor materials market, which is very well known to you. On EBITDA pre for electronics, we have also become more precise and see the EBITDA pre trending in the lower half of the absolute range, slightly below the lower end of the guidance band on an organic basis and meet negative mix effects due to the semiconductor market challenges. For the group as a whole, let me summarize it again. I'm very pleased to confirm our guidance plan for net sales, EBITDA pre and EPS pre once again illustrating the resilience of our multi-industry business model. And with this, I'm going to stop it here and open for your questions. Thank you very much.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Belen. Sharon first question, please. .",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to Constantin Fest, Head of Investor Relations, who will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Sharon. A very warm welcome to this Merck Q2 2023 Results Call. My name is Constantin Fest, I'm Head of Investor Relations here at Merck. I'm delighted to be joined today by Belén Garijo, CEO of the group; as well as Helene von Roeder, Group CFO. Also for the Q&A part of this call will be joined by Matthias Heinzel, CEO of Life Science; Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; and Kai Beckmann, CEO of Electronics.\nIn the next couple of minutes, we'd like to run you through the key slides of the presentation, and after that, we'll have our Q&A. Also note that we've reserved about roughly 1 hour for this conference call as some of us will have to catch a plane due to road shows. With this, I'd like to now hand over to Belén to kick it off.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Constantin, and very pleased to welcome everybody to our second quarter earnings call, and please stay on Slide #5 for the highlights. So first of all, Q2 has once again demonstrated the resilient nature of our multi-industry business model, even as the challenges have increased for some of our business and more specifically for Life Science and to a certain extent for Electronics in relation to semiconductors.\nBefore I start with the highlights of the please allow me to welcome Helene von Roeder to her first earnings call as the Chief Financial Officer of Merck. Now back to our Q2 earnings and the highlights. One, organically, group revenues were down by 1% and EBITDA pre declined by 7%. Currency has now become a true headwind. This was expected. And this currency impact -- negative impact paired with a minor portfolio effect led to reported sales decreasing by 5%, totaling EUR 5.3 billion.\nFX have more diluted effect on EBITDA pre on sales. Accordingly, reported EBITDA pre of EUR 1.6 billion was down 13% versus last year. EPS pre of EUR 2.20 was down 17% year-on-year. Healthcare was the best performer with 12% organic sales growth, and that was driven by Mavenclad, Bavencio and our Fertility franchise. Mavenclad is on its way to reach blockbuster status in 2023. Life Science showed a 4% decline in the core business, and this was mainly due to a more pronounced the stocking in Process Solutions, which we have now [Audio Gap] to see among our smaller and regional customers.\nAmid the continuing decline in the COVID-19 business, total sales in Life Science were now down 9%. That's organic in Q2. This decline also had a negative effect on the EBITDA pre margin in Life Science, and consequently, they one of the group. In Electronics, Semiconductor Solutions decreased 5% organically, again outperforming a declining market, which, as expected, became more challenging also in the second quarter.\nIn combination with the continued decline in Display Solutions, organic sales were down by 6%. While the business environment for Life Science and Electronics came under increasing pressure, Healthcare was the star performer of the quarter and they delivered very strong growth. I am therefore pleased to say that our multi-industry business model continues to demonstrate resilience through the transitional year 2023.\nIn order to reflect the development in the business sectors and to a lesser extent, the adverse currency movements, we are adjusting our 2023 guidance. Now expecting net sales in a range of EUR 20.5 billion to EUR 21.9 billion, EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 5.8 billion to EUR 6.4 billion and EPS pre in a range of EUR 8.25 to EUR 9.35, thereby lowering the ranges provided with our Q1 results in May.\nI would, nevertheless, like to highlight that the upper half of the guidance ranges still fall within our previous And more details on the assumptions will be shared at the end of the presentation. Moving into Slide #6, we will have -- where we show an overview of our performance by business sectors. And as you can see, and we already mentioned, Healthcare was the strongest contributor to the organic sales development in Q2 and largely offset the declines in Life science and Electronics.\nOur key growth engines in the quarter were our new product launches as well as the Fertility franchise within our Healthcare business sector. In fact, Healthcare showed excellent organic growth of 12% in a challenging operating environment. And this was mainly driven by almost 30% growth from recent launches with Bavencio up 27% and Mavenclad up by 28% in Q2. Our established portfolio means CM&E and Erbitux, also contributed with an organic sales performance of plus 8%.\nFrom a franchise perspective, Fertility was the highlight, with organic growth of almost 25%, amplified by a competitor followed by Oncology with an organic growth of close to 18%. Life Science was down 4% in the core business in Q2, on this more pronounced destocking in Process Solutions. As expected, COVID sales continued to be dilutive to growth and were significantly down both year-on-year and sequentially.\nThis resulted in sales decreasing by 9% organically in Life Science in the second quarter. As some of you may have noticed already, and just to put the quarterly performance of Life Science into perspective regardless of any influence of the COVID period, if we would look at the same period in 2019, the year before the corona pandemic started, our Life Science business has shown an annualized high single-digit organic growth rate, despite all the recent market challenges.\nIn Electronics, our Semi business continued to outperform in a declining market. As the market became more challenging in Q2, as we expected, our Semi sales declined by 5% organically in the quarter. This paired with a significant decline in Display Solutions, although not as pronounced as the one we saw in Q1. This led to an overall sales decline for Electronics of 6% organically in Q2.\nA small portfolio effects in Electronics contributed marginally to sales growth for the group. Currency served as a true headwind across the board on sales with the strongest negative effect on Healthcare. Regarding earnings, EBITDA pre came at EUR 1.55 billion, down organically by 7%, which was mainly driven by Life Science where organic EBITDA pre was down by minus 26% in Q2 on loss volumes in Process Solutions and negative mix effects in the core and, of course, also due to lower COVID sales.\nEBITDA pre in Healthcare was up strongly by more than 30% organically in Q2, boosted by excellent sales growth, lower gross profit comps and a small upside from portfolio management with no impact of the Bavencio repatriation at all in the EBITDA pre of Healthcare in Q1. EBITDA pre in Electronics was down 5% in Q2, and that was supported by the patent and cooperation agreement with Universal Display Corporation that Kai may detail later on.\nImportantly, this gives us access to key intellectual property that expands our materials portfolio in OLED, supporting our midterm growth. While this agreement was part of our full year guidance in Electronics, the exact timing and the accounting effect during 2023 is difficult to predict. And as I mentioned already, Kai may give you further color on this later on in the Q&A.\nCurrency was a stronger headwind on EBITDA pre than on sales, and this is due to emerging market currency and Asian currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen.\nMoving into the regional view on Slide #7. What we see is that in Q2, our 3 larger regions were down organically. North America declined by 3.2%, and this was due to the share drop in Life Science sales, while Europe was down 1.5% organically, and this was mainly due to Process Solutions. APAC was down 2.6% organically in Q2, mainly due to Electronics.\nOverall, second quarter demonstrates, once again, the advantages of our globally diversified business setup combined with the right mix of business -- or combining, better say, the right mix of business sectors, the regionalized footprint mitigating potential negative impacts. Our 2 smallest regions, LatAm and EMEA, Middle East and Africa, increased in the low to mid-teens percentage trend. And with this, I'm going to hand it over to Helene to provide additional insights on our Q2 financials.\n\nHelene von Roeder\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nSo thank you very much, Belén, and a warm welcome also from my side. Let's dive into the numbers. I am now moving to Slide 9 for an overview of our key figures for the first quarter. We achieved almost flat sales organically in Q2 at minus 1.1%, thereby continuing to show resilience in an increasingly challenging business environment supported by a multi-industry setup. Taking into account currency headwinds of minus 3.7% as well as a minor portfolio effect from the acquisition of Mecaro, net sales declined by minus 4.8% to EUR 5.302 billion in Q2.\nEBITDA pre was down by minus 12.8% to EUR 1.553 billion with the FX headwind of minus 5.7%, stronger here compared with sales, and EPS pre declined by minus 16.7% to EUR 2.20. The operating cash flow came in at EUR 622 million, which represents a decrease of minus 27% over Q2 2022, mainly driven by the decline in EBITDA pre. And looking at net financial debt, which increased by EUR 1.027 billion compared with the end of December. This is mainly due to investments for future growth and short-term financial investments. However, do bear in mind, we also paid the dividend to shareholders in Q2.\nSo let me also briefly comment on our reported results, I'm on Slide 10. EBIT was down by 17.6% in Q2. In absolute terms, the decrease was minus EUR 208 million, thereby lower than the decline in EBITDA pre of EUR 229 million. The decline in EBITDA and therefore also EBIT was mainly driven by the EBITDA pre decline in Life Science. And this, in turn, was driven in particular by the impact of destocking in Process Solutions.\nFinancial result was minus EUR 76 million in Q2 versus minus EUR 55 million in Q2 last year, mainly due to additional interest costs from pensions as well as related party financial liabilities and tax effects. The effective tax rate came in at 21.0% at the lower end of our guidance range and below the 22.4% in the second quarter of last year. The higher negative financial result had a stronger effect on net income than the lower effective tax rate. Net income and EPS were down by 18.9% and 18.6%, respectively, slightly higher than the decline in EBIT.\nSo with that, let's move on to the review by business sector, starting now with Life Science on Page 11. Sales in the Life Science core business were down minus 4% organically in Q2, while COVID-related sales continued to decline and had a dampening effect of minus 5%. Accordingly, sales in Life Science declined by minus 8.7% organically in Q2. From a portfolio perspective, Process Solutions and Life Science Services were down organically in Q2 with Science and Lab Solutions having been almost flat organically.\nSo let's look at Process Solutions first. The core business decreased by minus 7% organically in Q2, below the plus 3% in Q1. And this was further amplified by the COVID-related decline of minus 5%. The decline in the core business was mainly driven by destocking, which became visible during the course of Q1. Now we expected the destocking effect to fully materialize in Q2, but it turned out to be greater than we had thought at the beginning of Q2, which is now also visible at our smaller and regional accounts.\nOrder intake continued to decline year-on-year on the back of reduced COVID-related sales, and book-to-bill was again slightly below 1 as expected. Sales in Science and Lab Solutions were flat in the core and organically slightly down by minus 1% in Q2. The moderation versus a strong plus 7% in the core in Q1 is driven by a temporary demand weakness, mainly at our large pharma customers, especially in North America.\nSo let's turn to Life Science Services. Business sales were down minus 7% organically against tough comps, also reflecting batch phasing in CDMO, amid a sharp drop off in COVID-related sales to marginal levels, as expected, sales were down minus 30% organically. With regards to earnings, please note that in Q2 2022, the EBITDA pre margin was at its peak for Life Science. Against these very tough comps, EBITDA pre decreased by minus 26.1% organically, while the margin came in at 30.2%, down 780 basis points year-on-year.\nThe margin decline reflects lower volumes, mainly driven by customer destocking in Process Solutions and lower COVID sales as well as negative product mix effect due to the loss of COVID sales and in the Process Solutions core business. So if we now take a quick look at 2023, I would like to point to two developments. For one, the destocking effect in Process Solutions is only fully materialized in Q2 and was more pronounced than anticipated in early May.\nBased on intensified conversations with our customer and our own further developed analysis, we now assume the trough will be in Q3 and expect a trend change towards normalization for sales in Q1 to Q2 2024. Secondly, we had particularly strong organic core sales growth in Q3 last year, mainly driven by Process Solutions.\nSo with that, let's move to Healthcare on Slide 12. Healthcare delivered organic sales growth of 11.9% in Q2, above the quantitative guidance range we provided with Q1 in early May. Recent launches grew plus 29% organically, while the established portfolio also grew at plus 8%. Oncology increased plus 18% organically, mainly driven by Bavencio, which was up plus 27% and supported by Erbitux, which grew plus 10% organically.\nAt the end of March, we announced that we would regain exclusive worldwide rights for Bavencio and have now taken full control of the global commercialization effective June 30. Our N&I franchise accelerated growth in Q2 and is now up by plus 12% organically.\nMavenclad momentum resulted in a strong performance of plus 28%, while Rebif was only down minus 3%, benefiting from U.S. channel dynamics. By franchise, Fertility was a star performer at plus 25%. Competitor stock-outs continued in Q2, driving stronger performance in various regions. This was paired with a strong rebound of our Fertility franchise in China, where the end of the Zero COVID Policy led to a temporary slowdown in the Fertility market in Q1.\nSo regarding our pipeline. For evobrutinib, we are progressing towards the readout of our Phase III RMS program in Q4. Thinking about the potential of this asset, we recognize the excitement in the medical community about the concept of PIRA, which is getting more and more attention when looking at the BTK inhibitor space.\nXevinapant, our inhibitor of proteins antagonists, we are progressing towards interim analysis our event-driven study and locally advanced cell carcinoma of the head and neck in this eligible population, depending on the accumulation of events.\nRegarding earnings, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 704 million, resulting in a very strong margin of 34.3%. Organic EBITDA pre was up 30.4%, driven by operating leverage, mix and lower comps on gross profit. While Q2 was supported by income from active portfolio management of around EUR 70 million, it should be noted that in the year-on-year comparison, this is offset to a large extent by BD income in the prior year as well as an expected decline in third-party royalty streams.\nFX unfortunately was a significant headwind of minus 13.9% on EBITDA in Q2, higher than the minus 5.4% on sales. This was particularly due to the decline in value of emerging market currencies, including the Turkish lira. So looking to 2023, we continue to see income from active portfolio management in a mid- to high double-digit million euro amount for the full year, hence no significant contribution expected in H2.\nRegarding the excellent organic sales performance in Q2 and whether this is a good indicator for H2, I would like to say the following. While we generally expect a positive sales momentum to prevail for recent launches, Q2 was indeed also helped by continued competitor stock-out, which started emerging since Q4 last year. From our current perspective, we include in our model some degree of normalization of the supply situation at Fertility towards the later part of H2.\nRegarding the EBITDA pre margin, the level excluding active portfolio management in Q2 provides a good indicator for the remainder of the year, given operating leverage, mix and the repatriation of Bavencio. On Page 13, we will look at Electronics. Sales were down organically by minus 6.3% in Q2, with FX having turned into a headwind in Q2 at minus 3.8%. We did have a very small positive portfolio effect of 0.3% related to the acquisition of Korea-based Mecaro.\nSemiconductor Solutions outperformed a declining market yet again, but still was down minus 5% organically in a more difficult environment. Display Solutions was down by minus 11% organically with negative pricing and mix effect, but already better than the minus 28% observed in Q1, driven by a continued challenging environment in Liquid Crystals. Surface Solutions was down minus 6% on softness, both in Industrials and Coatings, but Cosmetics are coming back.\nEBITDA pre amounted to EUR 262 million, implying a margin of 29.1%, down only 30 bps year-on-year. Organically, EBITDA pre declined by minus 5.2% with FX having turned into a headwind of minus 4.9% for Q2, slightly more pronounced than on sales. Both the decline in Display Solutions and Semiconductor Solutions sales contributed to the decline in EBITDA pre.\nThe EBITDA pre margin held up compared to Q2 2022 and was also above the level from Q1. It should, however, be noted that it included a gain from the patent and cooperation agreement with UDC. This agreement will give us early access to their R&D emitter materials, which does strengthen our OLED portfolio significantly. Overall, this agreement added a mid-double-digit euro million amount to EBITDA pre in Q2 and will not recur in this form.\nThat said, let me also briefly comment on the coming quarters. Looking at Semiconductor Solutions, our differentiated market position in Semi materials and our strong order book in DS&S should help to mitigate some of the market headwinds as we already demonstrated in Q1 and Q2 of this year. However, we are not fully shielded. MSI expectations for 2023 dropped during the course of the year and now stand at minus 13%.\nAnd we now expect the market downturn to extend into 2024 as our customers lower their outlook and capacity utilization. Our previous guidance was in line with market expectations of a recovery of the Semi market already in Q4 of 2023. So turning to Display Solutions. We believe the inflection point in customer utilization of Liquid Crystals has been reached in Q2, and note that comps in H2 are getting easier.\nOverall, we expect slower top line momentum in Semiconductor Solutions in H2, with Display Solutions having the chance to return to growth against easier comps.. So before handing back to Belén, let me also comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. As you can see on Slide 14, our balance sheet overall is slightly above the level as at end of December 2022. The main driver behind this development was business growth.\nSo looking at the asset side, inventories increased mainly related to our Life Science and Electronics businesses. Receivables were slightly up on business performance and high sales volumes at the end of Q1, and intangible assets decreased due to FX and amortization assets increased due to short-term investments with cash and cash equivalents declining accordingly.\nSo then moving on to the liability side. Provision for employee benefits remained stable. Financial debt increased, which was more than offset by decline in other liabilities, in turn, affected by the dividend payment in Q2. And net equity increased slightly, thanks to higher retained earnings with negative FX effects almost canceling this out. Our equity ratio improved slightly to 55% from 54% compared with December 2022.\nTurning to cash flow on Slide 15. Our operating cash flow came in at EUR 622 million and was down minus 27% compared to Q2 last year. This was mainly due to the decline in profits after tax and changes in other assets and liabilities, in turn, mainly due to tax and pension plans. Changes in working capital in Q2 were reduced compared with high growth comps in Q2 last year.\nWhile CapEx increased in line with our midterm growth ambitions, investing cash flow turned positive in Q2 compared with the earlier year period. This was due to changes in short-term investments of our excess liquidity. So last but not least, the difference in financing cash flow can be explained mainly by the repayment of bank liabilities, which took place in Q2 this year. And with that, let me hand back for Belén for an update on ESG as well as the guidance.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you very much, Helene. And as every quarter, I would like to provide a very brief update on our ESG initiatives. In this case, DE&I, diversity, equity and inclusion, and for this, please move to Slide #17. So as discussed with many of you on prior occasions, we have stepped up our sustainability efforts, and we continue to make good progress.\nJust last week, we released our first progress report on diversity, equity and inclusion. The report is covering our plans and the progress in 2022, along with our ambitions through 2030, which has been communicated to you in our first Capital Markets Day in 2021. It demonstrates that we approach diversity, equity and inclusion with the same purpose and transparency as our other global business priorities.\nWe set wealth ambitions, and we hold ourselves accountable. If one believes is the positive correlation between being a diverse organization and a high performance organization, and I believe all of you know that there is a strong body of evidence behind that, then it seems that we are moving in the right direction at Merck. We now have more than 38% women in senior leadership positions, an increase of 11 percentage points since 2015 and 40% female participation in the Activity Board.\nOur engagement brings us closer to our customers, to our patients and to our communities so that we can be among the first to develop meaningful solutions that address their unmet or emerging needs. I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to discover how we continue to incorporate pride of belonging and our efforts to advance human progress into our first report on DE&I.\nAnd with this, let's move on to the guidance. Please move to Slide #19. So as I mentioned at the beginning, we are adjusting our full year 2023 guidance band for the group in particular, on the increasing challenges in Life Science, but also on the way we see the Semiconductor Solutions market moving in the coming quarters.\nIn this respect, now we expect group net sales in a range of EUR 20.5 billion to EUR 21.9 billion, EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 5.8 billion to EUR 6.4 billion and EPS pre in a range of EUR 8.25 to EUR 9.35. While we continue to expect to grow our net sales, excluding the COVID-19 business organically by a range between 1% positive and 5% positive, we now guide to an overall organic sales development of minus 2 to plus 2 with the midpoint implying a flat organic performance and an organic EBITDA pre decline of minus 9% to minus 3% in the full year 2023.\nCurrency, as several times mentioned, is expected to become a hard headwind of minus 3 to minus 6 for sales and for EBITDA pre, respectively, slightly below our previous forecast of minus 2 to minus 5 for sales and EBITDA pre. This is due to a somewhat weaker U.S. dollar and a weakening Asian currencies such as the Chinese renminbi. While we are lowering our guidance ranges that we provided or versus what we provided to you in May, there is still a meaningful overlap with the previously communicated guidance band.\nThe lower half of the old band now represents the upper half of the new guidance ranges. The new midpoints of the ranges are at the lower end of the old guidance band and reflect our current most balanced view. We remain confident of achieving our mid-term guidance of EUR 25 billion in sales by 2025, despite the challenging operating environment in the transition -- in the transitional year 2023.\nLet me offer some additional color by business sector, moving into Slide #20. So for Life Science, what -- we are adjusting our guidance and expect an organic sales development of minus 3% to plus 4% in the core business. We reiterate our expectation for total COVID-related sales of around EUR 250 million in 2023, therefore, expecting this to be a strongly dilutive to growth in 2023.\nFor Life Science overall, we therefore expect an organic sales development of minus 8% to minus 2% and an organic EBITDA pre development of minus 21% to minus 12%, amid more pronounced destocking in Process Solutions. Please note that we are currently going or planning for a complex SAP migration in Life Science, which potential impact is already reflected in the new guidance that we are communicating today.\nFor Healthcare, we are raising once again our guidance, and we now expect organic sales growth of plus 6% to plus 9%. And for organic EBITDA pre growth, we now forecast plus 14% to plus 19%. On sales, a number of drivers continue to play in our favor. First, the stronger performance of our recent launches complemented by an upside from the competitor supply shortages in our Fertility franchise and CM&E portfolio.\nIn addition to benefits from regaining exclusive worldwide rights to Bavencio effective June 30, EBITDA pre now is also getting the benefit from operating leverage and positive -- very positive mix effects. In Electronics, we have become more cautious on both organic revenues and EBITDA pre development in 2023. And now we are forecasting sales to decrease organically by -- or between minus 6% to minus 1% and EBITDA pre to decline organically by minus 18% to minus 10%. And this mainly reflects a more pronounced and extended downturn in the Semiconductor Materials market with industry forecast delaying the time of the recovery into 2024.\nAs you have heard from other companies playing in this space and of course, as you have seen from recent communication from some of our major customers like TSMC. Overall, we continue to expect Semiconductor Solutions to show great resilience and to continue to outperform in this challenging market. For a group as a whole, I'm pleased to say that our organic sales performance is flat in H1, and this is despite the increasing challenges in Life Science and Electronics and amid the decline COVID business clearly proving the benefits of our multi-industry business model.\nWith this, I'm going to thank you very much for your attention and would be very happy -- we would be very happy to now take your questions.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nOne remark from my side, it would be very kind if each of you could limit yourselves to 2 questions. This will allow more of all of you to ask questions in the first place. Thank you. And with this, we'd like to have the first question, please.",

[Operator Instructions] I am now handing over to Constantin Fest, head of Investor Relations. He will lead you through this conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nConstantin Fest\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much, Sharon. Dear ladies and gentlemen, a very warm welcome to the Merck Q1 2023 Results Call. My name is Constantin Fest. I'm Head of Investor Relations here at Merck. I'm delighted to have today with me here, Belen Garijo, our Group CEO; as well as Marcus Kuhnert, our Group CFO. Please note, for the Q&A Q&A part of this call. We are also being joined by Matthias Heinzel, CEO of Life Science as well as Peter Guenter, CEO of Healthcare; and Kai Beckmann, CEO of Electronics. Also note that at the beginning of this call, for a brief introduction, we are joined today by [ Helene ] as our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer as of 1st of July.\nAlso for your information, the first minute of the call, we would like to spend by guiding you through the key slides of this presentation. And after that, we are happy to take all your questions in our Q&A.\nWith this, I'd like to now hand over to you, Belen, to kick it off.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Constantin, and welcome, everybody, to our Q1 earnings call. Overall, Q1 has once again illustrated the strength of our business in a year that we have deemed to be transitional.\nBefore I go on the highlights for Q1, please allow me to briefly comment on the changes that we recently announced at the level of the Executive Board. As you know, Marcus Kuhnert has decided to step down as CFO and as a member of the Executive Board as of June 30. I wanted to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude also on behalf of the Executive Board for the tremendous contribution of Marcus to the company over the last 9 years. We all wish him the very best. I personally have enjoyed immensely working with Marcus, first, as a peer in the Executive Board and then as a CFO over the last couple of years.\nAt the same time, I'm truly happy to welcome [ Helene ] as our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer as of 1st of July. [ Helene ] brings with her an extensive experience in finance and in capital markets, having worked for 23 years in several big investment banks. She is joining Merck from Vonovia, where she [ sheriffed ] as Chief Financial Officer until 2021 and then transitioned to become Chief Transformation Officer responsible for digitalization and innovation in both position being also a member of the Vonovia Executive Board. And as Constantin mentioned, she is here with us today on the call, and I would say it's probably better if she says a couple of words about herself. So Helene, welcome.\n\nUnknown Attendee\n\nYes. Thank you, Belen, for the opportunity to quickly step into this call and to introduce myself. I am really excited to take over this task, and there are indeed a number of reasons for that. Firstly, I do know the company already quite well as I have been a member of the Merck Supervisory Board of Partners of EMarKG for 4 years now. Secondly, I am passionate about capital markets and finance. As Belen mentioned, I worked for 23 years at various investment banks both in London, U.K. and in Frankfurt, Germany. And thirdly, I'm a trained physicist and, as such, I feel almost naturally attracted to a vibrant science and technology company like Merck KGaA. In my latest role as Chief Transformation Officer at Vonovia, I was responsible for digitalization and innovation. And as such, I'm looking forward to sharing my experience here as well.\nIt is impressive to see how Marcus ran the financial organization over the last 9 years. Let's be clear. He leaves giant footsteps. Starting July 1, it is now my turn together with the team. Marcus and I have been working very closely during my tenure at the Merck Board, and hence, you can rest assured that it will be a very smooth transition with Marcus still being around as a member of the Executive Board of EMerckKG. In a nutshell, I feel extremely honored to now serve Merck KGAA as a CFO and member of the Executive Board.\nAnd with this, I hand back to Belen. Thank you, Belen.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Helene. So I have to say, I was a bit surprised of the question that was raised around the announcement because several of you asked why are we breaking this news from today's earnings release announcement. Well, let me tell you very frankly. First, as a company which emphasizes people very much, we wanted to separate this important organizational announcement from our quarterly earnings release. That is the most important. As a second reason, it was already announced by Helene's current employer that she would leave her proposition on Thursday last week. And we wanted to limit the time interval between Vonovia's release and our own for obvious reasons. .\nSo now back to our Q1 earnings. I am now on Slide #5, starting with the highlights. First of all, organically, our group sales increased by 1% and EBITDA pre declined by 2%. There with a slight currency tailwinds and a very minor portfolio effect, reported sales were at EUR 5.2 billion, which is an increase of 2%. Currencies had a slightly dilutive effect on EBITDA pre and reported EBITDA pre of EUR 1.587 billion, was down by 3%. EPS pre of EUR 2.36 was slightly down year-on-year.\nHealthcare was the best performer with 5.3% organic sales growth, driven by the launches of Mavenclad and Bavencio. Life Science showed a robust organic growth of 7% in the core business and was slightly up despite the sharp decline in the pandemic-related business. In Electronics, Semiconductor Solutions increased by 2%, significantly outperforming the market. That, in combination with a meaningful decline in Display Solutions, led to a minus 7% organic sales development in Electronics.\nI am happy to say that our multi-industry setup is delivering and helping us to perform also in 2023. And as usual, at this time of the year, we are further quantifying our guidance. We anticipate in 2023 net sales in a range of EUR 21.2 billion to EUR 22.7 billion, EBITDA pre EUR 6.1 billion to EUR 6.7 billion and EPS pre between EUR 8.80 to EUR 9.90, thereby confirming our qualitative guidance for organic growth that we shared with you in early March. We will come back to giving you more details on the assumptions later in the presentation.\nTurning to Page #6, we see a bit more detail of our performance by business sector. As you see, Healthcare and Life Science contributed very positively to organic sales growth in Q1, more than offsetting the decline in Electronics. Our key growth engines in the quarter were our new Healthcare products, as I already mentioned, Science & Lab Solutions within our Life Science business sector. In fact, in a challenging operating environment in Q1, Healthcare took the lead with organic growth of 5.3%, and that was driven by 28% growth from recent launches with Bavencio up plus 31% and Mavenclad growing by 23% in Q1 while the established portfolio remained stable.\nFrom a franchise perspective, in Healthcare, oncology was the highlight, delivering an organic growth of almost 15%. Life Science was up 1% organically, driven by the strength in the core business. COVID sales became dilutive to growth and were significantly down both year-on-year and also sequentially versus the last quarter as we expected. Yet we performed well versus many of our peers, both considering our organic growth and our performance in the core business.\nIn Electronics, our semi business was up 2% in the quarter, significantly outperforming a declining market. However, this was more than offset by the decline in Display Solutions and then resulting in an overall sales decline of 7% organically in Q1. A small portfolio effects in Life Science and Electronics contributed very marginally to sales growth for the group. Currency served as a slight tailwind across the board on sales, adding 0.8% to sales at group level.\nRegarding earnings, EBITDA pre came at EUR 1.59 million, down organically around minus [ 2 ] or minus EUR 28 million. And this was mainly due to Electronics, where organic EBITDA fee was down by minus 20% or minus EUR 57 million in absolute terms in Q1 versus last year. EBITDA pre Healthcare was up strongly by more than 10% organically in Q1, driven by operational performance and, importantly, not yet including the repatriation of Bavencio -- of the profit of Bavencio, which will only kick in as of July, so on the second half. EBITDA pre in Life Science was slightly down. Currency was a marginal headwind on EBITDA pre, mainly due to the ASEAN currencies such as the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen as well as emerging market currencies.\nWith this, I'm going to hand it over to Marcus that will comment and will provide additional color on our Q1 financial results.\n\nMarcus Kuhnert\n\nCFO & Member of Executive Board\n\nThank you very much, Belen, and welcome also from my side. I'm now on Slide 8 for an overview of our key figures for the first quarter. Overall, we had a solid start to 2023 in a challenging business environment, supported by our multi-industry setup. Taking into account slight currency tailwinds and a minor portfolio effect from the acquisitions of Exelead and Mecaro, net sales increased by 1.8% and to EUR 5.3 billion. EBITDA pre was down by 2.6% to EUR 1.59 billion with currencies having turned into a slight 0.5 percentage point headwind. EPS pre declined by 2.1% to EUR 2.36.\nOperating cash flow came in at EUR 853 million, which is an increase of 1.5% over the comparable period in 2022. This was mainly driven by a slower increase in working capital and the development of other assets and liabilities, namely upfront payments received in our delivery systems and service business within Semiconductor Solutions. Net financial debt increased by EUR 664 million compared with the end of December, mainly due to short-term investments of our excess liquidity in the range of EUR 800 million. Accordingly, net debt-to-EBITDA increased slightly to 1.3x, up from 1.2x at the end of last year.\nLet me also briefly comment on our reported results. So I'm now on Slide #9. EBIT was down by 11.8% in the first quarter. In absolute terms, this was a decrease of EUR 138 million, more than the 2.6% decline on EBITDA pre. This was mainly driven by higher costs for our ongoing efficiency programs, but also by higher depreciation and amortization resulting from higher investments in Life Science and Electronics in particular. The financial result improved compared with an already low base mainly due to an improved result from financial investments benefiting from higher interest rates. The effective tax rate came in at 21%, below the 22.4% from Q1 last year and at the lower end of our updated guidance range. Despite a better financial result and a lower effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share were down by 9.6% and 9.4%, respectively, driven by the declining EBIT.\nWith that, let's move on to review the sectors, starting with Life Science on Slide #10. In Life Science, sales growth slowed down to 0.6% organically in the first quarter. The core business was up at a robust 7% while COVID-related sales continued to decline and had a dampening effect of minus 6% on organic growth. From a portfolio perspective, Process Solutions and Life Science Services were down due to the decline in COVID business, while Science & Lab Solutions showed a strong performance of 5.9% organic growth.\nLooking at Process Solutions first, growth in the core business came in at 3%, significantly below the 24% in Q4 and was only partly able to mitigate the COVID-related decline of minus 7%. The significant decline in core organic growth was mainly driven by adverse inventory dynamics, mainly at our large customers becoming visible only during the course of Q1. Order intake continued to decline year-over-year on the back of reduced COVID-related sales, and book-to-bill was again slightly below 1 as expected.\nTurning to Life Science Services. Here, the sales were down 7.2% despite very strong organic growth of 35% in the core business, which was more than offset by a sharp drop-off in COVID-related sales to marginal levels as expected. The double-digit organic growth in the core was due to both the more mature contract testing business as well as the CDMO business, which benefited from positive batch phasing. Sales in Science & Lab Solutions were up 5.9% organically on healthy growth of 7% in the core, given positive pricing and a robust performance across portfolios, regions and customer segments.\nWith regard to earnings, EBITDA pre decreased by minus 1.4% organically, while the margin came in at 36.2%, down 170 basis points year-on-year. This decline reflects product mix effects and ongoing growth investments in our organization, for example, capacity expansions and Process Solutions and CDMO activities.\nIf we now take a quick look at 2023, I would like to point to 2 developments. Firstly, we only started to see the destocking dynamics at our customers in Process Solutions during the course of Q1 and expect this dynamic to continue throughout Q2. Additionally, we had particularly strong organic core sales growth in Q2 and Q3 last year, mainly driven by Process Solutions. Secondly, the EBITDA pre margin in Q1 was helped by a temporary uplift in the gross margin also on production cost efficiencies. And a number of dampening effects on the EBITDA pre margin, such as adverse mix effects, a higher operating expense base for our ongoing strategic investments as well as reduced operating leverage will only start to become more visible during the course of 2023.\nWith that, let's move on to Healthcare on Slide #11. Healthcare delivered organic sales growth of 5.3% in Q1, comparing very well with our qualitative guidance range we provided in early March. Recent launches grew 28% organically, while the established portfolio grew slightly by 0.3%. By franchise, oncology increased 15% organically, mainly driven by Bavencio, up 31%, and supported by Erbitux, which grew at 4% organically. End of March, we announced to regain exclusive worldwide rights for Bavencio, and we will take full control of the global commercialization effective June 30.\nOur N&I franchise was down slightly 2% organically with a strong Mavenclad performance of 23%, largely offsetting an amplified 25% Rebif decline in the quarter. Mavenclad benefited from patient wins in North America as well as lower comps. The Rebif decline on the other hand was partly driven by unfavorable channel dynamics in the quarter. Fertility grew 7% organically competitor stock-outs continued in Q1, driving a stronger performance in various regions. However, this comes against the challenging market environment in China, where fertility saw a double-digit decline. The end of the Zero Covid policy led to a temporary slowdown of the fertility market in China.\nRegarding our pipeline, for evobrutinib, we are progressing towards the readout of our Phase III RMS program in Q4. For enpatoran, our TLR7/8 inhibitor, we initiated a Phase II study in [ polyenemoto myositis ] as indicated at the R&D update call last year.\nRegarding earnings, EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 590 million, leading to a margin of 30.9% slightly supported by FX. Organic EBITDA pre was up 10.5% in Q1 driven by operating leverage, mix and low comps on gross profit. This strong performance was achieved with no income from active portfolio management in Q1 while we hedge around about EUR 40 million in Q1 last year. Looking to 2023, we continue to see income from active portfolio management in a mid- to high double-digit million euro amount for the full year with a significant contribution expected in the second quarter. Regarding the margin for the coming quarters in 2023, I'd like to say the following. We expect the sales momentum to prevail, mainly driven by recent launches and normalization of our China business post-COVID and continued competitor stockouts. As such, we see the EBITDA pre margin level in Q1 as a good indicator for the coming quarters based on operating leverage, mix and cost discipline.\nI will continue with Electronics on Slide 12. Sales were down organically by minus 7.1% in Q1, while currencies had a slight positive effect of 0.8%. We had a small positive portfolio effect of 0.3% related to the acquisition of Korea-based Mecaro. Semiconductor Solutions performed strongly and remained in positive territory at a 2% organic growth, clearly outperforming a declining market and the [ MSI. ] Display Solutions was down 28% organically in Q1 against tough comps in Q1 last year, driven by a continued decline in liquid crystals due to lower customer set utilization. Surface Solutions was down minus 5% on software, industrial and coatings, mainly due to a slower recovery in Asia.\nThe EBITDA pre amounted to EUR 237 million, implying a margin of 26.4%, down 380 basis points year-on-year despite support from FX. Organically, EBITDA pre declined by 19.8%. The main driver was Display Solutions on lower utilization, pricing and mix. Semi Materials also contributed to the decline in EBITDA pre as the weak market environment provided less leeway for price increases while inflation continued to put pressure on costs.\nThat said, let me also here briefly comment on the coming quarters. Looking at Semiconductor Solutions, our differentiated market position in Semi Materials and our strong order book in DS&S should help to mitigate some of the market headwinds as we demonstrated in Q1. However, we are not fully shielded. MSI expectations for 2023 dropped from minus 10% to now minus 14%, and we expect the market downturn to extend to Q3 as customers are lowering their outlook and utilization. Turning to Display Solutions. Our market view has not changed. We expect customer utilization in LC to remain low at least in the first half and a reduced contribution to sector EBITDA pre.\nOverall, we do not expect top line momentum in margins in Electronics to change meaningfully from Q1 in the short term but continue to expect a recovery in H2 driven by semis but more geared towards the later part of H2. This is reflected in our quantitative guidance. And let me mention again that the overall contribution of electronics to group EBITDA pre is limited. A 100 basis point change in EBITDA pre margin of Electronics [ boost ] the group EBITDA pre margin by only 20 basis points.\nBefore handing back to Belen, let me also comment on our balance sheet and cash flow statement briefly. As you can see on Slide 13, our balance sheet overall remained at the level from the end of December 2022. Zooming a little bit into the details, on the asset side, we see an increase in receivables and inventories, mainly related to our Life Science Electronics business. Intangible assets decreased due to currency and amortization. Other assets increased due to the mentioned short-term investments and so cash and cash equivalents declined. On the liability side, we have seen stable provisions for employee benefits as the interest rates have not significantly moved since year-end. An increase in financial debt, which was offset by a decline in other liabilities and a slight increase in net equity thanks to retained earnings. Thus the equity ratio remained stable at a level of 54%.\nTurning to cash flow on Slide #14. Operating cash flow came in at EUR 853 million and was up slightly compared to Q1 last year despite a decline in profit after tax. This was, as already said, mainly due to slower increase in working capital. Cash out for investing activities increased, primarily driven by higher CapEx to support our growth ambitions. Last but not least, the difference in financing cash flow can be explained mainly by a temporary change of financial liabilities to Merck KGaA.\nAnd with that, let me hand back to Belen for the outlook.\n\nBelen Garijo Lopez\n\nChair of Executive Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Marcus. Let's focus now on the guidance on Slide #16. So as I anticipated in our first slide, we expect the group net sales in 2023 in a range of EUR 21.2 billion to EUR 22.7 billion EBITDA pre in a range of EUR 6.1 billion to EUR 6.7 billion and EPS pre in a range of EUR 8.80 million to 9.90. And this is based on organic sales growth of plus 1 to plus 4, an organic EBITDA pre development of minus 5 to 0, in line with our qualitative outlook that we shared with you in March. Currency is now expected to become a headwind of minus 2 to minus 5 for sales and for EBITDA pre, respectively. And compared with our previous quarters of the minus 1 to minus 4 for sales and EBITDA pre, this is a slightly higher negative effect mainly due to some somewhat weaker USD and weakening Asian currencies such as the ones I mentioned already, the Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi. We stay confident on reaching our midterm guidance of EUR 25 billion in sales by 2025 despite the challenges and the operating challenges that we see in our environment in this transitional year 2023.\nNow moving into Slide #17. I will give additional color by business sector. First of all, we are moderating our forecast for Life Science to an organic sales development between minus 2% and 2% positive and an organic EBITDA predevelopment between minus 8% to minus 4% amid newly observed inventory dynamics in Process Solutions. We reiterate our guidance for total COVID-related sales of around [indiscernible] million in 2023, therefore, expecting that this COVID sales will be dilutive to our growth in 2023. Excluding the COVID impact, we forecast organic sales growth of plus 3% to 8% in the core business.\nMoving on to Healthcare. We are raising our guidance for organic sales growth to now go between plus 5 to plus 9 and for organic EBITDA pre growth between 8% positive and 12%. On sales, a number of drivers play in our favor, complemented by an upside from this competition supply shortages. EBITDA pre mainly benefits from [ rating ] performance and also regaining exclusive worldwide rights for Bavencio effective June 30. For Electronics, we forecast an organic sales development of minus 2 to plus 3, moderating our previous qualitative guidance range. For EBITDA pre, we are now specifying our guidance range to minus 12 to minus 3 to reflect a more pronounced downturn in the semiconductor market which might extend into Q3.\nOverall, I'm happy to say that we continue to show great resilience in a continuously challenging operating environment. And as a group, we delivered on our promises in Q1 and are confirming our group guidance on the organic development helped by our multi-industry operating model.\nAnd with this, we are going to stop here, and we'll be happy all of us to take your questions. Thank you.",

Sir, you may begin.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.\nI would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOur SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2021 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.\nDuring today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks. The presentation, today's earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert M. Davis\n\nCEO & Chairman, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. 2022 was an exceptional year for Merck. Our science-led strategy is working, and I couldn't be more proud of what our team has delivered scientifically, commercially and operationally. We're focusing on what matters and keeping the patient at the center of everything we do.\nWe made significant progress in 2022 advancing our broad pipeline with important internal success complemented by a portfolio of strategic acquisitions, collaborations and partnerships. We've moved with speed and urgency to drive strong progress, and we have provided increased transparency into several of our long-term opportunities, including for GARDASIL, for our cardiovascular pipeline and more recently, from newer assets that leverage our leadership position in oncology. We enter 2023 with even greater confidence that we're creating a sustainable engine that will bring forth innovation and generate value for both patients and shareholders over the long term.\nTurning first to our results. The business is performing extremely well. The growth we've experienced in 2022 reflects a sustained track record of fundamental strength from our derisked key growth pillars. We begin the year with confidence that we'll maintain the strong underlying growth after taking into account the significant impact LAGEVRIO had during the height of the pandemic last year and are pleased to reflect this in our 2023 initial guidance.\nImportantly, our pipeline is advancing with significant progress across several late-stage programs. In oncology, we have expansive research efforts, including our ambition to move treatment into earlier-stage settings where there is a higher potential for more favorable longer-term outcomes for patients.\nIn December, along with our partner, Moderna, we were pleased to announce highly encouraging Phase II results for our personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. We're excited by the potential that this combination may have for patients across a range of tumor types. And last week, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy, which Caroline and Dean will speak to.\nIn cardiovascular, we're exploring candidates across a broad range of diseases and have made substantial progress from just 1 year ago. At the American College of Cardiology conference, we will present data from the STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension and from the Phase II trial of MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, and we will also host an investor event to discuss these programs.\nIn vaccines, Instituto Butantan in Brazil, with whom we are collaborating for vaccine development, reported very encouraging top line results for their candidate for the prevention of dengue. These data will inform future development of our dengue vaccine, V181, and our efforts to address this critical public health challenge.\nFinally, through our business development efforts, we brought in 4 programs, which will have Phase III trial starts in 2023 and which have the opportunity to contribute meaningful growth during the latter half of this decade and into the next. We are following our disciplined approach to business development and will act when scientific opportunity and value aligned. We have more to do, but I feel very good about the progress we've made in 2022, and we believe that all of these efforts will lead to real benefits for patients and, in turn, for shareholders.\nWe enter 2023 with confidence in the innovation engine we are building and our ability to deliver sustainable value for patients well into the next decade. We will continue to execute on our derisked assets and act with urgency to advance and grow our pipeline. We are doing all of this with an approach to sustainability that is closely aligned to our overall business strategy. I'm very confident in the short and long-term outlook of our company, and I look forward to providing future updates.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\n\nCaroline Litchfield\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, 2022 was an exceptional year for our company. We delivered excellent top line growth of 22%, driven by strength across our key pillars of oncology, vaccines and hospitals as well as the significant contribution from LAGEVRIO.\nOur Animal Health business delivered strong operational growth, which was offset by foreign exchange. These results are a testament to the profound impact our medicines and vaccines are having on patients globally, which are enabled by our dedicated teams who are executing with excellence to deliver these important innovations. We are confident in the health of our business and in our outlook for continued strong underlying growth.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Excluding the effects from foreign exchange, the business delivered strong operational growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses continued their strong growth, increasing 9% and 6%, respectively.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.5 billion, driven by strong global demand for in-line indications as well as continued global expansion from new approvals. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continued to benefit from uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma.\nKEYTRUDA continues to have a profound impact on patients, including in earlier-stage cancers where there is greater potential for better outcomes. We are excited by the recent approval of KEYNOTE-091, which represents KEYTRUDA's seventh indication in earlier-stage cancers. Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need. It is our ambition, along with others, to improve lung center screening rates to levels similar to other tumor types such as breast where screening programs with more routine.\nWhile we are committed to addressing this unmet need, we anticipate a more gradual near-term uptake from this indication. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintains its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, which gives us confidence that we are well positioned to positively impact patients in the earlier setting.\nOutside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in metastatic indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma as well as recent launches in earlier-stage cancers, including 30 types of high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma.\nLynparza maintained its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Alliance revenue grew 14%, primarily due to continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 9%, driven by increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer in the U.S.\nLastly, WELIREG is performing in line with our expectations, and we are proud of the impact this is having on adult patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our vaccines portfolio delivered growth, with GARDASIL increasing 6% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. In the U.S., sales decreased primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccine sales also benefited from the pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which is off to an encouraging start, with revenues also benefiting from inventory stocking.\nIn our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 7%, driven by an increase in market share amongst neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Hospital acute care sales also benefited from the resupply of the ZERBAXA, which started in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOur Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6%, reflecting strategic price actions and volume growth. Livestock sales grew 12%, driven by increased demand in ruminants and poultry products. Companion animal sales were negatively impacted by supply challenges for certain vaccines and a reduction in vet visits in October, which improved during the quarter.\nI will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Operating expenses increased 8% to $5.7 billion, reflecting increased investments to support our portfolio and growing pipeline. Other income was $86 million, reflecting the return on pension plan assets and capitalized interest, which was largely offset by net interest expense. Our tax rate was 15.6%. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.62.\nTurning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The strength across our key pillars is expected to continue into this year. We project revenue to be between $57.2 billion and $58.7 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. Excluding the negative impact of LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates, we expect strong underlying revenue growth 7% to 10%. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 77%.\nOperating expenses are assumed to be between $23.1 billion and $24.1 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of research and development expenses related to our acquisition of Imago and the expansion of our collaboration with Kelun-Biotech. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.\nOther income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $6.80 to $6.95. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% using mid-January rates.\nOur guidance reflects confidence in continued strong growth across oncology, vaccines and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. On revenues, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. Global immunization levels remain low, which creates a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients. And we are improving supply, which positions us well to support the significant demand we are experiencing today and expect over the long term for this vaccine that prevents HPV-related cancers.\nOther revenue is projected to decline significantly, primarily reflecting a smaller planned benefit from revenue hedges following the U.S. dollar strength last year, which resulted in an approximate $800 million benefit in 2022. Other revenue is also expected to be lower due to the discontinuation of third-party manufacturing sales to Johnson and Johnson.\nOn the rest of the P&L, we project the shift from other expense to other income, which is primarily attributable to an assumption that there will be no pension settlement costs as well as an expectation of lower net interest expense and higher joint venture equity income. This benefit is more than offset by an increase in the estimated tax rate due to the unfavorable impact of the R&D capitalization provision as well as an approximate 1 percentage point impact related to Imago.\nNow shifting to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are excited about the significant progress our teams have made to advance and augment our pipeline in 2022.\nIn 2023, we will continue to invest in opportunities that will address important unmet medical needs and drive the next wave of growth for our company, including the initiation of many late-stage clinical trials across a broad set of novel candidates. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of increasing it over time.\nWe will continue to pursue the most compelling external science through value-enhancing business development to augment our internal pipeline, and we'll invest appropriately maximize the potential of our program. Given the strength of our business and balance sheet, we plan to resume share repurchases, while ensuring we maintain ample capacity to pursue additional business development, which is the higher priority.\nTo conclude, we entered 2023 confident in our ability to execute on the important opportunities we have to deliver innovation to patients and sustain the strong underlying growth of our business well into the future.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\n\nDean Y. Li\n\nExecutive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Caroline. Today, I will provide notable updates since our last earnings call. We continue to make significant advancements and achieve important regulatory milestones. The fourth quarter marks the end of a successful year with progress made across oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases and cardiology.\nLet me start with oncology. We remain committed to transforming the landscape of cancer therapy with an ongoing focus on treating earlier stages of disease. We are pleased by the recent approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with stage Ib, II or IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of KEYNOTE-091. This approval provides, for the very first time, an adjuvant immunotherapy option for this patient population with stage 1b disease and regardless of PD-L1 status.\nBeyond KEYNOTE-091, we have additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer, including: KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant therapy in resectable stage II, IIIa and IIIb disease; KEYNOTE-867 evaluating KEYTRUDA in patients undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy with unresected stage I or II disease; and KEYLYNK-012 studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage III disease.\nThese trials are all part of our broader effort to treat earlier stages of cancer and further improve patient outcomes across, tumor types, such as melanoma. Together with Moderna, we announced positive Phase II results for V940, mRNA-4157 in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of stage III and IV for melanoma in patients with high risk of recurrence following complete resection. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in recurrence free survival versus KEYTRUDA alone.\nThis investigational personalized neoantigen therapy utilizes mRNA technology and is specifically tailored to target the unique mutational signature of each patient's tumor. We plan to discuss the results with regulators and initiate Phase III trials in multiple tumors this year. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.\nWe also announced positive results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-966 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy. This trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer.\nIn addition, we announced positive top line results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-859 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.\nIn November, we announced the acquisition of Imago BioSciences, which closed last month. Imago's lead candidate, bomedemstat, is a potentially first-in-class orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.\nThe combined team is now focused on continuing to advance the ongoing clinical development programs. At the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, data were presented from multiple pipeline candidates, including: favezelimab, our anti-LAG3 antibody; zilovertamab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, targeting ROR-1; and nemtabrutinib, our oral reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor; as well as KEYTRUDA. Updated Phase II data for bomedemstat in essential thrombocythemia and advanced myelofibrosis were also presented.\nWe continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. In the European Union, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we announced the approval for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROpel trial. In China, based on the results of KEYNOTE-522 and KEYNOTE 394 in we received approvals for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant/adjuvant high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively.\nWith our partners, Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA has accepted supplemental biologic license application for KEYTRUDA with PADCEV, an antibody drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, for the first-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The agency set a PDUFA date of April 21, 2023, for each application.\nBuilding on the clinical benefits observed with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and antibody drug conjugates, we have focused on augmenting our tissue targeting candidates through business development. We announced the expansion of our agreement with Kelun-Biotech with the addition of up to 7 preclinical antibody drug conjugates.\nThe collaboration leverages technology with the potential to yield a new generation of candidates designed to precisely target and deliver potent anticancer agents to the tumor site. This follows previously disclosed agreement for 2 clinical stage candidates, including MK-2870, an investigational TROP2 targeting ADC we are planning to advance into Phase III trials this year. We also expanded our collaboration with PeptiDream to include the discovery and development of peptide drug conjugates. This technology potentially provides for improved permeability and drug selectivity in targeting tumor tissue.\nNext to our vaccine portfolio. We were encouraged by the progress scientists and clinicians at the Instituto Butantan in Brazil made in developing a single dose dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Brazil. We are collaborating with the team there to conduct a detailed analysis of these positive topline Phase III results to determine next steps for our own dengue vaccine candidate, V181, currently in Phase II development. Merck's goal is to make V181 available outside of Brazil for populations at risk for dengue.\nAs Caroline noted, we are receiving positive feedback from the field regarding the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting, and remain confident in our population specific strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal disease.\nVAXNEUVANCE offers strong protection, including in the first year of life, with robust immunity across all shared and unique serotypes. This is important because the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is greatest in the first year of life for children. Also, we are on track and look forward to the Phase III results from our V116 program for the protection of adults this year.\nWe, along with others in the industry, are making a real impact in our goal to help reduce cancer incidence. It was noteworthy that the American Cancer Society's recently published annual report on cancer facts and trends included the remarkable observation that there has been a 65 percent reduction in cervical cancer incidence in women 20 to 24 years old, from 2012 through 2019.\nIt is this type of finding that further reinforces Merck's commitment to bringing forward treatment and prevention options to help patients with this devastating disease. As part of this commitment, we are encouraged by the role GARDASIL continues to play in helping to prevent certain HPV-related cervical cancers.\nTurning to the broader portfolio. With the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce the incidence of disease and burden on healthcare systems. We were pleased LAGEVRIO was granted conditional marketing authorization by China's National Medical Products Administration in December, for use in adult patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and a high risk of progressing to severe cases.\nI wish to reinforce something Rob mentioned. Please mark your calendars for March 6, where we will present detailed findings of the Phase III STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Phase II results for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans.\nWe will also host a live investor event to answer your questions. We look forward to bringing sotatercept as an important treatment option to patients and are currently working towards submission of the data from the STELLAR trial. We are in discussions with the FDA about submission of the data on a rolling basis, which is likely to result in a potential approval in early 2024.\nAs we close out 2022, it is important to highlight that over the course of the year we made strong progress across therapeutic areas, modalities, stages of development and multiple business development transactions.\nIn oncology, we obtained several important regulatory approvals globally for KEYTRUDA, and Lynparza as well as advanced a number of programs evaluating earlier stage cancer regimens. In vaccines, we received an important approval in pediatrics for VAXNEUVANCE. In addition, we were granted expanded authorizations in China, and active recommendations were reinstated in Japan for GARDASIL. In HIV, we resumed our clinical development program for islatravir. And finally in cardiovascular disease, we made significant progress across our pulmonary arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia programs.\nTaken together, we continue to deliver on our strategy of advancing promising candidates across multiple therapeutic areas. We have strong momentum across our pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our progress in 2023.\nAnd now I will turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Dean. Kelly, we're ready to take questions now. We intend to end the call at 9:00 sharp this morning. (Operator Instructions)",

My name is Leaha West, and I will be your conference moderator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Co. Q3 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.\nI would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The presentation, today's earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert M. Davis\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. Our strong performance this quarter reflects sustained momentum across our key growth drivers and steady progress in our pipeline. We're well positioned to successfully close out the year, and we look forward to building on this momentum in 2023 and beyond.\nWe're delivering across our strategic priorities and executing well scientifically, operationally and commercially. As a result, our pipeline is advancing, our business is healthy, our growth pillars are intact and our financial performance is strong. We remain keenly focused on sustaining the success by driving continued growth and delivering long-term value to patients and shareholders.\nWith that, let's turn first to our results. We're pleased to report exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth again this quarter. We continue to see robust demand for our innovative human and animal health portfolios, including for products such as KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, BRIDION and BRAVECTO. Our updated guidance reflects our expectation of truly standout full year growth.\nMoving to our research organization. We made considerable progress across multiple therapeutic areas. In cardiovascular, the top line results of the STELLAR Phase III trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension achieved successful outcomes across both the primary and almost every secondary endpoint, suggesting the potential to transform the treatment of patients suffering from this devastating disease.\nI'm proud of the way our research organization has moved swiftly following last year's acquisition of Acceleron to advance sotatercept's development. We continue to advance other programs across our broad cardiovascular pipeline, including our Factor XI inhibitor, which recently received an FDA Fast Track designation for patients with end-stage renal disease.\nTurning to oncology, we presented encouraging results at ESMO across our broad portfolio and promising pipeline. Long-term survival data reinforces the durable benefits of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for certain patients. We remain enthusiastic about the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of cancer as well as in combination with other agents.\nIn vaccines, we launched VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and are progressing our Phase III trial of V116 in adults, an important component of our population-specific approach to invasive pneumococcal disease and part of our broader efforts to provide strong protection to both infants and adults. And finally, in HIV, we are pleased that there is a path forward for islatravir clinical trials in the treatment setting. We remain committed to helping address unmet needs in both treatment and prevention.\nMoving to our efforts around sustainability. We continue to execute on our priorities, further demonstrating our long-standing commitment to delivering value to society which in turn creates value for shareholders. In August, we published our annual ESG progress report, which provides a comprehensive review of our sustainability strategy, initiatives underway and progress against our goals.\nConsistent with our mission, we're focused on access to health, ensuring that our inventions reach as many patients as possible. To enable access, we're committed to responsibly discovering and manufacturing our medicines and vaccines, to bringing our best ideas forward through the empowerment of our talented and diverse employees and to always operating with strong ethics and values.\nSome of our initiatives include a commitment to providing 91.5 million doses of HPV vaccines in GAVI-supported countries, advancing our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and supporting projects and partnerships in our priority areas through the issuance of an inaugural $1 billion sustainability bond. Our approach to sustainability helps propel and enable our business strategy in ways that align with our operating priorities. This makes us a better company and global citizen, creating value for society and for shareholders.\nYesterday evening, we also announced that Ken Frazier will be retiring from his role as Chairman of Merck's Board of Directors at the end of November. I know I speak on behalf of the entire company and our Board in expressing our deepest appreciation for Ken, his principal leadership, respect for science, passion for engaging with employees everywhere, commitment to patients and health equity and contributions to communities around the world. Speaking personally, I'm deeply grateful for the inspiration, mentorship and support Ken has provided to me.\nMoving ahead, I look forward to working with the Board in my new role as Chairman as we continue to build on Ken's legacy and drive core to our purpose of using leading-edge science to save and improve lives globally. I'm confident that we have the fundamental building blocks in place to achieve sustainable growth and value creation. This is exemplified by our talented team of scientists and our colleagues all around the world who are dedicated to discovering, developing and delivering life-changing medicines and vaccines. I'm very confident in the short- and long-term outlook of our company, and I look forward to continuing to share progress as we move into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\n\nCaroline Litchfield\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning. 2022 continues to be a year of excellent performance for our business. This quarter, we again achieved exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth, driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. These results reinforce our commitment to our science-led strategy, enabled by the flawless execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short term while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders.\nTotal company revenues were $15 billion, an increase of 14%. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered strong growth of 10%. Underlying growth was 4 percentage points higher, given the growing headwind from foreign exchange.\nThe remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health business continued its momentum with growth of 19%, or 15% excluding LAGEVRIO, driven by strength across our key pillars. Our Animal Health business delivered a solid quarter as sales increased 4% in both our companion animal and livestock products.\nNow turning to the third quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.4 billion, driven by strong global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continued to benefit from uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma.\nIntervening earlier in cancer progression provides the potential for better patient outcomes, which is why we remain excited by the impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with these early-stage cancers. Notably, there continues to be very strong demand in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, a testament to the profound effect KEYTRUDA is having for patients with this aggressive form of disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer.\nOutside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Recently approved earlier-stage indications, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma are off to a strong start following launches in key European markets earlier this year.\nLynparza maintained its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Our alliance revenue grew 23%, driven by continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA study. The outlook for Lynparza remains strong. And if approved, we are confident in the potential to reach patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the PROpel study.\nLenvima alliance revenue grew 11%, a strong demand in the U.S. driven by continued uptake in advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer, was partially offset by shipment timing in China. Lastly, WELIREG is performing consistent with our expectations, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need of patients with certain VHL-associated tumors.\nOur vaccines portfolio achieved excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 20% to $2.3 billion. Growth is being driven by strong underlying demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. We recently received approval from China's National Medical Products Administration to expand the use of GARDASIL 9 to girls and women 9 to 45 years of age, which will further expand our opportunity in this important market. Growth in the U.S. was due to timing of CDC purchases, which will negatively impact fourth quarter sales.\nWe are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth of GARDASIL given its proven effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and other diseases. Global immunization levels remain low, which provides us a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients. And we have invested aggressively in manufacturing capacity, which positions us well to supply the demand we expect to see now and over the long term.\nIn our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 22%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. As mentioned earlier, Animal Health sales increased 4%. Livestock sales increased due to poultry products and ruminant technology solutions. Companion animal sales growth was driven by the BRAVECTO line of products, partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines.\nI will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, reflecting favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact of lower margin LAGEVRIO and supply sales. Operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes $619 million of payments related to certain collaborations and licensing agreements. Excluding these payments, operating expenses grew 13%, driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline.\nOther expense was approximately $100 million, which reflects lower pension expense compared to last year. Our tax rate was 13.6%. Taken together, we earned $1.85 per share, which includes $0.22 of charges related to significant collaborations and licensing agreement. Excluding these charges, we had exceptional underlying growth.\nTurning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.5 billion and $59 billion, including LAGEVRIO sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 20% to 21%.\nThe projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of nearly 1% using mid-October rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of approximately 4%. Excluding foreign exchange and LAGEVRIO, we expect growth of approximately 16%.\nWe are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing and narrowing our operating expense projection to $21.3 billion to $21.7 billion, principally driven by a $250 million payment related to the recent exercise of our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine as part of our ongoing collaboration with Moderna.\nAs a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We continue to assume other expense of approximately $500 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 14%. We assume 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased and narrowed our expected EPS rate to $7.32 to $7.37, an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint.\nThe operational momentum in our business would have led to an approximately $0.20 increase in our guidance. However, this is being partially offset by the option payments in Moderna and an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of nearly 1% using mid-October rates.\nOur guidance reflects confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We continue to demonstrate strong momentum and expect durable underlying demand across our key pillars, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health.\nAs you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. While we actively manage foreign exchange through our revenue hedging program, it continues to be a headwind to growth, particularly across products with a larger portion of international revenues, such as in our Animal Health business. The hedging program mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. And to the extent we continue to see foreign exchange headwinds recorded at the product level, we will see a benefit in other revenue. In addition, other revenue includes the supply sales to Organon.\nAs you saw in our results, PNEUMOVAX 23 is experiencing pressure, particularly in the U.S. as the market continues to shift towards newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to prioritize investments in our pipeline and business to drive near- and long-term growth across our portfolio.\nWe have made significant progress across our pipeline, which Dean will speak to, that has the potential to drive sustainable revenue growth. We are augmenting our pipeline by pursuing the best external science through value-enhancing business development which we will invest in to realize the promise of these products.\nWe continue to consider the full breadth of the business development landscape. We have ample balance sheet capacity and we will act only when science and value align. Should meaningful business development not materialize and depending on the pipeline of potential transactions, we will opportunistically buy back shares. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time.\nTo conclude, as we finish the year, we remain confident in the continued growth of our business. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong, and we continue to demonstrate the operational momentum and commercial execution that will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders now and well into the future.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\n\nDean Y. Li\n\nExecutive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Caroline. It's my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the second quarter call. We are growing momentum in our pipeline across therapeutic areas, across modalities, across stages of development and across the spectrum of internal programs, established partnerships and recent business development opportunities.\nIn cardiology, we are making strong headway in pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as our PCSK9 and Factor XI program. In vaccines, we are moving with rigor and speed to build on the VAXNEUVANCE approval and establish a suite of tailored pneumococcal vaccine. In oncology, we are expanding our portfolio in partnerships with Orion, Kelun, and most recently, Moderna. This progress strengthens my confidence in the pipeline and reinforces to me the opportunity presented by several candidates poised to positively impact patients' lives.\nAs Rob noted, we see significant opportunity to make an impact in cardiovascular disease. Earlier this month, we announced top line results from the Phase III STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept, added to currently approved standard of care, had a profound effect on the primary efficacy outcome measure of improvement in 6-minute walk distance from baseline at 24 weeks.\nOf note, 8 out of 9 secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement and the outcome measure of time to death for the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event. We look forward to sharing the results with regulatory authorities and plan to present the findings at a scientific congress in 2023. The data from the STELLAR trial is an important milestone as we work to establish a beachhead in pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nLooking ahead, the ZENITH trial is evaluating sotatercept for morbidity and mortality and will enable assessment of the potential to reverse progression of disease and will be followed by the HYPERION trial, which is designed to evaluate whether administration of sotatercept earlier in the course of PAH can help improve outcomes and delay time to clinical worsening. And we also have a Phase II CADENCE trial, which is exploring the potential for sotatercept in left heart failure.\nIn addition to sotatercept, we are studying MK-5475, an investigational inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator designed to provide selective pulmonary arterial dilatation with limited systemic exposure for the treatment of PAH. We remain confident in the promise of our investigational portfolio to fundamentally change the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nNext, to LAGEVRIO. Approximately 2.5 million people have now received LAGEVRIO for the treatment of COVID-19, and studies are continuing to show the impact this oral treatment option is having on patients and on the health care system. Real-world evidence of high-risk, older population conducted in Israel and Hong Kong found a reduction in hospitalization and death, consistent with the Phase III MOVe-OUT clinical trial.\nUnsurprisingly, a large study in the U.K. evaluating a broader, highly-vaccinated population conducted during the Omicron era found no difference in hospitalization versus standard of care. Nevertheless, there were important observations from certain secondary analysis, including quicker time to recovery and to symptom alleviation as well as reduced physician visits. LAGEVRIO continues to demonstrate a safety profile consistent with our findings in MOVe-OUT.\nThe pandemic continues to evolve and vaccination rates still vary substantially from country to country. More reason variants, such as Omicron, are generally associated with less severe disease. But the elderly and those with comorbidities remain at high risk of poor outcome. Insights from real-world studies are important in this context as we try to understand how LAGEVRIO is being used and the potential benefit for various patient populations.\nLAGEVRIO continues to be an important tool in the armamentarium to treat COVID-19, especially with uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges. In addition to COVID-19, we are now taking steps to harness the broad antiviral potential of LAGEVRIO. We have initiated a Phase II trial evaluating its use in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus and will provide further updates as they become available.\nShifting to our HIV portfolio. Since last year's setback to the islatravir program, we have gained tremendous learning and insights through the evaluation of data. Following consultation with the FDA, we are pleased we have a path forward. We initiated a new Phase III clinical program evaluating a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and a lower dose of islatravir for the treatment of people with HIV-1 infection.\nIn addition, the Phase II study with Gilead evaluating a weekly oral combination treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed is resuming with a lower dose of islatravir.\nWe continue to see significant potential in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor mechanism and remain committed to addressing the unmet need in both treatment and in prevention of HIV. In the prep setting, we are prioritizing an internal novel NRTTI compound for development, next to vaccine and specifically GARDASIL 9.\nAs Caroline noted, last month, the National Medical Products Administration in China expanded the authorization for GARDASIL 9 to a broader age range. The authorization reinforces the strong clinical profile of GARDASIL 9 and its effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and diseases.\nIn addition, we were pleased with the recent approval of VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by the European Commission in the pediatric calculation. This approval brings an important treatment option to vulnerable populations, including infants less than 1 year of age, who typically experience the highest rate of disease.\nI would also like to touch on the recently announced collaboration with Orna Therapeutics. We have made significant investments and gained important insights into the use of RNA technology. The compelling circular RNA platform that Orna has developed allows us to explore the potential for a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics.\nTurning to oncology. Strong momentum continues in our oncology portfolio across tumor types and stages of disease. Last month, at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting, we showcased long-term survival benefit data for KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and head and neck cancer as well as for Lynparza in ovarian cancer. In addition, we presented data that continues to support the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier-stage disease. Our expansive research efforts in treating in earlier-stage settings reflects our ambition to treat cancer when the potential of curing cancer may be high.\nAlso at ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, first-time data was presented from the Phase Ib/II EV-103 for KEYNOTE-869 Cohort K trial. KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin-ejfv demonstrated encouraging objective response rate as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There remains a high unmet medical need for new medicines for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and we look forward to the potential of this combination.\nThis quarter, we received priority review for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer regardless of their genetic mutational status based on the PROpel study. The PDUFA date has been set for the fourth quarter.\nOutside of the U.S., we continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. There remains significant opportunity for us to help improve patient outcomes and address unmet need in Japan and in China. We received 4 new approvals in Japan based on KEYNOTE-522 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-564 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma following surgery; KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage 2b or Stage 2C melanoma; and KEYNOTE-826 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab in certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer.\nFor Lynparza, we received approvals in the EU and Japan for the adjuvant treatment for patients with certain types of high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA trial and in China as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer.\nFinally, we exercised our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, or V940, which our partner, Moderna, is currently evaluating in combination with KEYTRUDA in a Phase II study for patients with locally advanced and resected melanoma. The primary objective of the Phase II study is to test efficacy of a personalized cancer vaccine plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone in a randomized study of early-stage melanoma in the adjuvant setting. We are energized to continue our collaboration with Moderna, a pioneer in mRNA vaccine technology.\nTo conclude, there has been substantive progress across our pipeline, and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress in the future. And now I will turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Dean. Leaha, will you please start the Q&A. (Operator Instructions)",

My name is Alan, and I will be your conference moderator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Co. Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Dannenbaum, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nWelcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You'll see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nIf our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2021 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.\nDuring today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speaker's prepared remarks. The presentation of today's earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert M. Davis\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm proud to report that the business continues to perform extremely well. We remain firmly guided by our strategic priorities to drive long-term growth and deliver value to patients and shareholders. We're executing on the opportunities in front of us today, while simultaneously making the necessary investments to sustain our success long into the future. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we achieved robust top and bottom line growth and made additional important clinical advancements in our pipeline.\nTurning first to our results. We again achieved exceptional performance this quarter led by strong growth of key products, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and BRIDION. Our results were aided by revenue from LAGEVRIO, which is helping to in fighting against COVID-19. We're confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio as we continue to see momentum in our business, which we are pleased to reflect in our updated guidance.\nMoving to research organization. We continue to advance our pipeline most significantly across our suite of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. VAXNEUVANCE received an expanded approval from the FDA for pediatric use, providing an important option for children in prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease.\nWe also presented positive results from clinical studies of V116, our pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate, designed specifically to address remaining disease burden in adults, and we've initiated pivotal phase III studies. These milestones reinforce the confidence we have in our population specific approach to address the distinct needs of children and adults.\nWe've also taken additional steps to help you understand the significant opportunities we see in our pipeline. In June, we hosted an investor event at ASCO which highlighted the depth and breadth of our oncology program. At the event, we reiterated our ambition to become the leading oncology company by 2025 and our goal of sustaining this success well into the next decade.\nAs I reflect on my first year as CEO, I'm very pleased by the significant progress we've made in advancing Merck's position as a global biopharmaceutical leader and the scent of momentum spreading across our business. The unwavering focus and dedication of our employees worldwide is driving strong execution on the significant opportunities in front of us. We're demonstrating impressive resilience across all aspects of our business in a very challenging global environment.\nWe're achieving record levels of production in our manufacturing operations, delivering exceptionally strong revenue growth, making meaningful advances in our pipeline and taking important steps to be more transparent about our outlook.\nOur strategy is working and our future is bright. I was very confident a year ago, and I'm even more confident today that we are well positioned to achieve our near and long-term goals, anchored by our commitments to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients and value to all of our stakeholders, including shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\n\nCaroline Litchfield\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are maintaining this year's strong momentum with another quarter of exceptional performance in both revenue and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our focus on science and innovation as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is being enabled by the excellent execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe and continue to deliver value for patients, customers and shareholders.\nTotal company revenues were $14.6 billion, an increase of 28%. LAGEVRIO contributing $1.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered very strong growth of 18%.\nThe remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum with growth of 33% or 21%, excluding LAGEVRIO driven by our key pillars. Our Animal Health business also delivered stellar performance, with sales increasing 5%, driven by growth across both our livestock and companion animal products.\nNow turning to the second performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 30% to $5.3 billion, driven by the vast global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications and to reflect the profound impact it is having on patients across the globe. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate momentum in metastatic indication and is experiencing strong growth from recent launches in early-stage cancers, including triple-negative breast, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is now approved with 6 indications in earlier stage cancers.\nWe've seen strong utilization and are confident in its continued success as physician and patient experience growth. We have seen a particularly strong uptake in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522, offering a systemic treatment option to patients in an area of significant unmet need.\nIn the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintained its leadership position in non-small lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA was driven by continued uptake in non-small cell lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Initial indicators also point to encouraging trends in the earliest stage indications, including triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma in key European markets.\nLynparza remains a market-leading part inhibitor. Our alliance revenue grew 17%, driven by uptaking certain patients with high-risk early-stage breast cancer following FDA approval based on the OlympiA study. We look forward to potentially expanding upon Lynparza's leadership by reaching additional prostate cancer patients based on the PROpel study.\nLenvima alliance revenue grew 33% due to strong demand following the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in advanced renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-775 in metastatic endometrial cancer. New patient states across each of these tumors remain strong. Lastly, we continue to be encouraged by the uptake of WELIREG which is tracking in line with expectations.\nOur vaccines portfolio again delivered excellent growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 40% to $1.7 billion. Outside the U.S., GARDASIL significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand, particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S. sales decreased primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns, although we continue to see some impact from the pandemic on well visits.\nWe continue to invest behind activation campaigns to ensure that parents recognize the importance of routine physician well visits for their children, particularly during the back-to-school season. We remain confident in the growth trajectory of GARDASIL given the proven ability to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males.\nIn our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 15%, driven by greater share among neuromuscular blockage reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Our animal health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 5%, livestock sales grew 6%, driven by higher demand in ruminants and poultry. Companion animal sales increased 3% due to global demand for the BRAVECTO line of product.\nI will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.7%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points. The decrease was due to the impact of LAGEVRIO, higher inventory write-offs due to increased manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix across the remainder of the portfolio and foreign exchange.\nOperating expenses decreased 19% to $5.2 billion, reflecting charges primarily related to last year's $1.7 billion acquisition of Pandion which is reflected in our second quarter 2021 R&D expense. Operating expenses excluding these charges increased in line with our plan, driven by investments in our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $200 million, reflecting higher-than-expected pension settlement expense. Our tax rate was 13.8%. Taken together, we add $1.87 per share.\nTurning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $57.5 billion and $58.5 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 18% to 20% or 13% to 14%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange.\nThe projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of more than 1% using mid-July rates resulting in a full year negative impact of approximately 3%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing our operating expense projection to $20.5 billion to $21.5 billion, primarily driven by the $219 million upfront payment from the recently announced collaboration with Orion Corporation.\nAs an ongoing practice, our guidance does not include significant potential business development transaction. We increased our expectations of other expense to approximately $500 million, reflecting higher-than-anticipated pension settlement expense. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5%. We assumed 2.54 billion shares outstanding.\nTaken together, we have narrowed our expected EPS range to $7.25 to $7.35. The operational strength in our business would have led to an approximately $0.25 increase in our guidance. This strength is being offset by the upfront payment to Orion, by a pension settlement expense and an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of more than 1% using mid-July rates. Overall, our guidance reflects our confidence that the strong underlying momentum of our business will continue into the second half of the year.\nAs you consider your models, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the pandemic was a tailwind to growth in the first half of the year. We expect the benefits to year-over-year growth to lessen over the remainder of the year. Also, we actively managed the impact of foreign exchange through our revenue setting program. To the extent we see further negative impact from foreign exchange, we will see additional benefits from our hedges in other revenues as we did in this quarter.\nOther revenue also includes supply sales to Organon and to Johnson & Johnson for its COVID-19 vaccine as well as receipts related to out licensing arrangements. In total, we expect other revenue to be higher in the second half versus the first half of 2022. With respect to our products, for PNEUMOVAX23, we continue to expect a negative impact to U.S. sales, given the shift towards newer adults pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.\nOn Animal Health, we're seeing normalized industry growth rate as we (inaudible) the favorable trends in spending resulting from the pandemic and experience foreign exchange headwinds. However, given our broad and innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to continue to drive above market growth in 2022 and beyond. Finally, we continue to expect to expect LAGEVRIO's full year sales of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, with second half sales weighted to the fourth quarter.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our pipeline and business to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities in front of us. We continue to pursue compelling external science through with strategic business development to augment our internal pipeline. Our recent collaboration with Orion is another example of our execution of this strategy. We remain committed to our dividend, which we expect to increase through the time. Finally, to the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases.\nTo conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, we remain very confident in strength of our business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our excellent execution will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\n\nDean Y. Li\n\nExecutive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Caroline. It's my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the first quarter call. We continue to execute on our pipeline strategy. We are advancing the latest signs to generate medicines and vaccines that provide clear benefit for patients.\nToday, I will highlight recent progress in our vaccine pipeline and provide updates on our oncology program as well as LAGEVRIO. As Rob noted, we have made significant progress across our pneumococcal portfolio. Building upon the approval in the adult indication we received a year ago, last month, we received FDA approval for our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, VAXNEUVANCE, an important new option to help protect pediatric populations against invasive pneumococcal disease.\nVAXNEUVANCE is the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine approved for pediatric populations in almost a decade. VAXNEUVANCE provides comparable immunogenicity for 12 shared serotypes compared to the currently available 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, improved immunogenicity for serotype 3 and expanded coverage for serotype 22F and 33F. Serotype 3, 22F and 33F are key invasive disease-causing serotypes known to be responsible for more than a quarter of all invasive pneumococcal disease in children.\nFollowing FDA approval, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted unanimously to endorse use of VAXNEUVANCE as an option for children under 19 years of age. Additionally, the ACIP unanimously voted to include VAXNEUVANCE and the vaccines for children program. We await publication of the final CDC recommendation in the morbidity and mortality weekly report.\nAlso in June, at the International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases in Toronto, we presented positive results from our Phase I/II study evaluating V116, our investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pneumococcal vaccine naive adult. V116 is designed to significantly expand coverage compared to currently licensed pneumococcal vaccines by targeting serotypes that account for 85% of all invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults aged 65 and older in the United States as of 2019.\nAs a strong indicator of our progress, we recently enrolled the first patient into the STRIDE-3 trial evaluating V116 in vaccine-naive adult, the first of 4 current Phase III trial. We have taken a thoughtful and tailored approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidate designed to afford the protection by targeting strains posing the greatest risk to specific populations. I look forward to providing additional updates on the progress of our pneumococcal program for VAXNEUVANCE, V116 and V117, our investigational candidate, specifically targeting pediatric disease.\nTurning to oncology. We continue to build on the momentum in earlier-stage cancers. We announced that the FDA has accepted our application of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection based on the results of the ongoing KEYNOTE-091 trial. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of January 29, 2023. However, further data may be provided during the review process that may delay this date.\nAt the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June, we provided expanded analyses and presented data on new endpoints in key subgroups 4, KEYNOTE-716, for the adjuvant treatment in Stage IIb and IC melanoma, KEYNOTE-522 in neoadjuvant, adjuvant high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and KEYNOTE-564 in adjuvant RCC.\nWe are also delivering on our regulatory strategy outside the United States. Notable actions include 4 approvals for KEYTRUDA from the European Commission based on KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIb or 2C melanoma; KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 in MSI high and/or mismatch repair deficient tumors in 5 different cancer types; and KEYNOTE-826 in certain types of persistent recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.\nIn addition, we received a positive EU CHMP opinion for adjuvant treatment with LYNPARZA for patients with serotypes of high-risk early-stage breast cancer based on the Phase III OlympiA trial. And finally, we are encouraged by the positive readout of KEYNOTE-869 or EV-103 and first-line urothelial cancer, which is in collaboration with Seagen.\nNext, I want to discuss our ongoing efforts to treat prostate cancer. Prostate cancer impacts millions of men and those with advanced disease have low rates of 5-year survival. We continue to generate insight about prostate cancer from our ongoing work, and we remain focused on improving patient outcomes. Business development and licensing remains a key element of our strategy to build and maintain a strong and diverse pipeline.\nEarlier this month, we announced a global development and commercial relation agreement with Orion for its investigational oral, steroid synthesis inhibitor, ODM-208, which is currently in Phase II development for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\nODM-208 targets cytochrome P450 11A1, a novel approach that is complementary to our broad-based prostate cancer program, which includes the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-921, KEYTRUDA with antiandrogen therapy based on KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-991 and LYNPARZA with anti-androgen therapy based on the PROpel trial.\nNext, to COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO. The pandemic persist and SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. There are solid emerging evidence for the threat of resistance to antibody therapies from Omicron variants, notably B4 and B5. The rate of transmission and increased hospitalizations with these variants reinforces the need for multiple effective antiviral treatment options, especially for those most vulnerable. For high-risk patients, evidence continues to show that prompt therapeutic intervention improved outcome.\nImportantly, a large proportion of high-risk individuals, including older adults, are likely receiving additional medications for chronic conditions. LAGEVRIO's low propensity for drug-drug interaction avoids the need to adjust existing dosing regimen and monitor liver and kidney functions during treatment, which can facilitate timely intervention for appropriate patients. Recently, data reported from Denmark, Hong Kong and Poland have provided support for the utility of LAGEVRIO in real-world settings. We plan to share more data as they become available.\nTo conclude, I am proud of the advancements across our pipeline to date and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific progress in the future.\nAnd now I will turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Dean. Alan, we're ready for the Q&A session. If you could please assemble the queue.",

My name is Grace Lacrae, an LBR Conference Operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Co Q1 Sales & Earnings Conference call. All eyes have been placed on mute to prevent any...\n\nand after the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. And to withdraw your question, please press the pound.\n\nThank you. I would like to turn the call over to Peter Denenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you, Grace, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2022 conference call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nCaroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer, and Dr. Dean Lee, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these items from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation and our press release.\n\nI would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statement.\n\nOur FCC filings, including item 1A and the 2021 10K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement.\n\nDuring today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks.\n\npresentation, today's earnings release, as well as our FEC filings are all posted to the investor relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\n\nThanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I get started, let me take a moment to speak about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.\n\nWe are hopeful for an immediate and peaceful resolution to the Russian invasion of the country, and we support the Ukrainian people and stand with them, and recognize what a terrible tragedy this represents.\n\nMerck is making every effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and to ensure essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach patients.\n\nIn addition, we are dedicating meaningful resources to address the humanitarian crisis in the country through multiple channels.\n\nTurning to our business, we continue to deliver across our key strategic priorities in the first quarter. We're sustaining the strong business momentum we delivered in 2021 with robust top and bottom line growth.\n\nWe've also achieved significant clinical advancements across our research pipeline and successfully integrated Excelron.\n\nWe've had a strong start to 2022, achieving very strong top and bottom line growth.\n\nCommercially, we continue to execute well across a broad set of key growth drivers, most notably, Gertruda, Sardicil, and Animal Health. Our performance reflects robust underlying demand for our de-risk innovative portfolio and reinforces the importance of our science-led strategy.\n\nFor Gebrio, our COVID-19 antiviral treatment was a significant contributor as well, but even excluding these sales, our top-line growth was still a very healthy 19% versus last year.\n\nOn the Gavrio, we've accelerated broad global access, and it's now established as an important tool for patients and health care providers to address the ongoing pandemic.\n\nSince receiving emergency use authorization in December , we've delivered approximately 6.4 million courses to more than 30 countries.\n\nThe success we are achieving is reflected in our updated 2022 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation for another year of strong growth and overall business momentum. Oncology business is benefiting from the continued rollout of new and important indications. Including an earlier lines of therapy.\n\nGlobal demand for Gardasil remains strong and growth will benefit from increased supply as a result of the significant investments we are making to expand manufacturing capacity and our animal health business remains positioned to grow at above market rate.\n\nLonger term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion through 2025.\n\nWe're preparing for the post-Katruda LLE period by continuing to strengthen the levers we have and building upon them in order to deliver long-term growth.\n\nIn oncology, we remain committed to building on the foundational position that we have achieved with Patruda, and we aim to expand our presence in this key therapeutic area and to establish an enduring leadership position.\n\nIn addition, we'll continue to maximize the opportunities we see for our durable growth drivers, such as Gardasil, our pneumococcal portfolio, and animal health through our proven commercial execution.\n\nBeyond our existing portfolio, business development remains a key priority.\n\nWe remain highly focused in our pursuit of the best external innovation and will be appropriately aggressive when great science and value align. We have a strong track record of business development, but we know we need to do more, and we believe we are well positioned to quickly deploy capital towards the right strategic assets as they present themselves.\n\nAnd finally, we'll continue to advance our broad pipeline across key therapeutic areas in order to deliver medically important innovations to patients.\n\nWe've taken important steps to provide increased transparency into the opportunities we see in our portfolio and our business, including through two recent investor events.\n\nEarlier this month, we provided a detailed description of our growing cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline. At Merck, we're focusing our efforts where the needs are greatest and where we have the best opportunity to positively impact patients' lives, including heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis.\n\nWe've made significant advancements across our CV pipeline and believe our broad, differentiated portfolio can have meaningful impacts on patients' lives with at least eight potential new approvals by 2030.\n\nWe're confident that these important innovations have the potential to be meaningful growth drivers for Merck well into the next decade.\n\nAnd in February , we hosted our inaugural ESG event, which highlighted our activities in our four priority areas of access to health, employees, environmental sustainability, and ethics and values.\n\nOur ESG efforts are grounded in our company's values and we look forward to building on Merck's legacy of operating responsibly going forward.\n\nBefore I close, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Roy Baines, who has announced his retirement after eight years at Merck.\n\nRoy has been instrumental in helping become a leading oncology company, particularly through his leadership and the development of the CRUDA.\n\nWe wish Roy the best in his future endeavors, and we're confident that he leaves behind an outstanding team and program.\n\nI'm pleased to report that Dr. Elias Barr was appointed to succeed Roy. Elias not only has deep experience having served in several research capacities throughout his more than two decades at Merck, but also has an unwavering commitment to patients consistent with Merck's purpose to save and improve lives.\n\nIn summary, we've begun 2022 with strong operational momentum, and I want to express my sincere thanks to our employees worldwide for their continued focus and commitment. We remain confident in our fundamental strategy, our growth prospects, and in our ability to deliver significant benefits for patients and value to shareholders well into the future. With that, I'll\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we have had a very strong start to 2022 with exceptional performance in both revenues and earnings.\n\nThese results further demonstrate that our focus on science and innovation at the core of our strategy, enabled by excellent execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe, is delivering value for patients, customers, and investors.\n\nTotal company revenues were $15.9 billion, an increase of 50%.\n\nThe Ghebrios contributed $3.2 billion in revenue.\n\nExcluding Luguevrio, the base business delivered very strong growth of 19 percent. The remainder of my\n\nOur human health business continued its strong momentum, excluding LeGabrieux, the human health business grew 21%, driven primarily by our key pillars, as well as the reduced impact of the pandemic.\n\nOur animal health business also delivered above-market performance, with sales increasing 9%, driven by growth across both companion animal and livestock segments.\n\nIn oncology, Keytruda grew 27% to $4.8 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand and the expansion into new indications.\n\nIn the U.S., Keytruda continues to demonstrate strong growth across all key tumors and is benefiting from recent launches in earlier stage cancers.\n\nincluding triple negative breast, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\n\nKeytruder is currently approved to treat five indications in earlier stage cancers, and we are excited about the potential opportunity to expand into adjacent lung cancer based on the encouraging data from keynotes 91.\n\nWe continue to be confident that Keytruda's robust clinical data combined with physicians' familiarity and experience with the product will support expanded use and patient benefit in early stage disease.\n\nIn the metastatic setting, Keytruda continues to maintain its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients.\n\nOutside the US, ketoated growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma.\n\nLimpasa remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Our Alliance revenue grew 20%, driven by uptake in metastatic breast cancer.\n\nWe are also excited by the expanded opportunity in early-stage breast cancer following the recent FDA approval based on the Olympia study.\n\nFurther, we look forward to potentially reaching a broad prostate population based on the PROPEL study.\n\nLenzima Alliance revenue also had very strong growth, driven by uptake following the launches of Keynote 581 in advanced renal cell carcinoma and Keynote 775 in metastatic endometrial cancer, where we are seeing encouraging new patient share trends across each of these tumor types.\n\nLymphoma growth also benefited from increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma in China and certain one-time ices.\n\nWe are also excited by the launch of Wellyreg for patients with certain VHL associated tumours.\n\nWelly-Rec continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers, and patients.\n\nAlthough still early in its launch, Rolireg has had strong uptake, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need for these patients.\n\nWe are working to potentially extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future.\n\nOur vaccines portfolio again delivered excellent performance, led by Gardasil, which increased 60% to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn the U.S., sales increased due to the timing of CDC purchase.\n\nGlobal demand for Gardasil remains robust, supported by strong clinical and real-world data, as well as efforts to increase the recognition of Gardasil as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males.\n\nIn our hospital acute care portfolio, Viridian cells grew 20% driven by the ongoing recovery in surgical procedures during the quarter and continued strong leadership of the neuromuscular blockade reversal agent class.\n\nOur animal health business delivered another quarter of robust growth, with sales increasing 9%.\n\nCompanion animal sales increased 13% driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the Brevecto line of products as well as vaccines.\n\nLivestock sales increased 7% due to higher demand in ruminants and poultry.\n\nI will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GET basis.\n\nGrowth margin was 70.7 percent, a decrease of 5.9 percentage points, driven primarily by higher Ligure 3.0 sales.\n\nAs a reminder, we share profits from Lagevrio equally with our partner Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin percentage.\n\nGrowth margin this quarter also reflects the favourable impact of product mix offset by higher manufacturing costs.\n\nOperating expenses increased 7% to $4.8 billion as we continue to prudently invest behind our growth drivers and pipelines.\n\nOther expense was approximately $140 million. Our tax rate was...\n\nTaken together, we earned $2.14 per share.\n\nTurning now to our 2022 Non-Gap Guidance.\n\nAs a reminder, at the request of the SEC, certain companies in our industry, including ours, have made changes to non-GAAP reporting.\n\nWe will no longer exclude significant expenses for upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions from non-GAAP results.\n\nAs a result, $1.7 billion of R&D charges, primarily related to the acquisition of Pandion, are now included in our recast 2021 non-GAAP results.\n\nThis increased R&D expense by $1.7 billion and decreased non-GAAP EPS by 65 cents.\n\nthere was no impact to the first quarters of 2021 and 2022.\n\nOur 2022 guidance does not assume any significant transactions that would have previously been excluded from non-GAP, so this could change in the future quarters if we execute business development which is a strategic priority.\n\nThe underlying strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year guidance.\n\nWe now expect revenues to be between $56.9 and $58.1 billion, representing growth of 17 to 19 percent, or 11 to 12 percent, excluding LaGhevria and the impact from foreign exchange.\n\nThe projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of approximately $200 million using mid-April rates, resulting in a full-year negative impact of just over 2%.\n\nwe are increasing our growth margin expectation to between 74 and 74.5 percent.\n\nwe expect operating expenses of $20.3 to $21.3 billion.\n\nAt the midpoint, it is consistent with what was implied by our prior guidance.\n\nWe expect other expense of approximately $350 million.\n\nWe assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5% due to an increase in estimated US taxes to be paid on foreign income.\n\nWe assume 2.53 billion shares outstand.\n\nTaken together, we have increased our expected EPS range to $7.24 to $7.36, representing pull-through of the operational strength from our key pillars and operating expense leverage, offset in part by a slight reduction in the top end of our Ligebrio sales assumption, the increase in our tax rate, and an incremental 1% headwind from foreign exchange using mid-April rates.\n\nAs you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on.\n\nFirst on Logevrio, we are narrowing the range of our full year guidance to $5 billion to $5.5 billion.\n\nWe have entered into supply and purchase agreements for approximately 10 million courses of therapy.\n\nSince authorization, we delivered 6.4 million courses of therapy, including 5 million in the first quarter.\n\nWe expect approximately half of the remaining school year revenue from LaGabria in the second quarter.\n\nWe continue to expect strong annual growth for Gardasil, especially in ex-U.S. markets including China.\n\nFinally, as a reminder, our other revenue line contains several items including supply sales to Organon, which we began recording upon the completion of the spin-off last year, and to Johnson & Johnson for its COVID vaccine.\n\nAlso included are our revenue hedge and royalty.\n\nOther revenue in first quarter also benefited from approximately $100 million in receipts relating to out-licensing agreements.\n\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritise investments in our business and pipeline to drive near and long-term growth.\n\nWe will continue to be appropriately aggressive in augmenting our internal pipeline through strategic business development, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities.\n\nWe remain committed to the dividend with the goal of increasing it over time.\n\nTo the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchase.\n\nTo conclude, we remain very confident in the growth of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines.\n\nWe are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and our shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to\n\nThank you, Carolyn. It is good to be here to provide an update on our progress.\n\nIn the first quarter, we continue to demonstrate progress in our pipeline.\n\nWe made advances across multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, in both advanced and earlier stages of cancer, as well as in cardiovascular disease and vaccines. I will also provide\n\nIn oncology, we continue to build upon our strong position and execute on our strategy to expand, deepen, and extend benefits to patients and diversify our imprint on patients.\n\npast quarter, we achieved milestones in several tumor types as well as different stages of disease.\n\nNotably, we continue to expand our treatment impact in earlier stages of disease where we now have six approvals from the FDA, five for Keytruda and one for Lympharzoid.\n\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology Virtual Plenary Session. Last month, data from the Keynote 91 or PEARLS trial, evaluating Keytruda for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage 1b to 3a non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection were presented.\n\nAt an interim analysis, Petruta significantly improved disease-free survival in all comers, one of the study's dual primary\n\nThe trial will continue to analyze the other dual primary endpoints of disease-free survival in patients whose tumors express high levels of CDL1.\n\ndid not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis.\n\nThese latest data provide a strong signal for the benefit of Katruda and the adjuvant treatment.\n\nAdditional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer include\n\nKeynote 671, which is evaluating neoadjuvant therapies for patients with respectable 2, 3A, and 3B disease.\n\nKeynote 867, which is studying stereotactic body radiotherapy with or without Keytruda in adults with unreceptive stage one or two disease, and Keylink 12, where we are studying Keytruda in combination with Lamparza in stage three disease.\n\nFollowing the approval of Keytruda for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with stage 2b or 2c melanoma following complete resection based on keynote 715.\n\nWe announced that at a pre-specified interim analysis, the study also met its secondary endpoints of distance metastasis-free survival and showed continued improvement in recurrence-free survival compared to preceded.\n\nThe data from Keynote 716 reinforces the evidence for Keytruda as adjuvant therapy for appropriate patients with stage 2B and 2C following surgery to help prevent recurrence of disease.\n\nNow, similarly, in the earlier stage setting, along with AstraZeneca, we announced Lemprasa was approved by the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with germline BRCA mutations with HER2 negative high-risk early breast cancer.\n\npreviously treated with chemotherapy, either before or after surgery, based on the Olympiac study.\n\nFurther, in women's cancer, we received FDA approval for Keynote 158 for the treatment of patients with microsatellite instability high or mismatch repair deficient advanced endometrial carcinoma based on new data for Keynote 158.\n\nNow, this approval is the fourth gynecologic cancer approval for Keytruda and marks a fifth approval derived from the Keynote 158 trial, an innovative trial designed to evaluate the use of predictive tumor biomarkers in patients receiving Keytruda for advanced solid tumor.\n\nAlong with AstraZeneca, positive results were presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancer Symposium for the PROPEL trial, evaluating Limparza in combination with Everetinone as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic, catheter-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nwith and without mutations in a group of homologous recombination with therapy.\n\nshowed an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival versus the standard of care. These early results also showed a trend towards improved overall survival.\n\nTrial will continue to assess this key secondary endpoint, and we plan to engage with health authorities to discuss the findings with the aim of bringing this important option to appropriate patients. Prostate cancer represents.\n\nand we are continually gaining important insights into the biology.\n\nWe are keen on making an impact for patients with late stage disease.\n\nLast month, we announced the discontinuation of the Keeling 10 study, evaluating the combination of Keytruda and Lamparza for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nThe study showed no evidence of superiority to abiratinone and to lutemide with respect to overall survival and radiographic progression freezing.\n\nour attention in metastatic catheter-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nNow shift to Keynote 9-2-1, a study exploring the combination of Keynote 9-2-1 and Keynote 9-2-1.\n\nKeynote 641, which is evaluating the combination of Keytruda and Enzalutamide.\n\nOutside of the United States, we continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy.\n\nNotable actions include positive CHMP opinions for cervical, MSI-HIV, and early-stage breast cancer in Europe , and approvals for the combination regimen of Keytruda plasmidema for advanced renal cell carcinoma.\n\nAnd finally, to coincide with ASCO, in early June we are planning to host an investor event in Chicago.\n\nAt our recent cardiovascular investor event, we showcased our growing portfolio programs targeting a range of conditions, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and thrombosis.\n\nFollowing the completion of our acquisition of Excella and Pharma, we are making strong progress in advancing the development of Cipatercept, a potential first in class valuable activin receptor type 2A fusion.\n\nWe recently completed enrollment for the stellar trial ahead of schedule.\n\nstellar is a first of four ongoing phase three studies evaluating\n\nThis progress reflects enthusiasm from investigators regarding this novel investigational method.\n\nFor the first time, the 2022 American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Failure Society of America's Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure included your Q vote, which we collaborate on with our partner, Bayer.\n\nas a class 2B recommendation for the treatment of stage C heart failure with reduced ejection pressure.\n\nThe guideline highlights the mechanism of FGC, such as vertubo, and the potential benefits of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP. Based on evidence.\n\nCurcuvo is the first drug specifically studied and approved for patients with worsening heart failure and the only drug recommended in the new guidelines for these patients.\n\nOur ongoing VICTOR study is designed to expand on the evidence to date by evaluating VIRCUBO in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who have not experienced a recent worsening heart failure.\n\nMerck is uniquely positioned to meaningfully impact the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease with at least eight potential approvals by 2030, including vertebral and stable heart failure and cicatriceps, as well as our pipeline of candidates, including an inhaled soluble guanylate cyclate stimulator, a factor 11 inhibitor, and an oral PCSK9 inhibitor.\n\nAs the pandemic evolves, there continues to be regional surges in infection rates with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants.\n\nSome of these strains are resistant to specific monoclonal antibody regimens and appear able to evade some vaccine protection, highlighting the importance of testing and the availability of antiviral options.\n\nAt the recent European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, we presented phase three virology outcomes data from move out, adding to the growing body of evidence for the antiviral properties of Legevra.\n\nParanoramic trial evaluating novel antivirals for early treatment, which is being sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the UK government, and the MUVA-HEAD trial evaluating Leghevrial for post-exposure prophylaxis are both ongoing.\n\nWe are working collaboratively with the European Medicines Agency to provide additional data from these trials in order to secure and improve.\n\nwe remain confident in the safety and efficacy of LaGavrio in appropriate patients. In particular, we believe its low propensity for drug-drug interactions makes it an important option for patients.\n\nNext, on our pneumococcal program. Earlier this month, the FDA extended the PDUFA date for the Supplemental Biologics License Application for Vaccine Rents. Our 15-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infants and children to July 1st, 2022.\n\nThe agency requested additional analyses of data, which we provided. Importantly, no new studies were requested.\n\nAlso in our new MoCAPA program, we received breakthrough therapy designation for V116.\n\nour investigational PCV that is designed to target serotypes responsible for approximately 80 percent of the residual invasive disease in the older adult population and includes eight unique serotypes not in currently licensed vaccines. We look forward to\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank Lloyd Baines for his many contributions to Merck over the past eight years.\n\nAs we build upon his legacy, I'm constantly reminded of Roy's wisdom and teachings.\n\nand I am grateful to work with a remarkable team he has trained and mentored. One of those mentees, of course.\n\nElliot's experience and commitment to Merck's purpose of saving and improving lives makes him the ideal leader of our global clinical development program.\n\nElliot has a wealth of experience, holding leadership roles across an array of therapeutic areas during his 27 years at Merck, including vaccine, infectious disease, and oncology.\n\nI look forward to continuing to partner with Elliot to build upon Merck's legacy of innovation and breakthrough science.\n\nThank you, Dean. Grace, if you could please begin the Q&A. And we request that analysts limit themselves to one question each today to get to as many analysts as possible. Thank you.\n\nTo ask a question, you will need to press star, then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. Again, for the question, you may press star, then the number 1 on your telephone keypad.\n\nYour first question comes from the line of Carter Gold from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Adam Ronsford-Carter.\n\nWe wanted to ask about Gardasil, if you could talk about any impacts you're seeing in China, either from a demand perspective or disruptions to manufacturing, and in that context, should we think about cadence or should we think about cadence over the year being notably different than in the years past? There's just a lot of different crosswinds in play, so any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nGardasil continues to be a great growth driver for our company, globally.\n\nsaw strong performance in the quarter and we expect continued strong performance as we go through this year.\n\nas they're off fled as a result of COVID and potentially lockdown.\n\nWe have the ability to ensure that we're supplying more of the Gardasil doses to other parts\n\nSo we're therefore not anticipating a significant impact to our Gardasil performance in China as a result of what we're seeing.\n\nAs it pertains to our supply chain, our company has a very robust supply chain.\n\nAnd we have plan A and plan B if there are any interruptions in the supply chain. So we again...\n\nthe reliability of our supply chain, but we remain vigilant and focused on the situation at hand.\n\nAnd next up we have Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo, Carolina.\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. So, one question we are getting a lot is, how do you feel about a potential challenge from a competitor or for PD-L1 and TIGIT combo potentially looking better than KITUDA and first-line PD-L1 high lung cancer? Do you see this as a major threat, especially looking at the phase 2 data from that competitor, TIGIT? Thank you.\n\nThank you for that question. So, you know, I just want to emphasize the question focuses on the addition of another checkpoint inhibitor digit on top of a\n\nAnd really, we have a PIDGET program, but we're also...\n\nSo the field will have to sort of see as the data evolves how much does PIDGET add to PD-1 in the long-term?\n\nBut I do want to make a broader sort of comment, which is you'll see movements and digits. There was recently movement and, you know.\n\nWhat you recognize is each of those combinations, what they do is, if you're able to show a benefit of the additional agent, it doesn't have as broad of an impact as P.\n\nhighlight is our strategy is not to just be invested in lag three, not to be just invested in CTLA-4, not to be invested in CTLA-5.\n\nNext up I have Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim, your line is open. Great, thanks for the question. I just really wanted to focus in on SITAS.\n\nIf you guys could just help us understand what is being done in the clinical trial.\n\nmanage closely the risk that sort of a subjective endpoint represents or\n\nthat the, you know, magnitude of the difference that you saw in the phase two will comfortably cover the challenges of the six-minute walk test that we've seen in some other studies given some placebo responses that raise levels of concern. So just love to get your thoughts there. Thanks so much. Yeah, so thank you so much for...\n\nSo, you know, just to reemphasize, we have three different trials all driving towards somewhat different outcomes. The six-minute walk, which is the stellar trial. There's also time for clinical work.\n\nIn relationship to the first one, which is Stellar, which is related to what you said, the six-minute walk.\n\nwhere we saw actually quite impressive data.\n\nWe have very committed patient groups as well as sites who are very well-trained in how to do these trials, and the phase two was, you know, was really nice data.\n\nSo, I think, you know, we're confident, we'll see what that data is, but the best predictor of how well we can manage those trials is really the best indicator is the Phase II, and we're using very many of the same sites.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. I'm just a two-parter around kind of corporate structure. I guess first, business development landscape, I know you talk about this as a priority. I guess it's been another kind of quarter of week equity market performance on the biotech side. So I guess, are you seeing any change in willingness on the part of some of the targets to engage or any resets and valuations that could enable some of these business development kind of activities to move forward?\n\nAnd then Rob, just a kind of a tangential question on that is, you know, broadly across the pharma group, I think we've been seeing asset divestitures of nontraditional pharma business.\n\nI know you've viewed animal health as more core to the company, but have your thoughts evolved at all, I guess, as your time as CEO , and when you look at your implied kind of core firm evaluation, given where some of the animal health multiples trade? So to any incremental perspective there, it would be appreciated. Thanks. Great. Chris, thanks for the question. Thanks for the question.\n\nThe short answer is we are not seeing a fundamental shift in seller expectations as of this point. You know, I think as time continues, if we see the market reset to become more permanent and more importantly, if the IPO market continues to be challenged for biotech companies.\n\nThat might change over time as companies become more cash-constrained. There are some smaller players that do have cash challenges, so I think that's where you could see the movement first, but fundamentally, we've not seen the change in the landscape yet. We'll have to continue to watch. With regards to the animal health business.\n\nYou know, our view continues to be that the animal health business, as you said, is core.\n\nto the company, it's core to our strategy as part of a growth driver for the company.\n\nBut as we've always said, we look at this regularly. We always are challenging ourselves to ask, what is the long-term value creation opportunity of this business in our hands?\n\nrelative to what would it be outside the company, and on a long-term view, we continue to believe it is best in our hands as part of the company, but if that...\n\nsituation evolves, we obviously will continue to be objective in how we analyze that, but we do not look at the short term.\n\narbitrage opportunity. For us, it's more about the long-term value creation, and that has not changed as of now. Thanks.\n\nThank you. Next up we have Chris Srivattani from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\n\nThank you. Good morning. If I could ask questions on Keytruda, the strength, particularly out of the U.S. this quarter. If you could help us with some of the underpinnings there, and relatedly, longer-term 2025. I think you framed how, Keytruda, your objective is to have, I guess, the wording change slightly. You were previously looking for 30 percent coming from adjuvant with your focus framed around the U.S.\n\nIf I'm reading it correctly, you've brought in the framework here to now think about it as 25% on a global basis. Maybe update us on where you feel you are in terms of making progress towards achieving those objectives of the adjuvant revenue contribution. Thank you.\n\nYeah. So, Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question, then Caroline can...\n\nCan jump in for the second part, you know, on the strength of the growth we're seeing in the United States. This is really a.\n\nto what we've been talking about all along, which is, as we continue to roll out new indications.\n\nWe are continuing to see our share grow as.\n\nas the leading IO agent, and importantly, I would highlight that the growth we saw among other things in the quarter, continuation of our position in renal cell carcinoma, continuation of the growth we're seeing in head and neck.\n\nIn RCC, obviously, being a first-line treatment in the metastatic setting, as well as now having adjuvant therapy as well, we've covered pretty much the waterfront of RCC, and we have the opportunity to continue to grow there. But the standout, frankly, for the quarter, and it's, I think, really important to understand is triple negative breast cancer, both in the metastatic setting and in the adjuvant setting. We are seeing incredible growth in that space.\n\nand it's something that we feel very proud of because I think we're going to have a meaningful difference there.\n\nMy reason to highlight that is both if you look at the adjuvant opportunity there and the growth we're getting, as well as what I mentioned in adjuvant RCC.\n\nI think it just reinforces what we see as the future, which is the growth contribution from the earlier lines of therapy long-term. But with that, maybe Caroline can be specific to some of the guidance we've provided. So to Rob's point, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we have for adjuvant and the impact that that has on patients. We initially shared that we expected 50% of our growth to come from adjuvant, representing 30% of the U.S. citizens.\n\nWe have now extended that to say 50% of the growth will come from adjuvants, representing 25% of our global business in the year 2025. And to Rob's point, our early introductions into the earlier stage cancers, with five indications now in Keytruda, are putting us on a very good course to have this impact. Great.\n\nThank you. Next we have Umar Afad from Evercore Eyes Eye. Your line is open.\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe let me touch up on Malno-Perevier real quick. I think the total utilization to date is about 200,000 courses through mid-April. And it looks like, at least based on third-party data sets, that the Pfizer regimen is getting used 8 to 10x more than Malno-Perevier.\n\nso i guess my question is if only a couple hundred thousand courses have been used through mid-april and three point one million courses were contracted the u s is there any recourse for u s to return a chunk of the course is back and i'm asking because of the field of the recording p and i want to make sure they're permanent sales\n\nYeah, I'll let Caroline maybe address this. So, Irma, thanks for the question. First, let me start with proud of monipiravir, look at the impact that it can have on the world. And it has impact to the comments that Dean made, given its importance, especially in patients that have drug-to-drug interactions.\n\nThe data that we have access to suggests that we have actually had utilization by 500,000 patients globally at this stage.\n\nWe have shipped 6.4 million courses as of now.\n\nthose shipments represent expectations for utilization over a period of time. And we're actually seeing extremely strong utilization, especially in ex-US markets, where the statistics you quote are actually reversed in some of the markets. We have a very strong market share.\n\nSo as we sit here today, we've guided on the 5 to 5.5 billion based on the contracts that we have in hand, and we are confident in that in our financials.\n\nThank you. Next we have Dana Graybush from SVP Leroy. Your line is open.\n\nHi, thank you for requesting the question. I have another one on Keytruda and early stage. Can you please talk to how the success of updevo plus chemotherapy and neoadjuvant lung cancer changes your expectations or strategy for the early stage opportunities in lung cancer and in any other.\n\nYeah, thank you very much for that question in relationship to sort of just earlier stage.\n\nlung cancer. I think it's really important to emphasize there's a series of different ways to approach it. One is neoadjuvant adjuvant.\n\nAnd I just think all of these signals just demonstrate throughout a variety of different\n\nstudies just the impact that PD-1s can have. So our point of view of it is it shouldn't change our strategy, it should just make our strategy pretty comprehensive.\n\nThe fundamental thing is we have Keynote 91, which is in the adjuvant, so that's post-surgery, and that's usually given by a medical oncologist.\n\ndisease-free survival was positive in all comers, regardless of PD-L1.\n\nThere was a trend to TPS greater than 50%, but not statistically significant. And OS, it was a favorable trend regardless of PDL.\n\nSo, we'll be letting that data mature as we continue to discuss with the FDA. But going to your point, it's not just Keno 91, it's Keno 671, it's Keno 867, it's Key Link 12. It's all in the earlier stage, so our desire to really push that earlier stage is going to be...\n\nIf anything, our commitment towards that is even greater. The one thing I would just add in relationship to some of the comments that Caroline and Rob made.\n\nis that I think it's very important to think about melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and triple negative breast cancer, where at least my experience being in the hospital, there's a concept of really looking at that earlier stage. I think uptake may be sort of built in the medical.\n\nI think all of us, including us and other companies, as well as patient advocacies and medical centers, are going to have to require diligent investment to really, really maximize the important scientific impacts of Keytruda and PD-1s and PD-L1s in the early lung space. Great, thank you.\n\nThank you. Next we have Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nThank you. I'd just like to thank Roy for all the contributions and insights over the years. The question is on your factor 11 monoclonal. Given your background in cardiology, and I'm sure familiarity with hemostasis, there's clearly been a number of indications where the DOAC\n\nwere unsuccessful compared to Warfarin for both efficacy and safety, potentially speaking to different underlying mechanisms for thrombosis and the different indications. I'm thinking about ESUS, I'm thinking about mechanical heart valves. Given what you know about Factor XI biology and the intrinsic pathway nature of the inhibition, what indications would you actively avoid or be somewhat cautious about taking?\n\na factor 11 inhibitor into, be it yours or someone else's.\n\nYeah, so let me just step back for just a moment that the benefit risk of whether it's platelet or coagulation factors in terms of clotting is something that's actually very topical in the news. I would just emphasize, you know, for years, for probably a decade or more, you know, aspirin has been just everywhere. And recently, people realized the benefit risk, one has to be very careful.\n\nThere has been a major change in the guidelines. So that impacts how I.\n\nThe other sort of thing that I impact is, if you look at Factor XI, the fundamental advantage of that is that you can get blockage of the coagulation cascade with, by genetics, very little impact in relationship to adverse effects.\n\nAnd so for me, the critical thing is to prove that as quickly as possible. So we immediately go, where is the problem where thrombosis and bleeding is both impacted?\n\nAnd so that's why we ran and studied renal disease. But I could see in the future.\n\nyou know, mechanical devices, you know, I would, you know, one of my favorite sort of things is left ventricular assist device. I think those.\n\nwill continue to need to be monitored in the future. So that's a place where the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis is really high. Where we have chosen to be a little bit...\n\nis, for example, broader sort of things such as atrial fibrillation and the risk relationship to stroke, because we look at the factor 10 as very effective.\n\nThere are bleeding complications, but to make a safety argument for it, you're talking about a very, very large...\n\nSo we are racing to places where the benefit risk of thrombosis and clotting and bleeding, where that differential would make something like a factor 11 have the biggest impact. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about your pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and how you think your more targeted approach will be a competitive advantage versus the one-size-fits-all that we're seeing now. And is there any precedence to what you're doing with V116 and 117? And maybe just lastly, how will you make that message clear to physicians? Since if everything goes as planned, you'll have several PCVs on the market. Thank you.\n\nYeah, first of all, we need to get the data to demonstrate that we have an advantage in the different patient populations. But I think you point out a really important point, which is essentially what we're trying to do is, for lack of a better word, we're, you know, you want to call it precision targeted vaccination, right? So, the fundamental thing is the 1, 1, 4 is adult approved and we're driving towards a pediatric approval for the 15 valence and so, you know, that will be in the pediatric population.\n\nIn the V116, where we have a breakthrough designation, we're trying to demonstrate that we can target 85% of the residual serotypes. And you know, I would just sit there and say it would be eight unique serotypes in relationship to all the different currently approved ones.\n\nAnd I think that patient population, you know, I reflect a little bit about COVID, but it's that older population that especially has risk factors who really want to make sure that that whole population, that adult population is covered. And so I do think the, you know, the fundamental thing is we'll have to have the data, but our concept is the adult.\n\nhave a different set of serotypes and they need to be protected, and we'll have to get the data to demonstrate that. But I think if we can demonstrate it, the uptake will be quite good.\n\nThank you. Next we have Meyer Goldstein from Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nThanks for taking the question. I'm just hoping maybe we can return for a second back to the question of novel targets in combination with Keytruda, and maybe if you could just give us a very high level perhaps rationale for which targets you're looking at and which indications, and I'm referring here obviously to things like TIGIT, LAG-3, ILT-3, and the like.\n\nAll right, so let me just sort of separate. So we always talk about expand, deepen, and extend. And when we talk about deepen, we're trying to get a deeper response with PD-1s. And there's a series of things that we do with what I call non-IO agents.\n\ntherapy. We're doing stuff with many other people as well as ourselves with ADCs. There are RAS programs that are advancing. So we think that\n\ncombination, there's large precedence throughout our portfolio already, and there will continue to be. And that's also true with Dima and Lampard.\n\nThe specific question I think you're driving to is combinations of IO with IO agents, and LAC-3, CTLA-4, and PIDGEN.\n\nSo, at least in our mind, we do recognize that, you know, there was demonstration of LAD3 adding to PD-1 in melanoma. And I think that's an important signal for us where we focused our efforts with LAD3.\n\nis in MFS-CRC. So we know that PD-1s work in MSI-HI, and no one's really been able to crack MFS-CRC, so that's very important, and also in classic Hodgkin's. I would say in relationship to CCLA-4, there was recent data with HCC.\n\nI would make a comment that I think would make some of the people from Merck smile a little bit. You know, we were the ones who actually did the study with PD-1 and CKLA-4 in relationship to lung.\n\nAnd we could not show a clear contribution of component for CCLA-4 over P.\n\nSo that is not a place that we think is an important place for patients and that is not a place that we're going because we have, we did the study to demonstrate that. Where we think there could be is clearly other people have recently released HDC, we're focused in, for example, in renal cell carcinoma and then PD-1 and Digit, our initial focus is in non-small cell lung cancer and also small cell lung cancer and we're advancing.\n\nseries of trials in that. So I hope that gave a comprehensive view of LAB3, CTLA-4, and TIGIT in relationship to IL-T4, other checkpoint inhibitors such as CD27, or in relationship to cytokines. I think the data that we're doing in earlier stages will have to play out for us to be able to answer that more clearly.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Mara. I think we have time for one more question and Rob will have a few closing comments.\n\nI think your last question comes from the line of Colin Brestow from UBS, your line is open.\n\nHey, good morning. Congrats on the quarter and also wanted to say all the best to Roy. It's been really great working with you and also congrats to Elliot. So I just wanted to piggyback on a Gardasil question.\n\nCould you maybe just give us a little more detail on how you expect the Gardasil supply to increase, and then maybe just help us think through what is the supply-demand mismatch right now? Some of your prior comments suggested that there may not be such, but I know you said supply has been a...\n\nan issue over the past sort of couple of years. So we'd love to get some expanded thoughts there. Thanks. Thank you.\n\nSo let me start first with the supply demand. There is significant demand for Gardasil. This.\n\nThe cancer-preventing vaccine in the HPV area has only reached today 9% of the global eligible population. So there is significant runway ahead of us to protect lives and to drive growth for Merck. Indeed, we've stated that we expect the revenue in the year 2030 to be double the $5.7 billion we achieved.\n\nSo we have significant opportunity ahead of us.\n\nIn order to achieve that opportunity, we are building new facilities that will be coming online from 2023, 4 and 5. So we're going to have a step up in the level of supply to the market that will happen over that period.\n\nSpecific then to this year, we will see a continuation of the supply into the market as we did in 2021, albeit not quite at the same step up that we achieved in 2021.\n\nSo we remain really confident in our ability to drive strong growth for Gardasil both in 2022 and the years to come.\n\nWell, just let me say thank you for your time and your interest today, and I'd just like to conclude by, again, thanking the Merck team globally for their focus and commitment, and really in driving the results you've heard about today, but in continuing to ensure we keep the purpose of the company front and center, which is to deliver for patients.",
    "content2": "Hopefully, you get the sense we are very confident in the business momentum we have. And I'd like to say as well, we are feeling better and better about the evolution of our pipeline. And I think you've heard today, we're starting to expand, we're doing all of the things we need to do. We have more to do, but we're making great progress. And that's why I have such confidence in the sustainability of our business long term. So we look forward.\n\nto continue to share these results with you to deliver for the patients that count on us and in turn bring value to the shareholders. So with that, I'd say thank you and have a great day."

My name is Grace Lakra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Co sales and earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Grace, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call.\nSpeaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we've excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.\nI would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020 10-K, identified certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.\nDuring today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks. The presentation, today's earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert M. Davis\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call.\n2021 has been a year of significant achievement and meaningful progress for Merck in the face of what has been a challenging environment for all of us. We deliver on our strategic priorities and took important steps to set a foundation for success in 2022 and beyond. We achieved strong operational performance, accelerated our broad pipeline, including monopirvir, completed the spin-off of Organon and acted on key strategic business development activities. We enter 2022 with strong momentum, and are pleased to reflect this in our initial revenue and EPS guidance. We continue to evolve with a more focused, more efficient and faster growing company, with an increased urgency to bring forward innovations to address critical unmet needs. This remains the core of our strategy to benefit the patients we serve, and in turn, create long-term value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nOur business achieved strong revenue and earnings growth. Total revenues increased 24% in the quarter and 17% for the full year. Commercially, we have executed extremely well across all of our key performance drivers, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. We delivered initial Monty Peter shipments to customers around the world, and following the FDA emergency use authorization that was granted in late December. We made meaningful progress towards our commitment to the U.S. government. Our dedicated teams worked diligently, including through the holiday season, to deliver 1.4 million courses of therapy to the United States, United Kingdom and other countries by year-end. Throughout 2021, we invested in the discovery, development, production and commercialization of medicines and vaccines, furthering the long-term sustainability of our business, all while delivering meaningful operating leverage and strong EPS growth. In total, 2021 was a year of strong execution of our strategic priorities across all fronts: operationally, commercially, clinically and financially.\nAs we look at 2022 and out to 2025 and beyond, we expect to achieve continued strong growth. Our oncology portfolio will benefit from the uptake of numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains robust, and further growth will be realized through the investments we are making to increase manufacturing capacity. And our Animal Health business remains very well positioned to grow faster than the market well into the future. Overall, we expect another year of strong revenue growth in 2022. While we will continue to make investments in our pipeline, we are confident that we can achieve a leveraged P&L and significant long-term operating margin expansion.\nLonger term, we are intensely focused on successfully navigating the headwind created by likely biosimilar competition to KEYTRUDA at the end of the decade. We aspire to grow through and beyond this period. But at the very least, we will look to minimize the headwind and shorten the time it takes to return to strong growth. We have multiple levers to achieve this task, driving sustained growth well into the next decade.\nFirst, we intend to strengthen our leadership in oncology broadly and leverage that position for sustained long-term success. We've done an excellent job of establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundational therapy, and we intend to maximize its opportunity and patient impact. In addition, we have an expanding portfolio of commercial and developmental oncology assets beyond KEYTRUDA, which offer meaningful growth opportunities beyond 2028.\nSecond, we have many important franchises beyond oncology that we expect can drive durable growth into the next decade, including GARDASIL, which we believe can potentially double by 2030, as well as our pneumococcal portfolio and our Animal Health business, to name a few.\nThird, we expect to generate very strong cash flow, which we intend to deploy into value-enhancing business development to augment our pipeline and bring additional drivers of longer-term growth.\nAnd fourth, we will advance our internal pipeline and the opportunities we see in vaccines, cardiometabolic, neuroscience and other disease areas. We are making extensive investments in discovery research as well, which we believe will be the source of longer-term innovation. As part of our commitment to provide more transparency into these efforts, we will host an investor event focused on our cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline in the spring.\nIn addition to accelerating our internal pipeline, as I noted, a key part of our strategy will be to deploy our cash flow towards value-enhancing business development. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in pursuing compelling external innovation. And we will supplement our pipeline with an approach that is science-led, but portfolio informed. Last year's acquisitions of Pandion and Acceleron are good examples of our approach.\nWe are taking calculated risks and we'll continue to focus on creating value in areas of unmet need. We have the operational capabilities, financial capacity, scientific prowess and sufficient runway before the end of the decade for business development to play an important role in our goal of achieving long-term sustainable growth. While we have a strong track record of business development, we know we need to do more.\nFinally, we've taken further steps to integrate important environmental, social and governance goals into the core of our business. In December, we completed the inaugural issuance of a $1 billion sustainability bond. We intend to use the net proceeds to support projects and partnerships in the company's priority ESG areas and to contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals.\nWe've also acted to accelerate global access for molnupiravir through our groundbreaking access strategy, including a recent agreement with UNICEF for up to 3 million courses of therapy to supplement supply available for distribution in low- and middle-income countries.\nIn addition, this morning, we announced plans to host our initial ESG investor event on February 23. We believe that strong performance across key ESG metrics aligns well with Merck's core values and mission. And we look forward to providing insights into our commitment to this space.\nNow before I turn the call over to Caroline, I want to take a moment to recognize Frank Clyburn. Following 14 years of significant contributions, Frank will be leaving Merck to become CEO of IFF. I want to thank Frank for the strategic vision and operational excellence he has provided in helping establish Merck as a global leader in oncology and for his strong leadership of our Human Health business. We wish Frank and his family all the best as he embarks on his new endeavor. While Frank will be missed, we are well positioned to continue our strong momentum with the deep and talented team we have in place, and we expect to announce new leaders shortly.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Caroline to provide details into the performance of our business as well as our financial results and outlook. Caroline?\n\nCaroline Litchfield\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning.\n2021 was a year of exceptional performance for our business. We drove robust top line growth of 17% and bottom line growth of 33%. Our teams performed with agility and executed with excellence despite challenges from the ongoing pandemic. We are also very proud of the significant efforts to bring Molnupiravir to patients worldwide. These results reinforce the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for strong growth. We will continue to invest in our portfolio and pipeline as well as in business development to maximize growth over the near and long term and to create value for patients and shareholders.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.5 billion, an increase of 24% or 23% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. Molnupiravir contributed $952 million in revenue or 9 percentage points of growth.\nThe remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis.\nOur Human Health business continued its strong momentum, growing 23%, driven by our key pillars and contribution from molnupiravir. Our Animal Health business also delivered robust performance with sales increasing 8%, driven by companion animal products.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands.\nIn oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 16% to $4.6 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors and is benefiting from the recent launches in neoedibant and adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and in cervical cancer. KEYTRUDA continues to extend its strong IO craft leadership and maintain its position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients despite competition. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck and RCC.\nWe continue to expand our reach into earlier lines. We were very pleased to receive 2 additional adjacent approvals this quarter in RCC and in melanoma. With these approvals, KEYTRUDA has now received 5 indications in earlier-stage cancers. If approved, we also look forward to expanding into adjuvant lung cancer following the encouraging top line results from the KEYNOTE-091 trial. We are confident that along with strong clinical data, KEYTRUDA's reputation and familiarity among physicians will be a benefit as we move into early stage disease.\nLynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Growth of 33% was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including prostate. Our expected launch in a broader prostate population based on the PROPEL trial represents a significant opportunity.\nLenvima sales grew 31%, driven by RCC and endometrial cancer in the U.S. We have seen very encouraging early trends in new patient share following the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line RCC.\nWe are also excited by the recent launch of Relireg for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Relireg continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients and is off to a promising start. We expect to extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future.\nOur Vaccines portfolio again delivered strong growth, driven by GARDASIL, which grew 50% to $1.5 billion and nearly 40% for the full year. Outside the U.S., robust growth was driven by strong underlying demand across all key geographies and particularly China as well as increased supply. This growth more than offset the decline in the U.S. due to timing of CDC purchases as well as the replenishment of the CDC stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2020. Also impacting HBV immunization levels was the prioritization of COVID vaccinations in younger age cohorts. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains strong, as it is increasingly being recognized as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both female and male.\nIn our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 24%, driven by increased usage of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and BRIDION's growing share within the class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales increasing 8%. Companion animal sales increased 26%, driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as vaccines.\nRecall that we experienced changes in distributor purchasing patterns, which negatively impacted last year's results. Livestock sales were flat, as strong global demand for poultry and swine products was offset by a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the recording of an extra month of sales relating to Antelliq in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nI will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nGross margin was 74.8%, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points. As a reminder, we share profits from Molnupiravir equally with our partner, Ritva, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin. This impact was largely offset by favorable mix and lower discards.\nOperating expenses increased 3% to $5.3 billion as we continued to invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $50 million. Our full year tax rate was 11.2%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to a more favorable mix of income and expense than previously estimated. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 4.3% reflects the impacts of the lower full year rate as well as foreign tax credit. Taken together, we earned $1.80 per share. It is worth noting that our underlying operating results were towards the upper end of our expectations and the contributions from Molnupiravir and the favorable tax rate resulted in EPS that exceeded our price guidance.\nTurning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance.\nWe believe the strong underlying momentum in our business will continue, and we will also benefit from increased Molnupiravir revenues. We expect revenue to be between $56.1 million and $57.6 billion, representing growth of 15% to 18%, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 74%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, driven in part by the addition of R&D expenses related to the Acceleron acquisition. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13% and 14%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.12 to $7.27, reflecting growth of 18% to 21%. This range includes the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% using mid-January rates.\nAs you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on.\nFirst, on Molnupiravir. We are excited by our regulatory authorizations to date and believe Molnupiravir will be an important treatment option to combat the ongoing pandemic. We have announced a number of supply and purchase agreements, providing approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Based on agreements now in place, we are confident in our ability to achieve $5 billion to $6 billion in revenues in 2022, weighted to the first half of the year.\nNext, we expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, which would benefit from increased expansion in ex U.S. market and the continued ramp of recent launches globally. On GARDASIL, we continue to expect robust demand along with increased supply to drive strong year-over-year growth, albeit not at the same pace as in 2021. In the U.S., increased uptake in the mid adult cohort as well as catch up from missed doses due to pandemic will drive growth. Outside the U.S. we continue to expect strong demand across regions, particularly in China and from a relaunch in Japan. Global HPV vaccination levels remain low, and we continue to believe GARDASIL's opportunity for growth is significant.\nIn pneumococcal, we are excited by the recent launch of Veeva in adults and the potential opportunity for approval in pediatric, which represents a larger portion of the new market. We expect some offset however from the impact to U.S. sales of Nemak 23 as the market continues to shift towards newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We also expect to experience modest LOE pressure on JANUVIA in the second half of 2022, as we lose exclusivity in some of the larger ex U.S. market.\nFor Animal Health, given our broad and innovative portfolio we are well positioned to again drive above-market growth in 2022 and beyond. Finally, as we look out to 2025, we remain confident in our ability to achieve strong revenue growth, driven largely by our derisked portfolio and operating margins in excess of 43%.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We also continue to augment our internal pipeline through strategic business development. We were active in 2021, including the acquisitions of Acceleron and Pandion, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases.\nTo conclude, our growth in the fourth quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and in the global demand of our innovative medicines and vaccines. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength. And our continued execution will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\n\nDean Y. Li\n\nExecutive VP & President of Merck Research Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone.\nI will provide a brief summary of notable achievements in 2021 and then report on progress since the last earnings call.\nIn 2021, we made meaningful advancements across our broader pipeline with approvals for new molecular entities, including ex Nuvan, Vercuvo and Wellreg, and an EUA fomonuperobir. We also made strides in women's cancers with U.S. regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA in cervical, endometrial and triple-negative breast cancer. In total, we received more than 30 approvals and filed more than 20 NDAs and SBLAs in the United States, EU, Japan and China. In 2022, we look to build on this progress and momentum.\nI will now cover notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates for our Molnupiravir , oncology, pneumococcal, HIV and cardiovascular programs.\nAs we enter the third year of the pandemic, the Omicron variant continues to reap havoc on our communities and health care systems. In the United States alone, we are now seeing approximately 2,000 deaths a day. Vaccines and treatment options have the potential to help combat this pandemic.\nSince the first renovation for Molnupiravir per by the U.K. in November, we have received authorizations in 9 additional countries, including an emergency use authorization in the United States and a special approval for emergency in Japan. In addition, other countries have provided authorizations to our voluntary license holders.\nFindings from the move-out clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of last year showed Molupiravir significantly reduced hospitalization or death in adult patients most in danger of progressing to severe disease. Importantly, for physicians and patients, approximately 90% fewer deaths were seen in those taking molnupiravir. These results reinforce ammonium can provide an important oral treatment option for certain adults at high risk for severe illnesses. The Director of the United States CDC has indicated the need to prioritize therapeutic interventions for people with the highest risk of progression, such as those with certain comorbidities. We believe Molnupiravir is a low propensity for drug-drug interactions make it a meaningful and important option for appropriate patients with COVID-19 who are receiving treatments for underlying conditions, such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, and for those with impaired liver or kidney function, consistent with local recommendations.\nTo date, this pandemic has consisted of successive waves of SARS-CoV2 variants, most recently, Omicron. Last week, we announced data from multiple independent studies indicating that Molnupiravir is active against the Omicron variant in vitro. Each surge comes with distinct public health and disease characteristics and corresponding treatment and prevention challenges. The potential threat of rapidly emerging variants reinforces the need for treatment options with high barrier to resistance that target ever solutionarily conserved aspects of viral biology.\nRecognizing the importance of an oral antiviral, we committed to manufacturing Molnupiravir and have it ready for supply to patients within the U.S. upon emergency use authorization. As Caroline noted, we were able to fulfill that promise and ensure delivery of this important treatment. We are working with governments and partners around the globe to stay ahead of the curve and to further Merck's contribution in fighting this pandemic.\nNext, we continue to fortify our position in oncology. Several recent milestones highlight our strategy of targeting earlier-stage cancers where there is potential for improved outcomes by reducing risk of recurrence. We received FDA and European Commission approval for KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for renal cell carcinoma and FDA approval for certain stages of melanoma. In RCC, approval was based on KEYNOTE 564, KEYTRUDA is the first and only immunotherapy treatment option for certain patients at intermediate high or high risk of recurrence in the adjuvant setting. And in melanoma, the approval was based on KEYNOTE 716 and and provides for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with Stage IIb and IC disease following complete resection. Both approvals provide patients with important new options shown to help reduce the risk of recurrence.\nSimilarly, we recently announced a positive finding from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARL study, evaluating KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment for patients with Stage Ib to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection. At an interim analysis, the trial met one of its dual primary end point, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival in all comers when treated with KEYTRUDA compared to placebo. The trial will continue to analyze DFS in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, the other dual primary end point which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis, as well as overall survival, a key secondary endpoint.\nWe are continuing to make progress in women's cancer based on data from the Phase III OLYMPIA trial. The FDA granted priority review for LYNPARZA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative, high-risk early breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy either before or after surgery. We anticipate FDA action during the first quarter of 2022.\nMoving to the broader portfolio.\nThe FDA issued a complete response letter for the new drug applications for gefapixent and have requested additional information related to the measurement of efficacy. There were no safety concerns for gefapixant. And we will continue with the FDA to discuss next steps as we look to address the significant unmet need in patients with chronic cough.\nIn Japan, we are pleased to announce the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved L, the trademark for gefapixant for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Momentum continues in our pneumococcal disease program, following the U.S. approval in July 2021, the European Commission approved a new events in individuals 18 years of age and older in December. Also in December, we announced the FDA granted priority review of our supplemental application for vaxNuvint in the pediatric setting. Importantly, vaNuvint incorporates serotypes 22F and 33 up and provides robust response on other key disease-causing serotypes, like serotype 3, therefore, offering the potential to prevent additional invasive disease in children. We anticipate regulatory action in the spring of this year.\nMerck has a proud legacy of HIV research, and we remain committed to those impacted by this virus. Following the announcement of the FDA clinical halt for ongoing trials evaluating ezlotevir, we are working to understand the data and the principles of the finding. We believe in the potential of the nucleoside reverse transcripted and translocation inhibitor mechanism for both the prevention and treatment of HIV. And we intend to share updates in the future.\nLooking across our broader pipeline. As Rob noted, in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Acceleron. Its lead candidate, statecept, is an excellent complement to our pipeline and has the potential to provide a novel approach to treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. The integration is proceeding according to plan, and the Phase III program is on track. We plan to provide further details on our cardiovascular pipeline at an investor event in the spring.\nIn closing, 2021 was a tremendous year where we demonstrate our ability to advance both our internal and external pipelines. We are well positioned to continue our momentum into 2022, with a dual focus: becoming the leading oncology company by 2025 and sustaining that position beyond 2028, while also extending our impact across other therapeutic areas. I look forward to providing further updates in the coming year. Now I turn the call back to Peter.\n\nPeter Dannenbaum\n\nVP of IR, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Dean. Grace, would you please start the Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. .",

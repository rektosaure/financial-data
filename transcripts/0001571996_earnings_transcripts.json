A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nActual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Paul, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to congratulate David on his appointment to CFO. We've worked together closely for the past couple of decades, and I look forward to what's ahead. Now, moving to our results. We delivered a strong third quarter with a record for both revenue and earnings per share, and an all-time high in AI server orders. Total revenue reached $27 billion, up 11%. CSG and ISG combined were up 13%. Year-to-date, total revenue was up 12%, with ISG revenue up 28%. EPS was up 17% to $2.59, driven by improved profitability in AI and storage, and continued operational scaling. Our strong performance and operational discipline led to continued robust cash flow and significant capital returns for shareholders.\nNow, let's move to AI, where momentum has accelerated meaningfully in the second half of the year, building on an already strong first half. AI server demand remained exceptionally strong. We booked $12.3 billion in orders in the quarter, bringing year-to-date orders to $30 billion, both record figures. The large-scale customer base continues to broaden, with expansion across Neoclouds, or tier two CSPs, and Sovereigns. Our strong orders and customer base expansion clearly shows customers value our unique ability to design, deploy, and maintain large at-scale AI factories, especially our engineering and rapid deployment capabilities. We have AI racks operational within 24 to 36 hours of delivery, with uptime exceeding 99%. We shipped $5.6 billion in AI servers during the quarter for a total of $15.6 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $18.4 billion.\nOur five-quarter pipeline continued to grow sequentially across Neoclouds, Sovereigns, and enterprises, and remains multiples of our backlog, even when accounting for the robust demand we've seen. As expected, AI server profitability improved sequentially. Moving to traditional servers, overall demand grew double digits, with growth accelerating sequentially in both EMEA and North America. We saw growth across units, TRUs, our buyer base, and the mix of the 16th and 17th generation platforms, reflecting customers' preference for dense, high-performing compute configurations. Traditional x86 compute demand continues to benefit from workload expansion and AI driving broader IT modernization and consolidation. Moving to storage, while revenue declined 1% year-over-year, demand for our Dell IP portfolio remained strong. For two consecutive quarters, our all-flash array portfolio has delivered double-digit demand growth, supported by strong double-digit growth from PowerStore, PowerMax, Object Scale, and PowerFlex.\nPowerStore demand has now grown for seven consecutive quarters, with six quarters of double-digit growth. Profitability improved as we increased both the mix and margin of Dell IP offerings, underscoring the differentiated value of our platforms. In CSG, we saw momentum continue. CSG revenue increased 3%, with commercial up 5%. International growth accelerated sequentially, up double digits year-over-year. North America also showed improvement. Demand for small and medium business remained strong, and we now have five consecutive quarters of P&L growth and seven consecutive quarters of commercial demand growth. Consumer revenue declined 7%, although the demand environment turned to growth as we refocused on expanding where we play in the market. Commercial profitability was stable, while consumer and education were competitive. The PC refresh cycle remains durable, supported by an aging installed base and a significant portion of systems not yet upgraded to Windows 11.\nBefore I wrap up, I'd like to briefly touch on the commodity supply environment. We are well-positioned across our commodity basket. Q3 was deflationary, and our outlook for Q4 is largely unchanged from last quarter. Looking ahead to next year, there will be dynamics that we will have to navigate, but we are confident in our ability to secure supply and adjust pricing as needed. As always, we'll leverage our world-class supply chain to deliver the best outcomes for our customers and shareholders. In closing, we delivered a record third quarter with strong performance across all segments, and continued operational discipline. Revenue and EPS reached Q3 highs, supported by growth in ISG, CSG, and improved profitability in AI and in storage. AI momentum remains exceptional, with record orders, backlog, and a growing, diverse customer base.\nOur competitive edge in AI is our ability to engineer bespoke, high-performance solutions, deploy large-scale clusters rapidly, and support them globally, all backed by an unmatched ecosystem and flexible financing offerings. This end-to-end capability is why Dell continues to win in AI. We are well-positioned to capitalize on AI infrastructure buildouts, expanding traditional infrastructure demand, and the ongoing PC refresh cycle. Now, let me turn it over to David to talk more about Q3 in detail.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Jeff. I'm pleased with the team's strong execution this quarter, delivering Q3 records for both revenue and EPS, along with strong cash generation and above-trend capital return. Total revenue was up 11% to $27 billion. ISG and CSG combined grew 13%. Gross margin was up 4% to $5.7 billion, or 21.1% of revenue. Gross margin rate was driven primarily by a mix shift to AI servers, with shipments doubling year-over-year, partially offset by improved profitability in storage. Operating expense was down 2% to $3.2 billion, or 11.8% of revenue, as we continued to drive scale within the P&L. Operating income grew 11% to $2.5 billion, or 9.3% of revenue. The increase in operating income was driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in our gross margin rate. Q3 net income was up 11% to $1.8 billion, primarily driven by stronger operating income.\nOur diluted EPS increased 17% to $2.59, a Q3 record. Moving to ISG, ISG revenue was a Q3 record $14.1 billion, up 24%, marking seven consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Servers and networking revenue reached a Q3 record $10.1 billion, up 37%, and is up 43% year-to-date. AI server demand accelerated, with a record $12.3 billion in orders, $5.6 billion in AI server shipments, and a record-ending backlog of $18.4 billion. In traditional servers, we saw demand improve throughout the quarter and stability within the P&L. Storage revenue was $4 billion, down 1%, with strong demand across parts of our Dell IP portfolio. PowerStore continued its double-digit growth trajectory, with seven consecutive quarters of growth. ISG operating income was a Q3 record $1.7 billion, up 16%, marking six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. This was driven primarily by higher revenue.\nOur ISG operating income rate was up 360 basis points sequentially to 12.4% of revenue. This improvement was driven by a mix of AI servers, sequential improvement in AI server margins, and stronger profitability from storage. Turning to CSG, CSG revenue was up 3% to $12.5 billion. Commercial revenue grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 5% to $10.6 billion, while consumer revenue declined 7% to $1.9 billion. CSG operating income was $0.7 billion, or 6% of revenue. Commercial profitability was stable, driven by steady pricing sequentially, as customers prioritized rich configured AI-ready devices. In consumer, profitability improved year-over-year, and demand returned to growth. Moving to cash and the balance sheet, we delivered another strong cash quarter, with cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion. This was primarily driven by profitability and working capital improvements. We ended the quarter with $11.3 billion in cash and investments, up $1.6 billion sequentially.\nOur core leverage ratio is 1.6x. We returned $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders, including 8.9 million shares of stock we purchased at an average price of $140 per share, and paid a dividend of approximately $0.53 per share. Through three quarters, we have returned $5.3 billion and repurchased over 39 million shares. With record Q3 results in hand, I now walk you through our outlook for Q4. In ISG, we expect to ship roughly $9.4 billion of AI servers in Q4, a record, bringing full-year shipments to roughly $25 billion, or over 150% year-over-year. Our Q4 outlook for traditional server and storage remains unchanged from last quarter, supported by continued data center modernization and consolidation, and above-market growth in Dell IP storage. In CSG, with the ongoing PC refresh cycle, we are improving our execution to drive revenue growth and gain market share.\nGiven that backdrop, we expect Q4 revenue between $31 and $32 billion, up 32% at the midpoint of $31.5 billion. ISG and CSG combined are expected to grow 34% at the midpoint, with ISG growing mid-60s and CSG up low to mid-single digits. Operating expenses will be flat sequentially. We expect operating income to be up roughly 21%, with continued sequential improvement in ISG operating income rate. We anticipate a diluted share count of roughly 672 million shares, and an 18% non-GAAP tax rate. Our diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.50, ±$0.10, up 31% at the midpoint. Our Q4 guidance implies a strong FY26, with revenue of $111.7 billion, up 17%, and non-GAAP EPS of $9.92, up 22% at the midpoint, both well above our long-term framework. Briefly on FY27, it's still very early in our planning process.\nWe wanted to give you some context on how we are thinking about next year. We have strong conviction in our AI business, supported by what we see in our backlog, the pipeline, and ongoing customer discussions. We've proven we can execute and deliver for our customers in this space. For the rest of the business, the long-term framework we outlined at our securities analyst meeting remains a solid starting point as you think about next year. We are highly confident in our ability to drive EPS growth, supported by multiple levers, including leveraging our go-to-market engine, improving gross profit, scaling operating expenses, and ongoing share repurchases. In closing, we delivered a record Q3 with revenue of $27 billion and EPS of $2.59, both quarterly highs, driven by strong execution across ISG, CSG, and disciplined cost management.\nISG continues to see sustained double-digit growth and accelerating AI demand, evidenced by $30 billion in AI server orders over the past three quarters. We are focused on capitalizing on the ongoing PC refresh, and expect continued growth from CSG. We remain focused on driving shareholder value through strong cash generation and capital returns. Thank you all for your time. Now I'll turn it back to Paul to begin our Q&A.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, David. Let's get to Q&A. In order to ensure we get to as many of you as possible, please ask one concise question. Operator, let's go to the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our first question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff and David, I mean, maybe since this is sort of the topic of investor conversation mostly at this point, if you can flesh out your thoughts on the kind of reaction you expect from customers in relation to the pricing discussions by sort of the product categories, where do you think it's more sort of easier to take some of those pricing actions versus not relative to your overall portfolio? David, if I heard you correct, you're saying to sort of use your investor targets for about mid-teens EPS growth as still a starting point for next year, despite those sort of dynamic sort of headwinds on the memory side. Can I just clarify that as well? Thank you.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nSure, Samik. Let me wade my way through that. I suspect it won't be the first question this afternoon, or the only question, I should say. Look, we're in a very unique time. It's unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen. By the way, it's not unique to DRAM. It's NAND, it is hard drives, leading-edge nodes across the semiconductor network. There is a, if you will, a category I'd categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply. As we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done. We have a lot of experience at this. This isn't our first DRAM cycle. There have been seven, I think, in the last 40 years. Michael and I have been here navigating the organization in various ways through that time.\nOur senior leadership team and our supply chain has been through everyone this decade. First rule of our supply chain is to get the parts. Supply matters, mix matters, and as we get the supply and mix, our job is to minimize the impact of that to our customers. Clearly, we're in a situation that is not typical. We've learned a great deal since COVID, since the previous cycle of this last super cycle of this magnitude was 2016 through 2017. We're going to do everything we can to minimize the impact. The fact is the cost basis is going up across all products, no one more unique than others. Everything uses a CPU, has DRAM, has storage in it. With that said, we're going to do things we've always done. We're going to work on configurations, we're going to work on availability, adjust, mix.\nOur direct model allows us to move demand where supply is. Our direct model allows us to act to the market signals it gives us quicker than anybody else, allows us to price accordingly, reprice when needed. We will make our way through that across consumer PCs, commercial PCs, into server storage, and through our AI servers. No product category is not going to be impacted in terms of the aggregate cost basis moving. Again, our number one rule is get parts. Secure supply. Secure the mix we need to meet the customer demand. The world needs more computational intensity, needs more compute. If you're in the world of AI, token growth is going. We see a consolidation in servers. Consolidation in servers is driving denser servers with more DRAM, more storage. We're in the middle of a PC refresh that's not complete.\nI don't see how we will not—what's the best way to describe it? I don't see how this will certainly not make its way into the customer base. We'll do everything we can to mitigate that. As we mentioned earlier, our cost outlook for Q4 is largely unchanged. David just gave you what our guidance is that we believe that you'll see sequential profitability improvement in our company across the broad portfolio, while managing an increase in our cost basis. That's what we're going to do. That's what we know how to do. We have all of the tools in our company to be able to do that effectively and fast.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nDavid, can I just—\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nThat is related to your—\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep, please. Thank you.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nYeah. Hey, Samik. Like we said, it's very, very early in our planning process, obviously. The framework from our security analyst meeting is a good reference point to start with. I think EPS included in that is the zip code we'll be in. We'll be looking, obviously, to leverage our go-to-market engine, which is differentiated. All the things Jeff has just outlined there in relation to our supply chain. We'll continue to drive significant scale in our opex, and then, obviously, stay committed to our capital return KPIs, right, whether it's share repurchase or stay committed to our dividends. Look, we feel we have many tools in that toolbox to allow us to stay agile and deliver our EPS numbers. Like I said, it's still very, very early in the planning process here.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Thank you both.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Samik.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Mark Newman with Bernstein.\n\nMark Newman\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter, particularly impressive on the AI server orders. I wondered on AI servers if you could talk about some of the recent comments that have been coming from NVIDIA around the potential vertical integration that they're doing, getting a little bit more involved in the supply chain and how that may impact on how or how Dell is navigating around that. Also on AI servers, any color on the mix of AI servers, any change on the mix, for example, enterprise as a portion of AI server orders would be useful. Thanks very much.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nSure, Mark. Let me make my way through that. I mean, first of all, as we look forward to the new technologies that are in front of us, we remain excited. We think there's ample opportunity for us to continue to differentiate. These large-scale deployments are very complex. Our value add is at the rack level, is at the solution level, L11 and beyond. That differentiation, we believe, remains for the next several cycles easily. In fact, our ability to engage with customers early, which we can on the next-generation technology, to work through their needs to bring these very complex offers to the marketplace fast and at scale with a significantly better uptime and outcome, we believe is a differentiation. We focus on optimizing performance per watt, performance per dollar at the data center level.\nWe focus on our services, our value add and deployment, our financing side, the ecosystem that we bring to our customer base. None of that changes in the next generation of technology. To be honest, I think the opportunity for us gets greater in the future as we head towards 500 kilowatts or rack of power density, moving to a megawatt and beyond. The engineering skill required to do that at rack scale is significant. We've invested in that ahead of the curve, and we believe that gives us the opportunity to differentiate, remain the leader in time to market, and drive broad installation and deployment capabilities ahead of our competition at a higher level, uptime of 99% or better. That's why we win. I don't see that changing.\nWhen I look at the mix, two forms of the mix that I'll address is we saw a change in the quarter towards GB300. In our backlog of $18.4 billion, there's been a significant shift towards GB300 as expected. Lastly, we continue to see great build on our five-quarter pipeline around sovereigns and around enterprise, and remain very encouraged about the opportunities in both.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Mark.\n\nMark Newman\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHey, great. Good execution with the commodity environment, guys. I'll try to be concise for Paul. The question is around your AI server margins. You mentioned it was up sequentially. I was wondering if you guys can talk about order of magnitude there. Is that going to continue into Q4? Are you starting to see more product attached, more high margin attached to that end? Thanks.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nI'll take a run at it, Ben. Then David can certainly add to this. Clearly, we made reference in Q2 that we had some one-time cost elements that hit us. If you recall, we talked about expedites and supply chain reconfiguration. Those went away in Q3 as expected. We also talked about shipping a lot of the early aggressive GB200 deals in the quarter. Those went through the system. We continue to now see the ability to add differentiation, as I just mentioned in the previous question, that we see in the GB200 and 300 designs. Our margins moved to stay right in that range that we've talked about, mid-single digits. We see that continuing. This part of our long-term value creation framework that we laid out eight weeks ago is what we'll continue to talk about here.\nWe believe that we can operate going forward in that range. In fact, we're very confident of that. We also had a mix change, or if you will, a change in customer mix to the good. When you look at the broad portfolio and diverse customer set that we have within the AI portfolio, shipping to a broader set of customers across a greater range of solutions helps margin. Hope that answered your question about AI margins.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah, thanks a lot, Jeff. Appreciate it.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nOf course.\n[inaudible]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for touching my question tonight. I wanted to touch on PCs. Jeff, you sound very bullish on the PC opportunity into next year. Some of the channel partners earlier in earnings were talking about maybe the seventh inning of a PC refresh. I'd love to just get your comments because you sound more bullish. Where do you think we are on the PC refresh? Is that still Windows end-of-life upgrades that still need to get done, or are there new factors that you think could elongate the PC cycle well into 2026? Thank you.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nSure, Eric. I mean, a couple of things. One, we have not completed the Windows 11 transition. In fact, if you were to look at it relative to the previous OS end-of-service, we are 10, 12 points behind at that point with Windows 11 than we were the previous generation. We still have ample opportunity to convert. If memory serves me right, the installed base is roughly $1.5 billion or 1.5 billion units. We have about 500 million of them capable of running Windows 11 that haven't been upgraded. We have another 500 million that are four years old that can't run Windows 11. Those are all rich opportunities to upgrade towards Windows 11 and modern technology. Equally important, AI PCs.\nSmall language models, more capable applications, improvements in operating systems and their capabilities, and the embedded AI there, the use of an MPU, the capability of an MPU in future PCs gives me the view that the PC market will continue to flourish going forward. Now, let's define flourish. We have the PC market in our outlook roughly flat year over year. That's after a year that we grew mid to high single digits. I think it's flat as we look into next year's planning horizon, and we're building plans accordingly that would take share against that outlook.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Eric.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAwesome. Thank you, Jeff.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nOf course.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you so much. I was wondering if you could just maybe give some color around this AI business. You noted very strong conviction going into fiscal 2027. Obviously, you just raised your guide here from $20 to 25 billion. Can you just put that in context of some of the financing issues at Neoclouds and how much of sort of your conviction and growth is predicated on some of these Neoclouds being able to procure financing versus maybe other customers that you might have visibility into? Jeff, if you could just clarify, you mentioned the cost base moving up across the product portfolio, and I was wondering if you could maybe just share at the highest level how much of that conceptually could you recover from pricing versus how much of OpEx reductions are possible to offset some of these pressures. Thank you so much.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nMaybe I'll start, and Jeff can add some color. Look, I think if you start answer first, you look at our Q4 guidance, $9.4 billion. That represents $25 billion, obviously, for a full FY 2025. You look at that appetite for AI demand, and it's across the Neoclouds, sovereign opportunities, and obviously within the enterprise, shipments of $5.6 billion in Q3, orders of $12.3 billion. That's year to date at $30 billion. Backlog at $80.4 billion. As Jeff referenced in his opening remarks, the next five-quarter pipeline is multiples of that. Every conversation we're in, which has also been very aware of all the opportunities that are out there, is about demand. It's about opportunity, and eagerness to work and see the opportunities in front of us. We actually see huge scale to come.\nEvery opportunity reality is we're not going to win them all, but we love our momentum that's there, and we think we're well-positioned to meet the expected needs of the customer base.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nYeah. I would add to that maybe some color. $25 billion this year, 150% increase over last year. The guidance that David called out, we will ship nearly as much in Q4 as we did all of last year. I think that gives a reflection on the need for compute, the need for what we see as token generation increasing at an incredible rate, and the corresponding compute that has to be behind that to generate those tokens. It's reflected in that five-quarter pipeline that David said that is up across all three customer types, Neoclouds, sovereigns, as well as enterprises. We're seeing progress in all three. I think that's very important for us to make sure that we communicate that the momentum as we head into Q4 continues. You saw that in the orders in Q3, the backlog building, and significant shipments in Q4.\nIf I flip to the other question about the cost basis and our ability to recover, that's an interesting question. We've said over the years, in normal times, when our input costs go up, we can recover roughly 2/3 of that cost in a 90-day period. I would tell you this is not normal times. This is extraordinary times. We've put extraordinary actions in place weeks ago as we saw this to be able to mitigate the impact upon our company, our customers, and our shareholders. It goes back to our business model. Direct signals, we understand the demand, our long-term partnerships and agreements with our partners that make DRAM and make NAND, the agreements we have in place around capacity. Those relationships are meaningful and impactful as we navigate these types of situations that, again, are unprecedented.\nOur model gives us tremendous flexibility, whether that is to reprice, how we set out quotes, whether that's to reconfigure, redirect to different products, the ability to determine how long price will be in effect, the ability to understand where we're going to drive demand to, and change our demand generation vehicles to drive that. It's important that our engine and the way we run, I think, is very different than others in our ability to respond. Those of you that took note saw that in COVID in a very similar situation. The experience that we had there, where there were material shortages and increased costs, our ability to navigate that, I think, was unmatched in the marketplace. Our supply chain is very good at this, and we're going to lean on them.\nThose lessons learned from the COVID time and most recently what happened with tariffs, I think, show that we can operate with the right sense of urgency. We're managing this real-time, actively managing it. I was on three pricing calls today alone, and we're driving to get a better outcome. Our belief is we will do better than our normal 2/3 in a 90-day period, given the actions that we've put in place, our understanding of demand, and our understanding of supply.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Wamsi.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nYep. Thanks. Love taking my question. Well, I guess maybe you could just spend a little bit of time on ISV margins improved rather well by about 350 basis points sequentially. Can you just touch on what drove the strength in ISV margins in Q3 versus Q2? Your guide, I think, reflects the largest AI server revenue number you guys are going to put up in Q4 at $9.4 billion plus. How should we think about that impacting your P&L? Do you think gross margins should remain in the Q2 levels, or is there kind of further movement from there as you think about the P&L impact from the AI numbers in Q4? Thank you.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nYeah. Thanks, Amit. Yeah. Look, really pleased with the team's execution in Q3 around ISG, I think, at 12.4%, like you said, up 350 basis points quarter on quarter. A lot to like here. I guess a couple of things to call out. First, on the storage side, Q3 was no different than what we've seen year to date, where we've seen demand growth at a premium-to-market for our Dell IP storage portfolio. Probably a strong call out there will be PowerStore also, six consecutive quarters with double-digit growth. Obviously, that Dell IP portfolio gives us better operating margins as you'd expect. There's a natural mix effect that creates a tailwind there. Secondly, in storage, our pricing discipline was something I was very pleased with also.\nThirdly, look, the focus of the teams is looking to find improvements at a by-product level within the portfolio also. Again, like you said, a lot to like on the storage side. Also, within that, on the AI margins, like Jeff said earlier, Q3 is on track to what we've consistently committed to, mid-single-digit up ink here in relation to that. We obviously didn't have those Q2 one-timers that were there, and we'll keep that consistency as we go into Q4. Your reference, I think your question was Q3 into Q4, then from a guidance perspective, look, we expect to continue to make progress. Our Q4 profit guidance is anchored again through the storage P&L. With the Dell IP storage growth, we expect to make it four for four in terms of quality growth in that portfolio.\nThat should allow us to grow at our likely slightly ahead of normal sequentials, which will allow us to see an uptick in our up-ink rate sequentially also into Q4.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nYeah. Amit, I just again want to emphasize that AI shipments were 5.6 to 9.4 quarter over quarter. Our strategy of focusing on Dell IP storage, the mix is up, the rate is up, and increased velocity of our traditional server business is the recipe for the performance that we expect to have in Q4, while increasing AI shipments significantly, as we mentioned.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nOkay, thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to shift gears a little bit away from the AI to the more traditional server business. Jeff, I think in your prepared comments, you've mentioned double-digit demand growth. I think if my math's correct, I don't think revenue grew necessarily at that clip. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing as far as the aged install base, where we're at in the upgrade cycle for traditional servers, and do you think double-digit growth is a good baseline that we could think about going into fiscal 27 as that demand follows through to revenue? Thank you.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nSure. A couple of comments, yes. The double-digit was demand. The P&L certainly did not track that, but we obviously would have built backlog as a result. We talked about North America recovered or improved quarter over quarter, and that the international market demands were double digits. That is two in a row now off last quarter's double-digit performance. We continue to see modernization in the data center, consolidation in the data center, which is reflected in the fact that our TRUs continue to go up, our content continues to go up, the number of cores, how much DRAM, how much NAND per server is corresponding with that. We still see a pretty significant opportunity with roughly 70% of our install base still the older generation servers that we have shipped many years ago.\nThe ability to continue to upgrade them, modernize them is the opportunity that we have in front of us. We see that cycle continuing into next year. This has been a longer consumption cycle. We're encouraged by what we see. That's reflected in the Q4 guidance that we just talked about. That momentum, as we update you on 27, will give you the best look we have. Right now, that momentum of consolidating, modernizing, refreshing old servers to new ones continues. We're working on making sure our pipeline grows, and we can convert it into orders as quickly as we can.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nOf course.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Aaron.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to follow up on the commodity cost recovery point, which was encouraging to hear. When you talk about the actions that you've taken to help mitigate the impacts, I guess, do you expect to see a benefit from below-market costs, strategically purchased commodities? If so, how long can that be a benefit for? I think you may have alluded to opportunities to maybe reprice longer-term commercial contracts in response to rising commodity costs. Just wanted to see if that was the case, or are there any kind of longer-term contracts that might inhibit your ability to price at all? Thank you very much.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nWell, I mean, maybe working backwards towards the first parts of your questions. Clearly, we have to do what's right by customers. Where we have contracts, we have contracts, and we will honor those contracts and work through the situation. I think what maybe I didn't convey correctly or to the right balance that's needed is we tend to talk about the commodity cost here. There's a commodity scarcity too. In other words, there's not going to be enough parts. There's a combination of the demand that's in the marketplace, one's ability to procure the part, which is why job one of our supply chain is to get the material, never run out of parts, and then price it to the commensurate value with having that material. That's what we're going to work our way through. We're, I think, very skilled at this.\nThe last two cycles have certainly honed our skills. We'll use all of the tools available from configurations. It's not uncommon in the PC industry to see configurations come down. That's happened before, likely to happen again. That tends to happen in the lower price bands. You tend to see mixed where what comes out of the factory isn't necessarily what was forecasted. We think we have a unique ability to adjust our demand faster than anybody. We think the ability to navigate how you price with a very large transactional business, selling to small and medium businesses, selling to the day-to-day needs of many corporations, we can adjust that to what's available. Those are all skills and techniques that, being a direct manufacturer and a direct seller, we believe gives us an advantage and will help our partners and customers through that as well.\nAll of these tools that I've mentioned in one of the previous answers are in effect now. Our special pricers know the cost for all of our best guess for next year, what's available. Our sales force, our product business leaders, all know, and we're working as one team to collectively work this real-time, as I mentioned before, to get the best outcome for the company, our shareholders, and customers. That's what we'll work through. Our ability to recover, I think, is better than in normal times. I think that's probably amplified or improved by the fact that there'll be a scarcity of parts.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.\n\nAsiya Merchant\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. Just looking ahead into storage, it seems like that business is doing perhaps a little bit better than what was previously expected. As you look into the server demand that is driving up the revenues for the core server, as you look into next year, just given obviously the backdrop of commodity headwinds here, how are you thinking about storage from here on? If we can get that inflection towards more Dell IP storage, which is obviously positive for your margins, quicker relative to some of the unwinding of the HCI storage, if that can happen faster than what was previously communicated at the analyst's table. Thank you.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nYeah. I think, again, just to clarify, I guess, in Q4 and what we're looking at in terms of guidance, continuing to show that Dell IP storage growth and seeing that sequentially, hopefully, above or expected to be above normal sequentials. That allows, along with the pricing discipline, to keep that margin improvement coming along for the P&L. On the server comment, again, strong demand in Q3, particularly in month three. To Jeff's point earlier, building a bit of that backlog. I think you can expect high single-digit growth in that business for Q4, which would end us on a high point as we exit the quarter. That said, look, as we head into FY2027, still very early. Obviously, it's a lot happening in the market and changing. I would still reference you back to the long-term framework that we've got.\nI think it's a good reference starting point. We'll work from there, and then obviously be agile as we assess and see how it evolves. Yeah, for now, I think it's still a little early for FY27.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nStrategy-wise, we made the pivot to Dell IP, not looking back. It is serving us well. The mix continues to increase across our storage revenue dollars. The margins within the portfolio continue to improve. We talked in our comments about the all-flash portion of the portfolio growing double digits for the second quarter. I think PowerMax, PowerScale, PowerStore, Object Scale, and PowerFlex all growing. We've talked about PowerStore and seven quarters of growth, six of those double digits. The buyer base is growing. The net new customers buying Dell storage with PowerStore is up. The strategy that we've flipped to, which really drives this notion of three core areas where the Dell Private Cloud, which is really open, disaggregated, and automated storage, it's our three-tier storage with our Dell automation platform.\nOur AI and unstructured storage assets, so think of those as the construct of the AI data platform, then cyber resilience, which is really Data Domain and Power Protect. Those are all Dell IP assets. That's what we're driving. That's what the sales force is incented to do. We're seeing nice results from them.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Asiya.\n\nAsiya Merchant\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks for taking the question. I want to see if you could maybe unpack the elements that contribute to the roughly $5 billion of incremental AI revenue for the full year. I guess what I'm trying to get at is how much is this about your ability to get key components, new orders, or existing orders occurring earlier? Just help us unpack what factors led to the raised forecast for AI. Thank you.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nWell, at the highest level, $12.3 billion of new orders and a growing backlog, and then a supply chain that I think is unmatched that finds materials and gets materials lined up with customer availability. This is equal parts customer readiness: buildings, power, direct liquid cooling. We've used the word lumpy before, which we purposely didn't use here, but it's really driven by a customer's readiness and our ability to deliver, matched up with the supply chain's ability to get the material, and matched up with our sales force out winning new opportunities across the Neocloud customer base, the sovereign customer base, and enterprise customer base. It's that combination and why you see one quarter $5 billion, one quarter $9 billion in shipments. It really is equal parts customer readiness, customer delivery acceptance that drives that.\nThe stars align in Q4 with the amount of orders, with the GB200 and GB300 business that we have booked, that we'll be able to deliver at that rate in Q4.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Simon.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Vogt with UBS.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Maybe just one for David. You talked about margins and commodity pressures quite extensively. Can we look at your purchase commitments as a barometer for how you're thinking about margins going into next year? I know a big chunk of that is probably tied to the AI server business. Is there anything in those purchase commitment numbers that we could look at as evidence of how you're thinking about where DRAM and NAND prices could be? I think last quarter you exited the queue north of $5 billion, but most of that is for this fiscal year. If you can give us any update on how to think about purchase commitments going into fiscal 2027, and as an indicator, that would be great. Thanks.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nYeah, sure. Look, we've noticed a certain level of change in the pattern of our purchase commitments or in relation to positioning on things like inventory, etc. If you think of AI, and this is a good kind of litmus test for us within the finance side as well as we observe it, you take that $12.3 billion that Jeff just referenced. If you look sequentially, we actually took down our inventory values about $300 million. If you look at it in a year-to-year, the year-to-year inventory is roughly flat, give or take. Yet our year-to-date demand is up over $19 billion in that period too. Obviously, we have our normal supply chain procurement processes kicked in as part of it. No real discernible change from last quarter or anything to read in as we look into FY 2027 just yet.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks a lot, David. Operator, we'll take one more question, and then we'll get handed over to Jeff to close it.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our final question from Tim Long with Barclays.\n\nTim Long\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you for squeezing me in. Two-parter, if I could, on gross margins. First part, talking about the mix in AI servers, as you start to convert more of the Neocloud and Sovereign and Enterprise to revenues, would you expect a change to that mid-single-digit operating margin? Could that move higher, or how meaningful would that be? The second part on the PC side, I think there was a comment at the analyst day about really doing well in the high-end commercial, but trying to recapture share in other parts of the PC market. Is that something that we could expect might impact operating margin on the PC business? Thank you.\n\nDavid Kennedy\n\nCFO, Dell Technologies\n\nYes. Maybe let's start with the AI side. Look, we're going to stay consistent on our mid-single-digit delivery in terms of operating profit. We'll stay within that range. While we'd like to in every deal, the reality is we won't, right? A lot of those can be competitive, particularly the larger ones. Look, we'll remain judicious as we manage the profitability and the ongoing activities there. Some will flow slightly lower. Other deals will be slightly higher. We'll stay pretty consistent as an objective within that mid-single-digit momentum as we kind of go forward. That's, if you like, the bedrock of which we'll build it on. The other element for me, which is part of it, is making sure every deal is accretive from a dollar perspective too. Again, cash flow is something that's the forefront of all our operations.\nWe think that's a good thing. In fact, we think it's a great thing. We want to make sure we keep it front and center as we look at the activities.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nTim, your second question on PCs, when we were last together, you're exactly right. I talked about the PC business being a scale business, and our share had slipped in the non-premium segments. We leaned in this past quarter. We leaned in with our Dell Pro Essential and education boxes, and commercial, and we were more aggressive into holiday in the consumer business. The results are encouraging. International growth accelerated sequentially, up double digits in demand year over year. That's exactly where Dell Pro Essential is targeted. While it is a very competitive marketplace, we made a slight reference to it, but I'm going to call it out specifically. We returned to demand growth in consumer for the first time in three years. We returned to growth in the consumer business for the first time in three years.\nWe're going to continue to work on our cost position, tuning the products so they're the right products at the right cost for the right price band. We went into the market with what we had. We'll continue to refine that. Lots of changes in the roadmaps going forward. You have our commitment that we can grow while balancing the profitability within the operating ranges that we've given.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Dell Technologies\n\nThanks, Tim. To you, Jeff, to close this out.\n\nJeff Clarke\n\nCOO and Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies\n\nThank you all for joining us today. A few points as we wrap up. First, we achieved record Q3 results across both revenue and EPS, underscoring disciplined execution and the strength of our business model. Second, our AI momentum remains exceptional. We saw record orders in Q3 and have booked $30 billion through the first three quarters of this year. Our pipeline and customer base continues to expand, and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on accelerating demand for AI solutions. Lastly, we saw improved profitability and strong cash generation, enabling above-trend capital return to shareholders. We are set up well to close the year strong and to drive long-term value. Thanks for joining us today, and happy Thanksgiving, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

I'd like to inform all participants, this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is a copyright property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd like to turn the call over to Paul Frantz, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Frantz, you may begin.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Yvonne McGill and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review these materials. Also, please take time to review the presentation, which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call. During this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified.\nStatements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We had a strong operational execution in the second quarter. with record AI shipments. Our revenue was a record $29.8 billion, up 19%. ISG and CSG were up 22%, and Earnings per share increased by 19% to $2.32 marking a Q2 record. Our modernization work continues to enable internal efficiencies, driving decoupling of revenue growth and operational expenses, which were down 4% while continuing to invest in R&D. This strong performance resulted in another quarter of robust cash generation and significant capital returns to shareholders. Now let's move to AI, which remains a significant tailwind.\nWe continue to see strong demand for AI servers, building on the exceptional demand observed in Q1. We booked $5.6 billion in orders in the second quarter and shipped a record $8.2 billion, resulting in an ending backlog of $11.7 billion. For context, we have shipped more AI servers in the first half of this year than all of last. Our 5-quarter pipeline continued to grow sequentially with double-digit growth across enterprise and sovereign opportunities. Our pipeline remains multiples of our backlog.\nEnterprise orders and our buyer base grew sequentially in Q2, distributed across various industries such as financial services, health care and manufacturing. And we're seeing strong enterprise interest in our new NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000 AI factory solutions. These turnkey solutions provide their performance, flexibility and power efficiency enterprises need to manage the entire AI life cycle at any scale with air cold and PCIe options available. As I mentioned last quarter, our execution in AI continues to be a key differentiator we are innovating at an unprecedented pace, engineering at scale solutions for customers while remaining agile to rapidly changing customer road maps and architectures. We were the first in the world to ship both the NVIDIA [indiscernible] solution last year and the [indiscernible] in July [indiscernible].\nTwo great examples of our speed to market in an environment where speed matters. Customers are seeing real-time the value in our ability to deploy large-scale clusters quickly and reliability. Our execution, value-add through engineering and ability to Dell design and even Dell manufactured components with NR at scale data center solutions drive margin rate improvement within AI. In traditional servers, revenue grew again. We now have 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year P&L growth. From a demand perspective, international markets grew, but the April weakness we saw in North America continued. TRUs grew double digits as customers prioritize richly configured servers given their focus on density and power efficiency, driven by a higher mix of our 16th generation servers. We have completed the launch of our 17th generation portfolio of servers. Designed for ultimate performance, reliability and security, giving customers the ability to consolidate workloads to make room for AI and to drive broader data center efficiencies.\nThere's still significant opportunity ahead as over 70% of the installed base is running on 14th generation servers or older. In Storage, revenue was down 3% and and demand moderated. We saw double-digit demand growth in PowerStore, which has grown 6 consecutive quarters, 5 of those up double digits, fueled by very strong channel participation. Within PowerStore, 46% of the buyers renewed power store customers and 23% were new to Dell storage. All Flash storage saw strong growth, driven by strength in our all-flash offerings across Paramax, power store, power scale and object scale. Our focus remains on driving not only growth but also expanding profitability and storage by increasing our mix of DLIP storage and improving margins within each product.\nIn CSG, we saw momentum continue, although not at the pace we expected. Overall, CSG was up 1% and commercial was up 2%, and -- we now have 4 consecutive quarters of P&L growth, 6 consecutive quarters of demand growth in commercial. Commercial demand grew double digits in EMEA with continued growth in North America and APJ, but to a lower extent. We saw strong demand growth across small and medium business, which helped drive profitability improvement. Consumer revenue declined 7%, but profitability improved as we did a better job on positioning our products plus we are in a deflationary environment.\nWe expect moderate growth as the PC refresh continues, driven by an aging installed base in the Windows 10 end of life, which is now 48 days away. -- to fully seize the refresh opportunity, we have taken steps to improve execution and expand our PC TAM. For example, just this morning, we launched a new business notebook specifically designed to win the entry-level commercial PC market. This is indicative of the fast strategic actions we're taking to drive growth and gain share while operating within our 5% to 7% long-term profitability targets. In closing, I'll wrap it up by saying we are pleased with our overall performance. We had another strong quarter with record revenue. EPS grew well above our long-term value creation framework. We generated strong cash and shareholder return, and we are building a better company with our modernization work. Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and the opportunity is showing no signs of slowing down. With the AI hardware and services TAM expected it to double from $184 billion last year to $356 billion in 2028. and we are doing the work internally to adapt rapidly to evolving customer needs. We really like our hand. Now let me turn it over to Yvonne to talk about Q2 in more detail.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nLet me begin with an overview of our Q2 performance, then I'll move to ISG, CSG cash and guidance. In the second quarter, we saw record revenue and also delivered a Q2 EPS record. Our total revenue was up 19% to $29.8 billion. Our combined ISG and CSG businesses grew 22%, and -- gross margin was $5.6 billion or 18.7% of revenue. Gross margin rate was driven primarily by a mix shift to AI servers due to record AI shipments. Operating expense was down 4% to $3.3 billion or 11% of revenue as we continue to unlock efficiencies and modernize our processes. Now let's look at operating income. We delivered a 10% increase to $2.3 billion or 7.7% of revenue. The increase in operating income was driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in our gross margin rate. Q2 net income was up 13% to $1.6 billion, primarily driven by stronger operating income and our diluted EPS and was up 19% to $2.32, a Q2 record. Now let's move to ISG, where we delivered another quarter of strong performance. ISG revenue was a record $16.8 billion, up 44%. This marks 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Servers and networking revenue was a record of $12.9 billion, up 69% and Demand for AI remains strong with $5.6 billion in orders in the second quarter, and we shipped $8.2 billion of AI servers. In traditional servers, we saw continued P&L growth driven by strong TRU expansion as customers consolidated and modernized their data centers. Storage revenue was down 3% to $3.9 billion as demand was softer than anticipated. Power Store continued its double-digit growth trajectory with 6 consecutive quarters of growth. We had ISG operating income of $1.5 billion, up 14%, a Q2 record and has been up double digits for 5 consecutive quarters. This was driven primarily by higher revenue.\nOur ISG operating income rate was down year-over-year to 8.8% of revenue. As we have outlined before, the mix of our AI business will have an impact on our margin rates. In the second quarter, we saw a significant shift in our mix to AI as the team executed very well and drove record AI shipments. This was the primary driver of our operating income rate this quarter, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Given our engineering differentiation and integration, we expect our AI margin rates to improve in the second half. Now let's turn to CSG. DST revenue was up 1% to $12.5 billion.\nCommercial revenue was up 2% to $10.8 billion, while consumer revenue was down 7% to $1.7 billion. CSG operating income was $0.8 billion or 6.4% of revenue. TRUs remained stable sequentially, and we continue to see customers prioritize richly configured AI-ready devices. Our mix of small and medium business and transactional increased, driving an improvement in profitability. In Consumer, profitability improved due to better execution and a deflationary environment. Now let's move to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had another strong cash quarter with cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. This was primarily driven by profitability and revenue growth. We ended the quarter with $9.8 billion in cash and investments up $0.5 billion sequentially. Our core leverage ratio is at our target of 1.5x. We returned $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, with 8 million shares of stock repurchased at an average price of $114 per share and paid a dividend of roughly $0.53 per share. Since our capital return program began at the beginning of FY '23 and we've returned $14.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.\nTurning to guidance. We saw strong AI shipments in the first half. delivering $10 billion of AI servers more than the entirety of last year. We are raising our AI server shipment guidance $5 billion to $20 billion. with shipments slightly weighted to the third quarter. We expect the demand environment we saw in the second quarter for traditional servers and storage to persist into the second half. In CSG, as the PC refresh cycle continues, we are focused on improving our execution to grow revenue and gain share. Overall, we expect profitability to improve in the second half across CSG and ISG and specifically within AI servers. Given that backdrop, we expect Q3 revenue to be between $26.5 billion and $27.5 billion, up 11% at the midpoint of $27 billion. ISG and CSG combined are expected to grow 13% at the midpoint with ISG in the low 20s and CSG up mid-single digits. OpEx will be down low single digits. We expect operating income to be up roughly 7%. We expect our diluted share count to be roughly 681 million shares. And our diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.45 plus or minus $0.10, up 11% at the midpoint. Moving to the full year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance and now expect FY '26 revenue to be between $105 million and $109 billion with a midpoint of $107 billion, up 12%. We expect ISG to grow mid- to high 20s driven by AI server shipments and continued growth in traditional servers, and we expect storage to be flat for the year. We continue to expect CSG to grow low to mid-single digits. We expect ISG and CSG combined to grow 14% at the midpoint. The full year guide reflects improved profitability in the second half for ISG and CSG. We -- we continue to execute our modernization efforts, and we expect operating expense to be down low single digits. We expect operating income to be up roughly 10%. And -- we expect INO to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. We are increasing our diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance to $9.55 and plus or minus $0.25, up 17% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%. The -- in closing, we had very strong results with record revenue and a Q2 record for EPS. We have a broad portfolio with many operational levers that provide the ability and flexibility to hit our commitments. I have 4 key priorities. First, enable and drive revenue growth and share gains in the business. Second, do the first 1 profitably. Third, continue our modernization efforts; and lastly, generate significant cash flow and continue our track record of strong capital returns to shareholders. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 7. There, we will discuss our optimism on the growth and value creation opportunities that lie ahead.\nNow I'll turn it back to Paul to begin Q&A.",

Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.\nNow I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. This quarter, we executed very well, achieving growth across our core markets and experiencing unprecedented demand for our AI optimized servers. Our revenue reached $23.4 billion, up 5%, driven by growth across all of our core markets. ISG and CSG were up 8%. Earnings per share increased by 17% to $1.55, growing 3x faster than revenue. This resulted in a record cash generation for the first quarter and shareholder returns exceeding $2 billion.\nTurning to AI. We experienced exceptionally strong demand for AI-optimized servers, building on the momentum discussed in February and further demonstrating that our differentiation is winning in the marketplace. We booked $12.1 billion in orders in the first quarter, surpassing the entirety of shipments in all of FY '25. We shipped $1.8 billion, leaving us with a backlog of $14.4 billion. Our 5-quarter pipeline continued to grow sequentially across both Tier 2 CSPs and private and public enterprise customers [ and remains ] multiples of our backlog.\nEnterprise AI customers grew again sequentially with good representation across key industry verticals, including web tech, financial services industry, manufacturing, media and entertainment and education. AI momentum continues to remain strong. That said, given the scale of these opportunities, the variability and timing and choices around technology, the inherent nonlinear nature of demand and associated shipments is likely to persist. This quarter is a clear indicator that Dell offering resonates with customers. We are innovating at breakneck speed, designing bespoke custom solutions for customers while being agile to respond quickly to evolving next-generation architectures.\nOur ecosystem in the space is unmatched, with key partners such as NVIDIA, AMD, Hugging Face, [ Coherent ], Meta, Mistral and Google and so many others. Our execution continues to be a key differentiator. We've built a strong reputation for deploying large-scale clusters quickly and reliably, significantly reducing the time to first token and accelerating time to value for our customers. Beyond deployment, we provide ongoing comprehensive support, including managed services that ensure system reliability and performance in customer data centers. And finally, our ability to offer flexible financing solutions enables customers to scale their AI infrastructure with confidence and efficiency. Looking ahead, we remain focused on expanding our leadership in this space by continuing to invest in innovation, deepening customer partnerships and delivering the infrastructure and software solutions within our AI factories that will power the next wave of AI transformation.\nIn traditional servers, revenue increased double digits, and we now have 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year demand growth. TRUs increased alongside the mix of our 16th generation servers as customers prioritize consolidation and modernization of their data centers. A significant portion of the installed base remains on 14th generation servers or older, presenting a substantial refresh opportunity with our 16G and 17G servers.\nIn storage, revenue increased 6%, making it the third consecutive quarter of P&L growth along with margin improvement year-over-year. We continue to execute on our areas of focus, Dell IP in the mid-range, software-defined, unstructured and data protection as more and more customers move to disaggregated architectures.\nPowerStore demand rose double digits, growing for 5 consecutive quarters. Customers value our 5:1 data reduction guarantee, and we are integrating more security into PowerStore using advanced AI analytics. We are gaining traction in data protection, with demand up double digits in both our next-generation target appliances as well as our software.\nOur mix of Dell IP storage continues to grow, and we are capturing more value from our platforms, expanding the margin rates within our products. And CSG momentum increased in commercial PCs or demand strengthened. Overall, CSG revenue rose by 5%, driven by strong commercial revenue growth of 9%. We now have 3 consecutive quarters of P&L growth and 5 consecutive quarters of demand growth in commercial. We saw double-digit demand growth across small business, medium business and large enterprise. Commercial demand was strongest in North America, with EMEA and APJ up double digits.\nWhile the PC refresh remains behind prior cycles, we are seeing indicators that the installed base is upgrading to new Windows 11 PCs, many of them AI PCs. The consumer market remains challenged. Consumer revenue declined 19%, and the industry pricing remained competitive. Over the past 3 months, we've made significant advancements to the Dell AI Factory. From industry-first AI PCs to the edge and data center enhancements, we are pushing the boundaries with dense, powerful energy-efficient AI infrastructure, leading the industry pace of innovation, some examples of our recent end-to-end AI announcements.\nWe lead the industry with the broadest portfolio of Copilot+ capable AI PCs shipping since March. Strategically timed with the Windows 11 refresh, this allows our customers to move to the latest technology and future-proof on-device AI workloads. We announced new Dell Pro Max notebooks and desktops equipped with the NVIDIA RTX Pro Blackwell GPUs, Intel Core Ultra processors and AMD Ryzen Threadripper processors.\nAt GTC, we announced the future of deskside AI development with the Dell Pro Max with the GB10 and GB300, with the latter touting 784 gigabytes of unified system memory and the power to run a 1 trillion parameter model. At DTW, we announced the Dell Pro Max notebook with the industry's first enterprise grade discrete [ NPE ] capable of running a 109 billion parameter model, setting a new bar for edge inference in a mobile form factor.\nOn the server side, the XE9780 and 9780L, our air-cooled and liquid-cooled platforms supporting up to 256 NVIDIA HGX B300 GPUs per rack. The XE9712 supporting NVIDIA GB300 NVL72, which we have the world's first led at GTC in March, the XE7745 supporting the NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPUs with support for up to 8 GPUs in a 4U chassis, the launch of our PowerCool platform, starting with our [ rear door heat exchanger ] that captures, cools and recirculates 100% of the rack heat, reducing the cooling energy costs by up to 60%.\nWe introduced the Dell AI data platform, which showcases fast, powerful, scalable storage with significant software and hardware enhancements to PowerScale and ObjectScale that also features cutting-edge technologies like Project Lightning, a large-scale [ cashing ] solution [ continued ] with NVIDIA and end-to-end data management with the Dell Data Lake House. We expanded our ecosystem of partners and announced our collaboration with Google to bring Gemini on-prem exclusively for Dell customers, an industry first. And additionally, we announced our partnership with the innovative [ Coherent ] to simplify the deployment of agentic technology on-prem.\nWe also announced the Dell Private Cloud and the Dell Automation Platform designed to make deploying, managing and scaling private cloud environment simple. We are not only innovating today, we are defining the future architecture of the intelligent enterprise.\nIn closing, I'm confident in our position and the ability to execute. We are leading in AI and pushing the boundaries of innovation. We had over $12 billion in AI orders this quarter alone, which will drive significant revenue growth and EPS. We are enabling data center modernization and consolidation with our 16th and 17th generation servers, enabling lower TCO while reducing physical footprint.\nOur Dell IP storage portfolio targets faster-growing, higher-margin segments of the market. Our commercial PC portfolio is ideally suited for enterprises with a wider range of offerings and AI-capable devices. Our industry-leading supply chain is a unique advantage in the dynamic environment we are operating in today. We are leveraging the agility and resilience we have built over the past 4 decades, enabling us to navigate numerous challenges over the years and allows us to minimize the impact on our customers and shareholders.\nWe are using GenAI internally to increase the competitiveness and capability of the company. For example, our Digital Service Assistant has increased our diagnostic and resolution ability while increasing customer satisfaction. We are well positioned today as AI accelerates and becomes more pervasive in all of our lives. There is so much more to come, and we will be ready.\nNow over to you, Yvonne, for more details on Q1.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nThanks, Jeff. Let me begin with an overview of our Q1 performance, then I'll move to ISG, CSG, cash and guidance. In the first quarter, we saw continued P&L growth across all of our core markets and record Q1 cash flow from operations. Our total revenue was up 5% to $23.4 billion. Our combined ISG and CSG business grew 8%. Gross margin was $5.1 billion, or 21.6% of revenue. This was down 80 basis points due to a more competitive pricing environment, predominantly in CSG, and geographical mix within traditional servers.\nOperating expense was down 2% to $3.4 billion or 14.5% of revenue as we continue to unlock efficiencies and modernize our processes. Now let's look at operating income. We delivered a 10% increase to $1.7 billion or 7.1% of revenue. This was driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses. Q1 net income was up 13% to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by stronger operating income. And our diluted EPS was up 17% to $1.55, growing 3x faster than revenue.\nNow let's move to ISG, where we delivered another quarter of strong performance. ISG revenue was $10.3 billion, up 12%. [ Servers ] and networking revenue was a Q1 record of $6.3 billion, up 16%. We saw very robust demand in AI servers, with $12.1 billion of orders in the first quarter, and we shipped $1.8 billion of AI servers.\nIn traditional servers, we saw continued P&L growth, but the demand environment moderated compared to the last quarter. Additionally, we saw a lower mix of North America in traditional server, which is a higher-margin geography. Storage revenue was up 6% to $4 billion, our third consecutive quarter of growth. We saw strong demand in our Dell IP portfolio, specifically with PowerStore and data protection.\nWe had ISG operating income of $1 billion, up 36%. This was driven primarily by higher revenue. Our ISG operating income rate was up year-over-year to 9.7% of revenue. The rate improvement of approximately 170 basis points was driven by revenue scaling and slightly lower operating expense and higher mix of Dell IP storage.\nAs Jeff mentioned, we are focused on further increasing our mix of Dell IP versus partner IP storage and are also driving continued product profitability improvement within our storage business. Now let's turn to CSG. CSG revenue was up 5% to $12.5 billion. Commercial revenue was up 9% to $11 billion, while consumer revenue was down 19% to $1.5 billion. CSG operating income was $0.7 billion, or 5.2% of revenue.\nPRUs remained stable sequentially, and we continue to see customers prioritize richly configured AI-ready devices. As Jeff mentioned, we saw strong performance across small and medium business and large enterprise. In consumer, the demand environment remains soft and profitability remains challenged. We are focused on executing within CSG, leveraging our leading go-to-market engine and broader portfolio of offerings to capture the PC refresh.\nNow let's move to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had a strong cash quarter with record Q1 cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion. This was primarily driven by profitability and working capital improvement. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and investments, up $4.2 billion sequentially. Our core leverage ratio was up sequentially to 1.6x given our recent debt issuance.\nWe returned $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders, with 22.1 million shares of stock repurchased at an average price of $90 per share, and paid a dividend of roughly $0.53 per share. Our significant share repurchases this quarter reflect our continued confidence in the business, our ability to act opportunistically during periods of price dislocation and commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Since our capital return program began at the beginning of FY '23, we've returned $13.2 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.\nTurning to Q2 guidance. In CSG, we expect the PC refresh cycle to continue as the installed base upgrades to new devices, resulting in improved profitability sequentially. In ISG, we expect to ship roughly $7 billion of AI servers as we fulfill some of our large deals. We are expecting sub-seasonal performance in traditional server and storage, our larger profit pools that provides scale, as customers evaluate their IT spend for the year, given the dynamic macro environment.\nGiven that backdrop, we expect Q2 revenue to be between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion, up 16% at the midpoint of $29 billion. ISG and CSG combined are expected to grow 19% at the midpoint, with ISG growing significantly and CSG up low to mid-single digits. OpEx will be down low single digits year-over-year. We expect operating income to be up roughly 8%. We expect our diluted share count to be roughly 685 million shares, and our diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.25, plus or minus $0.10, up 15% at the midpoint.\nMoving to the full year. It is early in what has been a very dynamic year. We're optimistic on our portfolio and our ability to execute. However, we want to be thoughtful on how customers think through their IT spend relative to the macro environment. Against that backdrop, we are reiterating our full year revenue guidance and expect FY '26 revenue to be between $101 billion and $105 billion, with a midpoint of $103 billion, up 8%. We expect ISG to grow high teens, driven by over $15 billion in AI server shipments and continued growth in traditional server and storage. And we expect CSG to grow low to mid-single digits. We expect the combined ISG and CSG to grow 10% at the midpoint.\nGiven what we expect for the first half, the full year guide reflects slightly lower profitability expectations within CSG, traditional server and storage. As our modernization efforts continue, we expect operating expense to be down low single digits year-over-year. We expect operating income to be up roughly 9%. We expect [ INO ] to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. We are increasing our diluted non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $9.40, plus or minus $0.25, up 15% at the midpoint, assuming and annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.\nIn closing, we had another strong quarter with EPS growth significantly outpacing revenue and record Q1 cash generation. We are focused on executing our strategy, expanding our lead in AI and modernizing our business, all driving increased EPS growth. This will be an exciting year, and I look forward to the growth we see above our long-term framework and the value we will continue to deliver to our customers and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Paul to begin Q&A.",

I'd like to inform all participants that this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is a copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd like to turn the call over to Paul Frantz, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Frantz, you may begin.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Yvonne McGill and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review those materials. Also, please take some time to review the presentation, which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial metrics refer to GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release.

We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.\nNow I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paul, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I am proud of the team's execution this year. We navigated an incredibly dynamic AI environment and accelerating server consolidation, a significant pivot to Dell IP storage and a lagging PC refresh and delivered results above our long-term value-creation framework. We grew our company while reducing our operating expenditures over the course of the year. Our modernization have made us more efficient and provided us the ability to invest more innovation and in areas of strategic differentiation.\nOur FY '25 revenue was $95.6 billion, up 8%, with operating income of $8.5 billion. OpEx was reduced by 4% over the course of the year. This resulted in record EPS of $8.14, up 10%, and cash flow of $4.5 billion. We continue to differentiate ourselves with consistent performance through numerous economic cycles, different technology buying and adoption cycles and our rapidly innovating technology ecosystem.\nSome examples of the innovation from this past year. We added 5 platforms to our AI-optimized portfolio, including support of the oil architectures, the highlight being the PowerEdge XC9712 supporting NVIDIA's MVL72 GB200, which we were the first to ship in the world. We launched the Dell Infrastructure Rack Sobel system, our IR 7000 and 5000 in both 21-inch and 19-inch versions, providing up to 96 GPUs in a rack and 786 GPUs in a scalable unit. We have made significant advancements of CDUs, cold plates metals and power distribution with our IR 7000 supporting up to 480 kilowatts per rep.\nWe introduced our direct-to-chip liquid cooling version of the 9680, providing 33% density improvement and 2.5x improvement in energy efficiency. We made significant advancements to PowerStore with PowerStore Prime, our mid-range storage solution addressing the fastest-growing portion of the market. And we introduced the PowerScale F910 and F710 in our unstructured portfolio that is prime to support unstructured and AI workloads. We introduced the most Copilot+ PCs powered by ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon processors and also launched the broadest portfolio of Intel Meteor Lake commercial PCs, furthering our #1 leadership position in commercial AI PCs worldwide.\nWe continued our #1 leadership in PC monitors with the world's first 4k monitors to achieve 5-star Eye Comfort certification. focused on expanding our peripherals portfolio selling everything around the PC docking stations, cameras, mice, keyboards and headsets, including the first and only holistic solution to manage your fleet of PCs and peripherals remotely, creating the best possible customer experience.\nAnd finally, we simplified our branding, redesigned our PC portfolio and broadened our silicon options across Intel, AMD and Qualcomm, setting us up well for the PC refresh. We are extremely well positioned to capture growth across every segment of our business and extend AI from the largest at-scale CSPs to enterprise workloads and out to the edge with the PC. These tailwinds and our unique operating model that leverages our leading product positions, our go-to-market engine, services and supply chain, underpin our confidence that our opportunity continues to grow as we look ahead to FY '26.\nMoving to Q4. Revenue was $23.9 billion, up 7%, driven by a robust ISG growth. We executed particularly strong with substantial operating margin improvement in ISG driven by our Dell IP storage portfolio. This resulted in EPS of $2.68, up 18%, growing faster than revenue.\nTurning to BU results. Let's start with ISG. The prospects for AI are strong, and we are very well positioned. In Q4, AI orders demand was $1.7 billion with $2.1 billion in shipments in order with $4.1 billion in backlog as customers work through technology changes. And in February, our partnership with XAI and other customers continued. We booked deals putting our AI backlog at roughly $9 billion as of today. Our pipeline expanded sequentially and has grown every quarter since the introduction of the 9680. We are seeing continued progress in AI from enterprise customers, albeit still earlier in their journey with sequential growth in both orders and customers.\nAnd our engineering services, financing and ability to optimize density and performance per watt are important differentiators for the largest at-scale CSPs and provide very efficient enterprise solutions. In traditional servers, the growth trajectory continues, up double digits in Q4. We've now seen 5 quarters of year-over-year demand.\nOur mix of [ 6G ] servers continues to increase as customers remain focused on consolidation to improve power efficiency and increase floor space. The server consolidation in the data center is expanding server TRUs driven by service with more CPU cores, storage and memory.\nIn storage, we saw P&L growth for the second consecutive quarter with very strong profitability driven by our Dell IP storage portfolio. PowerStore, our flagship midrange product, has had strong demand growth for 4 consecutive quarters, the most recent 3 at double-digit demand growth. As I mentioned, the software and hardware updates we made with PowerStore Prime resonate with customers and partners. We have industry-leading [ 5-to-1 ] data reduction, delivered 30% improvement in IOPS Native MetroSync and QLC availability.\nWe also saw double-digit demand growth in PowerScale, our leading unstructured storage platform, and continued growth in our buyer base with PowerFlex. We are well positioned in some of the fastest-growing categories within storage as customers shift towards disaggregated architectures.\nIn CSG, we are seeing the recovery coming with strength in SMB, which historically is a leading indicator. We also saw large opportunities within the quarter, which were very competitive. Commercial was up 5%, marking the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and the fourth consecutive quarter of demand growth. Consistent with what we saw coming out of Q3, customers are waiting to refresh to buy AI PCs that future-proof their purchases going forward.\nConsumer continues to be challenged with softer demand and elevating levels of discounting. We expect a broader PC refresh this year as the installed base continues to age, we get closer to the Windows 10 end of life and AI PCs are more broadly available.\nTo close, I am proud of our FY '25 results and our ability to execute our strategy, leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and capture new growth. The AI hardware and services TAM has nearly doubled over the course of the year to $295 billion in 2027, growing at a 33% CAGR. We are well positioned in AI, traditional servers, storage with our focus on Dell IP and PCs, including everything around the device. We continue to drive a disproportionate level of AI growth by demonstrating the value we provide to our customers. And I'm excited for the tailwinds surrounding our business as we enter FY '26.\nNow over to Yvonne for more details about Q4.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nThanks, Jeff. Let me begin with an overview of our Q4 performance, then I'll move to ISG, CSG cash nitens. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong profitability, specifically in ISG. Our total revenue was up 7% to $23.9 billion. This was driven by continued strength in servers. Our combined ISG and CSG business grew 10%. Gross margin was $5.8 billion or 24.3% of revenue. This is down [ 6 ] basis points due to a more competitive pricing environment, predominantly in CSG, and an increase in our AI-optimized server mix.\nWithin gross margin, we discovered previously unrecognized accumulated credits from suppliers. You'll find revised financial results within our Q4 press release that reflect higher gross margin and increased earnings per share for the relevant period.\nOperating expense was down 6% to $3.1 billion or 13.1% of revenue. FY '25 was a transformative year as we reevaluated, reimagined and modernized how we operate. This enabled us to unlock efficiencies and increase productivity, all while growing our core business double digits.\nNow let's look at operating income. We delivered a 22% increase to $2.7 billion or 11.2% of revenue. This was driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in our gross margin rate. Q4 net income was up 15% to $1.9 billion primarily driven by stronger operating income. And our diluted EPS was up 18% to $2.68.\nNow let's move to ISG, where we delivered another quarter of strong performance. ISG revenue was $11.4 billion, up 22%. Servers and networking revenue was a Q4 record at $6.6 billion, up 37%. We continue to see strong demand across both AI and traditional servers.\nStorage revenue was up 5% to $4.7 billion, a second consecutive quarter of growth. We executed very well in storage. We had a record demand quarter for PowerStore. PowerScale grew double digits, and our PowerFlex buyer base grew. While the overall demand environment is lagging that of traditional servers, we see some promising trends. We had record ISG operating income of $2.1 billion, up 44%. This was driven primarily by higher revenue.\nOur ISG operating income rate was up again sequentially to a record 18.1% of revenue. The rate improvement of 480 basis points was the result of improved gross margins, especially in storage, and reduced operating expense. Within storage, we saw record profitability driven by a higher mix of Dell IP versus partner IP, improved product profitability and revenue scaling in what is seasonally our strongest quarter.\nNow let's turn to CSG. CSG revenue was up 1% to $11.9 billion. Commercial revenue was up 5% to $10 billion, while consumer revenue was down 12% to $1.9 billion. CSG operating income was $0.6 billion or 5.3% of revenue. This is down 90 basis points sequentially due to a more competitive pricing environment. We saw some promising signs as we went through November and December with pockets of strength in large deals, but overall saw a slowdown in January.\nAs Jeff mentioned, we saw strength in small and medium business, which is historically a leading indicator. Profitability in commercial was weaker than expected as demand continued to push into the next fiscal year. In consumer, the demand environment remains soft and profitability remains challenged. We are ready and well positioned for a PC refresh with our simplified rebrand, leading go-to-market engine and focus on commercial PCs, the most profitable segments of the market.\nShifting gears, Dell Financial Services continues to drive differentiated payment solutions for our customers. We exited the year with a record $15 billion in assets under management, up 5%. And when you normalize for the exit of our VMware resell business and the discontinuation of our commercial revolving product, DFS originations were up 7% in Q4 with a strong attach rate across the business.\nNow let's move to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q4 cash flow from operations was $0.6 billion. This was primarily driven by profitability, partially offset by working capital. Our cash conversion cycle was negative 31 days with $6.7 billion in inventory. We ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and investments, down $1.4 billion sequentially. Our core leverage ratio was down sequentially to 1.2x.\nWe returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders with 6.4 million shares of stock repurchased at an average price of $117.51 and paid a dividend of $0.45 per share. Since our capital reaching program began at the beginning of FY '23, we've returned $10.8 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We announced an 18% increase in our annual dividend to $2.10 per share, well above our long-term value-creation framework. Additionally, the Board of Directors has approved a $10 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. This is a testament to our confidence in the business and our ability to generate strong cash flow.\nTurning to FY '26 guidance. IT spending is expected to grow with 3 underlying trends that we see. First, since this are leveraging AI to enable good if advantages, and we are seeing that in our opportunity pipeline that continues to expand. Second, data center modernization is well underway with a focus on consolidation and power efficiency. Third, customers are planning to refresh their PC installed base with AI-enabled devices.\nAs these trends materialize, we will leverage our operating model that has driven value creation over the last 40 years. Against that backdrop, we expect revenue and EPS growth in FY '26 above our long-term value-creation framework. We expect FY '26 revenue to be between $101 billion and $105 billion with a midpoint of $103 billion, up 8%. We expect ISG to grow high teens driven by $15 billion of AI server shipments and continued growth in traditional server and storage. And we expect CSG to grow low to mid-single digits, more weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 10% at the midpoint.\nGiven the higher mix of our AI-optimized servers and the current competitive environment, we expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 100 basis points. As our modernization efforts continue, we expect OpEx to be down low single digits year-over-year. We expect ISG operating income rate to be roughly flat year-over-year with CSG down slightly. We expect I&O to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $9.30 plus or minus $0.25, up 14% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.\nFor Q1, we expect revenue to be between $22.5 million and $23.5 billion, up 3% at the midpoint of $23 billion. ISG and CSG combined are expected to grow 6% at the midpoint with ISG growing low teens and CSG flat year-over-year. Gross margin rate will be lower sequentially given seasonally lower storage mix and a higher AI-optimized server mix. OpEx will be down low single digits year-over-year. We expect operating income rate to be down sequentially given typical seasonality in ISG with lower storage mix. We expect our diluted share count to be between 706 million and 710 million shares, and our diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.65 plus or minus $0.10, up 25% at the midpoint.\nIn closing, we delivered solid FY '25 results, well above our long-term value-creation framework. We generated $95.6 billion in revenue, record EPS of $8.14 and returned $3.9 billion of capital to our shareholders. We executed our strategy and expanded our lead in AI while positioning our core business for the opportunity ahead. Internally, we began a transformation to future-proof the company, focusing on supplying, automating and modernizing how we work. And as we look forward, I'm excited about the sustainable growth we see and the value we will continue to deliver to our customers and our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn it back to Paul to begin Q&A.\n\nPaul Frantz\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks, Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Let's go to the first question, operator.",

Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob, and thanks everyone for joining us. We executed well in Q2, and I'm really proud of our team and our performance. Revenue was $25 billion, up 9%, with another record for our servers and networking business. Diluted EPS was $1.89, up 9%, and cash-flow from operations was $1.3 billion. Our AI momentum accelerated in Q2 and our results and outlook demonstrate that we are uniquely positioned to help customers leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence. In ISG, our AI server orders and shipments increased again sequentially. Our unique capability to deliver leading-edge air and liquid cooled AI servers, networking and storage tuned and optimized for maximum performance at the node and rack level combined with leading ecosystem partners and world-class services and support continues to resonate with customers. Orders demand was $3.2 billion, primarily driven by Tier-2 cloud service providers. Encouragingly, we continue to see an increase in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions each quarter. Enterprise remains a significant opportunity for us as many are still in the early stages of AI adoption.\nWe are also excited about the emerging sovereign AI opportunity, which plays to our strengths given our position with governments around the world. We shipped $3.1 billion of AI servers in Q2. Most exciting, our AI server pipeline expanded across both Tier-2 CSPs and enterprise customers again in Q2, and now has grown to several multiples of our backlog. As we begin the second-half of the year, we have optimized our sales coverage to better focus on AI opportunities across CSPs, and both large and small customer segments and geographies. In addition, we have added substantial engineering capabilities, including data center networking and design to support these AI pursuits. Traditional server demand continues to improve and we saw strong demand again in Q2, our third consecutive quarter of growth and our fifth consecutive quarter sequentially as customers invest in both traditional and AI infrastructure.\nDell IP core storage demand, including PowerMax, PowerScale, PowerStore and PowerProtect Data Domain grew double-digits in the quarter, a positive sign as we move into the second-half of the year. In CSG, we saw modest commercial PC demand growth in the quarter with healthy operating profitability and we expect growth in the second half of the year. In CSG, we continue to pursue profitable share focusing on commercial PCs, high-end consumer and gaming with our strong attach motion. We are optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle, as the installed base continues to age, Windows 10 reaches end-of-life later next year and the significant advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications continue.\nIn closing, we are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and lean into new opportunities like AI. We are offering customers choice, flexibility and control of how and where they build, train and run artificial intelligence. We are still in the early innings, and our AI opportunity with Tier-2 CSPs, enterprise and emerging sovereign customers is immense. Our view is supported by an AI hardware and services TAM of $174 billion, up from $152 billion, growing at a 22% CAGR over the next few years. We are competing in all of the big AI deals and are winning significant deployments at scale.\nProgress will not always be linear in the early stages, but we are winning in the market with strong feedback from repeat customers while acquiring new customers every quarter. We have the right AI portfolio with more to come, the right services capabilities, and we are optimizing our sales coverage to capture this once-in-a-generation opportunity. With the coming IT hardware recovery cycle and our positioning in AI, I really like our hand. Now over to Yvonne for the financials.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Let's start with an overview of our performance. Then I'll dive into specifics of ISG, CSG, DFS and guidance going forward. In the second quarter, we delivered strong operating results and solid cash flow, both of which position us well for the second-half of the year and beyond. I'm encouraged by the great momentum we're generating in ISG with AI leading the way.\nOur total revenue was up 9% to $25 billion, including the headwinds from the exit of our VMware resale business. And our combined CSG and ISG business grew 12%. Gross margin was $5.5 billion, or 21.8% of revenue. This is down 230 basis points due to an increase in our AI optimized server mix and a more competitive pricing environment. Operating expense was down 4% to $3.4 billion, or 13.7% of revenue.\nLet me emphasize, we expect solid top line growth in the second-half of the year even as we continue to optimize our cost structure to enhance our competitiveness over the long-term. A big part of this optimization effort is leveraging AI to reimagine our business processes and drive higher productivity. To that end, in Q2, we took a $328 million charge for workforce reduction as we continue to position our business for the long-term.\nNow, let's look at operating income. We delivered a 3% increase to $2 billion or 8.1% of revenue. This was driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decline in our gross margin rate. Finally, Q2 net income was up 7% to $1.37 billion, primarily driven by stronger operating income. And our diluted EPS was up 9% to $1.89. So, that's a look at the whole.\nNow let's talk about the specifics, starting with ISG, where we delivered strong performance. ISG revenue was a record $11.6 billion, up 38%. Server and networking revenue was another record of $7.7 billion, up 80%. Server demand continues to outpace shipments with strong growth across traditional and AI servers and the mix of our AI optimized server demand grew sequentially again. Storage revenue was down 5% at $4 billion. We were pleased to see double-digit demand growth across our core storage portfolio, including PowerMax, PowerScale, PowerStore and PowerProtect Data Domain. This strong storage performance was offset by headwinds in the partner IP portion of our HCI portfolio.\nISG operating income was up 22% to $1.3 billion, due in large part to AI-optimized server revenue growth and associated gross margin dollars. Our ISG operating income rate was up 300 basis points sequentially to 11% of revenue. This rate improvement was the result of operating expense scaling, driven by higher server revenue and storage profitability. We're pleased with the sequential improvement in storage profitability. We gained scale with 6% sequential revenue growth. We were more disciplined in our pricing. We had a higher mix of Dell IP storage solutions and a better geographic mix with more North America activity.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we expect our ISG operating margin rate to continue to improve in the second half of the year. In CSG, revenue was down 4% to $12.4 billion. Commercial revenue was flat at $10.6 billion, while consumer revenue was down 22% to $1.9 billion. CSG operating income was $767 million or 6.2% of revenue due to a more competitive pricing environment. We expect growth in the second-half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI will create tailwinds for the PC market.\nDell Financial Services originations were up 5% to $2.4 billion in Q2. Strength in both client and ISG financing offset the exit from our VMware resale business and the sale of our consumer revolving portfolio in Q3 of last year. Normalizing for these two impacts, DFS originations were up more than 30%, proof of increasing interest in our customer payment solutions. Now let's move to cash flow and the balance sheet. Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. This was primarily driven by sequential revenue growth and profitability, offset partially by working capital.\nOur cash conversion cycle was negative 43 days, up four days sequentially, driven primarily by the increase in our AI server business and AI order linearity. We ended the quarter with $6 billion in cash and investments, down $1.3 billion sequentially. This is the result of capital returns of $1 billion and net debt paydown of $1 billion during the quarter. We repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock at an average price of $130.03 and paid a $0.45 per share dividend.\nSince our capital return program began at the beginning of FY '23, we've returned $9 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. With our additional debt reduction and increased profitability this quarter, our core leverage ratio was 1.4x.\nTurning to guidance, indicators continued to point towards growth in the second half, of the Year. Against step backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies FY25 revenue to be in the range of $95.5 and $98.5 billion, with a midpoint of $97 billion for 10% growth. We expect ISG revenue to grow roughly 30%, driven primarily by AI and ongoing momentum in our traditional server business. We expect CSG revenue to be flat to live single digits for the year.\nWe expect the combined ISG and CSG business to grow 13% at the midpoint. We expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 180 basis points due to inflationary impact costs, the competitive environment, and a higher mix of AI-optimized servers. We will continue to drive efficiencies in the business and expect operating expense to be down low single digits for the year.\nWe expect both ISG and CSG operating margin rate to be within our long-term financial framework for the full year, 11 to 14% and 5 to 7% respectively. We expect interest and other to be roughly $1.4 billion and an annual non-gap tax rate of 18%. Deleted non-gap EPS is expected to be $7.80 plus or minus 25 cents and up 9% at the midpoint. For Q3 of fiscal year '25, we expect revenue to be in the range of $24 billion and $25 billion at the midpoint of $24.5 billion, up 10%. We expect the combined ISG and CSG businesses to grow 14% at the midpoint with ISG up in the low-30s and CSG flat-to-up low-single digits.\nWe anticipate operating expenses to be down low-single digits sequentially. Our operating income rate is expected to improve as we continue to drive profitability in ISG. Q3 diluted share count should be between 714 million and 718 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2 plus or minus $0.10. To close this out, I'll echo what Jeff said. We are very optimistic about FY '25 and beyond.\nAI and the coming IT hardware refresh cycle will be tailwinds for our business and no one in the industry is better positioned than Dell. We are applying artificial intelligence and beginning to realize the benefits across our own business. We're using it to improve customer and team member experiences in sales, software development, services, content management and our supply chain. And in turn, we're using our experiences to help our customers realize benefits of AI for themselves.\nBefore I turn it back to Rob for Q&A, I'd like to share that after 32 years at Dell, Rob has decided to retire. For those who may not know, Rob began his career at Dell in 1992 in Corporate Treasury while attending graduate school. He's held many roles since then and has seen Dell continue to transform and grow over the last three decades. This will be Rob's final earnings cycle. We wanted to personally share the news with you all today. Paul Frantz will lead IR going forward. Paul is a longtime finance leader at Dell and a familiar name to many of you. Paul and Rob have been working closely over the last few years to ensure a smooth transition.\nRob, I'd like to thank you for all you've contributed to Dell's success over so many years. You will be greatly missed. I'll save my extended thank you and goodbyes for later. For now, I'd like to turn it back over to Rob for Q&A.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nThank you, Yvonne, and thanks for those kind words and congrats to Paul. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask one question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our first question from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\n\nAmit Daryanani\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nBest of luck with the retirement. I guess my question is really around ISG margins. This could really step up from 8% in Q1 to 11% in this quarter, despite the 82% sequential growth you had in AI servers. So can you just talk about what's enabling this kind of margin expansion because really a lot of your peers on the AI server side are struggling with--are struggling with their margins, I feel right now. So I'd love to understand kind of what's enabling this margin expansion. And then critically, as we think about this 11% to 14% target for the full-year, what are the key inputs of building blocks together in the back-half of the year? Thank you.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Amit. And I will get started on that one. So we were very pleased with the operating income rate we saw in the second quarter, though 11%, up 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter. That was really driven by improvement across the entire portfolio. I mean, first, revenue was up quarter-over-quarter 26%, which helped drive scale within the P&L. And as expected, the headwinds we saw in Q1 did not persist into Q2. In storage, we had scale. We're price disciplined. We mixed more towards our own Dell IP storage offerings, which was very helpful and saw strength in North America enterprise. In the traditional server space, the demand environment continued to improve, although we're still seeing some competitive pressures. And in AI servers, we had strong shipments with improved profitability and growing enterprise customers in that portfolio mix. I'd say, we do expect ISG operating income to finish FY '25 within our long-term framework that 11% to 14% and do expect as we move through the second-half of the year that we'll continue to see that as we mix more towards our storage portfolio as we do each year.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nYes, Amit, maybe two additional data points that I think are worth noting in the improvement. One as Yvonne said, our Dell IP core storage. On a demand basis, it was up double-digits. We improved the margins in each of our categories, PowerMax, PowerStore, our PowerScale and PowerProtect, data protection quarter-over-quarter through the price discipline that Yvonne mentioned. And the second one, which I think is very important, we improved margins of our AI portfolio. And we did that with the same sort of price discipline, but more importantly, the engineering value-add and the technical value-add that we're bringing to our customers and the expansion from beyond the specific node to the rack level deployment. So our ability to add L11, L12 capabilities, expert deployment, system validation and testing, the ability to help engineer the solution at our customer site, the extension into networking, the ability to cable these things up and deploy them at scale, that is allowing us to extract additional value in our AI deployments.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nAll right. Hi, thanks for the question, Amit. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nHi, can you hear me okay?\n\nMultiple\n\nYes.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nOkay, great. Hi, how you doing? And congrats, Rob. I can say I knew you back when, but I won't. Congrats and so listen, I'm just trying to reconcile your guidance, Yvonne. And then I have a follow-up. It looks like there--it's more 4Q loaded than what the Street was thinking and there was the talk of the layoffs into the print here. And I was just wondering if you can reconcile that for us, the $2 and then it looks like maybe the Street has to raise the 4Q vis-a-vis where they were. And I was wondering if that has to do with timing of savings, and I was wondering also if you can quantify the savings, what the 328 kind of equates to in savings and how we should think about that? And then, Jeff, if you don't mind if you could just mention how the AI server margins are progressing and what we should think about with the flat backlog Q-to-Q? I know you had great sales, but should the flat backlog be a concern? I know there was a lot in there, but since I congratulated Rob, maybe you'll give me a pass and answer them all. Thanks.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThat was the greatest one question at a time of five that I've seen.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nThat was a classic, Ben.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nWe may have Rob answer--\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nWe'll see if we can get through at least the first part of those questions, Ben, I will let Yvonne start.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nAll right. So for--I could talk to the second-half, but let me start with Q3. We were talking about CSG and ISG, combined are going to grow at 14%, right? Total revenue at the midpoint of $24.5 billion, so up 10% year-over-year. So 14% for CSG, ISG, 10% in total. ISG up 30% year-over-year. So very, very impressive continued performance there, driven primarily by AI servers as well as continued momentum in traditional servers. So we're expecting to see that. CSG, we're expecting to be flat to up low-single digits in the third quarter. I'm expecting gross margin rates to be up slightly quarter-over-quarter. And I'd say, remember that we're expecting inflationary environment in the third-quarter, in the second-half actually holistically as well as a continued competitive environment. OpEx, which I think you have a--somewhat a question on, we've already guided to that OpEx holistically and that will be down, we did that last quarter. So we expect that to be down about 2% quarter-over-quarter. And then from an OpEx standpoint, expecting continued improvement there driven by ISG and storage and traditional server mix as well as performing within our long-term framework holistically.\nI don't know if there's anything to add-on the third-quarter as we going to the full-year. So I think your question on, are we waiting more towards the fourth-quarter than the third-quarter? We're sequentially higher in the fourth-quarter from a historical perspective and expect to continue that tradition. And we are expecting a CSG recovery to begin in the second-half, more weighted towards the fourth-quarter. And then you'd also have your natural largest quarter from a storage perspective in that fourth-quarter. And so, you'll see that would be reflected both the momentum in CSG as well as the storage momentum in the profitability and performance in that period.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nAnd then on the two AI questions, the AI server margins, I'll start there summarizing what we discussed with Amit is, margins were up sequentially. We were able to extract value out of our offer. We were able to extract the value out of our AI offer by expanding our--again, our value proposition to our customers beyond the box to the rack level. So our ability to sell services around the box, the ability to sell networking and network integration, the ability to sell what we call L11 and L12 capabilities, which think of it as factory integration, solution testing and on-site deployment. The ability to configure these at-scale for our largest customers is allowing us to extract differentiated value of our competition. We're going to continue to focus on that and continue to find more ways to help our customers deploy AI at-scale. In terms of the backlog, I mean, the first thing I would point to is shipments nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. And I think that's an important thing to think through. For us over the last 12 months, we shipped $6.5 billion of AI infrastructure to our customers on the demand line of just under $9.5 billion.\nWhat you're seeing is improved supply. Still working with customers on their delivery dates, still working with customers on their ability to accept the equipment and integrate it into their data centers. I'm not worried about the backlog as well. I think we've made reference before of our five-quarter pipeline. Our five-quarter pipeline remains healthy. I think I made reference that it's several multiples of our backlog. We have visibility to a pretty significant pipeline, and it's our job to convert that over the coming quarters.\n\nBen Reitzes\n\nAll right. Thanks.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nThanks, Ben. Clearly exciting. Exciting opportunity for us. All right. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move to our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nGreat, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. And Rob, just echo what everyone was saying, you'll be missed. Thanks for all your help over the years. Jeff, I appreciate all the detail that you provided in your prepared remarks on the makeup of your AI optimized server customer base, increasing number of enterprises, expanding pipeline in Tier-2 CSPs and enterprise. Is there any way you can just maybe expand on those comments a bit? And what I'm really trying to get a better understanding on is just that the concentration of spending within your backlog, within your pipeline for AI optimized servers and how that's changing for you? Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nSure. Let's see where do I start with that. Obviously, the pipeline I talked about is growing, growing at the size of multiples of our backlog. The composition of that is continuing to see the number of enterprise customers grow and the amount of revenue in that pipeline is growing, which to me is encouraging and signals customers--enterprise customers specifically are moving from experimenting to now piloting the technology to do a vast number of things, some of the use cases that Yvonne mentioned earlier. So we're encouraged by the number of enterprise customers growing quarter-over-quarter. We're encouraged by the number of enterprise customers in our pipeline and the revenue that represents. Clearly, some of these large Tier-2 CSP deployments, training foundational models are still a large percentage of the backlog, large percentage of the pipeline. And I think that's just the scale, but we are seeing the continued growth of enterprise, which again, I think is very, very encouraging, whether that be in life sciences, higher education, financial services, some of the national labs, et cetera, we're seeing expansion across the enterprise.\nWhen I look at the composition of the backlog and technology, it ranges from parts that are available today to parts that are available in the future and everything in between, our backlog represents things that we can ship in Q3, things that we can ship in Q4, into next year. And obviously, a five-quarter pipeline represents the same thing, which extends into next year. Erik, was that enough color? Was that helpful?\n\nErik Woodring\n\nYes, that's perfect. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thanks for the detail.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll move to our next question from Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nYes, thank you. And Rob, congratulations on your retirement. We will miss you. I just wanted to--I have one confirmation and a question. In terms of improving profitability in AI servers from Q1 to Q2, did gross profits on AI server gross profit percentage on AI servers improved materially between Q1 and Q2 or just operating profit dollars because there was clearly significant OpEx improvement?\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThe short answer to that is both improved.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nOkay. And then, I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little more color on the storage dynamics because you talked about Dell IP businesses growing double-digits and yet the storage business was down 5% year-over-year. So maybe you can help dimension what else is in that equation that suggests that hyperconverged is either an enormous part of your business or was down by a huge amount, or there's some other piece that we need to be able to make those numbers pull together. So perhaps you can provide a little more color on that. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nSure. Yvonne and I'll try to tag team this one. But I'll start with, as I mentioned previously, if you look at our Dell IP portfolio and the success we had in Q2, it was good to see. We had double-digit growth as we referenced on a demand basis across the high-end products, the mid-range products, the unstructured products and the data protection products. Those products from a margin contribution point-of-view are significantly greater than the partner IP references that Yvonne mentioned earlier. So when those businesses are growing and I think I've just mentioned in the previous questions, and their margin rates improved with better price discipline in the quarter, we got, if you will, leverage from both growth as well as improvement in the gross margins, which will ultimately make its way to the operating margin for storage. And that was significant. The thing that was driven by some mix of geography, North America that Yvonne mentioned earlier, but primarily driven by the core products themselves. And then obviously, your conclusion is correct. The partner IP business was down quarter-over-quarter. That's less profitable for us and the mix shifted increasingly more towards our Dell IP products.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nYeah, [inaudible]. I mean, sorry about that. Yes, go ahead.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI just--so the double-digit growth was sequential growth in the--that you were seeing in those businesses?\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nISG revenue growth was up 26% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nSo the storage growth--\n\nMultiple\n\n[inaudible].\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nYes, that was year-over-year, Toni. The core comment about double-digit growth was up year-over-year.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nCorrect. So--but, but the whole--\n\nMultiple\n\n[inaudible].\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nYes, so you've got a decline in conversion, hyperconverged infrastructure and it is--we haven't broken it out specifically, but it is obviously a large part of the business. And data protection would be the other area where there was a bit of decline year-over-year. So those two offset the increases in the other four businesses we mentioned.\n\nToni Sacconaghi\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes Asiya Merchant with Citi.\n\nAsiya Merchant\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\n\nGreat. If I could just, you know, talk a little bit about CSG. And Rob, again, thank you for all the help and support over the last few years. We'll miss you as well. On CSG, if I may, you sound very optimistic about growth here in the fourth-quarter. Maybe if you could just double-click on that a little bit and give us some--a guidance on what you're seeing in the pipeline or the demand indicators that gives you confidence in that growth as we enter calendar '25? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nSure. I'll take a run at and then Yvonne can help come over-the-top. I mean, we remain optimistic about the refresh. I mean, I think it's reflected in our guidance that we think the refresh is shifting and more towards the end-of-the year than we thought maybe at the middle of the year. I know all of you have done your supply base checks, it would indicate the same thing that refresh is heading towards end of '24 into '25. And what's important about that is, as the refresh takes longer to start, history suggests it snaps back faster because the Windows 10 end-of-life date is not moving. So we have a Windows 10 end-of-life date. We have an aging installed base of machines bought during the COVID era, all mounting to be refreshed with exciting new products built around AI, and more AI applications are coming. And we remain optimistic about that recovery. Calling the timing has been difficult. But the end-of-life is around the corner or a quarter closer.\nThe installed base is bigger and older, exciting new products are coming, applications to help productivity with end users is around the corner. And if you think about the extension of AI out to the Edge in inferencing, and what inferencing will be done on the Edge on PCs, that opportunity is immense as well. When you think about running these small language models with larger memory footprints on the Edge on your PC to do amazing things and having a personal agent on your, if you will, screen helping you along the way, that's all in front of us. So we remain very optimistic about that. Closely from our performance, you can see that we had called a recovery a little earlier and recalling today, it's a little further out. Yvonne, anything you would add?\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nNo, I think you hit that, Jeff.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nThanks, Asiya. I appreciate it. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll move to our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. And Rob, congrats and thank you for the help. I guess, Jeff, if I just go back to your comments about what you're seeing from enterprise customers in terms of AI server demand. I'm just curious to understand, clearly you're excited about that building pipeline that you're seeing from the enterprise side, but what are you seeing when enterprise customers come in? What is that giving you in terms of opportunity to either do like attach of more services or storage for that matter? And how should we think about how much of a differential on the gross margins does that lead to when you compare to sort of what you're doing, the work you're doing with the Tier 2s?\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nSure. Maybe in order that at least I think about this. First of all, we still believe we're in the very, very early innings in deployment enterprise. And we know that as we've surveyed thousands of our enterprise customers. And we have a pretty good understanding of where they are in their AI journey. And if you think of this as in stages, they are truly in what we call stage 0 and 1 trying to determine what they're going to do, what their strategy is. And a large percentage of our customers are in that state. And I think we have a pretty good represent--pretty good understanding of that, given our broad market coverage with the largest sales force and technology reaching down into small businesses and everything up to large multinationals. We have a pretty good pulse of where enterprises, business or commercial customers are on that journey. And that gets us really excited that they all see the opportunity. Many are experimenting, moving to piloting the technology, so they can actually take advantage of the opportunities to drive productivity or an advantage with customers or customer service or what have you.\nAnd in doing so, it really brings us tremendous opportunity. We've built professional services to help customers do exactly the four things they need to make progress here. Build a strategy, help them implement it, ultimately think about how they deploy the model and then adopt it and scale it to get the advantages of it. We've built services around that. We continue to scale that capability. And then because these are very complex systems, the ability to engineer and to help our customers integrate these. You just can't put this into a data center. There has to be space, it requires power. In many cases, it requires new forms of cooling. The network interconnect is very complex. The storage subsystems have to be high-speed systems, three-tier architecture systems with the flexibility and efficiency and scale to really run at high-performance. That's kind of what we do. We get excited about that opportunity and to help customers really extend from a strategy to implementation to be able to run these at-scale and to take advantage of this enormous capability is exciting. And then if you think about the use cases, the use cases are generally around large language models, small language models are coming.\nWe're already talking about technologies like agents and agent is a buzzword of our industry today, and we've just scratched the surface of how agents are going to help each individual's productivity, help with specific skills, which provide an opportunity to take the millions of processes that are in businesses today and help automate them. That's what's in front of us. And I think we've said each of the last several calls and we'll say it this call again, the margins selling to enterprises are better than the margins selling to our largest customers. And that's the value we continue to provide and we'll continue to build upon. I think I made reference to this as well. I think this is a very important thing. We've tuned our go-to-market model where we have a dedicated pursuits team for the largest CSPs and we have a overlay specialty organization that covers our largest enterprise customers down to many thousands of them with AI specialized skills and then the engineering capability behind it to help the sales force win each and every engagement. I know that was a lot. I think I covered the questions.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nAll right. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks. Thanks, Rob. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll move to our next question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. And I also wanted to extend my congratulations to Rob. I just have two questions if I could. First for Yvonne, I wanted to ask about the low 30% ISG revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter, which implies ISG revenue is down sequentially. Could you just talk a little bit more on the drivers of that? What are you assuming for AI servers to happen quarter-on-quarter in terms of revenue? And then second, for Jeff, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the partnerships announced in the last couple of months, the new Nutanix Hyperconverged partnership, the NVIDIA SuperPOD certification, certification for the Dell PowerScale. Should that help drive an inflection in storage revenues as we head into the latter part of the year and into next? How material are these partnerships? How much does it change your strategy in storage, if at all? Thank you.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nYes, I'll start off, Mike, your question. For Q3, we do expect ISG revenue to grow in the low-30s year-over-year, and for the full-year in 30s also. Traditional servers and storage are roughly in-line with historical sequential business that we see. Servers will grow in the low-single digits and storage will be down in the low-single digits. So that's relatively normal sequentially. So that would imply that AI servers are down quarter-over-quarter. Now that said, shipments are or were up in the second-quarter to $3.1 billion. The backlog is sitting at $3.8 billion. The pipeline, as Jeff has already talked about, is a multiple of that backlog. And enterprise orders, customers and pipeline are all growing. So with all that said, I would say if we have the GPUs and the customers are ready, we're fully motivated and ready to ship more AI servers in the third-quarter, but that is what's embedded in our guide.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nAwesome.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nLet me see if I can work my way through the partners question and what's happening. I think there are two distinct things. One, if you think of HCI as a category, at least from our view, it really is a category of products with a single hypervisor. It's really meant to drive simplicity and ease-of-use for that use case. And if you think about what customers, particularly enterprise customers, in fact, almost solely enterprise customers, large and small are, as they think about AI, they don't have space. They need to make space. They need to create room for bringing AI gear in. So there's a consolidation of foot in business. And HCI is a wonderful tool to be able to consolidate traditional applications. We have a good product with VxRail and we clearly added to that to give customers choice with our Red Hat product, with our Azure product and the Nutanix product that you described. And we'll continue to do that. Probably what I think is really interesting is these new modern workloads and certainly all those around accelerated computing are demanding more performance, more scale, more flexibility, more efficiency.\nI think I've said this before, you have to feed the beast. These new architectures are demanding some data, they gobble data up and you need to feed it in a high-performance way. We think the best way to do that is through a three-tier architecture. We think it meets the demand--the high demands of these new workloads. We can drive high performance, we can scale-up, we can scale-out. We can drive the flexibility and efficiency needed and getting SuperPOD certification with our PowerScale products, the F910 and F710 is essential to be able to work in that environment, bringing the very best of our company going-forward and it's why we made the announcement since we're talking about announcements. In May, earlier this past quarter about Project Lightning bringing a high-speed parallel file system to the forefront as well because that's another opportunity to expand our position in storage and quite frankly, expand our margin opportunity around storage, around GPUs and around what's happening in AI.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nAll right. Good. Thanks, Mike. Next question--you're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nYes, thank you. And Rob, congrats as well. Yvonne, you just said quarter-on-quarter decline in AI server revenues, your backlog is flat quarter-on-quarter in AI servers. Is that really reflective of just Blackwell delays? And does your backlog include the liquid-cooled offerings like XE9680L? And should we expect an acceleration in that backlog then over the next several quarters? And Jeff, you noted higher margins in enterprise consistently. Can you also comment on where sovereign might fit in that? And can you also help us with which models do you think will drive Enterprise and Sovereign versus maybe 9680 primarily at Tier-2 CSPs? Thank you so much.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nAll right. You all are killing me on the multiple questions.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nOkay. You need one question, one question. Rob, you need one question is three or four. Let me see if I can work my way through that. So when I think of the backlog Wamsi, I think, adding opportunity of deliveries from customers next quarter and then in Q4. And then clearly into next year and that implies Blackwell. We have sold our most advanced architecture aligned to Blackwell to a number of customers. We have sold H100s and H200s and availability, more importantly, customer availability to take the product, which is what Yvonne is reflecting in our guidance. She didn't make a demand statement, she made a shipment statement. So demand with that five-quarter pipeline that I described that is now multiples of our backlog is converting the backlog or converting that into orders as quickly as we can. That opportunity is in all sorts of architectures, the vast majority with NVIDIA, H100s, H200s and Blackwell, as well as a couple of others opportunities around AMD and Intel, but the vast majority is NVIDIA.\nSo our work as a pursuits team selling to enterprise is to get the order, can obviously convert that pipeline into the opportunity into the order and get into backlog, and then our supply chain team needs to get the parts, which isn't--availability has improved, it continues to improve. I think Jensen made reference to that yesterday that availability will continue to improve. That will help customers deploy and then customers have to be ready to deploy. So that's what we're working through. That's the best reflection of that of interpreting those signals into the guidance that Yvonne talked about is what we know today. And obviously, we're trying to improve that. And you asked about sovereign. Our opportunities in sovereign, I think are large and immense as I described in our prepared remarks. As it stands now, none of the five-quarter pipeline reflects the sovereign opportunity of any great size.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nAll right. Hi, thanks for the question, Wamsi. Let's go to the next one.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\n\nYes, thanks for taking the question. Rob, on your last call, I'll stick to the one question and congrats to you and Paul. I guess my question is not AI. It's actually on the traditional server side. Looking at the numbers, it looks like you've seen a pretty good uptick in this last quarter. I'm just curious of how you would characterize, I'll call it, the pipeline of opportunity that you're seeing in the traditional server market, the duration of demand, just kind of thinking about that potential kind of recovery cycle that you're seeing in outside of these AI servers for traditional servers? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nSure, great. Great question, Aaron. Thanks. So maybe a couple of things to reinforce the momentum we're seeing is now five quarters in a row of sequential growth, three quarters in a row of year-over-year growth. We are seeing unit growth. We are seeing TRU expansion, i.e., more cores, more memory, more storage. And I think three things are driving the demands in course servers today. The first is we're coming out-of-the longest digestion period ever. It was eight quarters, two years. The installed base is old. And as it's aged, what I'll link to a conversation I just said made moments ago is that customers are looking for room to put AI into their infrastructure. And to do that, we think there's a consolidation that is beginning to occur to make room. And that consolidation is important because the new technologies today are incredibly more efficient than what you might be replacing that's four or five years-old.\nFor example, if I was to look at a 14G product we shipped four-plus years ago to a 16G that we ship today, our product today has 2.5 times to 3 times more cores in it. It's 25% to 35% more power-efficient and a single 16G server can replace 3 to 5 14G servers in a rack. So consolidation is going to occur because that space and power is needed. And then lastly, as I think about it, we've made some references to this in the past. Workloads are coming back from the cloud, they're repatriating. And as they repatriate, they got to go somewhere and they're coming back on-prem on servers and storage. Those would be the three things I point to.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nAll right. Hi, thanks, Aaron. I appreciate you playing with us here.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aaron.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nWe appreciate that. Let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from David Vogt with UBS.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGreat guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Rob, congrats again and Paul, congrats. And I'm going to stick to one question as well. Obviously, you were clear about the GPU and the delivery constraints on the AI server side. But how are you thinking about how that gets reconciled as we move through your fiscal year into next year. Is it more GPU availability? What are the gating factors that you're thinking about? And does that mean as we exit this year, you're still going to see some constraints in terms of the ability to convert backlog and orders into revenue and we should expect backlog to continue to grow at a faster clip until that's resolved at some point, I would imagine at some point next year. So any thought or help there would be--\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.",
    "content2": "What I hope we conveyed is, supply is improving and supply is improving. Our deployments and scheduled deliveries to customers is what we have to manage through. Again, much of this is very complex deployments, readiness of a data center, readiness of power, readiness of cooling, if it's direct liquid cooling, the ability to have water in the data center. All of that infrastructure has to be put in-place and coordinated with the delivery of a GPU and a server. And that's what we're working through.\nThere's clearly opportunities that we're working across our customer set of what technologies they want to deploy, urgent need, if it's a need that can go into next year, they're clearly picking technology that will be available next year. So it's that composition of demand that we're trying to translate into shipments that were--again, we're reflecting in our guidance and this is our best understanding of it today. Again, try to reinforce that our five-quarter pipeline is multiples of the backlog. There's demand out there. Our Pursuit teams are out working to convert that into orders. And as it converts into orders, an improving supply situation that we have to go work on.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCFO, SVP of Infrastructure Solutions Group and SVP of Global Financial Planning & Analysis, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nYes. I mean, we do expect to grow again next year, right? And we expect AI momentum to continue and we expect, as we talked about a little bit previously, the CSG business to grow also. And so we're really excited about next year. And as we get closer to it, we'll update you on our expectations.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks Yvonne.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nI appreciate the question.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nAnalyst, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nCongrats again, Rob.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nThanks, David. You bet. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\n\nThank you. And Rob, congratulations. Congratulations to Paul as well. I'm going to stick to the one question as well. I wanted to see if you could unpack a little bit your thoughts on the storage trend as it relates to AI. I think in the past, you've talked about a lagged effect behind the compute side of the business. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you expect storage to benefit in terms of degree and timing. Thanks.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nWell, I think consistent with our previous discussions and what I've tried to highlight today is the opportunity for storage is vast, it's large. Again, these large language models consume lots of data, and they need it fast. So the opportunity for us is rearchitecting, improving performance, more IOPS in the data categories that are most interesting to our customers here. The fastest-growing category is unstructured. When you look at what Dell is doing in the structured storage space, we are investing more on in unstructured storage apart from our own proprietary IP. Our scale, as an example, building on the F710, 910, Project Lightning, our parallel file system, the opportunity to help customers provide that data to these GPU engines in the form of moving from text to rich media types like video, audio, other forms of 3D images and complex datasets like that, different modalities. That is what we're building high-performance storage subsystems for. And it's a huge opportunity for us, both from our largest customers that buy today and enterprise customers that buy into the future. I hope that helps.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nYes. Hi thanks, Simon. We're going to try and get one last question in here real quick. So, please one question only.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nAnalyst, Cross Research LLC\n\nThanks for squeezing me in. I assume the only reason Rob is retiring because he has a big book deal coming or something. But congrats. So I guess just for my one question, I mean, there's been--there was a lot of talk in different metrics on pricing and also a lot of talk in terms of mix, et cetera. I guess from a big-picture standpoint, Jeff, like how do you feel about just available pricing power versus your ability to offset new market entrants or just more competitive entrants on any of your areas of expertise going-forward into next year? It seems like that's going to come up a couple of times. Just wondering if you can summarize it. Thanks.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nI'm making an assumption, so I'm going to clarify it. In AI, in GPU?\n\nSteven Fox\n\nAnalyst, Cross Research LLC\n\nActually, I mean--\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThe infrastructure broadly across the portfolio?\n\nSteven Fox\n\nAnalyst, Cross Research LLC\n\nBroadly across the portfolio. Yes, just strategically. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nWell, if you--our industry has always been competitive. I do not expect that to change, whether that's with new entrants or traditional competitors that exist in each of our categories. So if I was to look at commercial PCs, clearly as a refresh is slower and starting than all of us would like, it's a competitive environment today, slightly different than it's been over the past 40 years. The same would be true in consumer, a larger number of competitors there. The consumer market is lagging relative to the commercial market in terms of its performance or its growth, and it's a competitive environment there. If I work my way down through servers, when a large percentage of traditional servers are consumed by a smaller number of customers, the large bids are very competitive. That hasn't changed. I don't expect that to change. And we're seeing the same thing in GPUs. There's a lot more in it, a lot more participants. And I'd go back to what makes Dell special and why I think we win and continue to win.\nOne is our coverage model. We have the broadest coverage model in technology, a combination of our direct sales force, and our partner programs. We're going to continue to invest in coverage. We're going to continue to broaden our channel programs to cover all customers who want to buy DellGear. And those who don't know they want to buy DellGear, it's our job to train them to want to buy DellGear. I look at the advantages of our supply-chain. I think it's unmatched in this industry. It provides us a source of competitive advantage and we're continuing to invest in that. It's one of the areas where internally we're applying AI. I think about what we're doing in R&D, the particular product categories that I described. The investments that we are making in all of these categories keep us competitive and in many cases, we're a leader. I think we're the market leader in commercial PC revenue. We're the market leader in displays. We're the market leader in workstations. We're the market leader in traditional servers. We're the market leader in storage. We're the market leader in data protection.\nI could go on. We have a number of number ones and we're going to continue to invest to differentiate and win in those categories. And then lastly, the fourth thing that we think makes us special and different is we service our own products. We take care of our customers and we're expanding those services. In AI, as I mentioned before, it helped with strategy to help define the infrastructure to help them deploy and implement and then ultimately adopt and scale. We do that broadly across the smallest companies in the world to the largest companies in the world. That's who we are. That's what we're going to invest in. As we think about the efficiencies that we're driving in our organization, it's to allow us to do those better.\n\nRob Williams\n\nGeneral Manager, Procurement-Utilities, Power & Cooling, BT Group Plc\n\nWell, that was about as good a close as I could ask for, Jeff. Appreciate that. We look forward to seeing everyone out on the road over the next couple of weeks. Michael and Yvonne will be at Citi next week, and Jeff will be at Goldman the week after that. Have a restful Labor Day weekend. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time."

This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke; Yvonne McGill; and Tyler Johnson.\nEarnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review these materials and the presentation, which includes content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and adjusted free cash flow. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release.\nGrowth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.\nNow I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm really proud of the team and our strong performance in Q1. We executed well in an improving demand environment.\nRevenue was $22.2 billion, up 6%, with exceptional growth in servers and a return to growth in our commercial PC business. Operating income was $1.5 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.27. And cash flow from operations was $1 billion.\nWe are uniquely positioned to help customers with artificial intelligence and our strong AI momentum continued in Q1. In ISG, our AI optimized servers orders increased to $2.6 billion, with shipments up more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We have now shipped more than $3 billion of AI servers over the last 3 quarters.\nOur AI server backlog is $3.8 billion, growing sequentially by approximately $900 million. Our AI optimized server pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter again and remains a multiple of our backlog. We've seen an expansion in the number of enterprise customers buying AI solutions, which remains a significant opportunity for us given we are in the early stages of AI adoption.\nTraditional server demand remained strong in Q1. It grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year and the fourth consecutive quarter sequentially. Storage demand has stabilized with revenue flat year-over-year.\nMoving to CSG. Commercial PC demand has also stabilized, and we saw an improving demand environment as we move through the quarter. CSG revenue was flat year-over-year with healthy operating profitability. We expect commercial PCs to continue to improve as the year progresses.\nWe remain optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle driven by multiple factors. The PC installed base continues to age, Windows 10 will reach end of life later next year, and the industry is making significant advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications. We will continue to focus on commercial PCs, high end of consumer, and gaming, driving a strong attach motion, a strategy that has served us well across various economic cycles.\nLast week, we held our annual Dell Technologies World customer event in Las Vegas, and artificial intelligence was front and center. There was tremendous excitement around our approach to Gen AI and the capabilities we are bringing to customers and partners as they set out on their AI journey. We highlighted our AI strategy to accelerate adoption of AI, which is built on 5 core beliefs. The first, data is the differentiator. 83% of all data is on-prem and 50% of data is generated at the edge. Second, AI is moving to the data because it's more efficient, effective and secure. And AI inferencing on-prem can be 75% more cost effective than the cloud.\nThird, AI will be implemented in a wide range of ways, from locally on devices to massive data centers depending on the use case. Fourth, you need an open modular architecture to support rapid and sustainable innovation. And finally, AI requires a broad and open ecosystem to take advantage of the latest advancements.\nWe launched the Dell AI Factory to help accelerate AI innovation and adoption. It combines our Dell solutions and services optimized for AI workloads with an open ecosystem for partners, including NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft and Hugging Face. The Dell AI factory is the industry's broadest AI optimized portfolio of solutions and services that can be designed and sized to meet the specific requirements of our customers.\nWe also extended our engineering leadership of new features and capabilities across our portfolio, including the new PowerEdge XE9680L, an 8-way GPU server with 12 Gen 5 PCIe slots, and direct-to-chip liquid cooling that improves overall power efficiency by 2.5x. With its 4U form factor, customers can buy the densest rackable architecture in the industry with up to 9 XE9680Ls and 72 high-watt GPUs in 1 rack that can support performance up to 130 kilowatts straight from our factory.\nIn storage, significant software updates to our power scale, which now includes the availability of QLC. Our power storage software updates give new and existing customers up to a 66% performance based and native sync replication for filing block. We also added the PowerScale F-910 to our AI optimized portfolio. The hardware and software capabilities is 2x faster right performance than our competition.\nWe also broadened our networking portfolio with the new power switch Z9864 with 51 terabits per second of throughput for AI workloads. In client, we announced Dell's next-generation AI PCs. The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite powers our upcoming XPS and Latitude 7455 available in June. These 45-plus tops PCs can support 13 billion plus parameter models, which means customers can run popular models like Llama 3 directly on our PCs.\nIn closing, our strategy remains simple. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and to lean in to new opportunities like AI driving incremental growth. We are giving customers more choices, flexibility and control of how and where they build, train, run and deploy AI, closer to where the majority of their data exist, on-prem, increasingly at the edge on device, and across clouds to help them accelerate AI adoption. We are partnering with customers on every step of their AI journey to make it easy with an open modular solutions and a broad ecosystem of AI models, tools and partnerships. We are applying AI internally across our own business for better customer and team member experiences.\nAnd now over to Yvonne for the financials.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nThanks, Jeff. In Q1, we again demonstrated our ability to execute and deliver strong cash flow and our traditional business has stabilized, with AI continuing to drive new growth. Our combined CSG and ISG revenue grew 8%, and our total revenue was $22.2 billion, up 6%.\nGross margin was $4.9 billion and 22.2% of revenue, down 250 basis points given a more competitive pricing environment and a higher AI optimized server mix. Operating expense was $3.5 billion or 15.6% of revenue, down 3%. And we will continue to be prudent in our cost management.\nOperating income was 6.6% of revenue and $1.5 billion, down 8%, driven by the decrease in our gross margins, partially offset by OpEx scaling. Q1 net income was $923 million, down 4%, primarily driven by lower operating income. Diluted EPS was $1.27, down 3%.\nISG revenue was $9.2 billion, up 22%. Server and networking revenue was a record $5.5 billion, up 42%. Server demand was even stronger with growth across traditional and AI. And our AI optimized mix of server demand increased again sequentially.\nWe delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year with demand strengths in HCI, PowerMax, PowerStore, and Power Scale.\nISG operating income was 8% of revenue and $736 million, down 1%. Q1 is seasonally our lowest profitability quarter in ISG given storage seasonality, and we expect ISG operating margins to improve as the year progresses.\nOur CSG revenue was $12 billion, flat year-over-year. Commercial revenue was $10.2 billion, up 3%, while consumer revenue was $1.8 billion, down 15%. CSG operating income was $732 million or 6.1% of revenue, down primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment. The commercial PC demand environment improved as we progressed through the quarter, and we remain bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI on the PC market.\nOur Dell Financial Services originations were $1.9 billion in Q1, up 1% year-over-year despite the exit of our VMware resell business and our sale of our consumer revolving portfolio in Q3 of last year. DFS managed assets exited the quarter at $14.2 billion.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Adjusted free cash flow was $5.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, well above our average of $4.8 billion over the last 5 years as we continue to generate strong, consistent and predictable cash flow over time. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1 billion, primarily driven by profitability, partially offset by our annual bonus payout.\nOur cash conversion cycle was negative 47 days, flat sequentially, with higher inventory related to our AI business, offset by strong collections performance.\nWe ended our quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and investments, down $1.7 billion sequentially, primarily driven by capital returns of $1.1 billion.\nIn Q1, repurchased 6.7 million shares of stock at an average price of $108.38 and paid a $0.45 per share dividend. Since the inception of our capital return program at the beginning of FY '23, we have now returned $8 billion or 103% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends.\nTurning to guidance. Our open and modular AI optimized server solutions, coupled with a broad ecosystem of partners and our engineering and services expertise, are winning with customers. We expect the AI momentum we've seen over the past 3 quarters to continue, driving incremental revenue for the year.\nIn our core businesses, while the macro environment is still dynamic, our indicators point toward a stabilization with improvement as we progress through the year. Against that backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies FY '25 revenue to be in the range of $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion, with a midpoint of $95.5 billion or 8% growth. We expect ISG to grow in excess of 20%, fueled by AI, and our CSG business to grow in the low single digits for the year. We expect the combined ISG and CSG business to grow 11% at the midpoint, and our other business to decline, as previously discussed on the Q4 call.\nGiven inflationary input costs, the competitive environment and the higher mix of AI optimized servers, we do expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 150 basis points. So we expect both ISG and CSG operating margin rates to be within our long-term financial framework for the full year. We'll continue to be disciplined in our cost structure and expect OpEx to be down low single digits for the year.\nWe expect [ I&O ] to be roughly $1.4 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.65 plus or minus $0.25, up 7% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.\nFor Q2 of fiscal '25, we expect Dell Technologies revenue to be in the range of $23.5 billion and $24.5 billion, with a midpoint of $24 billion, up 5%. We expect the combined ISG and CSG to grow 8% at the midpoint, with ISG up in the mid-20s.\nWe expect OpEx will be down roughly 3% year-over-year. OpInc rate is expected to improve sequentially, driven by quarter-over-quarter growth in ISG and sequential growth and margin rate expansion in our storage business.\nQ2 diluted share count should be between 723 million and 727 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.65 plus or minus $0.10.\nIn closing, we are optimistic about FY '25 and beyond, with a number of tailwinds including AI and the coming IT hardware refresh cycle, and no one in the industry is better positioned than Dell.\nOur unique operating model with reinforcing competitive advantages has been honed for over 40 years now and is perfectly designed for this moment, to help customers accelerate their adoption of AI. We have the broadest end-to-end portfolio of solutions with industry-leading positions across PCs, AI optimized servers, traditional servers, and storage. We have the industry's leading supply chain with size and scale. And we have the industry's best go-to-market engine and an unmatched direct sales force, supported by a strong channel partner network, all underpinned by our world-class services organization that can support customers across the globe.\nIt's an exciting time to be in technology and here at Dell, and we are looking forward to a bright future. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Yvonne. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask 1 question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question.",

I'd like to inform all participants, this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited.\nFollowing prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Yvonne McGill and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review these materials and the presentation which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. The reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified.\nStatements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. As I reflect back on this past year, it's increasingly clear that data and technology are essential to everything our customers do and Dell is well positioned to thrive in this environment. Our FY '24 revenue was $88.4 billion with operating income of $7.7 billion and EPS of $7.13.\nIn a year where revenue declined, we maintained our focus on operational excellence, delivering solid earnings per share and outstanding cash flow. FY '24 was one of those years that didn't go as planned. But I really like how we navigated it, we showed our grit and determination by quickly adapting to a dynamic market, focusing on what we can control and extending our model into the high-growth AI opportunity.\nOur operating margin rate improved as we delivered higher gross margins with disciplined operating expense management. We focused on cash and working capital improvements, generating $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations and we improved our cash conversion cycle to negative 47 days exiting the year, a 15-day improvement. We delivered on our capital allocation commitments, and we have returned $7 billion to shareholders since the initiation of our dividend. Earlier today, we announced an increase to our dividend, which Yvonne will cover in more detail.\nWe have positioned ourselves well in AI. We've already started to benefit from the momentum we're seeing. We saw strong demand continue for our AI optimized server portfolio, including our flagship PowerEdge XE9680, which remains the fastest ramping solution in company history. We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers and the projected growth in unstructured data where we are well positioned with industry-leading storage solutions.\nWe believe the long-term AI action is on-prem where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure. PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in our CSG business. Look for us to make a number of new product and solution announcements at Dell Technologies World in May, that will help customers get started with AI and make it easy.\nTurning to Q4. We saw positive signs in the business as we exited the year, but enterprise and large customers remain cautious with their spend. Our Q4 execution was solid given the environment with ISG faring better than CSG. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion with strong profitability and cash flow. Operating income was $2.1 billion, diluted EPS was $2.20 and cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion.\nIn ISG, traditional server demand grew year-over-year and a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth and storage demand grew above normal seasonality, though down year-over-year as expected. Storage recovery typically lags servers by a couple of quarters. Our strong momentum in the AI build-out continues as we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build gen AI solutions that meet their performance, cost and requirements.\nIn Q4, we saw strength across a wider range of customers and geographies with an expanding pipeline. AI optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion.\nDemand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training and infrastructure requirements. They appreciate our perspective, our collaborative approach and the capabilities we can provide to help them create holistic AI solutions, including our end-to-end portfolio, engagement with our engineering teams, consulting services and financing options. Progress in this space won't always be linear, but we are excited about the opportunity ahead.\nIn CSG, we remain optimistic about the coming PC refresh cycle as the PC installed base continues to age, Windows 10 reaches end-of-life later next year, and the industry makes advances in AI-enabled architectures and software applications. In Q4, we maintained pricing discipline and managed our costs well in an increased competitive environment, delivering solid operating margins.\nIn the near term, the PC market is still soft, and we expect the recovery to push into the second half as enterprise and large customers remain cautious with their spend. We will continue to execute our CSG strategy, which has served us well across various economic cycles, focusing on commercial and high-end consumer with a strong attach motion. As we enter FY '25, our strategy remains simple. We are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and turning new opportunities into incremental growth. We are well positioned with our unique operating model and a number of tailwinds. We are driving a disproportionate level of AI server growth, fueled by our technology leadership, engineering expertise, service capabilities, and our traditional server business is gaining momentum. Our storage business will benefit from the exponential growth expected in unstructured data and we are bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle where we are well positioned.\nWe are optimistic about FY '25 and expect a return to growth above our long-term framework. Now over to Yvonne for more details about Q4.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nThanks, Jeff. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11% with strong gross margins and lower operating expense. Gross margin was $5.5 billion and 24.5% of revenue, up 70 basis points with a mix shift to ISG. We saw increased pricing pressure in Q4 in PCs and servers but remained focused on profitable opportunities, and we will continue to maintain that discipline and focus going forward.\nOperating expense was almost $0.5 billion lower than this time last year at $3.3 billion or 14.9% of revenue, down 12% as we actively manage our overall spend. Operating income was 9.6% of revenue and $2.1 billion, down 1% with lower operating expense and an increase in our gross margin rate, largely offsetting the revenue decline.\nQ4 net income was $1.6 billion, up 22%, driven by a lower tax rate and lower I&O. Diluted EPS was $2.20, up 22%.\nISG revenue was $9.3 billion, down 6% and up 10% sequentially. Servers and networking revenue was $4.9 billion, down 2% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The Server order growth was strong, with the majority of our AI optimized server orders going into backlog. Our AI mix of server demand increased again sequentially given strong customer interest in gen AI.\nWe delivered storage revenue of $4.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially with better profitability as we increased our mix of proprietary storage software. Demand improved sequentially across the storage portfolio above our normal seasonality. ISG operating income was 15.3% of revenue and $1.4 billion, down 7%, driven by a decline in revenue and a lower gross margin rate given the higher AI optimized server mix, partially offset by lower operating expense.\nOur Q4 CSG revenue was $11.7 billion, down 12%, largely driven by a decline in units. Commercial and Consumer revenue were $9.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. CSG operating income was $0.7 billion or 6.2% of revenue. Op Inc. was up 8%, driven by lower operating expense and higher gross margin rates, partially offset by a decline in revenue.\nEarlier this week, we announced that Dell will have the broadest portfolio of commercial AI PCs in the industry and new XPS systems, which feature built-in AI acceleration with an addition of the neural processing unit, or NPU, helping to improve performance, productivity and collaboration.\nWhile PC demand recovery has pushed out, we remain bullish on the coming PC refresh cycle and the longer-term impact of AI on the PC market.\nOur Dell Financial Services originations were $8.4 billion for the year and $2.5 billion in Q4, down 19% driven by the sale of our consumer revolving portfolio and lower VMware resell. DFS managed assets ended the year at $14.4 billion, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong with credit losses near historically low levels.\nTurning to cash flow and balance sheet. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, primarily driven by profitability. We ended the quarter with $9 billion in cash and investments, down $0.9 billion sequentially, driven by capital returns of $1.1 billion and debt pay down, partially offset by free cash flow generation, and we reached our core leverage target of 1.5x exiting the year.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $74.67 and paid a $0.37 per share quarterly dividend. And earlier today, we announced a 20% increase in our annual dividend to $1.78 per share, well above our long-term financial framework and a testament to our confidence in the business, and our ability to generate strong cash flow.\nTurning to guidance. There are several trends that give us confidence in our view of FY '25. First, the momentum around AI; second, the improvement we're seeing in traditional servers; and third, the aging PC installed base that is due for a refresh. The macro environment, however, is leading customers to be more thoughtful about their infrastructure budgets, particularly in the first half. Against that backdrop, we expect Dell Technologies FY '25 revenue to be in the range of $91 million and $95 billion with a midpoint of $93 billion and 5% growth, above our long-term value creation framework. We expect ISG to grow in the mid-teens, fueled by AI with a return to growth in traditional servers and storage and our CSG business to grow in the low single digits for the year.\nWe expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 8% at the midpoint, offset by a decline in other businesses. Given the higher mix of AI optimized servers, inflationary input costs and the current competitive environment, we do expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 100 basis points. We'll maintain our cost discipline and expect OpEx to be roughly flat. We expect I&O of roughly $1.4 billion. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $7.50 plus or minus $0.25, up 5% at the midpoint, assuming an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18%.\nFor Q1 of fiscal '25, we expect Dell Technologies revenue to be in the range of $21 billion and $22 billion with a midpoint of $21.5 billion, up 3%. We expect the combination of ISG and CSG to grow 5% at the midpoint, with ISG up in the mid- to high teens. Gross margin rate will be lower sequentially given seasonally lower storage mix and a higher AI optimized server mix. OpEx will be up slightly with typical seasonality. Q1 diluted share count should be between 723 million and 727 million shares. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.15 plus or minus $0.10.\nIn closing, we are optimistic and expect a return to growth in FY '25 and beyond with a number of tailwinds. We have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term and we are committed to delivering against our long-term financial framework with average annual revenue growth of 3% to 4%, diluted EPS growth of at least 8% and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better over time.\nWe are also committed to returning 80% or more of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders over the long term. We're excited about the future and confident in our ability to create meaningful long-term value for all our key stakeholders. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.\n\nRobert L.

We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.\nNow I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. We delivered Q3 revenue of $22.3 billion, with solid profitability and strong cash flow. Operating income was $2 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.88, and cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion.\nIn ISG, the demand environment for traditional servers improved over the course of the quarter, and demand for AI servers continues to be strong across a wider range of customers. Demand for storage was down as expected. ISG revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter, with sequential growth in servers and networking revenue, driven by AI-optimized servers as we begin to convert more PowerEdge XE9680 backlog into revenue.\nFor the quarter, we shipped over $0.5 billion of AI-optimized servers, including our XE9680,XE9640, XE8640 and the [ R750 and R760XA ] servers. Customer demand for these AI servers nearly doubled sequentially, and demand remains well ahead of supply.\nIn CSG, the demand momentum we saw in June, July continued into August, but slowed as the quarter progressed. The result was CSG revenue was down sequentially and short of our expectations. Operationally, we executed well, remaining disciplined on pricing and an increasingly competitive environment. And we controlled our expenses, focusing on profit and cash flow, including outstanding working capital performance.\nAnd lastly, we've returned another $1 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. Yvonne will go into more details on cash flow and capital returns later.\nAI continues to dominate the technology in business conversation. Customers across the globe are turning their operations upside down to see how they can use generative AI to advance their businesses in meaningful ways. These AI initiatives are being driven at the CEO and Board levels. And as a result, we are at the front of a significant TAM expansion.\nAI-optimized server mix increased to 33% of total server orders revenue in Q3, driven by strong demand from AI-focused cloud service providers and growing interest from other customer verticals. We drove improved demand margins, increased services attached and incremental unstructured storage attached over the course of the quarter. The XE9680 is the fastest ramping solution in Dell history. And in Q3, we continue to see strong demand and big wins, including customers like [ CoreWeave ], a cloud provider that specializes in GPU accelerated workloads, and Imbue, which is using high-performance computing clusters powered by the XE9680 servers to train foundational models.\nOur AI-optimized server backlog nearly doubled versus the end of Q2 with a multibillion-dollar sales pipeline, including increasing interest, across all regions. That all said, AI hype is everywhere, and we need to be measured in our expectations. We are still in the early innings with AI as customers continue to work through their AI strategies. Experience over multiple technology cycles tells us that progress won't always be linear, but we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. We believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers size, characterize and build GenAI solutions that meet their performance, cost and security requirements. Our AI strategy, AI in our products, AI built on our solutions, AI for our business and AI for our ecosystem partners is the foundation for our actions, priorities, road maps and partnerships. And in Q3, we continue to build our capabilities.\nWe are collaborating with Meta to make it easy for our customers to deploy [ Metisloma2 ] models on-premises, with Dell AI-optimized portfolio. We are also collaborating with Hugging Face to help users create and fine-tune and implement their own open source GenAI models on Dell infrastructure. And earlier this month, we introduced the [ Object Scale XF960 ], an all-flash scale-out appliance for GenAI and real-time analytics based on our software-defined Object Storage solution, which can run on Linux and Red Hat OpenShift on PowerEdge servers.\nLooking forward, the recovering ramp in PC demand we were expecting in Q3 has pushed out, with large enterprises and corporate customers remaining cautious with their spending. The PC install base continues to age, and there are exciting changes coming to the PC next year, including advances in AI-enabled architectures from Intel, AMD and Windows on ARM, which will help drive a PC refresh cycle. We are also seeing the beginning of a traditional server rebound, and historically, storage follows a couple of quarters later.\nWe are leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and turn new opportunities, including multi-cloud, edge and AI into incremental growth. And we are positive on FY '25 and fully expect to return to growth next year given the expected tailwinds to our various businesses, including AI.\nTechnology is everywhere, and Dell is ready. The amount and value of data continues to grow. And as that happens, the opportunity for Dell Technology grows in tandem. We have proven that over 4 decades through wave after wave of innovation. And we have proven our ability to capture the growth as our TAM expands and translate that into results for our stakeholders. Regardless of the economic cycle, expect us to focus on growing and extending our core businesses in the areas with the most attractive profits to deliver innovation for our customers, remain disciplined in our pricing and focus on costs.\nNow over to Yvonne for the detailed Q3 financials.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nThanks, Jeff. We're focused on driving a balance of growth, profitability and cash flow in any demand environment. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion, down 10% with strong gross margins, lower operating expense and improved working capital management. Gross margin was $5.3 billion and 23.7% of revenue, flat year-over-year.\nWe continue to see increased pricing pressure in Q3 but remain focused on profitable opportunities. And you should expect us to continue to maintain discipline and focus going forward. Operating expense was $3.3 billion or 14.9% of revenue, down 5%, driven by lower SG&A costs and down 7% sequentially as we actively manage our spend.\nOperating income was $2 billion, down 17% and 8.8% of revenue with the impact of a decline in revenue, partially offset by lower operating expense. Our tax rate was 19.2% year-to-date or 15.4% for the quarter.\nNet income was $1.4 billion, down 19%, and diluted EPS was $1.88, down 18%. Our recurring revenue in the quarter was $5.6 billion, up 4%, and our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $39 billion, flat year-over-year, with growth in deferred revenue offset by a decrease in backlog.\nDeferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in software and hardware maintenance agreements and VMware resell. ISG revenue was $8.5 billion, down 12% and flat sequentially. Servers and networking revenue was $4.7 billion, up 9% sequentially. We saw server ASPs continue to expand in both AI-optimized and traditional servers, and our AI mix of server demand accelerated again sequentially given customer interest in GenAI.\nWe delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion, down 13%, with demand growth in data protection and [ power scale ]. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 170 basis points, driven by a decline in revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross margin rate.\nLooking forward, our many #1 positions are proof of our deep enterprise expertise, and with a TAM of $200 billion growing at a 7% CAGR over the next few years, we are confident in our ability to grow the business as the market returns to growth.\nOur fiscal Q3 CSG revenue was $12.3 billion, down 11%, primarily driven by a decline in units, while ASPs remained flat. Commercial and consumer revenue were $9.8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. CSG profitability remained strong in Q3, with operating income up $0.9 billion or 7.5% of revenue. [ OpInc ] was down 20 basis points, driven by a decline in revenue, offset by lower operating expense and an increase in gross margin rate as we maintained pricing discipline and benefited from lower input costs. With a TAM of $400 billion growing at a 2% CAGR, we will continue to focus on commercial, the high end of consumer, profitable relative performance and executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing.\nDuring the quarter, we saw continued strength in Apex and our data center utility and [ Flex fund ] demand offerings and added new multi-cloud offerings, including Apex cloud platform for Azure and Red Hat OpenShift. Our Q3 Dell Financial Services originations were $1.8 billion. DFS ending managed assets reached $13.9 billion, up 1%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong with credit losses near historically low levels.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvement and profitability. Working capital benefited from an approximately $200 million sequential decline in inventory, strong collections performance and continued improvement in receivables aging. Our cash conversion cycle improved again sequentially and is now at negative 52 days, a 20-day improvement since the end of last year. We ended the quarter with $9.9 billion in cash and investments, flat sequentially, driven by free cash flow generation, offset by $1 billion in capital returns.\nCore leverage was 1.6x exiting Q3, flat sequentially. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $66.55 and paid a $0.37 per share quarterly dividend.\nTurning to guidance. Enterprise and large corporate customers continue to be cautious in the current macro environment. Against that backdrop, we expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $21.5 billion and $22.5 billion, with a midpoint of $22 billion. Sequentially, we expect ISG revenue to be up mid-single digits, driven by sequential growth in traditional servers and seasonal growth in storage. We expect CSG revenue to be down low-single digits sequentially. We're seeing pockets of stability in PC demand, but have yet to see a broader recovery in the PC market.\nAnd in our Other business segment, we expect to be down in the low 20s sequentially. Operating income rate should be down marginally versus Q3, driven by a more competitive pricing environment in CSG. And for our tax rate, you should assume roughly 20% plus or minus 100 basis points for Q4 or 19.5% at the midpoint for the full year. We expect our Q4 diluted share count to be between 729 million and 733 million shares, and our diluted EPS should be $1.70, plus or minus $0.10. We're increasing our expectations for the full year diluted earnings per share to $6.63, plus or minus $0.10.\nTurning to FY '25. It's still early in our planning process. However, I recognize you're thinking about next year. So let me share our current thinking. We're seeing signs of stability and inflection in parts of the portfolio, including traditional and AI-optimized servers. We expect revenue to return to growth next year, above our long-term financial framework. The opportunity is the broader IT spending recovery with large corporate and enterprise customers, particularly in the U.S.\nWe'll continue to focus on profitable growth, but we'll be mindful of the competitive environment and inflationary input costs as we move through the next year. Pricing discipline and cost controls will help mitigate these headwinds. Count on us to continue to execute our unique operational model, focused on cash flow, and returning capital to shareholders. And we look forward to updating our FY '25 expectations in more detail on our Q4 earnings call.\nIn closing, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term with technology trends like AI, multi-cloud and edge in our favor. At the end of the day, our strategy is simple: Leverage our unique operating advantages to extend our #1 leadership position and capture new growth. This strategy, coupled with our P&L leverage and strong cash generation, drives a resilient long-term financial framework and capital allocation plan. We have proven our ability to generate strong cash flow through profitability and working capital efficiency, including $9.9 billion of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months.\nAnd at our Analyst Meeting last month, we committed to increasing capital returns to our shareholders. Expect us to continue to invest in innovation, be disciplined in how we manage the business and focus on what we can control, delivering for our customers and our shareholders. We are excited about the future and confident in our ability to create meaningful long-term value for all of our key stakeholders. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",

I'd like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is a copyrighted property of Dell Technologies, Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. Following prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Yvonne McGill and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review our materials and presentation, which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin operating expenses, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified. Given where we are in the macro cycle, we will be referencing sequential growth more frequently this quarter. Statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nVice Chairman, Products & Operations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. Coming into the quarter, we were cautious given our Q1 results, but the demand environment improved at a faster rate than we anticipated, particularly as we move into June and July. Operationally, we executed well with expense controls, pricing discipline and lower input costs. We sharpened our focus on pricing this quarter, and we were selective on deals, particularly where share benefits would have been temporary. While revenue was down year-over-year, a better demand environment and strong execution enabled extraordinary Q2 results, revenue was $22.9 billion, with operating income of $2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.74, well ahead of our initial expectations.\nWe are encouraged with some of the signs we are seeing in the macro environment as we move into the second half. We saw better underlying demand in the U.S. market and EMEA was better than anticipated. We also saw demand growth in government and SMB and our transactional demand improved through the quarter. However, most of our largest global customers remain careful with their spending levels. From a solutions perspective, we saw significant strength in AI-enabled servers. PowerFlex and PowerStore demand grew within our storage portfolio. PowerFlex, our proprietary software-defined storage solution has now grown 8 consecutive quarters with demand in Q2 more than doubling year-over-year. Workstation demand grew and was another bright spot that will continue to benefit from the rise of AI developers and data scientists can now fine-tune Gen AI models locally before deploying them at scale. Commercial PC demand improved sequentially and as we move through the quarter. And S&P attach rates were strong, particularly in software. Our ASPs continue to expand across AI servers, traditional servers and commercial PCs.\nOverall, we were pleased with the quarter given strong sequential growth of 10% and growing interest in orders in AI solutions. Artificial intelligence is a strong tailwind for all things data and compute as well as CSG when you think about the potential for workstations and eventually all PCs. AI is expanding the TAM for total technology spending and is projected to grow at a 19% CAGR for the next couple of years to approximately $90 billion, including hardware and services. In Q2 alone, we saw unprecedented strength from our PowerEdge XE9680. It's the fastest ramping new solution in Dell history and builds on the success of other GPU-enabled servers we've been selling for years. The 9680 is a key element to our Dell generative AI solutions engineered to speed the deployment of a modular, secure and scalable platform for generative AI in the enterprise.\nAI service increased to 20% of our servers order revenue in the first half of the year and the 96800 was a big factor. Currently, we have approximately $2 billion of XE9680 orders in backlog and our sales pipeline is substantially higher. Gen AI represents an inflection point driving fundamental change in the pace of innovation while improving the customer expectation and enabling significant productivity gains and new ways to work. As the #1 infrastructure provider, we are clearly positioned to serve the market in a unique and differentiated way. And we have the world's broadest Gen AI infrastructure portfolio that spans from the cloud to the client. Customers big and small are using their own data and business context to train, fine-tune inference on Dell infrastructure solutions to incorporate advanced AI into their core business processes effectively and efficiently. We can help customers size, characterize and build the Gen AI solutions that meet their performance, cost and security requirements. Many of these new workloads will be on-prem or at the edge given the importance of latency, data security and cost.\nIn the near term, we are seeing organizations concentrate on 4 Gen AI use cases, customer operations, content creation and management, software development and sales. And internally, we are doing the same to enhance how we build products, service our customers and improve productivity and efficiency. As we think about the back half of the year, we are coming off a Q2 where we grew above normal seasonality and and demonstrated the power of our model to generate cash in a sequential growth environment. You should expect us to focus on growing and extending our core business in the areas with the most attractive profit pools. Deliver innovation for our customers, remain disciplined on our pricing and focus on costs with multi-cloud edge and Gen AI as tailwinds. I like our hand. And I look forward to talking more about our views on technology trends, strategy and innovation at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Now over to Yvonne for a detailed Q2 financials.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nWe're pleased with our Q2 execution and an improving demand environment. We delivered revenue of $22.9 billion, down 13% and up 10% on a sequential basis with strong gross margins and strong operating expense and net working capital management. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points. Gross margin was $5.5 billion and 24.1% of revenue. Our gross margin rate was up 270 basis points, driven by lower input costs and pricing discipline. We did see increased pricing pressure in Q2, but we're selective on deals depending on the customer and opportunity. As Jeff mentioned, we are focused on profitable opportunities rather than temporary share gains. And you can expect us to continue to focus on the more profitable segments of the market and maintain pricing discipline.\nOperating expense was $3.6 billion, down 4% driven by lower discretionary spend in SG&A and was flat sequentially. Operating expense was 15.5% of revenue and we will continue to actively manage our spend as we move through the second half. Operating income was $2 billion, up 1% and 8.6% of revenue. with the impact of the decline in revenue offset by an increase in gross margin rate and lower operating expense. Our quarterly tax rate was 20.4%. The Net income was $1.3 billion, up 1%, primarily driven by higher operating income and diluted EPS was $1.74, up 4% due to lower share count and higher net income. Our recurring revenue in the quarter was $5.6 billion, up 8%, and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was $39 billion, up 1% sequentially driven by deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in software and hardware maintenance agreements. ISG revenue was $8.5 billion, down 11% and but up 11% sequentially on the back of improving server and storage demand. We delivered storage revenue of $4.2 billion with demand growth in PowerStore and PowerFlex.\nService and networking revenue was $4.3 billion. We saw server ASPs continue to expand and our AI server mix of server revenue demand continued to increase given the recent rise in customer interest in generative AI solutions. Both storage and service and networking revenue were up 11% sequentially. ISG operating income was $1 billion or 12.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points, driven by an increase and gross margin rate, offset by a decline in revenue.\nTurning to CSG. The calendar Q2 PC market was down 14% in units but is now showing signs of improvement, up 7% sequentially Our fiscal Q2 CSG revenue was $12.9 billion, down 16%, primarily driven by a decline in units, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Revenue grew 8% sequentially and commercial continues to fare better than consumer with commercial revenue growing sequentially to $10.2 billion. Consumer revenue was $2.4 billion. CSG profitability remained strong in Q2, with operating income of $1 billion or 7.5% of revenue, up 120 basis points, driven by an increase in gross margin rate and lower operating expense as we maintain pricing discipline and benefited from lower input costs.\nWe remain focused on commercial and the high end of consumer, profitable relative performance and executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing. Customer interest remains high in financing and consumption models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability. Our Q2 Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 1%. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.7 billion, up 9%, while the overall DFS portfolio quality remains strong and credit losses near historically low levels. During the quarter, we continued to see Apex momentum, including a strong double-digit percentage increase in a number of new Apex customers that have subscribed to our as-a-service solutions with strength in our data center utility and select on-demand offerings.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $3.2 billion, primarily driven by working capital improvements, a growth and profitability. Within working capital, we reduced inventory $0.4 billion sequentially and continued strong collections performance with past due now at record low levels. With the work we've done on net working capital post pandemic, our cash conversion cycle has now improved to negative 50 days in Q2, in line with pre-covered levels. Cash and investments was up $0.7 billion sequentially driven by free cash flow generation offset by $1.1 billion of debt paydown and $0.5 billion in capital returns. In Q2, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $49.53 and paid at $0.37 per share dividend. Our core leverage improved to 1.6x exiting the quarter, and we ended Q2 with $9.9 billion in cash and investments. which gives us flexibility to increase our return of capital going forward.\nSince we implemented our current capital allocation framework 6 quarters ago, we have returned over 90% of our adjusted free cash flow in the form of share repurchase and dividends, and we continue to evaluate enhancements to our framework based on investor feedback.\nTurning to guidance. We're seeing signs of stability across a number of areas within our business, including small and medium business and government. But our largest corporate and global enterprise customers are still measured in their IT project investments and spending plans. Against that backdrop, we expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $22.5 million and $23.5 billion with a midpoint of $23 billion, flat sequentially. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 40 basis point impact to Q3 revenue. We expect both CSG and ISG revenue to be roughly flat sequentially. Although we remain disciplined and focused on profitable share, we expect a more competitive pricing environment. Combined with more muted component cost deflation, we expect gross margin rate will be down 150 basis points sequentially. Our continued focus on cost controls will drive lower sequential operating expense that partially offset expected gross margin dilution. We expect our Q3 diluted share count to be between $733 million and 737 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $1.45 plus or minus $0.10.\nFor the full year, we're raising our FY '24 revenue expectations to be in the range of $89.5 billion and $91.5 million, down 12% at the midpoint. Given Q3 guidance, this implies sequential growth in Q4. We expect interest and other to be roughly flat year-over-year. For our tax rate, you should assume 22.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. We are increasing our expectations for diluted earnings per share to $6.30, plus or minus $0.20.\nIn closing, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term with AI, multi-cloud and edges tailwinds. We have generated $8.1 billion of cash flow from operations over the last 12 months. demonstrating our ability to drive efficiency and working capital during a more challenging demand environment, and our Q2 performance underscores the power of our model to generate cash when we return to sequential growth. We remain focused on executing our strategy, investing in innovation to expand our TAM and winning the consolidation of our core markets, including multi-cloud edge, telco and AI.\nExpect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business, focusing on what we can control and delivering to our customers and our shareholders. And we look forward to seeing you all at our Security Analyst Meeting in October, where we'll provide updates on our strategy, long-term value creation framework and capital allocation policy. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",

Our Q1 results demonstrate our strong execution and the power of our model in what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment. At the summary level, we delivered revenue of $20.9 billion, operating income of $1.6 billion, diluted EPS of $1.31 and cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion. Consistent with our commentary in recent quarters, the demand environment remains challenged and customers are staying cautious and deliberate in their IT spending. We continue to see demand softness across our major lines of business, all regions, all customer sizes and most verticals. That said, we did see pockets of stronger demand performance worth noting. The CSG business performed sequentially better than our expectations at the time of our Q4 earnings call. And we did see some early signs of demand stabilization in commercial PCs in our small and medium business segments and across our transactional business. In storage, we saw continued demand growth in PowerStore, our marquee midrange offering and in PowerFlex, our leading software-defined storage solution.\nPowerStore has grown for 11 consecutive quarters since its release and PowerFlex has now grown for 7 consecutive quarters. And in servers, we saw an increase in demand for our AI optimized solutions. Interest has been particularly strong for our new purpose-built 16G server for artificial intelligence, the PowerEdge X9680, though we caution that we are early in the demand cycle for AI infrastructure, and it will take time to translate to the P&L. In what was a challenging demand backdrop, we executed extremely well and stayed focused on what we could control. We maintained pricing discipline even as competitors continue to reduce excess channel inventory.\nOur average selling prices increased, and we delivered strong sequential and year-over-year gross margin performance given lower input costs. We continue to maintain strong cost controls, reducing operating expenses by 6%.\nSince Q1 of last year, we have reduced operating expense by $240 million and we'll continue to focus on prudent cost management as the year progresses. Our supply chain performed well. We reduced inventory by approximately $800 million in Q1 and by $2.3 billion over the last year, and our lead times and backlog have normalized post pandemic and ahead of competitors. And we are clearly focused on relative performance. We again gained share in calendar Q1 in commercial PCs, excluding Chrome, the most profitable segment of the market and our focus and we expect to gain share in Q1 in storage when IDC results come out later this month. Though we anticipate some fluctuations in share performance as the year progresses, given the timing of industry backlog reduction, we remain confident in our ability to remain a structural share gainer over the long term.\nWe also pressed forward on a substantial innovation agenda. Last week, we hosted our annual Dell Technologies World [indiscernible] with more than 10,000 attendees and made several big announcements as we advance our strategies in multi-cloud, Edge, AI, security, hybrid work and as a service solutions. In multi-cloud, we introduced 3 Apex cloud platforms developed with Microsoft, Red Hat and VMware to seamlessly extend cloud platform operating environments to on-premise environments. We also announced new Apex cloud storage for public cloud offerings, bringing Dell's industry-leading block [indiscernible] enterprise storage capabilities to Azure and AWS environment and delivering on the promise of project Alpine announced last year. We delivered on the vision of Project Frontier, introducing Dell Native Edge, our software platform that makes it easier for customers to manage, simplify and secure their entire edge estate with a single solution. We announced Project Helix, our collaboration with NVIDIA that enables customers to quickly deploy generative AI on-premises at scale using their own proprietary data safely and securely. Under Apex, we met our commitment to extend as-a-service capabilities across our full portfolio with the addition of compute and PC as a Service. And finally, we announced Project Ford Zero, a collaboration with over 30 partners to develop a U.S. Department of Defense validated solution that will ease the adoption of Zero Trust security in private clouds. Looking ahead, we expect the cautious IT spending environment to continue in Q2. We expect CSG to perform closer to historical sequentials, given the pockets of commercial PC demand we saw in Q1 and the duration of the PC down cycle relative to prior cycles.\nWe expect Q2 ISG spending to remain muted as customers scrutinize and prioritize spend. So customers continue to move forward with digital investments, sales cycles continue to lengthen given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And as the industry levels continue to normalize, we expect an increasingly competitive environment relative to Q1. Ultimately, we have confidence in the long-term health of our core markets and the advantages of our business model. Data continues to increase exponentially in both quantity and value and customers see us as a trusted partner, ready to help them navigate the complexities of multi-cloud, edge, AI, data management and hybrid work. We remain the industry leader in all of our key solution categories are central to our customers' technology agendas and have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments in any environment.\nSo short and long term, we'll stick to the playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles, focusing on customers, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, prudently managing costs maintaining pricing discipline and investing for the long term.\nNow over to Tom for the detailed Q1 financials.\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nChief Financial Officer, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. We're pleased with our Q1 execution given the current environment. We delivered revenue of $20.9 billion, down 20% with strong gross margins and operating cost management. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 290 basis points. Gross margin was $5.2 billion and 24.7% of revenue. Gross margin rate was up 2 points, driven by lower input costs and pricing discipline. We did see increased pricing pressure in Q1, but we're selective on deals depending upon the customer and the opportunity. Expect us to continue to focus on the more profitable segments of the market and remain disciplined on pricing.\nOperating expense was $3.6 billion, down 6%, driven by lower marketing and headcount-related costs and 17.1% of revenue given scaling. We will continue to actively manage our overall spend as we move through the year. Operating income was $1.6 billion and 7.6% of revenue due to a decline in revenue partially offset by a higher gross margin rate and lower operating expense. Our quarterly tax rate was 22.7%. Net income was $963 million, primarily driven by lower operating income and to a lesser extent, a higher tax rate. Diluted earnings per share was $1.31, down 29% due to lower net income, partially offset by a lower share count.\nOur recurring revenue in the quarter was approximately $5.6 billion, up 6%, and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, was approximately $39 billion, which was down 7% due to a reduction in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to increases in services and software maintenance agreements. ISG revenue was $7.6 billion, down 18% driven by soft demand in servers and storage. We delivered storage revenue of $3.8 billion with demand growth in PowerStore and PowerFlex. While Q1 is seasonally our softest storage quarter, we did see customer decisions extend out and some deal sizes reduced.\nServers and networking revenue was $3.8 billion. We saw server ASPs continue to expand, and our mix of high-value workload servers increased as we continue to sell deeper into the customers' digital agenda. ISG operating income was $740 million or 9.7% of revenue, down 2 points, primarily due to a decline in revenue, partially offset by a better gross margin rate.\nTurning to CSG. The PC market has continued to slow since June of last year, and the market declined sharply in calendar Q4 and again in calendar Q1, down 29% in units. Our fiscal Q1 CSG revenue was $12 billion, down 23%, primarily driven by a decline in units, partially offset by higher average selling prices in commercial and consumer and a continuation of trends we've seen in recent quarters, commercial fared better than consumer.\nCommercial revenue and consumer revenue were $9.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. CSG profitability was strong in Q1 with operating income of $892 million or 7.4% of revenue, up 20 basis points driven by a higher gross margin rate and lower operating expenses. We remain focused on commercial and the high end of consumer relative performance in executing our direct attach motion for services, software, peripherals and financing.\nTurning to GFS and Apex. Customer interest remains high in consumption and financing models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability. Our Q1 Dell Financial Services originations were $1.8 billion. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.3 billion, up 9% while the overall GFS portfolio quality remains strong with credit losses near historically low levels.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to see Apex momentum, including an increase in the number of Apex customers that have subscribed to our as-a-service solutions.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was seasonally very strong at $1.8 billion, aided by our focus on working capital efficiency. As Chuck mentioned, we reduced inventory by approximately $800 million in Q1 and by $2.3 billion over the last year through disciplined execution and improvement in our supply chain our receivables balance benefited from strong collections this quarter. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion in cash and investments, down $1 billion sequentially due to a $1.1 billion of core debt paydown and $527 million of capital returns, offset by free cash flow generation. Our core leverage ratio improved sequentially to 1.7x as prepaid our $1 billion note due in June.\nTurning to capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining the flexibility to be opportunistic. In Q1, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock for $251 million and paid $276 million in dividends. Now I'll turn it over to Yvonne to cover our guidance.\n\nYvonne McGill\n\nCorporate Controller\n\nThanks, Tom. Turning to guidance. we expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $20.2 billion and $21.2 billion or between down 3% and up 1% sequentially, with a midpoint of $20.7 billion. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 200 basis point impact to Q2 revenue. We expect CSG revenue to be roughly flat sequentially and ISG down in the low single digits sequentially. With inventories normalizing across the supply chain, we expect a more competitive pricing environment. Given Q1 profitability, combined with more muted sequential component cost deflation, we expect gross margin rates to be down roughly 50 basis points sequentially. We expect our Q2 diluted share count to be between 733 million and 738 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.10.\nFor the full year, we're maintaining our FY '24 revenue expectations, down between 12% and 18% and down 15% at the midpoint. Given Q2 guidance, this implies a return to sequential growth in the second half of the year. Interest and other will be up approximately $100 million as we fund DFS originations in a higher interest rate environment. For our tax rate, you should assume 24% plus or minus 100 basis points. We are increasing our expectations for diluted earnings per share to $5.50, plus or minus $0.25.\nIn closing, expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business. in the current macro environment, focusing on what we can control and delivering for our customers. While there is near-term uncertainty, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term. We are committed to delivering our value creation framework with revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted EPS CAGR of 6% or higher and the net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or higher over time. We have returned $5 billion to shareholders over the last 6 quarters through share repurchases and dividends. Approximately 96% of our adjusted free cash flow over that time period, well in excess of our 40% to 60% return target.\nWe value our relationships with our shareholders, and we are actively listening to your feedback. We increased our annual dividend by 12% last quarter, and we recently put in place new governance enhancements to our Board and oversight structure. Ellen Kullman, has been elected by our Board as Lead Independent Director with robust oversight responsibilities. And our Board committee members are independent directors. Also, with recent S&P Global eligibility rule changes, we are encouraged about the potential for future inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.\nNow I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Yvonne.\n[Operator Instructions]\nLet's go to the first question.",

We are pleased with our FY '23 execution and financial results given the macroeconomic backdrop. FY '23 was ultimately a tale of 2 halves with 12% growth in the first half and revenue down 9% in the second half as the demand environment weakened over the course of the year. Net, we delivered record FY '23 revenue of $102.3 billion, up 1% on the back of 17% growth in FY '22, record OpInc of $8.6 billion, up 11% and record EPS of $7.61, up 22%. ISG, in particular, had a strong year with record revenue of $38.4 billion, including record revenue in both servers and networking and storage and record operating income of over $5 billion.\nImportantly, we are structural share gainers and continue to outperform the industry. We expect to gain over a point of share in mainstream server and storage revenue when the IDC calendar results come out later this month. In servers, we remain #1 in the market and have gained 9 points of mainstream server revenue share over the last 10 years. In storage, we are far and away the industry leader, bigger than #2, 3 and 4 players combined and have gained 4 points of share in the key midrange portion of the market over the last 5 years. And in PCs, we gained over 140 basis points of commercial PC unit share in calendar '22, our 10th consecutive year of share gains.\nFocusing on Q4, we again proved our ability to deliver against our commitments and execute no matter the market environment. We delivered Q4 revenue of $25 billion, down 11% with operating income of $2.2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.80 driven by strong ISG performance and disciplined cost management.\nISG revenue was $9.9 billion, up 7% with record profitability. ISG has now grown 8 consecutive quarters, and our end-to-end business model has proven to be a demonstrable competitive advantage in this changing environment. We've enhanced our relevancy with customers as spending priorities shifted from CSG to ISG over the course of the year, and we positioned our business to capture growth where it materialized in the IT market.\nSpecifically in ISG, we delivered record storage revenue of $5 billion, up 10%, including demand growth in PowerFlex, VxRail, Data Protection and PowerStore. We are pleased with our momentum in storage. The investments we made over the years strengthening our portfolio are paying off and have allowed us to drive growth and share gain in what was a resilient storage market in 2022. We grew servers and networking 5% in a challenging server demand environment by optimizing server shipments, along with strong attach and growing ASPs, a clear indication that we continue to sell deeper into customers' digital agendas.\nTurning to CSG. The PC market remains challenged. From a historic 2021, the PC market slowed markedly in June and experienced a sharp decline in calendar Q4. Consequently, our fiscal Q4 CSG revenue declined 23% to $13.4 billion. It was a continuation of trends we've seen in recent quarters. Commercial revenue fared better than consumer, down 17% as customers delayed PC purchases in the face of macroeconomic and hiring uncertainty. Consumer was down 40%.\nGiven the decline in revenue, CSG operating income was $671 million or 5% of revenue, primarily driven by descaling with revenue decreasing faster than OpEx. We are seeing increasing competitive pressure and elevated industry channel inventories, but we continue to maintain pricing discipline, execute our direct attach motion and focus on our relative performance in the most profitable segments of the PC market.\nIn this challenged and uncertain environment, we've stuck to a playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles, staying customer-focused, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, managing our cost position, maintaining pricing discipline and sustaining our unique and winning culture. In short, we have focused on what we can control.\nAnd in Q4, we continued to take decisive action, extending our existing cost controls, pausing external hiring, limiting travel and reducing outside services spend. We reduced our operating expenses, excluding compensation and benefits, by 5% versus last year, normalized for the extra week in the quarter. We also made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by an additional 5% as announced in February. We will continue to stay disciplined in our expense management as we navigate the current IT spending environment.\nIn Q4, we also advanced our innovation agenda. We launched our next generation of PowerEdge servers with significantly enhanced AI and machine learning capabilities and improved energy and cost efficiency for data center, cloud and edge environments, including new purpose-built XR servers for telecom, Open RAN and mobile edge use cases.\nAt Mobile World Congress this week, we announced new solutions and partnerships that will enable the telecommunications industry to accelerate the adoption of open network architecture, including Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks for Red Hat, an integrated solution specifically engineered, validated and supported by Dell to help network operators run their telecom workloads more efficiently.\nAnd we continue to lead in defining the next era of hybrid work solutions. At CES, we made announcements in a number of areas, including high-margin peripherals that improve the employee experience like our premier collaboration keyboard with dedicated touch controls to easily manage Zoom calls and a series of new monitors, including a 32-inch ultrasharp display with 6K resolution. We're proud of the substantial innovation that we've driven in all of our businesses in FY '23, and we have more exciting announcements coming in May at Dell Technologies World.\nLet me conclude by offering some brief observations on the demand environment. The broad caution in the IT spending environment that we started calling out in Q2 persists as customers continue to scrutinize every dollar in the current macro environment.\nExiting FY '23, we saw select growth in verticals like financial services, transportation and construction and real estate. However, we've continued to see demand softness across most other verticals, customer types and regions. Underlying demand in PCs and servers remains weak, and we are seeing signs of changing customer behavior in storage. Though Q4 was a very good storage demand quarter, we saw lengthening sales cycles and more cautious storage spending with strength in very large customers, offset by declines in medium and small business. Given that backdrop, we expect at least the early part of FY '24 to remain challenging.\nThat said, our fundamental belief in both the long-term health of our markets and the advantage of our business model haven't changed. Data continues to increase exponentially in both quantity and value, and customers continue to see us as trusted partners, helping them navigate the complexities of hybrid work, multicloud and the edge.\nUnlike in prior cycles, customers are not outright stopping digital investments. They continue to plan projects even as they scrutinize spend. This gives us confidence that we will see a rebound in spending and a return to sequential growth later this year. We're industry leaders in our categories, we're central to the technology agendas of our customers, and we have a track record of meeting our commitments and improving our strategic position no matter the environment.\nWe plan to stick to the playbook that served us well in FY '23 and prior cycles. Control what we can control, stay disciplined and agile, invest for the long term and meet our commitments to customers, team members and other stakeholders. We've positioned the business to navigate the current uncertainty and for the inevitable rebound.\nNow over to Tom for the detailed financials and guidance.\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nChief Financial Officer, Dell Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. We're pleased with the full year and Q4 P&L performances given the macro environment. As Chuck highlighted, we set new records this year and have continued to build on our industry-leading positions.\nTurning to our Q4 results, which, as a reminder, included a 14th week. We delivered revenue of $25 billion, down 11% with strong ISG performance, particularly in storage. Currency remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 410 basis points. Gross margin was $6 billion, up 3% and 23.8% of revenue. Gross margin rate was up 3 points due to a mix shift to ISG, component and logistics cost deflation and pricing discipline.\nThe pricing environment in ISG was generally consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters, while in CSG, we saw areas of pressure, particularly in consumer and in some commercial markets where, in some cases, our competitors were working to reduce their channel inventory. We continue to be disciplined in our pricing execution and within CSG, driving our direct model with a focus on attaching services, software, peripherals and financing.\nOperating expense was $3.8 billion, up 5%, driven by an extra week in our quarter and 15.1% of revenue. In Q4, we recorded a $281 million charge to our GAAP operating expense for our previously announced workforce reduction. Operating income was $2.2 billion, down 1% and 8.7% of revenue with the extra week of operating expenses roughly offsetting an extra week of gross margin.\nOur quarterly tax rate was 26% and 20% for the full year. Q4 net income was $1.3 billion, down 5%, primarily driven by slightly higher interest expense, including a 14th week in the quarter and a slight decrease in operating income.\nFully diluted earnings per share was $1.80, up 5% due to a lower share count. Our recurring revenue is approximately $5.6 billion a quarter, up 12%, and our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $40 billion, down due to a reduction in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was up primarily due to an increase in service and software maintenance agreements.\nNow turning to our business units. In ISG, we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Revenue was $9.9 billion, up 7%, driven by strong storage and server and networking performance. Storage revenue was a record $5 billion, up 10%, and servers and networking revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5%.\nISG operating income came in at a record $1.5 billion or 15.6% of revenue, up 360 basis points as we benefited from cost favorability, pricing discipline and revenue growth, including a higher mix of storage software.\nOur Client Solutions Group revenue was down 23% to $13.4 billion primarily due to continued softness in both the commercial and consumer PC markets. Commercial revenue was $10.7 billion, down 17%, and consumer revenue was $2.7 billion, down 40%, though average selling prices continued to trend higher in both businesses. CSG operating income was $700 million and 5% of revenue.\nAs we have historically seen when the macro environment has slowed, customers' interest in consumption and financing models that provide both payment flexibility and predictability has increased. Our Q4 Dell Financial Services originations were $3 billion, up 12%, with strength across all geographies. DFS ending managed assets reached $14.7 billion, up 9%, while credit losses remained at historically low levels, given the strength of our portfolio, which is over 60% investment grade. And we more than doubled the number of active APEX customers that have subscribed to our as-a-Service solutions over the course of the year.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion in Q4 and $3.6 billion for the full year. Our strong Q4 cash flow was driven by profitability partially offset by a use in working capital. Within working capital, inventory was down $1.4 billion sequentially due to disciplined management and strong shipments at the end of the quarter. However, the inventory improvement was offset by a temporary increase in receivables driven by linearity of revenue in the quarter and a decline in payables given reduced inventory purchases and timing of disbursements.\nOur commitment to improving working capital efficiency remains a priority as we continue to focus on unlocking capital within the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in cash and investments, up $3.7 billion sequentially driven by free cash flow generation and a $2 billion debt issuance, partially offset by $400 million in capital returns.\nOur core debt balance ended the year at $18.1 billion, up due to the debt issuance. We intend to use part of the issuance proceeds to pay down the $1 billion maturity coming due in June and will consider using the remaining proceeds to prepay other debt in the capital structure over time.\nTurning to capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining the flexibility to be opportunistic. In Q4, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of stock for $150 million and paid $236 million in dividends. And for the full year, we repurchased 62.4 million shares for $2.8 billion and paid approximately $1 billion in dividends.\nAs we highlighted in our press release earlier today and as part of our commitment to capital returns, we are raising our annual dividend from $1.32 to $1.48 per share, an increase of 12%, reflecting our confidence in our long-term business model and our ability to generate and grow cash flow over time.\nTurning to guidance. Given the demand trends we saw last quarter, we expect Q1 revenue to be seasonally lower than average, down sequentially between 17% and 21%, 19% at the midpoint. Currency continues to be a headwind, and we are expecting a roughly 300 basis point impact to Q1 revenue. We expect the ISG business to be down sequentially in the mid-20s as we come off a seasonally strong storage quarter to Q1, which is typically a seasonally weaker storage quarter, and we expect CSG revenue down sequentially in the mid-teens. We will remain disciplined in our pricing and expect gross margin rates to be relatively flat sequentially.\nFor our tax rate, you should assume a 24% plus or minus 100 basis points for Q1 and for fiscal year '24. We expect our Q1 diluted share count to be between 737 million and 742 million shares and our diluted EPS to be $0.80, plus or minus $0.15, down sequentially, primarily driven by lower revenue.\nFor the full year, we continue to see a wide range of outcomes. We expect revenue to be down between 12% and 18% and down 15% at the midpoint of the range. Given Q1 guidance, this implies a return to sequential growth as we move through the year. We'll continue to be mindful of our pricing discipline and our cost structure, making adjustments as appropriate, depending on the environment while also continuing to invest in innovation.\nInterest and other will be up approximately $200 million as we fund DFS originations in a higher interest rate environment. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share of $5.30 plus or minus $0.30.\nIn closing, we delivered solid fiscal year '23 financial results. And over the last 3 years, we have now grown our revenue at a 6% CAGR and our EPS at an 18% CAGR. While there is near-term uncertainty, particularly in the first half of fiscal year '24, we have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term, and we remain committed to delivering our value creation framework with a revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted earnings per share CAGR of 6% plus and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better over time.\nWe have returned approximately $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal year '23 through share repurchase and dividends and expect to return 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Expect us to continue to be disciplined in how we manage the business in the current macro environment, focusing on what we can control and delivering for our customers. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",

I'd like to inform all participants that this call is being recorded at the request of Dell Technologies. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Technologies Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information whole or part without prior written permission of Dell Technologies is prohibited. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSVP of IR, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Jeff Clarke, Chuck Whitten, Tom Sweet and Tyler Johnson. Our earnings materials are available on our IR website, and I encourage you to review our materials and presentation which includes additional content to complement our discussion this afternoon. Guidance will be covered on today's call.\nDuring this call, unless otherwise indicated, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. A reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our web deck and our press release. Growth percentages refer to year-over-year change unless otherwise specified.\nStatements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected due to a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our web deck and our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.\nNow I'll turn it over to Chuck.\n\nAnthony Charles Whitten\n\nCo-COO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. We delivered very good results, including strong ISG revenue with record profitability and good CSG profitability despite the difficult demand environment that we highlighted in our last earnings call. The net of our disciplined execution was Q3 revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% with record operating income of $2.4 billion and record diluted EPS of $2.30. ISG revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12%, while CSG was $13.8 billion, down 17%.\nFrom a macro perspective, Q3 played out as we previewed last quarter. Soft underlying PC demand and slowing infrastructure demand. Though storage did hold up fairly well relative to servers with growth in multiple storage types, including high-end and PowerStore. Our Q3 performance underscores our strategic focus, the advantages of our model and our ability to deliver differentiated results in any market environment.\nOur unique sales model provides direct, real-time feedback from customers of all sizes and across geographies and industries, which allows us to see the demand environment shift faster than the rest of the industry. And as the demand environment changed, we reacted quickly and decisively, which showed in our results. We took actions to reduce costs, decreasing our operating expense 3% sequentially in Q2 and another 6% sequentially in Q3.\nWe have now reduced quarterly operating expense by over $300 million since Q1. We reduced server backlog consistent with our Q2 commentary, and delivered strong profitability as our model allowed us to access component cost deflation faster than the rest of the industry. And we stayed focused on relative performance in the most profitable segments of the market. Despite some expected distortions in the PC market given elevated competitor backlog, we continue to gain commercial PC unit share in Q3 and have now gained share in 35 of the last 39 quarters. In ISG, we expect to extend our industry-leading share positions in servers and storage when Q3 IDC results are announced in December.\nAnd we executed on all of the above without compromising our innovation agenda, with 30 infrastructure launches in the last 13 weeks, including 6 new Dell APEX offerings in strategic areas like multi-cloud, edge and subscription and as-a-Service. We're excited about the launch of Project Frontier, our initiative to deliver an edge operation software platform focused on unifying edge operations across infrastructure and applications for a broad set of industries.\nAnd earlier today, we announced the availability of PowerFlex, our flagship software-defined storage solution on AWS. With the cloud-first design point, PowerFlex on AWS is the first of Dell's industry-leading storage offerings available in the public cloud as part of Project Alpine. Our effort to bring our industry-leading storage software to public cloud to provide multi-cloud data mobility and simplify data management.\nIt will enable customers to use Dell storage software capabilities and APIs wherever their data resides, without the need for purpose-built or specialized public cloud infrastructure. Our new Project Alpine related SaaS offerings will add to our growing portfolio of APEX solutions, while enabling our customers to harness the power of multi-cloud.\nStepping back, the near-term market remains challenged and uncertain. On one hand, we are seeing some customers delay IT purchases. Other customers continue to move ahead with Dell given the criticality of technology to their long-term competitiveness and a growing need to drive near-term productivity through IT. The world continues to digitally transform. Data continues to grow exponentially, and customers continue to look to technology to drive their business forward no matter the economic climate.\nAs the market leader in commercial PCs and infrastructure, we are well positioned, whether a customer is seeking to drive growth, productivity and efficiencies or a combination. We're trusted advisers to our customers, and we have a business model that allows us to adjust quickly to meet their needs.\nSo we are very confident in our ability to adapt and deliver results despite the near-term uncertainty. Q3 was proof of our underlying advantages and ability to execute no matter the environment. As always, we'll continue to focus on what we can control, taking care of our customers, driving differentiated relative performance, delivering against our innovation agenda, managing our cost position, maintaining pricing discipline and building a unique and winning culture with our team.\nThis is the playbook that has served us well across multiple cycles and no matter the backdrop, we intend to accelerate our strategic position as we did in Q3.\nNow I'll turn it over to Tom for the financials.\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. I'm pleased with our Q3 P&L performance despite the tougher near-term demand environment. As Chuck mentioned, we highlighted the softening environment and slowing ISG demand in our Q2 earnings conversation and the third quarter generally played out as we expected, albeit with server demand velocity slowing a bit more than we anticipated. We continue to focus on executing our strategy to win in the consolidation and modernization of our core markets. And we have executed well over the last few years and again in Q3.\nIn ISG, we've grown our revenue for 7 consecutive quarters and have grown our revenue at a 3% CAGR since fiscal year '20. We have been consistent structural share gainers in servers where we are #1, gaining 530 basis points over the last 5 years in mainstream server revenue per IDC. In storage, we are bigger than 2 and 3 combined. And with our refreshed storage portfolio, we have added to our #1 position, gaining share over the last 2 quarters and anticipate gaining share in both storage as well as servers again this quarter when IDC results come out in December.\nOur CSG business has grown at a 12% CAGR since fiscal year '20. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we have gained commercial PC unit share in 35 of the last 39 quarters, including Q3.\nTurning to our Q3 results. We delivered revenue of $24.7 billion, down 6% with strong ISG performance, particularly in servers. We reduced total backlog by $1.2 billion sequentially during the quarter with CSG backlog now in a more normal range and ISG backlog slightly elevated year-on-year but substantially reduced from the beginning of the quarter.\nProfitability was strong in Q3. Gross margin was $5.9 billion, up 2% and 23.7% of revenue. Gross margin percentage was up 2 points, primarily due to a favorable mix shift to ISG and a decrease in our cost of goods sold due to certain components turning deflationary along with declining logistics costs. FX remained a headwind and impacted revenue by approximately 420 basis points. Q3 operating expense was $3.5 billion, down 8% and 14.1% of revenue as we slowed hiring and reduced discretionary costs given the current macro environment.\nAs a result, operating income was a record $2.4 billion, up 22% and 9.6% of revenue. Our year-to-date tax rate decreased to 18.2%, primarily due to geographic mix of income. Q3 net income was $1.7 billion, up 30%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Fully diluted earnings per share was a record $2.30, up 39%, with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 743 million shares as a result of share repurchases in Q3.\nOur recurring revenue is approximately $5.4 billion a quarter, up 11%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $39 billion, down year-over-year due to a decline in backlog, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue.\nTurning to our business units. In ISG, Q3 revenue was $9.6 billion, up 12% driven by a reduction in our server backlog, consistent with our Q2 call commentary.\nServers and networking revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14%, and storage revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11%. As mentioned, we did see softening unit demand in servers, somewhat offset by higher average selling prices, given richer configurations driven by customers running more complex workloads. ISG operating income came in at a record $1.4 billion or 14.3% of revenue which was up 390 basis points as we benefited from scale with lower operating expenses and pricing discipline.\nOur Client Solutions Group revenue was down 17% to $13.8 billion, primarily due to underlying softness in both commercial and consumer demand. Commercial revenue was $10.7 billion, down 13% and consumer revenue was $3 billion, down 29%. Average selling prices trended higher in both commercial and consumer as customers bought PCs with richer configurations. CSG operating income was $1.1 billion, down 7% primarily due to scaling partially offset by stronger gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses.\nCSG operating income was 7.7% of revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 17% with strength across geographies and DFS ended the quarter with $13.8 billion in assets. We have historically seen stronger originations and more recently, an increasing interest in subscription models as the macro environment slows.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was approximately $400 million in Q3 and is $3.9 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Q3 cash flow was helped by profitability but offset by the sequential revenue decline in the P&L and a use in working capital. Within working capital, inventory was up sequentially as we strategically accelerated purchases of some key components as we continue to navigate through supply chain dynamics. Improving working capital efficiency and reducing inventory remains a priority.\nOur core debt balance is $16.2 billion, and our core leverage ratio is 1.6x. We ended the quarter with $6.5 billion in cash and investments, down $600 million sequentially, principally due to $800 million in capital returns.\nTurning to capital allocation. We repurchased 16.3 million shares of stock in Q3 for $609 million and paid $238 million in dividends. In addition to our $1 billion annual dividend, since the beginning of our current share repurchase program, we have bought back 70.3 million shares for $3.36 billion. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic.\nTurning to guidance. Considering the demand environment, we expect Q4 revenue between $23 billion and $24 billion, down 16% at the midpoint with ISG roughly flat. Similar to Q3, currency continues to be a headwind for us. We are expecting a roughly 500 basis point impact to Q4 revenue. We continue to be focused on managing costs. However, we do expect to see a roughly $150 million OpEx increase sequentially given the extra week in our fiscal Q4.\nWe expect our interest and other expense to be up $60 million sequentially driven by interest rate volatility and the impact on our derivatives portfolio. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 22% at the midpoint, which reflects a 19% plus or minus 100 basis point rate for the full year. We expect our diluted share count to be roughly 730 million to 735 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.80, down 4% at the midpoint.\nI recognize that many of you have questions about our view on fiscal year '24. It's still early in our annual planning process. However, I'll frame our current thinking. We expect ongoing global macroeconomic factors, including slowing economic growth, inflation, rising interest rates and currency pressure to weigh on our customers. And as a result, their IT spending intentions even as they continue to digitize their businesses. These dynamics are creating a broader range of financial outcomes for our upcoming fiscal year, particularly as we think about the second half of the year. With what we know today, it's likely next year's revenue is below historical sequentials using our Q4 guidance as a starting point.\nIn closing, we delivered strong third quarter financial results. We have strong conviction in the growth of our TAM over the long term even though some customers have paused purchases in the near term, and we are committed to delivering our value creation framework with a revenue CAGR of 3% to 4%, a diluted earnings per share CAGR of 6% plus and a net income to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 100% or better.\nSince fiscal year '20, our revenue has grown at an 8% CAGR, our diluted earnings per share has grown at nearly a 20% CAGR, and we have exceeded our net income to adjusted free cash flow target in each of the last 3 fiscal years. We have also committed to return 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders over time and have returned $4.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the last 12 months through share repurchase and dividends.\nWe will continue to be disciplined in how we are managing the business in our financial posture in this complex macro environment, focusing on what we can control and helping our customers along their digital journey.\nNow I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSVP of IR, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. We ask that each participant ask 1 question to allow us to get to as many of you as possible. Let's go to the first question.",

Chuck will cover CSG and ISG operating performance, and Tom will cover our financial results and guidance.\nNow I'd like to turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nCo-COO & Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nHello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. In Q2, we executed well and delivered strong financial results despite a rapidly changing and challenging macro environment. We also advanced our long-term strategy, growing the core while innovating for our customers and enabling their opportunities in the data era. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $26.4 billion, up 9%, with growth in both CSG and ISG. And diluted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our differentiated business model and execution enabled us to outperform in the segments we serve. And in calendar Q2, we gained PC share and expect to gain share in server and storage when IDC releases Q2 results.\nI'd like to take a couple of minutes and talk about the macros that provides important context for our remarks today. Since we last spoke in late May, our view of the demand environment through the back half of FY '23 has changed. The demand environment slowed and pushed to the right over the course of the quarter, particularly in CSG. We saw a decline in PC demand as we went through the quarter with higher ASPs, partially offsetting a unit decline. Our supply chain execution was excellent throughout the quarter, and we were able to offset the CSG demand weakness with backlog reduction in CSG.\nWe saw ISG demand while still growing slow and pushed throughout the quarter. The Q2 and second half macro dynamics have become more challenging as customers are taking a more cautious view of their needs given the uncertainty. We have responded swiftly by managing inventories down and reducing our expenditures.\nNow let me turn to the supply chain and innovation. Like Q1, we are still seeing shortage of parts and embedded integrated circuits, including power supplies and mix. ISG backlog, particularly servers, remains elevated. PC backlog is now at normal levels as Q2 PC shipments significantly outpaced demand and the portfolio is on standard lead time across the board. On the cost front, we expect modest deflation in aggregate component costs in Q3, while logistics rates are beginning to decline. Our strength in ASPs over the last year have been a result of richer configurations and product mix, but the lower cost environment could have an impact.\nTurning to innovation. We are proud of the significant advances we have made in the first half of the year developing new solutions for our customers. Expanding our multi-cloud ecosystem and delivering new cloud experiences that include all major public clouds, Project Alpine, which brings our enterprise-class data services into public clouds for bursting, test and development, cloud-based analytics and data and container mobility. The largest release in PowerStore history and the new PowerMax OS 10 software deliver more than 500 new Dell storage software advancements that help customers deliver faster insights, achieve better multi-cloud data control and increase cyber resiliency.\nNew APEX offerings like Dell APEX Cyber Recovery Services that extend beyond storage, compute and data protection and deliver APEX as a full stack solution. And in CSG, we continue to deliver new commercial devices for our hybrid world, including the Latitude 9330, the world's first laptop with a collaboration touch pad.\nWe also recently celebrated 25 years of precision innovation, driving many industry firsts along the way. I actually led the workstation business when we launched Precision, so I'm particularly proud of this 1 in our #1 position worldwide. As we've highlighted, we're also innovating in strategic growth areas like telecom, and I'd like to provide a few examples of our progress in this important area. In May, we announced that we joined forces with T-Mobile to make it easier for enterprises and government customers to embrace 5G. T-Mobile's 5G private mobile network combined with Dell's edge computing technologies will bring customers the power of 5G connectivity on-premise where they need it.\nIn June, DISH marked a major milestone in building the world's most advanced cloud-native 5G Open RAN network. They now offer 5G broadband service to over 20% of the U.S. population on a cloud-native network built on Dell's open IT infrastructure, software and services. As we think about the second half of the year, we remain focused on what we can control: execution, relative performance, prudent cost management and delivering for our customers and shareholders like we did during Q2. What we have shown over the years is regardless of the environment, we are agile and built to outperform.\nNow let me turn it over to Chuck.\n\nAnthony Charles Whitten\n\nCo-COO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. We delivered strong financial results and excellent relative performance in CSG and ISG while managing the shifting demand dynamics as the quarter progressed. Starting with CSG. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $15.5 billion, up 9%, with operating income at 6.3% of revenue. Consistent with our Q1 commentary, commercial continues to fare better than consumer. Commercial revenue grew 15%, while consumer revenue declined 9%. An important measure of our success in any market environment is relative performance, and we again drove differentiated share results. We gained over 200 basis points of worldwide PC unit share and over 100 basis points of display share in calendar Q2 according to IDC. We have now gained PC unit share in 34 of the last 38 quarters. And in commercial PCs, our focus on the most profitable segment of the market, we gained over 300 basis points of unit share in calendar Q2 to claim the #1 spot worldwide.\nTurning to ISG. We delivered another record Q2 with ISG revenue of $9.5 billion, up 12%, our sixth consecutive quarter of growth, with operating income at 11% of revenue. Servers and networking grew 16% and storage grew 6%, our seventh consecutive quarter of servers and networking growth and our fifth consecutive quarter of demand growth in storage. The breadth of our storage portfolio continues to be a competitive advantage with #1 positions across storage categories. The breadth of leading capabilities is a real differentiator for us as one-size-fits-all architectures simply do not meet customers' diverse needs in the data era.\nIn Q2, we saw modest storage demand growth with strength in the high end and in our marquee midrange product, PowerStore, which grew double digits and has grown every single quarter since launch. And in servers, we saw demand growth in most geographies, albeit at a moderating pace. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect to gain server and storage share in calendar Q2 when IDC releases results in September.\nFinally, in ISG, I'd call out our momentum on APEX, our offerings for customers looking to buy infrastructure as a subscription. Our APEX ARR is now over $1 billion, and we grew orders 78% year-on-year in Q2 while adding almost 200 new customers. Customers like Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco, who is using APEX private cloud to support its growth and cloud strategy and realizing significant cost savings as the financial institution serves its members, and customers like Montage Health, who's using APEX private cloud to provide clinicians better access to critical applications and information for patient care and staff collaboration.\nStepping back, the near-term market outlook is marked by mixed signals, as Jeff highlighted in his macro comments. That said, we remain confident in the long-term health of our markets and in our competitive position. There has been a clear and significant increase in the size of the PC market from prepandemic levels as hybrid work has become the default approach for companies worldwide. And automation and digital transformation remain the backbone of our customers' strategies necessary for productivity and growth. Done right, technology investments are key to competitive advantage in the data era and can reduce costs while combating an environment with high inflation and labor shortages.\nSo we remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of our core markets and our opportunity to build meaningful new businesses in the data and multi-cloud era and in our durable competitive advantages that enable us to outcompete in any environment.\nNow I'll turn it over to Tom for the financials.\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. We delivered record Q2 revenue of $26.4 billion, up 9%, driven by strength in both CSG and ISG. We highlighted in late May that we thought fiscal year '23 would see a more robust infrastructure investment cycle, while PC growth would moderate. While we did see modest infrastructure demand growth in Q2, we now see a more challenging ISG demand environment as we head toward the back half of the year. And in CSG, we are seeing demand weakness in both consumer and commercial.\nOverall gross margin was $5.7 billion, roughly flat and 21.4% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 200 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to an increase in our cost and FX headwinds not yet entirely reflected in pricing as we balance profitability with competitive positioning.\nOperating expense was $3.7 billion, down 3% and 14% of revenue. During the quarter, we instituted a number of cost reduction measures, including a slowdown in external hiring. Operating income was $2 billion, up 4% at 7.4% of revenue. Our tax rate was 19.9% and net income was $1.3 billion, up 9%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances.\nFully diluted earnings per share was $1.68, up 14%, with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 755 million shares as a result of repurchases.\nNote that our GAAP profitability was impacted by a $255 million net adjustment to the value of our strategic investment portfolio given market conditions and $189 million charge relating to exiting our business in Russia, both of which are primarily noncash items.\nOur recurring revenue is approximately $5.2 billion a quarter, up 8%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $41 billion, up 2% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Dell Financial Services originations were $2.3 billion, up 24%, driven in part by our technology rotation solutions. We have historically seen stronger originations when the macroeconomic environment slows and DFS ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in assets.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $700 million in Q2 and is $5.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Q2 cash flow was primarily driven by growth in profitability, partially offset by a use of working capital. Working capital was impacted by an increase in receivables due to the timing of sales later in the quarter, partially offset by a $400 million sequential reduction in inventory. The quality and aging of our receivables is strong and the team did a nice job on inventory this quarter, which will remain a focus as we move through the rest of the year.\nOur core debt balance is $16.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash and investments, down $1.4 billion sequentially, principally due to $900 million in capital returns and a $300 million strategic investment portfolio write-down on a gross basis. We repurchased 13.6 million shares of stock in Q2 for $608 million and paid $242 million in dividends. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic like we were in Q1 and in Q2.\nTurning to guidance. As Jeff highlighted, we're seeing customers become more cautious given the current macroeconomic environment. We saw a softening in CSG specific to consumer and chrome in Q1. In Q2, the decrease in demand velocity extended to commercial clients, and we are seeing more cautious spending within our ISG business. Currency also continues to be a headwind for us, roughly 500 basis points for Q3 and roughly 400 basis points for the full year. Against that backdrop, we now expect Q3 revenue between $23.8 billion and $25 billion, down 8% at the midpoint, with CSG declining in the high teens and ISG growing in the low teens. We do expect gross margin rates to increase sequentially as mix shifts to ISG.\nGiven the cost controls we have in place, we expect OpEx spend to be down versus Q2. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20% plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted share count to be roughly 750 million to 755 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.79, flat year-on-year at the midpoint. The environment we saw in late May translated to a 6% growth expectation for the full year with diluted earnings per share growing 12%. Given the change in the demand environment, our current view for fiscal year '23 is revenue flat to up 2%, with diluted earnings per share between $6.60 and $7, up 9% at the midpoint.\nIn closing, we delivered strong second quarter financial results but are more cautious as we enter the second half. We are actively managing our cost and spending, and we remain focused on what we can control, executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future. And we expect to deliver revenue and earnings per share growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time.\nNow I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSVP of IR, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Let's go ahead and get to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, can you go ahead and take the first question?",

We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call today, Jeff will recap Q1 and innovation highlights from Dell Technologies World, along with the current demand and supply chain environments. Chuck will cover detailed Q1 CSG and ISG operating performance. And Tom will cover our Q1 financial results, capital allocation and guidance.\nNow I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nCo-COO & Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nHello, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Following a record FY '22, we continue to execute quite well in a complex macro environment. We are focused on our long-term strategy while continuing to innovate, enhancing existing solutions and creating new ones for our customers.\nFor Q1, we delivered record revenue of $26.1 billion, up 16%, with strong, balanced growth across CSG and ISG. We also improved our profitability in the quarter, and we will continue to focus on disciplined cost management. As a result, diluted EPS was $1.84, a record, up 36%. Over the last 12 months, we have generated $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We are grateful to succeed alongside our customers.\nAt Dell Technologies World, customers like CVS Health, USAA, General Motors and Boeing talked about reinventing their processes and their industries while unleashing innovation productivity and sustainability with Dell as a key technology partner.\nWe highlighted our role in the multi-cloud future, announcing a steady stream of innovation that places us at the center of our customers' multi-cloud world. Specifically, we made a series of announcements that demonstrate the work we are doing to build a multi-cloud ecosystem that includes all major public clouds. We shared Project Alpine, which brings enterprise-class data services into the public cloud for cloud bursting, test and development, cloud-based analytics, data and container mobility. We are also unlocking the power of data through our partnership with Snowflake, the first of its kind that provides direct access to Dell object storage on-prem, and we are including cybersecurity throughout.\nIn addition, we also announced over 500 software enhancements to our industry-leading storage portfolio. For PowerMax, the world's most secure, mission-critical storage, we introduced a new intelligent NVMe multi-node, scaled out architecture with isolated cyber-vaults, 65 million immutable snapshots in the industry's first data compression for mainframes.\nFor PowerStore, we added ease and integration, significantly boosted mixed workload performance deepened VMware integration and added native metro sync replication. And with PowerFlex, we have the only software-defined infrastructure that scales almost limitlessly, for compute and storage while supporting bare metal, all hypervisors and file and block storage services on a single platform with increased cyber resiliency and multi-cloud extensions.\nThese software-driven innovations enable a continuously modern storage experience with highly-adaptable storage architectures, comprehensive cyber resiliency and multi-cloud ecosystem flexibility.\nAnd lastly, we announced a range of APEX offers that further expand our subscription and as-a-service capabilities. To date, the transition towards multi-cloud and a highly-distributed architecture is playing out much like we thought. It's clear our strategy is resonating across our customers and partner ecosystem.\nTurning to the supply chain. We experienced a wide range of semiconductor shortages that impacted CSG and ISG in Q1. In addition, the COVID lockdowns in China caused temporary supply chain interruptions in the quarter. As a result, backlog levels were elevated across CSG and ISG exiting the quarter.\nWe expect backlog to remain elevated through at least Q2 due to current demand and industry-wide supply chain challenges. Q1 component costs were deflationary across key commodities, but logistics spend remained elevated due to higher rates and a mix of expedited parts.\nTurning to Q2. We expect component cost to turn inflationary and logistics costs remain at elevated levels. That all said, Dell Technologies is well positioned to navigate these supply chain challenges just as we have over the past 3-plus years.\nThe big picture. As we previously noted, we are seeing a shift in spend from consumer and PCs to data center infrastructure. IT demand is currently healthy. However, there are a number of uncertainties out in the broader macro that we continue to monitor: geopolitical issues, inflation, ongoing supply chain challenges, chip constraints and COVID shutdowns.\nWhat we've shown over the years is that regardless of the environment, we are agile and built to outperform. We are able to quickly lean into opportunities and focus on what we can control, executing our strategy for growth, innovating for our customers, motivating our teams, building better communities and delivering for our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck for a deeper dive into our segment results.\n\nAnthony Charles Whitten\n\nCo-COO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Great to be here with all of you and excited to share the details of our Q1 business unit performance.\nStarting with ISG, we delivered another record Q1 with 16% growth and $9.3 billion of revenue. It's our fifth consecutive quarter of growth as widespread digital transformation continues to support growth and infrastructure spend.\nISG profitability was up with operating income growing 39% and operating margins expanding 200 basis points to 11.7%. Servers and networking revenue grew 22%, and storage revenue grew 9% as 4 consecutive quarters of demand growth has now made its way into the P&L. We were particularly pleased with the breadth of strength in storage. In Q1, we saw storage demand growth across our portfolio, including data protection, HCI, unstructured, entry, high end and PowerStore, our marquee mid-range solution and still the fastest-growing storage architecture in company history.\nTurning to Client Solutions. CSG also delivered a record Q1 with revenue of $15.6 billion, up 17% on top of a strong prior year comp of 20% growth. This was outstanding absolute and relative performance. We gained 190 basis points of PC unit share in calendar Q1 based on IDC results, the most among the top 4 industry vendors.\nWe have now gained unit share in 33 of the last 37 quarters. But as we've highlighted, not all PC units are created equal. Our focus on the commercial segment paid off in Q1 as commercial demand was solid and we saw softness in Consumer and Chrome as expected.\nCommercial CSG revenue grew 22%, while Consumer grew 3%. We also saw continued strength in software and peripherals as customers continue to seek exceptional PC experiences in the \"do anything from anywhere\" world. Our market-leading display business, for example, grew 20% and gained 370 basis points in calendar Q1 according to preliminary IDC data.\nThe net of strong commercial performance, peripheral growth and disciplined cost management with strong profitability. The business delivered an op inc margin of 7.2%, and we have delivered roughly $1 billion of op inc or better over the last 7 quarters.\nLooking ahead, we are seeing a rotation in IT spending from CSG to ISG. Despite economic uncertainty, digital transformation and automation efforts are being used to solve the pressing challenges at the moment as technology and business strategies emerge, benefiting our infrastructure business. We expect ISG growth for the full fiscal year.\nAnd PCs are now a C-suite issue. In the world of hybrid work and in a fiercely competitive talent market, the PC is the gateway to the employee experience and a visible symbol of a company's commitment to technology. We do, however, expect CSG growth to moderate over the course of the year as the Consumer portion of the market slows.\nQ1 is proof of the benefits of having a strong geographically and sector diverse business covering the end-user to the edge, to the core data center, to the cloud. We are central to our customers' technology agendas, creating predictability, durability and flexibility in our business to pursue growth wherever it materializes in the IT market.\nAs Jeff stated, there is some macro uncertainty right now. but we have shown time and time again the ability to navigate any market environment by focusing on our customers, our employees, our long-term strategy and our stakeholders.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. As Jeff highlighted earlier, we delivered record Q1 revenue of $26.1 billion, up 16%, driven by strong growth in both CSG and ISG. We have previously highlighted that we thought fiscal year '23 would see a more robust infrastructure investment cycle while PC growth would shift back towards historical patterns. To date, this appears to be how fiscal year '23 is shaping.\nGross margin was $5.9 billion, up 9% at 22.7% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 150 basis points lower, primarily due to increased component and logistics cost. However, it was up 190 basis points sequentially due to improvement in both CSG and ISG gross margin percentages as more of our prior pricing actions took effect. We also saw a richer PC and server configurations and stronger storage performance in the quarter.\nOperating expense was $3.8 billion, up 3% at 14.5% of revenue as a result of investments in our team members and targeted investments in our growth areas, including capabilities to support our evolving business model. We will balance these investments with prudent cost discipline given the uncertainties in the current environment.\nOperating income was a Q1 record of $2.1 billion, up 21% at 8.2% of revenue. Net income was $1.4 billion, up 36%, primarily driven by growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to our lower debt balances. Our tax rate was 19.3%.\nFully diluted earnings per share was $1.84, up 36% with diluted share count decreasing sequentially to 780 million shares as a result of repurchases.\nOur recurring revenue was approximately $5.3 billion a quarter, up 15%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $42 billion, up 14% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue.\nDell Financial Services originations were $2.1 billion, up 9% and DFS ended the quarter with $13.2 billion in total managed assets.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Our use of cash from operations was $300 million in Q1, primarily driven by our annual bonus payout and seasonal revenue decline. As a reminder, Q1 is often a use of cash given the seasonality in our business and the timing of our annual incentive compensation payments.\nThe team did a nice job on working capital management in the quarter, minimizing the increase in inventory due to supply chain challenges and reducing receivables. Our core debt balance is $16.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and investments, down $2.8 billion sequentially principally due to seasonally low free cash flow and $1.75 billion in shareholder capital returns.\nWe repurchased 28.8 million shares of stock in Q1 for $1.5 billion and issued $250 million in dividends. Going forward, we will continue our balanced capital allocation approach, repurchasing shares programmatically to manage dilution while maintaining flexibility to be opportunistic like we were in Q1.\nTurning to Q2 and fiscal year '23. Digital transformation is a top priority for our customers, and it's fueling our growth as our customers look for a partner in their multi-cloud journey. Global IT spend is projected in the mid-single digits. And with what we see today, the current demand environment supports this. Against that backdrop, we expect Q2 revenue between $26.1 billion and $27.1 billion, up 10% at the midpoint with both CSG and ISG growing. We expect foreign currency to be a headwind for both Q2 and for the full year.\nWe do expect gross margin rates to decrease sequentially as CSG mix increases and we managed through inflation and currency dynamics with an elevated backlog. OpEx will remain roughly flat to Q1 as a percentage of revenue. For our non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20%, plus or minus 100 basis points. We expect diluted share count to be roughly 760 million to 765 million shares. Netting this out, we expect diluted earnings per share of $1 to $1.15 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.55 to $1.70, up 10% at the midpoint.\nAs you know, we are coming off a record fiscal year '22 and a good start to fiscal year '23. Last quarter, we talked about our long-term value creation framework of 3% to 4% of revenue growth and EPS growth of 6% or better as a starting point for the year.\nAs we look at the balance of fiscal year '23, we're watching a few macroeconomic dynamics, including the geopolitical environment, inflation, interest rates, slowing economic growth, currency and continued COVID impacts disrupting supply chains and business activity. While we believe these macro dynamics will have some impact on overall IT investment spending, with what we know today, our updated framework has revenue growth of approximately 6% with both CSG and ISG growing for the year and earnings per share growth faster than revenue in the range of 12% or better.\nIn closing, we delivered a strong quarter with record Q1 revenue, operating income and diluted earnings per share. We remain focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future while delivering revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time.\nNow I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.\n\nRobert L. Williams\n\nSVP of IR, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Let's get to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Jermiria, can you please introduce the first question?",

During the call today, Jeff will recap FY '22, the demand environment heading into FY '23 and supply chain dynamics in CSG. Chuck will cover ISG and our growth initiatives, and Tom will cover our Q4 financial results, capital allocation and guidance. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nCo-COO & Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. FY '22 was a historic year for Dell Technologies. In fact, the best in our company's history. We reached more than $100 billion in revenue and grew 17%, a huge achievement for a company of our scale and ahead of our long-term value creation growth rates. And our opportunity continues to grow as we look ahead to FY '23. We are more vital than ever to our customers in an expanding market led by digital transformation.\nIT investments remain a top priority for our customers as technology has become even more essential to their business. It's how you turn data into insight and action into better customer experience and competitive advantage. Customers also want choice and a trusted partner. Our position at the center of our customers' digital agenda and at the center of the technology ecosystem makes Dell the logical choice.\nYou can see in how we're winning with the customers like the Miami Dolphins, AT&T and Vodafone, with the world's largest reinsurer, Munich Re and one of India's largest manufacturers green panel across data storage, hyperconverged infrastructure and in adjacent opportunities like multi-cloud as-a-service, edge and telecom.\nWe are continuing to gain share in our core businesses and these emerging opportunities where we can bring our advantages to bear. We have differentiated ourselves through consistent performance, across different economic environments, uncredited challenges and unforeseen events, and we have leaned into new opportunities always with an eye toward our customers.\nIn FY '22, we delivered record revenue of $101.2 billion. Record operating income of $7.8 billion, diluted EPS of $6.22 and record cash flow from operations of $7.1 billion, truly a record year. And Q4 was no different. We saw 17% growth in demand of our products and services in the quarter with broad growth across geos, industry vertical and business units. As a result, we delivered record revenue up 16%.\nOperating income was a record, up 1%, but slightly below our November guidance as we optimize our performance based on customer needs, parts availability and backlog dynamics. Being trusted partners to our investors and lenders as well as our customers is important to us. And in FY '22, we unlock shareholder value by the spin of VMware, simplifying our capital structure, deleveraging our balance sheet, returning to investment-grade ratings, approving a share buyback program for up to $5 billion and today, announcing a quarterly dividend at an initial annual rate of $1.32 a share.\nNow let me shift gears and share a little color on the current supply chain dynamics, and then we will move into BU performance. The global supply chain shortage of semiconductors and global logistics challenges for goods and components continues to impact just about every industry. We are still experiencing shortages of integrated circuits across a wide range of devices, including network controllers and micro controllers that go into our products and solutions. The result we are seeing an impact across client systems, servers and storage.\nIn addition, freight costs have continued to rise due to increased logistics rates, a higher mix of air due to ocean network congestion and increase in part expedites to meet customer needs. We have reduced our PC backlog over the last 2 quarters, and it is nearing the high end of its normal range. However, we expect PC backlog to grow in Q1. Our higher-margin ISG backlog increased again in Q4 to a record level due to a combination of very strong demand and the lack of compounded availability.\nWe expect our ISG backlog to remain elevated through at least the first half of the year as part shortages continue. As we head into Q1, we do expect component cost to improve with modest deflation while freight costs remain elevated. We are awaiting information from the recent NAND contamination announcement from Kioxa and Western Digital to evaluate the impact on Dell. Our supply chain speed, agility and flexibility has enabled us to meet customer needs in this environment, though challenges remain. And our supply chain continues to be a durable competitive advantage as we navigate the unprecedented supply uncertainty.\nTurning to CSG. Our PC business logged another record year. We delivered record revenue of $61.5 billion, up 27%. Record operating income of $4.4 billion or 7.1% of revenue. Record unit shipments of 59.3 million units in calendar '21, up 18%, growing faster than any of the top 3. And calendar year 2021 commercial share growth was up 70 basis points more than any of the top 3 and has now been up 470 basis points over the last 5 years.\nTurning to Q4. We delivered our sixth consecutive record CSG revenue quarter with $17.3 billion, up 26% with healthy demand, up 21%. Operating income was a record of $1.2 billion. We shipped a record 17.2 million PCs in calendar Q4, up 9% and now have gained share in 2 of the last 36 quarters. Our leading innovation continues to build a strong foundation for future CSG results.\nWe won 47 awards at CES in January, where we introduced our new XPS 13, our thinnest ever gaming notebook, the Alienware 14, and an advanced commercial notebook concept built around sustainability, recyclability and reuse. Hybrid work, learning, shopping, socializing, entertainment and travel is all here to stay. And we expect commercial PC and premium consumer growth in FY '23, albeit at moderating rate relative to a record year.\nClearly, CSG had a fantastic year, and we are well positioned heading into FY '23 as the client systems TAM has reset to a higher level. I am very proud of our FY '22 results, our team and the company and the culture we've created. And I'm incredibly excited about the road ahead with all of you. We expect another year of growth as we modernize the data center with automation and intelligence deploy IT at the edge and simplify multi-cloud for our customers.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck for some color on ISG and our growth initiatives. Chuck?\n\nChuck Whitten\n\nCo-COO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. FY '22 was indeed one for the record books. We're in a privileged strategic position. We ended the year with great momentum, and we're incredibly optimistic about FY '23 and beyond. .\nTurning to full year ISG results. Fiscal '22 revenue was $34.4 billion, up 4% for the year and underpinned by 4 consecutive quarters of growth. Widespread digital transformation continues to accelerate growth in infrastructure spend, and we were encouraged by growing demand across our portfolio of ISG solutions, specifically FY '22 storage orders grew at the fastest rate since the EMC acquisition, and all geographies grew storage for the year. Mid-range storage orders were up double digits in FY '22, and PowerStore remains the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history and demand for our leading server products accelerated over the course of the year, culminating with record server demand in Q4.\nISG operating income was $3.7 billion, flat year-over-year as both ISG revenue and margin were gated by supply constraints and corresponding backlog growth. As Jeff highlighted, we will continue to navigate the challenging supply environment with our differentiated business model, our advantaged supply chain, our product design flexibility, and our unique direct go-to-market, which creates a high-quality demand signal and gives us the ability to shape demand to where we have supply.\nTurning to Q4. Our final fiscal quarter of FY '22 was a microcosm of ISG's year. with strengthening demand across our storage and server portfolios. ISG demand was up 17%, with revenue up 3% to $9.2 billion. Storage demand growth was up for a third consecutive quarter and in the high single digits. Our leading storage portfolio, where we're #1 in high-end, midrange entry unstructured object, all-flash, HCI and data protection, enabled us to capture growth across a variety of storage architectures and customer sizes.\nFor example, we saw double-digit demand growth in the high end, driven by select enterprise customers, 25% demand growth for our unstructured storage solutions and 8% growth for HCI despite a tough year-over-year comparison. Within midrange, power store demand continued to ramp in Q4, up 34% sequentially and now approximately 50% of our midrange SAN mix. Encouragingly, 26% of PowerStore buyers are new to Dell storage and 29% were repeat buyers, important leading indicators of future growth. Servers and networking revenue was up for a fifth consecutive quarter, up 7%.\nStorage revenue was roughly flat year-over-year due to the aforementioned backlog build and storage software and services content that gets deferred and amortized over time. ISG operating income was $1.1 billion, down 7% due primarily to backlog growth, component inflation and logistics costs. We continue to take pricing actions to mitigate cost increases though component shortages and turbulent logistics markets remain risks that we are actively managing.\nIn summary, FY '22 was a solid year for ISG as infrastructure markets rebounded the business returned to growth. Our leading indicators of server and storage demand were ahead of revenue, and our integrated business model continues to deliver despite challenging supply dynamics. ISG is poised for a strong FY '23, given the momentum in the business. Tom will share thoughts on forward guidance in a moment.\nBefore handing over to Tom, let me touch briefly on our priority growth initiatives. At our September Analyst meeting, we highlighted multiple growth opportunities both inside and outside our core business, including over $650 billion in TAM adjacent to our core, where our asset positions and durable competitive advantages give us a right to win. These are distinct markets like edge and telco but also growth opportunities like our Apex branded as a service solutions that provide a modern consumption experience to our customers.\nCustomers can buy our solutions, subscribe to our solutions and select from different types of services, including fully managed service offerings depending on their needs. FY '22 was an important year as we launch solutions in these spaces, engage customers and made investments that positioned us for future growth. We were pleased with our strategic technical and commercial momentum in these businesses. In particular, we saw a rapid acceleration of our APEX Flex on Demand subscription offering as the year progressed, an important market indicator that our APEX strategy is resonating with customers. We also delivered a steady stream of innovations and customer wins in edge and telco in FY '22, giving us conviction in our long-term strategy.\nNoteworthy in Q4 was the expansion of our APEX Cloud Services portfolio with 2 new offers. APEX multi-cloud data services, which deliver storage and data protection as a service with simultaneous access to all major public clouds through a single console. The solution allows customers to access the cloud services they want while maintaining control of their data on-premise, avoiding lock in and egress fees and enabling customers to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. And APEX Backup Services, which provides scalable, secure data protection with centralized monitoring and management for SaaS applications, end points and hybrid workloads. The solution offers all-in-one protection with backup disaster recovery and long-term data retention and a 100% SaaS-based offering with no infrastructure to manage.\nFY '23 will be about continuing to push the innovation agenda in APEX, telco, edge and multi-cloud. As these growth initiatives become more actually material, we will provide more detail.\nIn closing, we enter FY '23 in a solid demand environment across our businesses and with a lot of confidence. And with that, I will turn it over to Tom.\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $28 billion, up 16%, driven by another record quarter for CSG and continued growth in ISG with demand for servers and storage well ahead of revenue.\nGross margin was $5.8 billion, flat year-over-year at 20.8% of revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 320 basis points lower primarily due to higher-than-anticipated component and logistics costs and higher CSG mix. We continue to take pricing actions to manage the impact of commodity and logistics cost variability. Part shortages and supply chain risk remain across the economy, and we expect ISG backlog to remain elevated through at least the first half of fiscal '23.\nOperating expense was $3.6 billion, roughly flat year-over-year at 13% of revenue with the full year fiscal year '22 OpEx rate at 14.7%. We continue to invest for long-term growth but did benefit from lower compensation and benefits in the period.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect OpEx as a percentage of revenue to be slightly higher than fiscal year '22 and as we invest in the business, employees return to work, and we engage in more business-related travel.\nOperating income was a record $2.2 billion, up 1% at 7.8% of revenue. This was slightly lower than our November guidance given the impact of supply chain disruptions. Net income was $1.4 billion, up 2%, with growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense due to the reduced debt balances, offset by an increase in our effective tax rate. Our tax rate was 25.1%, higher than we expected at the time of our Q3 earnings call. The higher rate was driven by corporate transactions including the refinancing and tender we executed in December. The combined effect reduced income in higher tax jurisdictions resulting in lower utilization of available tax credits.\nThe total tax impact was a reduction of approximately $0.19 to diluted non-GAAP EPS. Fully diluted EPS was $1.72, and down 2% with diluted share count increasing to 810 million shares as a result of the VMware spin. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion, up 3% at 9.6% of revenue and was $9.7 billion, up 12% for the full year.\nOur recurring revenue is approximately $5 billion a quarter, up 12%. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is approximately $42 billion, up 20% and includes deferred revenue plus committed contract value not included in deferred revenue. Dell Financial Services originations in Q4 were $2.7 billion, up 12%. DFS ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in total managed assets.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet. We generated strong cash flow as our cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion. in Q4, mainly driven by top line growth and $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Q4 adjusted free cash flow was $3 billion. We are happy with the disciplined management of our working capital, although we continue to see higher inventory levels given the supply chain dynamics and component availability.\nWe expect inventory balances to come down as the supply chain situation improves over the coming year. We repaid $10.6 billion of debt funded primarily with $9.3 billion in VMware dividend proceeds and retired $1.7 billion in existing long-dated high-coupon notes, funded through $2.25 billion in new bonds and balance sheet cash.\nThe refinancing activity will save approximately $70 million in annual interest expense. We exited Q4 with a core debt balance of $16.1 billion and a cash and investments balance of $11.3 billion.\nTurning to capital allocation. As we have previously mentioned, we intend to return on average 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders over time. We repurchased 11.6 million shares of Class C common stock in Q4, totaling $659 million. And our intent is to continue buying shares going forward programmatically as we manage dilution and opportunistically return capital to shareholders, consistent with our capital allocation framework.\nAdditionally, since the end of Q4 and through the close of business last Friday, we have repurchased an additional 4.2 million shares for $248 million. Program to date, we have repurchased approximately 5.4% of the outstanding Class C common stock. To complement our share repurchase program, our Board has approved a Q1 dividend of $0.33 per share.\nWe expect the cash impact of our quarterly dividend payments to be approximately $1 billion or roughly $1.32 per share for the full year, and we expect to have the opportunity over time to grow our dividend at least consistent with our long-term EPS growth in each case, subject to future Board approvals.\nFor more details on the dividend announcement, please review today's press release and Form 8-K. Alongside capital return to shareholders, we will continue to invest in the business delever toward our 1.5x gross core leverage goal and pursue targeted M&A.\nBefore I provide thoughts on Q1 and full year guidance, I would like to invite Jeff back for a few comments on Ukraine.\n\nJeffrey W. Clarke\n\nCo-COO & Vice Chairman, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Regarding Ukraine. First and foremost, our thoughts are with those families who have lost loved ones and all who are impacted. Our top priority at this time is supporting our Ukrainian team members as they attempt to relocate to a safe and secure environment. We are closely monitoring things and are working with employees to address their personal and family situations. As for business operations in the region, the situation is rapidly evolving, and we will share more details as they become available. Back to you, Tom. .\n\nThomas W. Sweet\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Dell Technologies Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Turning to Q1 and fiscal year '23. We're optimistic about the overall macroeconomic environment with global IT spending projected in the mid-single digits. .\nDigital transformation is a top priority for our customers, and it's fueling our growth as our customers look to Dell as their partner in their multi-cloud journey. Against that backdrop, we expect Q1 revenue between $24.5 billion and $25.7 billion, up 11% at the midpoint with CSG and ISG growing.\nFor non-GAAP tax rate, you should assume 20% plus or minus 100 basis points, driven by higher overall U.S. tax on foreign earnings and lower interest expense going forward. This guidance assumes U.S. rates are not affected by any tax reform. And based on my earlier share repurchase commentary, we expect Q1 diluted share count between 785 million to 790 million shares.\nNetting this out, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.50, up 2% at the midpoint. I recognize that our EPS range is slightly wider than normal but given a more dynamic component availability in logistics environment and elevated backlog, particularly in ISG, I believe it is appropriate.\nFor fiscal year '23, we're coming off a very strong year with record performance in fiscal year '22. As a starting point, we suggest you align fiscal year '23 financial expectations with our long-term value creation framework, and we will provide an updated perspective on the year as we move forward.\nAs a reminder, that's revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range and EPS growth at 6% or better over the long term. We also expect to deliver solid free cash flow and return significant capital back to shareholders with our announced dividend and share buybacks.\nAs we think about Ukraine, I will reiterate that, first and foremost, our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted in support and supporting our team members in region as we closely monitor the developing news there. While our direct revenue exposure to Ukraine and Russia is minimal on a percentage basis, it is too early to determine any broader potential impact to our Q1 guidance and our initial thoughts on fiscal year '23.\nIn closing, we delivered an extraordinary year with record revenue, operating income, EPS and cash flow. We delivered significant shareholder value through the spinoff of VMware, the sale of Boomi and disciplined and consistent debt paydown, resulting in an investment-grade rating. We also introduced a comprehensive capital allocation framework and began shareholder capital return actions with share buybacks and the announcement of a dividend.\nWe remain focused on executing our strategy to consolidate and modernize our core and build new growth engines that enable our customers' multi-cloud future while delivering revenue and EPS growth with strong free cash flow to our shareholders over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.",

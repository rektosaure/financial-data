I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. Our first quarter marked a powerful start to our next chapter of growth. We increased pro forma revenue by 16%, adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points and earnings per share by 35% versus last year, all surpassing expectations.\nWe achieved these gains while making strategic investments in the long-term growth drivers of the business. This outperformance positioned us to increase our outlook for the year, reinforcing that our advantages are structural and sustainable. Now touching on the strategic highlights of the quarter. We meaningfully advanced our AMPLIFY growth agenda, as outlined at our Investor Day in September.\nWe built emotional connections with consumers, acquiring over 2.2 million new customers globally in the quarter, driven by Gen Z. By connecting with consumers early in their journey, we're building lifetime value and reinforcing a competitive advantage our ability to attract and retain new generations to our brands.\nNext, we delivered fashion innovation and product excellence, led by Coach, where our brand is strong and growing. This is evident in the accelerated growth we achieved in our core leather goods offering. The combination of craftsmanship and value we offer to consumers continues to be a differentiator of our brands and business. We powered global growth through compelling experiences, driving double-digit gains in North America, China and Europe, far outpacing the industry.\nOur direct-to-consumer business model enables us to connect with consumers wherever they choose to engage with our brands while gathering real-time insights that underpin data-driven decisions. This is key to how we scale with focus and impact, and it was on display in the first quarter as we achieved strong growth in stores and online.\nAs always, our talented teams are the driving force behind our results, delivering with creativity and discipline and building the capabilities that set us apart today and into the future. Overall, we are delivering standout performance against an uncertain external backdrop with a business that is healthy and positioned for long-term growth.\nNow moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach delivered an exceptional first quarter, highlighted by a 21% increase in revenue at expanding margins. We drove double-digit top line growth across our key markets with North America increasing 26%; China, up 21% and Europe growing 39%. These broad-based gains and outperformance versus the industry demonstrate that our unique expressive luxury positioning is resonating around the world.\nThis is evident in our strong customer acquisition results as we welcomed over 1.7 million new customers globally to Coach, a strong increase over prior year, led by Gen Z. Our new and younger customers are transacting at higher AUR and have a higher retention rate than the balance of our client base. They are also influencing all generations, as we achieved growth in acquisition and retention among both Gen Z and non-Gen Z cohorts, a clear signal of our growing brand resonance and reach.\nNow to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. We drove strong double-digit gains in leather goods, where we have multiple platforms powering our growth. Our icons continue to lead consistent with our strategy. In particular, the Tabby, New York and Teri families outperformed driven by accelerated Gen Z customer recruitment.\nFurther, the large kits lost bag remained a highly coveted and viral success, a clear demonstration of our brand desire and the creativity of our teams. Bag charms and straps also continued their strong momentum, providing consumers with further opportunities for personalization, customization and self-expression.\nOverall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories highlights the innovation and value we offer in the luxury market. With these advantages, we drove mid-teens handbag AUR growth for the quarter, led by North America. Further, handbag units also rose in the quarter globally and in North America despite lower promotional activity at the brand.\nLooking forward, we expect continued gains in both AUR and units, showcasing the diversified drivers in place to support healthy and sustained growth. To this point, we have a strong pipeline of innovation. This was clearly reflected in the brand's Spring 26 runway show presented at New York Fashion Week in September, which received outstanding reviews and social buzz.\nNext, turning to footwear. We delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, fueled by sneakers and the continued success of the High Line and SoHo families across channels. Footwear is a long-term growth opportunity for Coach, given our brand strength and the category's relevance with our target consumer.\nTouching on marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that showcases our brand purpose and product offering. During the quarter, we launched our fall campaign, Reviver Courage, inspired by insights gained from our engagement with Gen Z around the world. The campaign featured Global Ambassador L. Fanning and 2 new ambassadors, Korean Rapper, songwriter and producer, [ So yan ]; and Japanese songwriter [ Lilas ], 2 artists breaking boundaries and reshaping culture in their own ways.\nIn addition, our not just for walking footwear campaign highlighted our SoHo sneaker and featured [ Audrey Mona ], the Singing Voice of Mira in the Netflix hit film, [ K-PopDeemon hunters ]. This campaign continued to support strong demand for our product offerings and cultural relevance for our brand.\nOur marketing execution exemplifies the brand's hallmark Magic and Logic in action. By using data-driven insights to scale creativity, we are enhancing the efficacy of our campaigns, expanding our reach and enabling our growth. And finally, we are fueling brand desire through distinctive, immersive retail experiences that resonate with today's consumer.\nThis quarter, we launched 2 new coach coffee shops in North America at Jersey Gardens and Woodbury Commons, tapping into the importance of experiential retail, especially among younger audiences. These activations go beyond marketing. They're driving longer dwell times, commercial momentum and deepening emotional connections with the brand.\nLooking ahead to holiday, we're leaning into proven drivers of the business. To this end, we will bring new animations to Tabby, expand the New York family launch newness within our Coach originals collection and deliver a compelling assortment of seasonal novelty brought to life through marketing campaigns that connect brand, purpose and product.\nIn closing, Coach continues to deliver standout results, guided by a bold brand vision; to be the world's most inclusive, genuine and loved fashion brand. With the consumer at the heart of everything we do, our talented teams are operating with focus and purpose, turning insights into action and impact. By blending creativity with disciplined brand building, we've reimagined this iconic brand for the next generation of consumers, driving sustainable compounding growth.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. Our actions to reset the brand for durable and profitable growth are underway. In the first quarter, revenue trends improved sequentially to down 9%.\nAt the same time, we continue to back our turnaround efforts with disciplined investments, taking the strategic steps necessary to strengthen the brand's foundation for long-term growth. Importantly, in the first quarter, where we placed our strategic focus and investments, we drove progress as tracked against the leading KPIs we've previously outlined.\nWe saw a lift in consideration with our fall campaign and delivered an improvement in Gen Z acquisition trends driven by handbags. While still early in the turnaround, the improvement in these KPIs are signs that we are executing our strategies, and they are beginning to take hold. To touch on our strategies and the results of the quarter in more detail, our first strategic priority is to fuel brand heat through our uplifting luxury positioning to become top of mind and relevant with our target consumer, the Gen Z connector.\nIn the quarter, we launched our fall campaign, Spark Something Beautiful, featuring influential Gen Z celebrities, [ Ice Spice, Charlie DeMillo, Lava and Rain Judge ]. The campaign had strong organic engagement as the most watched video on social channels for Kate Spade and drove higher brand consideration and purchase intent. This campaign will continue into holiday building with festive additions as we remain focused on driving cut-through by increasing brand media through a spike and sustained strategy.\nNext, we advanced our strategy to build handbag blockbusters with a consumer-informed assortment that is more relevant and focused. During the quarter, we made important progress. Our handbag blockbusters outperformed the balance of the offering with higher AUR and strong Gen Z acquisition. This is another example of how our strategic focus is translating into early green shoots in the business.\nIn Q1, we launched Duo, the hero of our fall campaign, which became the top-performing style in retail, winning with consumers on versatility and value. We also successfully introduced the 454 family in outlet and on-trend silhouette reimagined from our archives. At the same time, we continued to animate DECO and Kayla pillars of the assortment that are supporting new Gen Z acquisition.\nAnd as we continue to bring more innovation to the offering, we are streamlining reducing handbag styles by 40% by holiday, allowing us to stand behind our big ideas with clarity and intention. Importantly, we are embedding deeper consumer insights and a rigorous test before we invest approach to all aspects of our work, ensuring that methodical consumer testing drives greater relevancy and impact across the entire assortment.\nFinally, touching on our third strategic pillar, to maximize compelling omnichannel consumer experiences. A critical part of this work involves removing deselection barriers with cohesive messaging that builds the brand through desire, and we're moving in the right direction, evidenced by the higher full price selling we delivered in the quarter, a building block to scale in a healthy way. We know that staying disciplined on discounting will impact our top line results, especially in promotional and highly competitive time periods like holiday, and we are committed to this strategy as we position ourselves for sustainable growth over the long term.\nOverall, we are strengthening the brand's foundation for long-term profitable growth. While turnarounds take time, Kate Spade is a unique brand with significant runway. To unlock this potential, we have a focused strategy, targeting investments and clear KPIs to track our progress. We remain confident in our path forward and the brand's opportunity to deliver sequential improvement in the back half of the fiscal year and return to profitable growth in fiscal year '27.\nIn closing, Tapestry achieved a record quarter, and we raised our outlook for the year, exemplifying the strength of our model. Our Amplify growth agenda is working, and our structural advantages are enduring. We operate in a large market where our runway is significant, and we have the strategy, capabilities and team in place to drive durable growth and value creation for years to come. Our vision to give more people the power to bring their own style and story into the world is fueled by our systemic approach to brand building. This is what guides us and drives our success. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance reflects the compounding momentum behind our strategic growth initiatives and the discipline of our execution. In Q1, we outperformed expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings, delivering record sales and EPS.\nIn the quarter, we achieved pro forma revenue growth of 16%, led by 21% growth at Coach. We drove adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points and we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.38, an increase of 35% versus last year.\nTurning to the details of the first quarter. I'll begin with a discussion of revenue trends on a pro forma constant currency basis. Sales increased 16% versus the prior year and outperformed our expectations. These results reflect strong global momentum. By region, North America sales accelerated, increasing 18% compared to the prior year, led by 26% growth at Coach.\nImportantly, both gross and operating margin in the region also rose versus last year. In Europe, revenue grew 32% above last year, with increases across all channels, led by growth in our direct business. Strong new customer acquisition, particularly among Gen Z and increased local consumer spending continued to fuel our momentum.\nGiven our market positioning and low penetration, we see significant opportunities for further growth in this large and attractive market. In Greater China, revenue outperformed our expectations, increasing 19%, with notable strength in digital. Our strong performance in China underscores that our strategic initiatives and investments are working and our business remains well positioned for long-term sustainable growth.\nIn other Asia, revenue increased 3%, led by growth in Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. And in Japan, sales declined 10% as expected, amid a challenging consumer backdrop. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. We delivered gains across all channels, fueled by direct-to-consumer growth of 16% compared to the prior year which included a mid-teens percentage increase in both digital and global brick-and-mortar sales at strong and increasing profitability.\nMoving down the P&L, we continue to drive healthy margin expansion versus the prior year delivering a first quarter gross margin of 76.5%, 120 basis points above prior year. This expansion was driven by operational improvements of approximately 170 basis points as well as a benefit from the divestiture of Stuart Weitzman of 70 basis points. These tailwinds were partially offset by a negative tariff and duty impact of 70 basis points and a currency headwind of 60 basis points.\nOur strong gross margin remains a core element of our value creation model, supported by our agile supply chain, which delivers craftsmanship at scale, a core competitive advantage of Tapestry.\nTurning to SG&A. Expenses rose 11%, driven primarily by an increase in marketing investment, which represented 11% of sales. Even with this investment, we drove 80 basis points of expense leverage reflecting our disciplined cost control while growing our top line. So taken together, operating margin expanded 200 basis points in the quarter, driving profit expansion of 24% over the prior year which was ahead of expectations, and our first quarter EPS of $1.38 grew 35% over the prior year and exceeded our guidance.\nNow turning to shareholder returns. Starting with our dividend, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share, representing $83 million in dividend payments for the quarter Additionally, during the first quarter, we spent $500 million to repurchase over 4.7 million shares. In fiscal '26, we now expect to return $1.3 billion or 100% of expected adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nThis includes approximately $300 million in dividend payments for an annual rate of $1.60 per share as well as $1 billion in share repurchases, which is an increase from our original outlook of $800 million. Our significant return of capital to shareholders is a testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation and underscores our confidence in the future.\nAnd now before turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged. We have 2 foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth and to return capital to shareholders via our dividend with the goal over time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings growth.\nBeyond these 2 foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which includes our previously announced $3 billion share repurchase authorization,\nAnd finally, using our rigorous 4-lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong, and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5x.\nNow turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $743 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $2.64 billion, including $240 million outstanding borrowings under our newly established commercial paper program. Together, this represented net debt of $1.9 billion.\nAt quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.5x, a full turn below our target. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $103 million and CapEx and cloud computing costs were $38 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 1% below prior year on a reported basis and up high single digits, excluding the impact of Stuart Weitzman.\nAs we enter the holiday season, our inventory continues to be current and well positioned globally and by brand. For fiscal '26, we continue to expect inventory levels to be modestly down year-over-year on a reported basis. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal '26, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and excludes the impact of Stuart Weitzman from our fiscal '26 expectations.\nWe are raising our fiscal 2026 outlook, which incorporates our first quarter outperformance and our momentum quarter-to-date. We view this guidance as prudent and achievable, balancing the realities of an uncertain external environment with the significant opportunities we see for our business.\nNow turning to the details. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue to be in the area of $7.3 billion representing pro forma growth of 7% to 8% on a nominal basis or 6% to 7% in constant currency with FX planned to be a 70 basis point tailwind. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency on a pro forma basis, in North America, we now expect revenue to increase mid- to high single digits.\nIn Europe, we expect growth in the area of 20%. In Greater China, we now expect to achieve low double-digit growth over the prior year. In Japan, we're forecasting a high single-digit decline. And in other Asia, we anticipate high single-digit gains. And by brand, this guidance now incorporates low double-digit growth at Coach.\nAt Kate Spade, we continue to embed a high single-digit decline in revenue for the year with sequential improvement planned in the second half. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points. We anticipate gross margin to decline in the area of 50 basis points an improvement from our prior outlook. This assumes operational gross margin expansion of 140 basis points due primarily to improvements in AUR slightly offset by an FX headwind of 20 basis points.\nFurther, we expect to realize a 60 basis point structural tailwind to gross margin from the disposition of Stuart Weitzman. Offsetting these planned margin drivers is a 230 basis point headwind from incremental tariffs and duties, which incorporates the timing of policy implementation product sell-through and mitigating actions underway. For context, this is a headwind of $170 million in the fiscal year, which assumes we mitigate 30% of the annualized run rate of $250 million. I remain confident in our ability to offset these headwinds fully over time given the strength of our business and supply chain.\nOn SG&A, we expect at least 100 basis points of leverage. This reflects our diligent expense control, partially offset by ongoing growth-focused investments in our strategic priorities. To this end, we expect marketing as a percentage of sales to increase around 90 basis points versus last year, reaching over 11% of revenue.\nWe will also realize a 20 basis point benefit to expenses from the sale of Stuart Weitzman. All in, this means operational SG&A leverage is expected to be at least 170 basis points. For some texture on operating profit by brand, we anticipate Coach will maintain its operating margin even with tariff pressure and continued brand investments. At Kate Spade, we continue to expect a modest profit loss given the outsized tariff impacts and brand investments, as mentioned.\nMoving to below the line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $65 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 18% and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 212 million shares, which includes the expectation for $1 billion in share repurchases.\nTaken together, we now expect EPS to be $5.45 to $5.60, representing 7% to 10% growth compared to last year. Moving on, we anticipate adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion. And finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $200 million. We anticipate about 60% of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations with the balance primarily relating to our ongoing IT and digital investments.\nTouching on the shaping for the year to start, given the dynamic nature of the rapidly shifting market, it's important to note we could experience volatility by quarter, notably within profit as the tariff and duty impacts work their way through the P&L. Now to our current assumptions, we expect pro forma constant currency revenue growth throughout the year, led by the first half.\nFor Q2 specifically, we're anticipating a pro forma total sales growth in the area of 7%, which includes an FX tailwind of nearly 50 basis points. This incorporates the expectation for low double-digit revenue growth at Coach or mid-20% growth on a 2-year stack basis, consistent with Q1 and a mid-teens revenue decline at Kate Spade.\nTurning to margin. We anticipate reported gross margin in Q2 to decline by approximately 50 basis points due entirely to tariff and duty headwinds while SG&A is expected to leverage by over 100 basis points in the quarter. Together, we expect operating margin to increase roughly 80 basis points in the quarter.\nIn the second half, operating margins are planned in line with prior year despite tariff and duty pressure. And finally, taking a prudent approach to our guidance, we expect Q2 EPS to grow high single digits to approximately $2.15. This includes a projected tax rate in the area of 20% for the quarter.\nIn closing, we delivered another record-breaking quarter, highlighted by strong top and bottom line growth. This outperformance positioned us to raise our outlook for the year, clear evidence of the power of our Amplify growth agenda and our disciplined and consistent execution.\nMoving forward, our foundation is strong, and we have competitive and structural advantages to fuel durable growth and sustainable value creation in the year ahead and for years to come. I'd now like to open it up for your questions."

Thank you for joining us. With me today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our strategies and outlook are Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Roe, Tapestry's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\nBefore we begin, we must point out that this conference call will involve certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. This includes projections for our business in the current or future quarters or fiscal years. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session, where we will be joined by Todd Kahn, CEO and Brand President of Coach. After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. Fiscal 2025 was truly a breakout year for Tapestry. We delivered $7 billion in revenue and operating margin of 20% and $5.10 in adjusted EPS, all growing meaningfully versus prior year.\nNotably, we also achieved key targets we set at our Investor Day 3 years ago, namely to achieve over $5 in earnings, returned more than $3 billion cumulatively to shareholders and drive best-in-class total returns. We delivered these results in the context of a rapidly evolving and uncertain macroeconomic landscape, reinforcing that our business and our exceptional teams are resilient, agile and built for growth. Our record results are more than numbers. Our success showcases that our strategies are working and that our systemic approach to brand building is capturing a new generation of consumers around the world.\nTouching on the strategic highlights of the quarter and year. We powered global growth, delivering accelerated gains in outpacing the industry in our key regions of North America, China and Europe. We did this by building lasting customer relationships, highlighted by strong new customer acquisition. During the year, we acquired over 6.8 million new customers in North America alone, fueled by growth of Gen Z and millennial cohorts.\nWe are creating emotional connections and reaching new young consumers as they enter our category, key to driving lifetime value and healthy durable growth. We also delivered compelling omnichannel experiences engaging with consumers wherever they interact with our brands, to drive direct-to-consumer growth across channels. Our modern technology platform allows us to bring data-driven insights to our work. And in a world that is increasingly powered by digital, our human connections have never been more important. Together, they are the foundation of our proven and profitable direct-to-consumer business model that is a core competitive advantage.\nAnd finally, we brought fashion innovation and product excellence to customers throughout the year, fueling brand relevance and desire led by Coach, where our brand heat and momentum are strong and growing. This is evident in our continued gains in AUR and gross margin. The creativity, craftsmanship and value we offer to consumers at scale have been and will continue to be differentiators of our brands and business.\nAs we look forward, we have proven our ability to navigate a complex and dynamic external backdrop, and we will continue to execute, leveraging the power of our competitive and structural advantages, our global scale, our compelling value proposition and the strong fundamentals of our business.\nNow moving to our results and strategies by brand, starting with Coach. Coach is a storied 85-year-old brand, and this fiscal year was the strongest in history. Our success is rooted in our brand-building capabilities. We've been intensely focused on understanding our target Gen Z consumer and creating emotional connections that fuel brand desire, which have allowed us to reimagine a heritage brand for modern consumers. Coach is redefining what's possible when you blend consumer obsession with disciplined brand building and creativity. And this is translating into compounding and durable growth.\nFor the year, Coach delivered a 10% increase in revenue at strong margins, capped by 13% constant currency top line gains in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth across our key markets, with North America up 16%; China, up 22% and Europe up 12%. Our global growth led by outperformance in our core leather goods offering highlights that our unique expressive luxury positioning is resonating around the world. This is evident in our strong customer acquisition results as we welcomed over 4.6 million new customers to Coach in North America this year, with over 1 million new customers in the fourth quarter, of which nearly 70% were Gen Z and millennials. Importantly, these customers are transacting at higher AUR and have a higher retention rate than the balance of our client base, demonstrating that these relationships are healthy and sticky.\nNow touching on our fourth quarter results in more detail. First, we drove double-digit gains in leather goods with broad-based growth across our offering. The iconic Tabby family continues to outperform and resonate with new and younger consumers. Our core Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering, while chain Tabby and quilted Tabby remain global successes.\nAdditionally, our New York family once again significantly exceeded expectations proving to be a new and durable growth driver for the brand. Building on the strength of the New York platform in its first year post launch, we're continuing to expand the Brooklyn and Empire collections while introducing new styles within the New York family, driving innovation and relevancy with our target consumer. Further, we grew our archival inspired Coach originals collection with a large kisslock bag at $695, which in July, once again sold out within minutes of launching online and within a day at stores, showcasing Coach's creativity and brand heat.\nAnd finally, our bag charms and straps also contributed to our momentum, providing consumers with further opportunities for personalization and customization with the Cherry bag charm remaining a particular Gen Z favorite as a way to enhance self-expression. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outperform the industry, demonstrating our innovation pipeline and the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market.\nWith these advantages, we drove mid-teens handbag AUR growth for the quarter, led by North America. Further, handbag units also rose in the quarter globally and in North America despite lower promotional activity at the brand. Looking forward, we expect gains in both AUR and units to drive our growth.\nNext, we grew our footwear business with a focus on sneakers, which drives lifetime value with our target Gen Z consumer. In the quarter, sneakers grew mid-single digits, led by the High Line and Soho Sneaker families, which are driving momentum and selling at one compelling price point across all channels, another clear indicator that our One Coach strategy is working.\nTurning to marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that highlights our brand purpose and product offering. Coach's, On Your Own Time campaign featuring the Spring 2025 collection and starring global ambassadors, El Fanning, Nazha, Koki, and Younji Lee continue to drive brand momentum across markets. Our sustained investment behind this campaign is in keeping with our strategy to deliver cut through and continuous brand and product stories to consumers.\nWe also added a second purpose campaign during the quarter, Not Just For Walking in support of our Soho Sneaker launch. The campaign was inspired by our consumer insights, showcasing what consumers want from a sneaker today in the many facets of their lives.\nAnd finally, we cultivated desire for Coach through unique authentic and immersive retail experiences. This is another example of how our teams are successfully turning insights into action. Our data continues to highlight that Gen Z consumers like to shop in the real world and in person with engaging experiences. As a result, we brought new store concepts, pop-ups and food and beverage to consumers across the globe, expanding into nontraditional formats and locations to delight consumers and build interest for the brand.\nIn addition, the learnings from this work will enable us to move with greater impact as we expand our store footprint and deliver new brand experiences in the future.\nIn closing, Coach is driving standout results, guided by a clear brand vision to be the world's most inclusive genuine and loved fashion brand. Our fiscal year '25 results highlight that we are building strong brand and cultural relevance, fostering emotional connections driven by product innovation and the creativity of our talented global teams who are operating with excellence, focus and intention. From these exceptional results and this position of strength, we are confident in the future for this powerful iconic brand.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. Our actions to reset the brand for durable growth are underway. In the fourth quarter, performance was pressured as expected. Revenue decreased 13%, while bottom line results reflected continued gross margin expansion as well as strategic reinvestment in brand marketing. As we've shared, we are in the early stages of this turnaround and will be focused on key leading indicators of progress informed by our experience at Coach. These include increasing unaided brand awareness and search interest, followed by an improvement in traffic and customer acquisition, which will ultimately compound to drive top line growth. We are tracking these KPIs with consistency and rigor, leaning in where we see traction and pivoting, if necessary, to ensure our success.\nOverall, we are deliberately resetting the brand and backing it with disciplined investments. While these actions will pressure revenue and profitability in fiscal year '26, they are essential to strengthening the brand's foundation and unlocking sustainable profitable growth for the long term.\nNow let's touch on the quarter. Our first strategic priority is to fuel brand heat and relevancy by investing in marketing focused on our target Gen Z consumer. And we took a step forward in the quarter with the launch of our spring campaign featuring influential Gen Z celebrities, Ice Spice and Charli D'Amelio. Initial reads were positive with strong organic engagement and a lift in consideration, consistent with our goal to reestablish Kate Spade as a top of mind brand for our target consumer.\nOur second key strategy is to strengthen our handbag offering. Simplifying and elevating our assortment anchored and blockbuster families. During the quarter, we amplified the Deco collection in retail and [indiscernible], which were featured as the heroes of our marketing campaign. As a result, both families were the top-selling bags in their respective channels and over-indexing with new younger consumers at strong AUR. And we're bringing more innovation to the assortment while we streamline our offering reducing handbag styles by over 30% by fall, allowing us to stand behind our big ideas with clarity and intention.\nImportantly, we are bringing deeper consumer insights and methodical consumer testing to all aspects of this work to ensure greater relevancy throughout our assortment.\nNext, we are focused on maximizing omnichannel cohesiveness with a compelling, consistent brand message across all consumer touch points. Alongside efforts to create a more compelling consumer journey, we remain focused on driving higher full-price selling, a building block to scale in a healthy way.\nIn closing, fiscal year '26 is a year of investment for Kate Spade. We are taking strategic and financial steps to reset Kate Spade for long-term growth, applying our brand-building learnings from Coach and aggressively leaning into action to turn around the brand. While a turnaround takes time, we are confident in our path forward and the brand's opportunity for healthy and profitable growth.\nNow turning briefly to Stuart Weitzman. As previously announced, we completed the sale of the brand to Caleres on August 4. This action was consistent with our commitment to be diligent stewards of our portfolio and disciplined allocators of capital. I want to thank the Stuart Weitzman teams for their work to support the brand and customers during this transition and wish them success, as they build their next chapter of growth with Caleres.\nIn closing, Tapestry achieved a record year as we are successfully connecting with a new generation of consumers around the world, Importantly, we capped our future speed agenda, exceeding earnings targets with our strongest growth year and momentum building in our business. And while the external backdrop is increasingly complex, our growth proves that our competitive advantages enable us to adapt and thrive in any environment.\nOur foundation is strong and our focus is clear. Our performance underpins our confidence that we have the strategy, capabilities and team in place to scale and win with significant runway for growth and value creation. I look forward to sharing our road map for continued growth at our Investor Day next month.\nI'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, we exceeded our outlook. Additionally, we delivered our earnings and capital return targets set at our last Investor Day 3 years ago. This is a testament to our disciplined execution and financial agility, reinforcing our strong foundation and commitment to durable long-term value creation.\nIn the year, we delivered revenue growth of 5% with 10% growth at Coach. We increased gross margins by 210 basis points and we grew earnings per share by 19% versus last year while accelerating investments into our brands.\nTurning to the details of the fourth quarter. I'll begin with a discussion of revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 8% compared to the prior year and outperformed our expectations. These results reflect gains in North America and internationally. By region, North America sales increased 8% compared to the prior year, led by 16% growth at Coach. Importantly, both gross and operating margin in the region rose versus last year.\nIn Europe, revenue grew 10% above last year driven by growth in our direct channels with increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. We continue to see significant opportunities to grow in the region given our positioning, momentum and low penetration in this large market.\nIn Greater China, revenue growth accelerated ahead of our expectations, increasing 18% with growth across all channels, including notable strength in digital. Our strong performance in China underscores our strategic initiatives and investments are working, and our business remains well positioned for long-term sustainable growth.\nIn Japan, sales declined 11% amid a challenging consumer backdrop and in other Asia revenue decreased 1% as growth in Australia, New Zealand and South Korea was offset primarily by a decline in Malaysia.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. We grew in each channel while achieving strong and increasing profitability. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 6% compared to the prior year, which included a mid-teens percentage increase in digital revenue and a low single-digit increase in global brick-and-mortar sales. In wholesale, revenue grew in the quarter in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered a record fourth quarter gross margin of 76.3%, 140 basis points above prior year, driven by operational outperformance. Our strong gross margin is a core element of our value creation model, providing us with flexibility and fuel to drive sustainable growth. As we've seen in the year, AUR growth is driving roughly 2/3 of our margin improvement with the balance coming from AUC, and we see both levers contributing to operational gross margin gains into the future.\nTurning to SG&A. Expenses rose 10%, driven by an increase in marketing expense, which was 13% of sales in the quarter, while we drove 120 basis points of leverage in the balance of the business. So taken together, operating margin increased 30 basis points in the quarter, driving profit expansion of 10% over the prior year, which was ahead of expectations. And our fourth quarter EPS of $1.04 grew 12% over the prior year and exceeded our guidance.\nNow turning to our shareholder return programs. In fiscal '25, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, a testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation. This includes $300 million in dividend payments and $2 billion in an accelerated share repurchase program. This program is expected to result in an average purchase price of about $78 per share.\nAnd now before turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. We have 2 foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth; and second, to return capital to shareholders via our dividend with the goal over time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings. Consistent with this, the Board authorized a 14% quarterly dividend increase for an anticipated annual rate in fiscal '26 of $1.60 per share. Beyond these 2 foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which was on display in fiscal '25 and remains a value-creation driver going forward. And finally, utilizing our rigorous [indiscernible] framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management.\nImportantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong, and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5x.\nNow turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $2.4 billion, representing net debt of $1.3 billion. This incorporated the paydown of bonds totaling approximately $300 million in April. At year-end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was a full turn below our leverage target at 1.4x. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was an inflow of $1.35 billion, and CapEx and cloud computing costs were $153 million.\nInventory levels at year-end were 4% above prior year, excluding $92 million of Stuart Weitzman inventory reflected in assets held for sale on our balance sheet. This included the strategic pull forward of receipts in light of the current trade landscape. Our inventory continues to be current and well positioned globally and by brand. For fiscal 2016, we expect inventory levels to be modestly down year-over-year on a reported basis.\nNow before turning to our guidance, as you saw in our press release, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of over $850 million related to Kate Spade. This was based upon the current business trends, the outsized impact of tariffs, which disproportionately affects Kate Spade as the vast majority of its business is in the U.S. and the incremental investments we're making in support of profitable long-term growth.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal '26, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. To start, I'd like to give some context by disaggregating the top line momentum we're seeing in the business and our focus on supporting revenue growth from the current dynamics impacting our profitability in the fiscal year. First, on sales, our trends in the first quarter are strong. And in fact, we've accelerated into the new year led by Coach with stronger full price selling. We are building the brand for continued healthy gains well into the future. This is our priority, and we're executing behind it.\nHaving said that, we are facing greater than previously expected profit headwinds from tariffs and duties with the earlier-than-expected ending of de minimis exemptions being a meaningful factor. In aggregate, the total expected impact on profitability this year from tariffs is $160 million, representing approximately 230 basis points of margin headwind. We're taking thoughtful actions to mitigate these impacts while continuing to deliver the compelling value, quality and innovation that is foundational to our brands. We're leveraging our agile supply chain to optimize our global manufacturing footprint, minimizing our tariff exposure where possible. We are also working closely with our long-standing service providers to drive efficiencies.\nI remain confident in our ability to address these headwinds fully over time given the strength of our business and the agility of our supply chain. Overall, we view our guidance as prudent and achievable.\nAll in, we expect to drive continued mid-single-digit revenue growth on a pro forma basis, deliver strong operating margins above prior year and returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in the fiscal year. And as we action our mitigation strategies on tariffs, we believe our longer-term earnings growth delivery will accelerate.\nNow turning to the details. This guidance excludes Stuart Weitzman from fiscal '26 expectations. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue to approach $7.2 billion. This represents pro forma revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate on both a nominal and constant currency basis with FX planned to be an 80 basis point tailwind.\nTouching on sales details by region at constant currency on a pro forma basis. In North America, we expect revenue to increase mid-single digits. In addition, we expect growth in Europe in the area of 20%. In Greater China, we expect to achieve high single-digit growth over the prior year. In Japan, we're forecasting a high single-digit decline and in other Asia, we anticipate high single-digit gains. And by brand, this guidance incorporates high single-digit growth at Coach at constant currency. At Kate Spade, we're embedding a high single-digit decline in revenue with sequential improvement planned in the second half of the year.\nIn addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion. We anticipate gross margin to decline in the area of 70 basis points. This assumes operational gross margin expansion of 120 basis points due primarily to improvements in AUR, slightly offset by an FX headwind of 20 basis points. Further, we expect to realize a 60 basis point structural tailwind to gross margin from the disposition of Stuart Weitzman. Offsetting these planned margin drivers is a 230 basis point headwind from incremental tariffs and duties, which incorporates the timing of policy implementation, product sell-through and mitigating actions underway. For context, this is a headwind of $160 million in the fiscal year, which assumes we mitigate 30% of the annualized run rate of $235 million.\nOn SG&A, we expect expenses to be approximately even with prior year, resulting in at least 100 basis points of expense leverage. This reflects our diligent expense control, partially offset by ongoing growth-focused investments in our strategic priorities. To this end, we expect marketing as a percentage of sales to increase around 80 basis points versus last year, reaching over 11% of revenue. We also realized a 20 basis point benefit to expenses from the sale of Stuart Weitzman. All in, this means operational SG&A leverage is expected to be at least 160 basis points.\nFor some texture on operating profit by brand, we anticipate Coach will maintain its operating margin even with tariff pressure and continued brand investments. At Kate Spade, we expect a modest profit loss given the outsized tariff impacts and brand investments, as mentioned.\nMoving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $65 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 18%, and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 213 million shares, which includes the expectation for $800 million in share repurchases. Taken together, we expect EPS to be $5.30 to $5.45, representing 4% to 7% growth compared to last year, including over $0.60 of tariffs and duty headwinds.\nMoving on, we anticipate adjusted free cash flow to approach $1.3 billion. And finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $200 million. We anticipate about 60% of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations with the balance primarily related to our ongoing IT and digital investments.\nTouching on the shaping for the year. To start, given the dynamic nature of the rapidly shifting market, it's important to note we could experience volatility by quarter, notably within profit as tariff and duty impacts work their way through the P&L. Now to our current assumptions, we expect pro forma constant currency revenue to increase high single digits in the first half and low single digits in the back half. For Q1 specifically, as mentioned, we started the year strong with revenue trends accelerating at Coach. As a result, we're anticipating a low double-digit total sales gain in the quarter. This includes a 70 basis point tailwind from FX.\nTurning to margin. As we mentioned, we expect gross margin pressure for the year due entirely to tariff and duty headwinds, primarily in the second half. In Q1, we anticipate reported gross margins to increase by approximately 100 basis points. SG&A is expected to leverage both in the first and second halves, while in Q1 specifically, we expect slight deleverage on higher marketing expense. We expect operating margin expansion in the first half, driven by a Q1 increase of roughly 80 basis points. In the second half, operating margins are planned in line with prior year despite tariff and duty pressure.\nTaking a prudent approach to our guidance, we expect EPS growth for the year to be led by the first half with Q1 forecasted to grow by more than 20% to approximately $1.25.\nSo in closing, we delivered another record-breaking quarter and year, highlighted by strong top and bottom line growth. We achieved over $5 in EPS and returned more than $3 billion to shareholders over the last 3 years, consistent with the targets we outlined at our last Investor Day. This showcases our differentiated and highly cash-generative business model that has proven agile, resilient and adaptive to change.\nMoving forward, we are confident in our brands, our people and our strategy. Our fundamentals are strong, and we have competitive and structural advantages that position us to drive durable growth and shareholder value in both the year ahead and for years to come.\nI'd now like to open it up and take your questions."

After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, our record third quarter results outperformed expectations, reinforcing our position of strength. Our talented global teams drove accelerated top and bottom line growth against an increasingly complex backdrop, clearly demonstrating the power of consistent branding and our connections with consumers around the world.\nTouching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth with total revenue gains of 8% at constant currency, outpacing guidance, fueled by 15% growth at Coach. By geography, international revenue rose 8%, led by an increase of 35% in Europe, where our business has strong momentum and the opportunity for continued growth is significant.\nIn addition, we delivered a sales increase of 4% for total APAC region. In Greater China, specifically, revenue growth accelerated, rising 5%, as we continue to confidently invest behind our long-term growth agenda in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue increased 9% compared to last year, and gross and operating margin continued to expand, reinforcing our commitment to driving a healthy business.\nSecond, we built new and lasting relationships with consumers around the world. In North America specifically, we acquired over 1.2 million new customers in the quarter, representing strong growth versus last year. And of these new customers, 2/3 were Gen Z and millennials.\nWe are capturing consumers who are entering the category for the first time, which is instrumental to fueling enduring relationships customer lifetime value and sustainable growth. New Gen Z and millennial consumers continue to transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base, and we achieved a meaningful increase in year 1 retention rates among Gen Z consumers at Coach, a key indicator that these relationships are sticky.\nThird, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences, delighting consumers across all touch points with our brands. To this end, we maintained strength in digital, which grew at a mid-teens rate versus prior year and represented approximately 30% of revenue at accretive margins.\nOur global brick-and-mortar sales rose at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter at strong and increasing profitability. Overall, our direct-to-consumer operating model is a clear differentiator and competitive advantage, driving real-time consumer understanding and agility.\nFourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we continue to deliver creativity, quality and compelling value to consumers around the world. This is on display at Coach, where we delivered strong and broad-based growth, highlighting the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our commitment to disciplined brand building is also reflected in our strong gross margin, which continued to expand in the quarter.\nImportantly, our global scale and diverse supply chain is a key competitive advantage, enabling us to deliver craftsmanship to consumers while navigating the shifting backdrop, which Scott will discuss in more detail shortly.\nOverall, we generated record third quarter earnings per share, which exceeded our expectations, and increased 27% compared to the prior year. This outperformance positioned us to increase our outlook for the fiscal year.\nWe're on track to deliver fiscal year '25 earnings in the area of $5 per share, consistent with the outlook we provided nearly 3 years ago at our Investor Day, despite the rapidly changing global landscape. This is a testament to the power of our strategies, the agility of our operating model and the resilience and focus of our teams. These advantages are driving our success today, and I'm confident they will continue to underpin our growth long term.\nNow moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach delivered another standout performance with accelerated growth in the third quarter, driving 15% top line gains as the brand's Expressive Luxury position continues to resonate with consumers. We believe that the momentum we have unlocked is enduring and that Coach's success is compounding.\nWe continue to build on our strong brand and cultural relevance driven by product innovation and the creativity of our talented global teams who are operating with excellence, focus and intention. The coach vision is clear: To be the world's most inclusive genuine and loved fashion brand. And it is this vision that guides our strategies and fosters a brand purpose that cuts through with consumers.\nAnd our success is evident in our results. We are driving meaningful new Gen Z customer acquisition through our outstanding product offerings, authentic brand values and deep understanding of our target consumer. We are winning in our core leather goods category where we're outpacing the industry, and we're doing this on a global scale. -- with strong top line momentum and exceptional loan margins, which increased nearly 100 basis points versus prior year.\nNow touching on the highlights of the third quarter in more detail. First, we drove double-digit gains in leather goods, where we have multiple platforms for growth. The iconic Tabby family once again led, over-indexing with new and younger consumers, building strength on strength. The Tabby Shoulder Bag 26 continued to anchor the offering, while the new Chain Tabby have was a global success.\nAdditionally, our New York family significantly outpaced expectations, cementing itself as a new growth driver for the brand, with styles ranging from the viral Brooklyn Shoulder Bag 28 at $295, to the soft Empire Carryall 40 at $695. Further, we grew our archival-inspired Coach originals collection with the introduction of the Large Kisslock Bag at $695, which sold out with minutes of launching online and within a day at stores.\nAnd finally, our bag charms and straps added to our success, providing consumers with further opportunities for self-expression. With the Cherry Bag charm -- a Gen Z favorite.\nOverall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outpace the industry, a testament to the brand's heat, innovation pipeline and the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market. With these advantages, we drove mid-teens handbag AUR growth led by North America. Looking ahead, we are confident in the potential for further sustainable AUR increases.\nNext, we remain focused on fueling footwear, which drives lifetime value with our target Gen Z consumer. In the quarter, footwear grew mid-single digits, bringing new and younger consumers to the brand. Growth in the category was led by the successful launch of the Soho sneaker and the continued momentum of the High Line sneaker.\nBuilding on our One Coach learning agenda, both sneakers are offered at consistent price points between retail and outlet channels, enabling us to amplify our innovation and big ideas with consumers.\nTurning to marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that highlights our brand purpose and product offering. During the quarter, Coach launched On Your Own Time, a campaign introducing Coach's Spring 2025 collection and starring global ambassadors, Elle Fanning, Nazia, Cokee and Young Geli.\nThis campaign was inspired by our ongoing discussions with Gen Z consumers across the world. and shares a powerful message about having the courage to set the pace of your own life. This campaign is continuing to deliver strong uplift in consideration and purchase intent across markets.\nAnd as we deepen our learnings with each campaign, we are strengthening both our bold storytelling and our media execution. This strategy is driving the acceleration of sustainable customer acquisition and brand growth, and it's working globally at scale.\nIn addition, we also cultivated enthusiasm for the brand through unique and immersive retail experiences. Our Coach Play concept stores continue to outperform, with higher Gen Z traffic, longer dwell times and higher return frequency. We're taking these learnings to bring the highest impact elements of this concept to our store fleet more broadly.\nOverall, our holistic brand-building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcome nearly 900,000 new customers to Coach in North America, of which nearly 70% were Gen Z and millennials. And at the same time, our retention rate with the Gen Z cohort also meaningfully increased, reinforcing that we're building lasting relationships with our consumers in support of durable growth.\nIn closing, Coach is strong and delivering differentiated results by fostering emotional connections and delivering exceptional value to consumers. Powered by Tapestry's growth engine, we will continue to invest in building an innovation to drive long-term sustainable growth, bringing this iconic brand to new generations of consumers.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. In the third quarter, revenue was pressured, declining 12% at constant currency, while profit met our expectations, driven by continued gross margin expansion. As we've shared, our work to reset the brand is underway, and we're making decisions today to drive sustainable growth long term. We know this work will take time, particularly in the context of a more uncertain backdrop. However, the actions we need to take are clear and we are executing with focus and urgency.\nOur strategy are informed by Tapestry's growth model with a focus on building brand heat, relevant product innovation and compelling experiences. As we build a healthier brand, we will be closely tracking leading indicators of progress along the way, informed by our learnings and success at Coach.\nThese include, first, increasing unaided brand awareness and search interest, followed by an improvement in traffic and customer acquisition, which will ultimately compound to drive top line growth.\nNow turning to the strategic details. First, we're committed to fueling brand heat and relevancy through cohesive storytelling and incremental investments in brand media. In April, we launched our spring campaign, which features Ice Spice and Charli D'Amelio, 2 very influential and relevant Gen Z celebrities. This is a further step toward a more effective spike and sustained marketing strategy that will enable us to reestablish Kate Spade as a top of mind brand for our target audience.\nNext, we continue to prioritize strengthening and elevating our handbag offering, bringing more innovation, focus and relevancy to our assortment. We are advancing our work to build blockbuster handbag families. During the quarter, we continued to amplify the Deco collection in retail and the Kayla and Kip in outlet, which over-indexed with new, younger consumers at strong AUR and margins, and we see further opportunity for these families going forward.\nAnd as we bring more innovation to the assortment, we are also working to streamline our offering by reducing handbag styles by over 15% by fall and continue the clear deselection barriers through improved styling, ensuring our big ideas cut through with consumers. Overall, we're focused on creating distinctive product that is consumer informed, grounded in Kate Spade's unique brand DNA and modern and relevant today.\nNext, we're working to maximize omnichannel cohesiveness with a compelling, consistent brand message across all consumer touch points. As part of our efforts to improve the customer experience and fuel brand health, we are committed to reducing promotional activity and delivering continued gross margin expansion.\nAs previously shared, reducing the level of promotional activity is a key building block to scale in a healthy way globally over the long term as we build for the future and connect with consumers on our brand values beyond simply price.\nIn closing, we are advancing our efforts to reinvigorate Kate Spade. The brand has a legacy of creativity, joy, wit and warmth, and we will build on this unique heritage while modernizing its expression, guided by a sharpened focus on our consumer. The steps to do this will take time, but we are confident in the potential and path forward.\nImportantly, the strength of our platform provides us with the experience, discipline and brand-building capabilities to execute these strategies while delivering enhanced results overall. Our focus is clear and we are committed to unlocking the untapped growth and value creation opportunities for this iconic brand.\nNow turning briefly to Stuart Weitzman. As previously announced, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the brand at Caleres, and we continue to expect the transaction to close this summer, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAs diligent stewards of our portfolio and disciplined allocators of capital, this ensures that all our brands are positioned for long-term success and that we maintain a sharp focus on our largest value creation opportunities. At the same time, we are pleased that we found Stuart Weitzman a home in Caleres, and ideal are to guide its next chapter of growth.\nIn closing, Tapestry delivered another standup quarter with accelerated sales and earnings growth that positioned us to increase our outlook for the year. I want to thank our extraordinary teams for driving these strong and differentiated results.\nMoving forward, the external backdrop has become increasingly complex. That said, in the face of uncertainty, our purpose is unwavering to stretch what's possible for our brands and business. To do this, we will harness our proven competitive and structural advantages that have allowed us to adapt and win in any environment, namely our global scale in an attractive industry, the compelling value we offer to consumers and the strong fundamentals of our business.\nI'm confident in our future and the meaningful opportunity to deliver durable growth and shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results exceeded our outlook, building on our track record of consistent execution as we unlocked accelerated growth. We delivered record third quarter revenue and earnings per share, while generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow year-to-date.\nNow moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 8% to the prior year and outperformed our expectations. These results reflect gains in North America and internationally.\nBy region, North American sales increased 9% compared to the prior year, led by strong double-digit growth at Coach, both gross and operating margin rose versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. In Europe, revenue grew 35% above last year with growth across all channels driven by increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z.\nIn Greater China, growth continued with revenue rising 5%. Our sequential acceleration was driven by both digital and stores, with each channel delivering growth. Our differentiated results in China clearly demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and investments in the region are yielding returns with our brands and business position for long-term sustainable growth.\nAnd in Other Asia, revenue rose 14%, led by growth in Australia, South Korea and Thailand, while Japan sales declined 2%.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 9% compared to the prior year at constant currency, which included a mid-teens percentage increase in digital revenue and a mid-single-digit increase in global brick-and-mortar sales. And wholesale revenue grew in the quarter in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered a gross margin of 76.1%, representing our highest quarterly gross margin in over 15 years. This was ahead of plan and 140 basis points above prior year, driven by operational outperformance. Our strong gross margin performance is a core element of our value creation model, providing us with flexibility and fuel to drive long-term growth.\nTurning to SG&A. Expenses rose 7% and were even with prior year on a rate basis. This included increased brand-building investments and higher compensation costs, offset by leverage on fixed costs. As compared to expectations, there was a benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.05 primarily related to marketing timing with the fourth quarter.\nTaken together, operating margin increased 140 basis points in the quarter, driving profit expansion ahead of expectations and 16% over the prior year, and our record third quarter EPS of $1.03 grew 27% over prior year and exceeded our guidance.\nNow turning to our shareholder return programs. As previously announced, in November, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which remained underway during the fiscal third quarter. In addition to the ASR program, we have $800 million remaining under our previous share repurchase authorization.\nTogether with our dividend, which is expected at $1.40 per share for the year, we're positioned to return over $2 billion or more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal '25, a testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation.\nAnd now before turning to the details of the balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged.\nWe have 2 foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth; and second, to return capital to shareholders via our dividend with the goal over time to increase the dividend, at least in line with earnings to achieve our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40%.\nBeyond these 2 foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which is on display this year.\nAnd finally, utilizing our rigorous forward lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top line growth.\nThese clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5x.\nNow turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $2.7 billion, representing net debt of $1.6 billion. At quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6x. In addition, after our quarter end, we repaid our April 2025 bonds at maturity, totaling $303 million.\nAdjusted free cash flow for the third quarter was an inflow of $135 million, and CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $36 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 6% above prior year, excluding $87 million of Stuart Weitzman inventory reflected in assets held for sale on our balance sheet. Our inventory continues to be current and well positioned globally and by brand in support of our growth ambition.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal '25, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal 2025 revenue, earnings and cash flow outlook. We continue to view this outlook as prudent and achievable, and we remain clear eyed about the realities of the external environment, balanced with the opportunities we see for our business.\nFor the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, representing growth of 4% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of nearly 50 basis points.\nTouching on sale details by region at constant currency, in North America, we now expect revenue to increase 3% to 4%. In addition, we still expect growth in Europe in the area of 30%, where we are underpenetrated and have strong traction. In Greater China, we remain on track to achieve low single-digit growth over the prior year. And in Other Asia, we continue to anticipate high single-digit gains, while in Japan, we're now forecasting a mid-single-digit decline.\nIn addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase due to improvements in both AUR and AUC. Both freight and FX are still expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes for the full year.\nOn SG&A, we expect expenses to increase above the pace of revenue growth, driven by increased marketing expense. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we continue to make deliberate growth-focused investments in our strategic priorities.\nMoving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $25 million. The tax rate is now expected to be approximately 17.5%. And our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 223 million shares.\nSo taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to be in the area of $5, representing high teens growth compared to last year, and ahead of our prior guide of $4.85 to $4.90. This guidance fully embeds all trade policies as of April 10. Incremental tariffs are expected to have an immaterial impact on fiscal '25 results based on the timing of our fiscal year-end.\nMoving on, we now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. And finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $160 million. We anticipate about half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations, with the balance primarily related to ongoing digital and IT investments.\nTouching on the shaping of the fourth quarter. To start, given the dynamic nature of the rapidly shifting market, it's important to note that our revenue trends quarter-to-date are in line with our Q3 results. However, while we've seen no slowdown in our business today, we're taking a more conservative approach to the quarter to-go outlook.\nFor the quarter, we are estimating revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate on both a reported and constant currency basis. Further, we're forecasting operating margin to be in the area of prior year, which incorporates the expectation for continued gross margin gains, offset by higher SG&A costs, including the previously mentioned marketing expense timing shift from the third quarter. So taken together, we're modeling Q4 EPS to be over $0.95.\nBefore closing, I want to provide some additional context on our business in light of tariffs and the shifting global trade landscape. First, as it relates to our supply chain, our products are primarily manufactured in Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines. These countries, taken together, represent 70% of our production, including Vietnam, which accounts for 1/3 of our total production.\nConversely, we have very limited manufacturing exposure to China, with less than 10% of our production in the region across all categories. This primarily includes manufacturing for jewelry and ready-to-wear, with negligible exposure in our core leather goods category. As a point of reference, over the past 12 months, roughly $900 million of our cost of goods sold was related to product imported into the U.S.\nTouching on our tariff mitigation strategies, we're taking thoughtful actions to protect the compelling value, quality and innovation we offer to consumers. To share some color, we pulled forward inventory receipts ahead of the incremental tariffs going into effect in April. In addition, we're leveraging our agile supply chain to optimize our global manufacturing footprint, minimizing our tariff exposure where possible.\nWe have scale and long-standing relationships with our service providers, and we're actively working together to unlock efficiencies. And most importantly, I want to thank our supply chain organization. Their deep global trade expertise, operational excellence and culture of continuous improvement allowed us to take swift action in the face of this uncertainty.\nOverall, while we are not immune to external factors, we're in a position of strength with structural advantages. Our fundamentals are strong and our business has momentum, with compounding growth fueled by innovation, customer acquisition and AUR gains.\nIn closing, we delivered another record-breaking quarter, highlighted by accelerated top and bottom line growth. And we raised our outlook for fiscal '25 and are on track to achieve EPS in the area of $5, while returning over $3 billion to shareholders over the last 3 years, consistent with the target we outlined at our September '22 Investor Day.\nMoving forward, as we face an increasingly complex environment, we remain confident in our brands, our people and our strategy with a differentiated and highly cash-generative business model that has proven agile, resilient and adaptive to change. We'll continue to focus on the factors within our control, operating with a commitment to discipline and consistency to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.\nI'd now like to open it up for your questions."

After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, our strong second quarter results outperformed expectations, showcasing our commitment to disciplined brand building. Our exceptional teams brought innovation and craftsmanship to consumers around the world this holiday season, driving accelerated top and bottom line growth to achieve record quarterly revenue and earnings per share. From this position of strength, we increased our outlook for fiscal year '25 while making strategic investments to extend our competitive advantages and fuel strong durable growth and value creation into the future.\nTouching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth with total revenue gains of 5%, outpacing guidance, fueled by 10% growth at Coach. By geography, all regions exceeded expectations. International revenue rose 7% at constant currency, led by an increase of 42% in Europe, where our business is strong and our runway for growth is significant. In addition, we delivered a sales increase of 1% in the total APAC region. In Greater China, specifically, we returned to growth with revenue rising 2%.\nImportantly, we continue to bring compelling innovation, relevance and value to consumers with a sharp focus on driving long-term growth in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue increased 4% compared to last year, while gross and operating margin expanded as we continue to drive a healthy business.\nSecond, we remain focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers. During the quarter, we drove new customer acquisition growth, welcoming approximately 2.7 million new customers in North America alone. Over half of these customers were Gen Z and millennials, and they continue to transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. Importantly, Gen Z consumers at Coach have the highest retention rate of all cohorts, reinforcing the opportunity to build lifetime value with our target consumer base.\nAt the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, highlighting our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we recruit new consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences underpinned by Tapestry's leading capabilities, which enable us to enhance the customer experience across all touch points with our brands. To this end, we maintained strength in digital, which grew high single digits versus prior year and represented approximately 1/3 of revenue at accretive margins. Our global brick-and-mortar sales rose at a low single-digit rate in the quarter at strong and increasing profitability.\nFourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence, as we remain focused on bringing creativity, quality and compelling value to consumers around the world. This is clearly on display at Coach, where we delivered strong and broad-based growth in handbags with AUR gains underscoring the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin as we achieved a record second quarter gross margin with further opportunity for expansion long term.\nImportantly, underpinning our innovation pipeline and margin gains is our agile supply chain, a key competitive advantage, which enables us to deliver craftsmanship globally and powers our growth. Overall, we generated record earnings per share, which exceeded our expectations and increased over 20% compared to the prior year. Importantly, our business is strong today and well positioned for the future as we remain committed to delivering consistent long-term growth and shareholder value.\nNow moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach had a breakout quarter as we continue to drive brand heat and bring this storied brand to a new generation of consumers. Coach's success is compounding and it demonstrates the enduring power of its expressive luxury positioning. Our growth is credit to our talented global teams who are operating with excellence and intention to deliver innovation across products, marketing and experiences to cultivate emotional and lasting connections with consumers.\nTo this end, during the quarter, we achieved 10% constant currency revenue gains at exceptional margins, highlighted by 270 basis points of gross margin expansion and a 210 basis point lift in operating margin. Importantly, our strategies are working with three key areas underpinning our accelerated growth. First, new Gen Z customer acquisition, resulting from our systematic understanding and engagement with our target consumer. Second, strength in our core leather goods category, where we have authenticity and scale and our innovation is winning. Third, global outperformance led by North America and Europe and a return to growth in Greater China.\nThese growth pillars will continue to drive our success in the future. Now touching on the strategic highlights of the second quarter in more detail. First, our results were driven by strong gains in leather goods, where we have multiple platforms for growth, given the power of our iconic handbag families and the success of new product introductions. The Tabby family once again outperformed over-indexing with new and younger consumers and doubling versus last year, building strength on strength. The Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering with momentum in core Tabby as well as new introductions, including the Times Square and quilted Tabby.\nIn addition, the recently launched New York family significantly outpaced expectations, featuring the Brooklyn and Empire bags. During the quarter, the Brooklyn shoulder bag 28 at $295 was a top recruitment driver, while the soft Empire carry all 40 at $695 outperformed. The New York family, a new foundation for the brand, continued to prove incremental and compelling, providing innovation that's clearly resonating with consumers globally.\nFurther, our Coach Originals collection featuring archival bags that celebrate the brand's legacy with a modern sensibility drove growth, notably with Gen Z consumers. And finally, bag charms and straps amplified our offerings, particularly the viral cherry charm cutting through for being emotional, highly giftable and trend right. Importantly, our strategies are driving strong brand heat and desire among Gen Z consumers. In fact, Coach was again recognized by the Lyst, climbing 10 places to become the world's fifth Hottest Brand with the Brooklyn bag leading as this quarter's Hottest Product.\nAdditionally, the Coach Cherry bag charm entered the list as the #4 hottest product. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outpace the industry, which included mid-teens AUR gains globally, led by North America. And looking forward, we remain confident in the opportunity for further sustainable growth given our brand strength and innovation pipeline as well as the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market.\nNext, we remain focused on fueling lifestyle with an emphasis on footwear where we are underpenetrated and have a right to win by leveraging our brand strength to drive customer recruitment, frequency and lifetime value with our target timeless Gen Z consumer. During the quarter, we successfully launched the new Highline sneaker, which sold at $125 in both retail and outlet and attracted new customers to the brand. This introduction in both retail and outlet channels builds on our One Coach learning agenda, which we successfully piloted with Tabby.\nTurning to marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that amplifies our brand and product offering. This holiday, we rolled out the next chapter of our Unlock Your Courage campaign. And with each campaign, we're learning, gaining deeper consumer insights that enhance our storytelling and media execution. This capability enables us to deliver the right content at the right time on the right platform ensuring that our messages are cutting through. This is key to driving sustainable customer acquisition, and it's working globally at scale.\nTo this end, during the quarter, we continued to increase our top of funnel marketing investments demonstrating the confidence we have in our brand and product offering. As a result, this helped drive greater consumer engagement and outperformance versus the industry, particularly in our key markets of North America and China. In addition, we also cultivated enthusiasm for the brand through unique and immersive retail experiences.\nOur Coach Play concept stores, which engage consumers across their 5 senses continue to outperform with higher Gen Z traffic, longer dwell times and higher return frequency. We are taking these learnings and evaluating opportunities to bring the highest impact elements of these locations to our store fleet more broadly.\nOverall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed over 1.7 million new customers to Coach in North America, a strong increase versus prior year and a significant acceleration in trend. Of these new customers, nearly 60% were Gen Z and millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger customers. At the same time, our retention rate with the Gen Z cohort also increased, reinforcing that we're building lasting relationships with our consumers in support of durable growth.\nIn closing, Coach, our largest brand, is strong and differentiated, and it continues to deliver outstanding results, highlighting the capabilities of Tapestry's growth engine. With consumer understanding at the center of all we do, our talented teams are delivering the blend of magic and logic that is the hallmark of the brand and the foundation of our future. From this position of strength, I'm confident our best days are still to come with significant opportunity to drive continued consistent long-term growth.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. While profit results met our expectations for the quarter, driven by gross margin expansion, revenue trends declined 10%. Most importantly, together with Eva Erdmann, Kate Spade's new CEO, we are moving quickly and decisively addressing what we know is not working and laying the groundwork for a return to sustainable, profitable growth. Since Eva's arrival in October, we've assessed the current state of the business and made progress in building our road map for the future, informed by deeper consumer insights. The takeaway of this work is clear. We need to rebuild the brand with consumers to reignite growth. To do this, we must focus our execution and accelerate our investments with clear priorities distorted to our largest opportunities, developing emotional storytelling to fuel customer acquisition, building handbag icons and driving growth in North America, our home market.\nAnd we see the path forward as having two important stages. First, we will streamline and solidify our foundation by editing for focus and investing to build brand heat. This will ultimately drive customer acquisition, which will allow us to scale from a healthy foundation which is the prerequisite for sustainable top line growth. While we are acting with urgency, we acknowledge the work to reset the brand is a multiquarter journey. Having said that, we know the path to growth is within our control and I am confident in the plan we've developed and the significant opportunity ahead for the brand.\nNow let me take you through our growth strategies and learnings in more detail, which includes results from the quarter. First, we're committed to fueling brand heat through relevant marketing to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition. During the quarter, we took a step forward in our brand-building efforts and this began with streamlining. In the fall, we made the decision to reduce spending on our fall campaign based on consumer feedback during testing. Instead, we pivoted working with speed and agility to create new, more compelling content. And in December, we launched our holiday campaign. This was a social first campaign featuring Grammy-nominated Singer-Songwriter, Madison Beer, consistent with our strategy to distort our marketing investments into upper funnel campaigns with more relevant messages for our target consumer.\nImportantly, the tagline To The One Who was pulled through creative activations on social media and in our stores. Following the campaign, we saw a significant increase in purchase intent among Gen Z consumers who engaged with the content, reinforcing the opportunity to make incremental marketing investments to drive consideration and ultimately new customer acquisition. As a result, we are extending our brand campaign in the third quarter to sustain and amplify engagement with consumers. Importantly, our learnings will be used to inform our bigger picture efforts as we build towards a larger purpose-driven 360-degree campaign launch in the fall of 2025.\nNext, we are focused on sharpening and elevating our handbag offering, improving our execution to drive more relevancy in our assortment. In support of this ambition, we leveraged our consumer survey work, which illuminated the need to streamline our offering, clearing deselection barriers through a tighter assortment and improved styling. By simplifying our product stories and focusing our merchandising efforts, we will ensure that the big ideas in leather goods cut through with more cohesion and relevancy. With this effort, we expect to reduce the number of handbag styles by over 15% by fall.\nAt the same time, we will work to build blockbuster handbag families informed by consumer understanding. And we have learnings from holiday. We stood firmly behind the recently launched Deco Collection in our stores and in our marketing. The Deco Collection continues to over-index with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins and we see further opportunity for this family going forward. Importantly, we know [indiscernible] 30 years ago, Kate Spade offered a pioneering proposition in the market, along with distinctive iconic product and this is our aim today. To build on what made us unique and successful historically in a way that is modern and relevant to our consumers today.\nNext, we are focused on maximizing omnichannel cohesiveness with one brand message across all consumer touch points. Importantly, we are taking steps to reduce our promotional messaging across channels. The results of the last quarter reinforced that emotion and newness are what's winning with consumers, while promotional activity is not. Therefore, decreasing our level of promotional activity will be a key building block of solidifying our brand and positioning it to scale in a healthy way globally over the long term. To this end, we expect our gross margin to continue to expand moving forward as we build for the future and connect with consumers on our brand values beyond simply price.\nIn closing, we are focused on executing our strategic road map for durable growth, and we are accelerating our investments to do this. We acknowledge that our strategic actions will pressure the brand's near-term financial results, however, the strength of our portfolio allows us to do this while delivering enhanced growth overall. Importantly, we have conviction that we are taking the right steps to reset the brand and unlock its full potential. Kate Spade is a beloved, unique and purpose-driven brand. And though there is significant work to do to enhance its relevancy and reconnect with consumers, the strategy to deliver this outcome is well understood and in our control. We are confident in the meaningful long-term runway for the brand and the value creation opportunity it represents for Tapestry.\nNow turning to Stuart Weitzman. Financial results remained challenged in the quarter with net sales decreasing 16% versus prior year at constant currency, primarily reflecting softness in Greater China and in North America direct channels. In addition, global wholesale net sales declined impacted by shipment timing, while trends at POS remains strong, growing at over 20%, a key indicator of strategic progress. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team remains focused on fueling brand relevancy, driving customer engagement and delivering improved financial results long term.\nIn closing, Tapestry delivered a standout holiday quarter. I want to thank our teams once again for their passion, creativity and commitment to brand building and for driving our strong results. From this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the year with a sharp focus on the path forward. We will continue to fuel momentum at Coach while taking action to reset the Kate Spade brand for long-term growth. We are confident that our bold growth agenda will support meaningful value creation, and we look forward to sharing the details of our long-term road map at our Investor Day this fall.\nOur future is bright and we have the ambition, discipline and strategies to generate strong and durable growth and shareholder returns for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations, building on our track record of consistent execution as we unlocked accelerated growth. In the quarter, we delivered record quarterly revenue, gross margin and earnings per share while generating significant free cash flow.\nNow moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 5% compared to the prior year and outperformed our guidance across all regions. These results reflect gains in Europe, North America and total APAC with international revenue growing 7%. By region, Europe revenue grew 42% above last year with growth across all brands and channels driven by increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In Greater China, revenue inflected to growth of 2%. Our sequential acceleration was driven by a return to growth in our brick-and-mortar channel led by an improvement in traffic, while trends in digital remained positive. Our differentiated results in China clearly demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and investments in the region are yielding returns, positioning our brands and business for long-term sustainable growth.\nAnd in other Asia, revenue rose 11% led by growth in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Malaysia, while Japan sales declined 5%. In North America, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year, led by double-digit growth at Coach. Importantly, total gross and operating margin rose versus last year as we supported long-term brand health.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 4% compared to the prior year, which included a high single-digit increase in digital revenue and a low single-digit increase in global brick-and-mortar sales and wholesale revenue grew in the quarter in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered a record second quarter gross margin, which was well ahead of plan and 280 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by 260 basis points of operational outperformance as well as a benefit of approximately 20 basis points from lower freight expense. Our strong gross margin performance remains a core element of our value creation model, providing us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investments and drive long-term growth.\nTurning to SG&A, which rose 7%, led by higher marketing spend versus prior year and forecast as we reinvested a portion of our profit outperformance into incremental brand building activities via top-of-funnel activation.\nTaken together, operating margin increased approximately 210 basis points in the quarter, driving profit growth ahead of expectations and 15% over the prior year. And our record second quarter EPS of $2 grew 23% over prior year and exceeded our guidance by more than $0.30. To provide context on this beat, approximately $0.17 of the upside was due to operational outperformance, $0.08 was due to the net benefit of share repurchase activity and $0.08 was related to a favorable tax rate versus plan.\nNow turning to our shareholder returns programs. As previously announced, following the termination of the merger agreement with Capri in November, we took swift action to utilize our significant cash flow to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program underscoring our outlook for growth and unwavering commitment to deliver shareholder value. Together with our dividend, which is expected at $1.40 per share for the year, we are positioned to return over $2 billion or more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal '25, a testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation.\nAnd now before turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged. We have two foundational commitments. First, to continue to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth; second, to continue to return capital to shareholders via our dividend. As we've shared, we have a goal over time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve our stated targeted payout ratio of 35% to 40%.\nBeyond these foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which is on display this year. In addition, we have $800 million remaining on our previous share repurchase authorization for future buyback activity.\nFinally, utilizing our rigorous 4-lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5x.\nNow turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $2.7 billion, representing net debt of $1.7 billion. This includes $1.5 billion of senior notes raised during the quarter at a blended interest rate of 5.3% to help fund our ASR. At quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6x.\nAdjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was an inflow of approximately $890 million and CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $39 million and inventory levels at quarter end were 14% above prior year as planned. As we move into the back half of our fiscal year, our inventory is current and well positioned globally and by brand in support of our growth ambition. To this end, we continue to expect to end Q3 and the full year with inventory above prior year.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal '25, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal year 2025 revenue, operating margin, EPS and cash flow outlook. Importantly, we continue to view our outlook as prudent and achievable as we remain clear eyed about the realities of the external environment, balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of over $6.85 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of over 50 basis points.\nTouching on sales by region at constant currency, we expect growth in Europe in the area of 30%, where we are underpenetrated and have strong traction. In other Asia, we anticipate high single-digit gains, while in Japan, we're forecasting a low single-digit decline. In North America, we expect revenue to be up slightly as we continue to support a healthy business. And in Greater China, we expect low single-digit growth over the prior year.\nIn addition, our outlook now assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase due to improvements in both AUR and AUC. Both freight and FX are still expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes for the full year.\nOn SG&A, we expect expenses to increase above the pace of revenue growth, driven primarily from increased marketing expense, including accelerated investments at Kate Spade. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we're making deliberate growth-focused investments in our strategic priorities.\nMoving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $35 million as compared to prior guidance of $20 million of net interest income. This change reflects the interest on our new bond issuance as well as a lower cash balance due to the execution of the ASR program. This outlook also incorporates the expectation to repay our April 2025 bonds totaling $303 million at maturity.\nThe tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 223 million shares as compared to our prior guidance of approximately 238 million shares, reflecting the partial year net benefit of share repurchase activity, which includes the initial delivery of approximately 28 million shares received in November.\nTaken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to $4.85 to $4.90, representing 13% to 14% growth compared to last year and ahead of our prior guidance of $4.50 to $4.55. This increase incorporates our Q2 operational outperformance of $0.17, a full year net benefit from share repurchase activities of $0.10 and a net tailwind of $0.08 from favorable tax rate, partially offset by a planned second half currency headwind.\nTo briefly touch on the topic of tariffs, this guidance embeds the expectation for an additional 10% tariff on goods imported from China into the U.S. beginning February 4, which is expected to have an immaterial impact on fiscal 2025 results given our limited manufacturing exposure to China. We continue to monitor the external landscape closely and are developing potential mitigating actions as needed. To note, we do not have production in Canada or Mexico.\nMoving on. We now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $170 million. We anticipate 2/3 of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments.\nTouching on the shaping of the year, we expect revenue to increase in the area of 4% in the back half of the year on a constant currency basis. Including an expected FX headwind, we anticipate revenue growth in the area of 3% for the second half with fairly balanced top line growth between quarters.\nTurning to operating margin. We expect expansion versus prior year in the second half driven by gross margin improvement, while SG&A is expected to grow modestly above the pace of reported sales gains with a higher level of growth planned in Q3 relative to Q4, and this is based on the phasing of investments. And we expect our tax rate in Q3 to be below the full year average. Taken together, we expect second half EPS growth with Q3 EPS forecasted to approach $0.85.\nIn closing, we delivered a record-breaking quarter, highlighted by accelerated top and bottom line growth led by Coach, our largest brand. And from this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the year. Importantly, our commitment to disciplined brand building and our intense focus on fundamentals allows us to invest in our future growth drivers, leaning into the biggest opportunities where we'll build strong gains and extend our competitive advantages while returning over $2 billion in capital to shareholders in this fiscal year alone. We are confident in our brands, our people, our strategy and our outlook with steadfast focus on delivering accelerated growth and enhanced shareholder value in fiscal '25 and for years to come.\nI'd now like to open it up and take your questions."

After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations, capping a successful year. This is a testament to our passionate global teams, whose creativity and exceptional execution continue to fuel our brands and business. They are navigating the current environment with focus and agility while meaningfully advancing our long-term growth initiatives.\nTouching on the highlights of the fiscal year. First, we delivered total revenue growth of 1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the benefits of our globally diversified business model. These top line results were led by international growth of 6% at constant currency, with gains across key regions, including increases of 14% in Europe, 9% in Other Asia and 5% in Japan, which together represent nearly 20% of Tapestry sales with additional runway for growth.\nIn Greater China, sales rose 3% for the year as anticipated, which included declines in the second half as we anniversaried last year's strong growth of over 30%. Although the recovery in China has been more gradual than what we originally expected entering fiscal year '24, we continued to invest in our brands, teams and platforms to support our long-term strategic growth agenda in the region and with this important consumer cohort.\nAnd in North America, revenue declined 1% compared to last year, while profit rose, driven by growth and operating margin expansion. Second, we remain focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers by cultivating emotional connections with our brands. During the year, we acquired over 6.5 million new customers in North America alone, of which over half were Gen Z and millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, which highlights our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we drive new customer recruitment. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences, meeting and delighting our customers wherever they choose to shop. To this end, our global brick-and-mortar sales rose for the year on a constant currency basis. Importantly, this growth was driven by an increase in productivity across the fleet, which is highly profitable.\nIn addition, we maintained our strong digital positioning, with sales more than 3x pre-pandemic levels, representing nearly 30% of revenue at accretive margins. Our digital business is powered by Tapestry's leading capabilities, which have enabled us to enhance the consumer experience across their purchase journey. Fourth, we fueled fashion, innovation and product excellence as we remain focused on bringing the creativity, quality and compelling value required to win with consumers. Nowhere was this more evident than at Coach, where we delivered record annual revenue, including growth in handbags with AUR gains, underscoring the strength of our brand and product offering.\nOur success is also reflected in our strong gross margin delivery as we achieved our highest annual gross margin in over 15 years. Overall, we generated record fiscal year earnings per share, which outperformed our expectations, growing at a double-digit pace compared to the prior year while making strategic investments in our brands and business.\nMoving forward from this solid foundation, our organization is embracing even greater ambition for the future, reinforcing a culture of innovation and accountability. We are taking action to accelerate growth at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, while building on the momentum of Coach, positioning us for long-term profitable growth. To this end, we've made 2 key changes to our executive leadership team. Sandeep Seth, CMO of Coach, has expanded his role to include a newly created position of Chief Growth Officer for Tapestry. Since joining Coach in 2021, he has been instrumental in working alongside Todd Kahn and Stuart Vevers in driving the brand's growth and evolution, including the successful launch of the expressive luxury repositioning. Sandeep will partner with me and our executive leadership team to strengthen the focus on growth across our portfolio, bringing deeper consumer insights into our strategies and building distinctive brand worlds.\nAnd earlier this month, we announced the appointment of Eva Erdman as CEO and Brand President, Kate Spade, effective in October. Eva is a proven brand builder and transformative leader, and I look forward to welcoming her to the organization.\nBefore turning to a discussion of our results in more detail, I'd like to address the pending acquisition of Capri. While we are confident that this combination remains an exceptional strategic fit, there is significant work to do to bring innovation to their brands and reinvigorate their business amid their disappointing decline in stand-alone results. We believe we're well positioned to execute our integration plans and growth strategies and that the path to value creation is clear and compelling under our ownership, bringing meaningful benefits to our customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world.\nWith that, I'll now touch on results and go-forward strategies across each of our brands, starting with Coach. Coach continues to build strength on strength, highlighting the power of expressive luxury. Throughout the year, our teams fueled brand heat and desire, notably with younger consumers, enabling Coach to achieve record annual revenue, which surpassed $5 billion at exceptional margins with significant runway for growth ahead.\nNow touching on some details of the fourth quarter. With consumer insights at the heart of our work, our talented design and creative teams, under Stuart Vevers' leadership, once again delivered a range of innovative product offerings that distinguish the brand. To this end, we continue to drive growth in our handbag offering, led by our iconic platforms. The Tabby family delivered another quarter ahead of our expectations, over-indexing with new and younger consumers and nearly doubling versus last year. Quilted Tabby continued to outperform, and we further expanded the family with the introduction of the Tabby backpack. During the quarter, the success of Tabby earned it a coveted spot on the list, ranking third among the 10 hottest products globally and helping to secure Coach's position on the list index for hottest brands where it was recognized for its unique ability to offer luxury experiences that are inclusive and attainable.\nFurther, given the power and halo of Tabby, and consistent with our goal of meeting consumers where they are, we broke the distribution paradigm through a test that brought Tabby 26 to over 100 outlet locations globally selling at full price, and the test is exceeding our plan. Importantly, the learnings from this test are informing our broader strategies in fiscal '25 and beyond as we explore additional opportunities to scale innovative products and marketing campaigns across channels.\nBeyond Tabby, our heritage Willow and Rogue families remain foundational volume drivers. We also launched newness with the Juliet shoulder bag, while our viral sensation, the Coach Original Swing Zip, continued to resonate strongly with Gen Z customers. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories outpaced the industry for the year, which included AUR gains globally and in North America, and we see further runway longer term given our innovation pipeline and brand heat.\nTouching on AUR details for the fourth quarter. Coach's global handbag AUR was even with prior year at constant currency impacted by geographic mix headwinds, while North America handbag AUR growth remained positive. Next, we continue to build out the lifestyle assortment, expanding the brand's reach with consumers, with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, lifetime value. Footwear drove outsized gains driven by the continued success of the low-line sneaker as well as the recently launched [indiscernible] sandal. In ready-to-wear, we achieved growth with traction in leather jackets, amplifying Coach's positioning as America's original house of leather. And in men's, we animated the League family with the flat backpack and messenger styles leading with consumers.\nTurning to marketing. We remain focused on storytelling under the brand's purpose, Courage to be Real. As part of the strategy, this spring, we launched the brand's Find Your Courage campaign, featuring Coach ambassadors that inspire consumers to embrace self-expression. By extending our top-of-funnel activations, we're creating continuous and meaningful conversations with consumers, building emotional connections with the brand and driving cultural relevance. Importantly, as a result of these efforts, we've seen significant gains in unaided awareness, consideration and purchase intent among Gen Z consumers, reinforcing that our strategies are working.\nFurther, we launched unique and immersive retail experiences across the globe, highlighting our commitment to consumer engagement through experiences beyond products. We're also connecting with younger consumers through immersive platforms and virtual experiences in the world of gaming, with a recently debuted collaboration with Roadblocks and Zepeto in keeping with our goal of innovating in new spaces for the brand.\nOverall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed approximately 4.2 million new customers to Coach this year in North America. This included over 1 million new customers in the fourth quarter, of which approximately 60% were Gen Z and millennials. At the same time, we've seen significant gains in Google search trends in the U.S., a clear signal of the brand's momentum.\nAs we enter a new fiscal year, our priorities are clear. We will continue to deepen our connection with consumers, grow leather goods, fuel gains across lifestyle with a focus on footwear, lead with purpose-led storytelling through high impact and sustained brand-building campaigns and expand retail experiences to bring expressive luxury to life through engaging the 5 senses. These pillars have driven our success and are the right strategies to take us into the future.\nIn closing, Coach is an iconic brand driving modern relevance with brand momentum that is translating into strong financial results. Building on our record year, we are confident in the bright future ahead, in our ability to drive healthy sustainable growth as we continue to bring this storied brand to a new generation of consumers.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies and reinforce our foundation for the future. While top line results were challenged, profit once again rose significantly versus prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. Moving forward, we are laser-focused on realizing the full potential of the brand. Importantly, as mentioned, I look forward to welcoming Eva to the organization this fall. She brings a deep understanding of the rapidly evolving consumer landscape and a demonstrated ability to cultivate desire, cultural relevance and passionate communities for distinctive luxury brands. I'm confident that Eva, working alongside the team in place, will enhance our execution to drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow touching on our results of the quarter in more detail. First, we remain focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag offering through innovative product and distinctive brand codes. During the quarter, we expanded the Grace family in specialty along with the [indiscernible] and Spade Flower programs and outlet. These families are resonating with our target consumer and will represent foundational elements of our assortment going forward as our pipeline of newness continues to grow. We also recognize that to successfully drive our product strategies, we need to amplify these efforts through more comprehensive brand-building initiatives, including holistic marketing campaigns that build engagement with the brand and its products.\nTurning to Kate Spade's lifestyle offering, which is a differentiator for the brand. During the quarter, we delivered growth in jewelry, driven by millennial and Gen Z recruitment as well as repeat purchasing and gifting. In addition, in June, we opened the brand's first dedicated jewelry location in London, a test, which will provide learnings as we explore the opportunity for growth in the category. Second, we powered the omnichannel experience to drive customer engagement. As you know, in fiscal year '24, we launched a katespadeoutlet.com site replacing the brand's surprise site and providing a better experience for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. The outlet digital channel grew in the quarter, with growth in both new and existing customers at higher margins. Third, we remain focused on creating emotional marketing to fuel brand relevance and heat. During the year, we acquired nearly 2.3 million new customers in North America, including nearly 500,000 new customers during the fourth quarter. Accelerating this progress will be key to our success. To this point, we will continue to distort our investment to top and mid-funnel marketing to support brand building and growth particularly with younger audiences, where we are seeing unaided awareness improve with Gen Z consumers.\nFinally, throughout the year, we maintained a commitment to operational excellence, which underpin the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion. This is structural to our business and an integral part of our go-forward strategy.\nTurning to our strategic initiatives for fiscal year '25. We have a clear imperative for growth. To achieve this in the year ahead, we will fuel brand heat to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition, strengthen the core handbag foundation, grow lifestyle and maximize the omnichannel opportunity. Overall, Kate Spade is a unique and purpose-driven brand with a distinctive position in the marketplace and significant expansion opportunities. Its mission of bringing joy to consumers around the world is powerful, and we continue to have a relentless drive to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow turning to Stuart Weitzman. Our results for the year were challenged, significantly impacted by external pressures in the brand's 2 key markets of North America and Greater China. Despite disappointing financial results, we continue to focus on brand building initiatives to drive awareness, growth and profitability long term.\nTouching briefly on our focus areas across product and marketing. During the quarter, we expanded our assortment of sophisticated casual styles, highlighted by momentum and [ flat ]. Additionally, we continued to extend the brand's reach through gains in new and emerging categories, including men's and handbags. Importantly, new innovation is driving traction at wholesale with the business growing double digits at POS in North America in Q4. Further, order bookings through the Spring '25 season are up over 30% to last year. This will support an improvement in revenue and profitability trends in the year ahead. Finally, during the quarter, we remained focused on driving brand relevancy through emotional storytelling in keeping with the brand's ethos of inspiring strength and confidence. Overall, we saw an increase in aided awareness, Google search and social engagement in the U.S. for both the quarter and the year, which represent leading indicators of stronger business results in the future.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year '25, the Stuart Weitzman team is prioritizing fueling brand relevancy with emotional storytelling, growing their icons in key item platforms, while further expanding casual and new categories and accelerating growth in wholesale where there's clear traction. Overall, we see long-term potential for the brand with an empowered team focused on delivering improved top and bottom line performance.\nIn closing, Tapestry delivered record full year earnings per share, outperforming expectations and once again demonstrating the power of brand building, customer centricity and operational excellence. I want to reiterate my gratitude to our incredible teams globally who continue to drive our success.\nFrom this position of strength, we have a bold vision for the future. We know that the landscape is rapidly evolving. Consumers have an incredible amount of choice and they're exercising those choices every day. We also know that the most successful brands are winning on innovation and emotion. And in this environment, we're well positioned to compete and win.\nBeyond our organic growth opportunities, there is a clear and compelling path to value creation through the acquisition of Capri, leveraging our platform and leadership to bring meaningful benefits to customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world. Importantly, we also understand that all great visions require great execution. The year ahead will again require agility and adaptability, controlling the factors we can and managing our business responsibly to drive long-term growth. While we are not immune to macroeconomic and other external factors, we can define our own destiny given our distinctive brands, talented global teams and strong cash flow. These differentiators provide us with strategic and financial flexibility to continue to deliver enhanced value in fiscal year '25 and for years to come.\nI'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, our commitment to disciplined growth remains on display. We drove an increase in constant currency revenue, expanded gross margin 250 basis points while investing in future growth drivers for our brands and business and grew EPS at 11% versus last year to a record earnings per share of $4.29.\nNow moving to the details of the fourth quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and above our guidance for the quarter. These results were led by growth internationally on top of strong double-digit gains from the prior year. By region, Europe grew 26% above last year with strength across channels, including higher spend from local consumers and tourists. In Other Asia, revenue rose 12%, with notable growth in Malaysia, Australia and Korea. And in Japan, sales grew 2% with an increase in Chinese consumer spend.\nIn Greater China, revenue declined 10% as anticipated as we lapped 50% growth a year ago and continued to navigate a more challenging consumer backdrop in the region. Importantly, and despite these headwinds, we did continue to drive growth in digital channels.\nIn North America, sales declined 1% compared to the prior year amid a challenging consumer backdrop, while both gross and operating margin rose significantly versus last year as we supported long-term brand health.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business decreased 2% amid our overall declines in North America and Greater China, while wholesale grew as expected, increasing 14%.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered our strongest fourth quarter gross margin in over 15 years, beating our expectations and expanding 250 basis points versus prior year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by operational outperformance, a benefit of approximately 90 basis points from lower freight expense as well as FX tailwinds.\nSG&A rose 3%, including the previously disclosed timing shift of $20 million from the third quarter into Q4, which primarily related to marketing. Importantly, we continue to tightly control costs while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms.\nSo taken together, operating margin declined approximately 40 basis points in the quarter, and our fourth quarter EPS of $0.92 exceeded our expectations with roughly half of that beat due to operational upside and half due to a lower tax rate.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the year with $7.2 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.2 billion, which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri of $6.1 billion as well as the early paydown of the company's $450 million term loan in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nFree cash flow for the year was an inflow of over $1.1 billion, or $1.3 billion excluding deal-related costs. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing for the fiscal year were $144 million. Inventory levels at year-end were 10% below the prior year, reflecting both strong inventory control as well as a shift in receipt timing into our fiscal '25 first quarter. Looking forward, our inventory is well controlled and current, and we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea disruption with only modest impact. While we expect inventories to be elevated in Q1 due to higher end transits, the full year is expected to end modestly above prior year levels.\nTurning to our dividend program. For the fiscal year, we returned $321 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year and a dividend payout ratio equal to 39% on a reported basis.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25 on a non-GAAP basis. We've taken a prudent approach to our outlook, balancing the realities of the external environment with the opportunities we see for our business. It's important to note that we view this as our baseline. It does not incorporate any accretion related to the pending acquisition of Capri.\nFor the fiscal year, we expect revenue in the area of $6.7 billion, representing growth compared to the prior year on a reported basis, including approximately 50 basis points of currency pressure. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to increase approximately 1% versus the prior year, consistent with the trend in fiscal year '24.\nTouching on sales details by region at constant currency. We expect mid-teens growth in Europe and mid-single-digit gains in Other Asia, with North America, Greater China and Japan each planned in the area of prior year. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion in the area of 50 basis points versus last year. We anticipate gross margin to expand approximately 40 basis points due to operational improvements. Freight is expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes in fiscal year '25.\nOn SG&A, we expect expenses to be roughly in line with the prior year, representing slight leverage. Importantly, we're continuing to diligently control costs while investing in our highest impact growth initiatives. For modeling purposes, you can expect corporate expenses to decline versus prior year and drive leverage.\nMoving to the below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $20 million, which incorporates the fourth quarter pay down of our $450 million term loan and the yield on our growing cash balances, with some rate cuts assumed throughout the year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 238 million shares. So taken together, we project EPS of $4.45 to $4.50, representing mid-single-digit growth compared to last year, and bridging versus our fiscal 2025 EPS target previously provided at our Investor Day in 2022, our guidance incorporates a negative impact of $0.35 related to the suspension of share repurchase activity due to the proposed acquisition of Capri as previously outlined, and an estimated currency headwind of approximately $0.20.\nFinally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. We expect around 2/3 of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments.\nTouching on shaping for the year, we expect constant currency sales to be flat in the first half of the year with modest growth planned in the back half of the year as we anniversary easier compares in Greater China. In Q1 specifically, we expect constant currency sales to be down in the area of 2% due primarily to lower wholesale shipments in North America in the quarter, which is timing for the year as well as mid- to high single-digit decline in Greater China. On a reported basis, we expect revenue to be down approximately 3%, including FX headwinds. As mentioned, we expect gross margin expansion for the year, led by the first half, with the most significant improvement planned in Q1, benefiting from operational tailwinds. SG&A dollars are expected to be roughly flat with last year in both the first and second halves of the year, including in Q1. We anticipate leverage planned in the back half on the expected growth in revenue.\nNet interest income is anticipated for the first half, with net zero impact planned for the second half, which assumes rate cuts as discussed. Taken together, we expect balanced EPS growth of mid-single digits for both the first and second halves, with Q1 forecasted to approach $0.95.\nNow to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we're confirming our long-term leverage target of less than 2.5x on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the Capri transaction close. And finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend.\nImportantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future.\nBefore closing, I'd like to touch on the acquisition of Capri. Since we announced the deal a year ago, the Capri business has been significantly pressured, reporting disappointing results. Having said that, it remains an excellent strategic fit and value creation opportunity. First, we continue to believe these are iconic brands with long-term growth potential. Second, as time has progressed, we've developed growing conviction in the opportunities for synergies, adapting our integration planning and strategies. In addition, over the course of the year, Tapestry's stand-alone business has outperformed, and we expect this to continue. Therefore, and looking at the full picture, the deal remains compelling despite more near-term headwinds than expected.\nImportantly, we expect EPS accretion on an adjusted basis in year 1, enhanced cash flow, compelling ROIC and are firmly committed to achieving our stated leverage target in 24 months post close.\nIn closing, we delivered a successful year, advancing our strategies and building on our track record of operational excellence to drive double-digit EPS gains and strong free cash flow against a dynamic backdrop. Moving forward, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables, remaining agile and committed to driving healthy, sustainable growth and shareholder returns, leveraging the power of our operating model and talented global teams. I'd now like to open it up for your questions."

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, our third quarter earnings results outperformed expectations, reflecting an unwavering commitment to disciplined brand building and operational excellence. Our talented global teams continued to advance our long-term initiatives fueling innovation and consumer connections while successfully harnessing the power of our customer engagement platform to navigate the dynamic backdrop with focus and agility.\nTouching on the highlights for the quarter. First, we delivered total revenue in line with the prior year on a constant currency basis, consistent with the low end of our guidance range. These top line results were led by international growth of 3% at constant currency, which included increases of 19% in Europe, 15% in other Asia and 2% in Japan, with each region expanding versus the prior year fueled by traction with tourists.\nIn Greater China as anticipated, sales declined 2% against last year's strong revenge spending. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity in China despite a more gradual recovery in the region than originally expected, and we continue to invest in our brands, teams and platforms to support our growth.\nFinally, in North America, revenue declined 3% compared to last year, amid a challenging consumer backdrop. Importantly, we are continuing to drive a healthy business, underscored by significant gross margin expansion compared to last year and our plan. Second, we continue to put the consumer at the center of everything we do to drive engagement and emotional connections with our brands.\nIn the quarter, we acquired approximately 1.2 million new customers in North America alone, of which over half were Gen Z and millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America.\nThird, we delivered unique omnichannel experiences with a focus on driving brand desire, consumer connections and cultural relevance. We launched immersive retail experiences across brands globally with highlights that include the continued rollout of the Coach play concept and Kate Spade's successful renovation of the Gotemba outlet in Japan. And just last month, we introduced the Stuart Weitzman shop-in-shop in Nordstrom in New York City. We believe these locations drive awareness and customer acquisition, notably with younger cohorts.\nFurther, we maintained our strong digital positioning with sales more than 3x above pre-pandemic levels, which represented over 25% of revenue. Importantly, our digital business is underpinned by Tapestry's data-rich platform and leading capabilities, which has enabled us to seamlessly meet consumers where and how they're shopping across their purchase journey.\nFourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence by delivering compelling assortments to consumers with particular success at Coach, where we drove handbag AUR gains at constant currency. Importantly, this focus also continued to drive operational gross margin expansion, helping to fuel our highest third quarter gross margin in nearly 2 decades. We understand innovation wins with consumers, and we are committed to bringing creativity, quality and compelling value to customers around the world.\nOverall, we generated third quarter operating income and earnings above expectations, driven by stronger-than-anticipated margins, highlighting the power of brand building, consumer centricity and operational agility. We achieved these results while making strategic investments in our brands to support healthy, sustainable growth into the future.\nNow turning to highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. Our team delivered another strong quarter with the power of the brand's unique expressive luxury positioning once again on display. We continue to infuse innovation across all customer touch points driving engagement, cultural relevance and emotional connections with customers globally. Importantly, the success of our strategies, together with consistent execution is evident in our financial results, with revenue growth at constant currency, significant gross margin expansion and profit gains with further runway ahead.\nNow touching on some details of the third quarter. We continue to drive growth in our handbag offering, led by our iconic platforms. The Tabby family delivered another quarter ahead of expectations and nearly doubled versus last year. The introduction of our Quilted Tabby was an incredible success fueled by the top-selling Black Tabby with brass hardware at a premium AUR of $550. At the same time, Core Tabby styles remain strong, and we see further opportunity ahead across the entire family.\nWhile we continue to animate this family, we're leaning into key styles including Quilted Tabby and see further opportunity ahead. Across the balance of the assortment, our Timeless Willow and Rogue families remain foundational volume drivers. And we augmented our offering to build relevance with younger consumers, including the Coach original Swing Zip which has gone viral on social media as well as the ACE Tote, both of which over-indexed with Gen Z customers. Overall, our creative and innovative products supported an increase in global handbag AUR at constant currency, including growth in North America.\nLooking forward, we see continued runway longer term, given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. At the same time, we advanced our focus on building out the lifestyle assortment to expand the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, customer lifetime value. In footwear, sales rose against last year, reflecting success in our core styles, notably the low line sneaker as well as strength in newness, including our Brent sandal.\nIn men's, the Gotham, Charter and recently launched all families led in the quarter. And in ready-to-wear, we debuted classic denim styles contributing to the strong success of denim across all categories in keeping with market trends.\nNext, we created purpose-led storytelling, building meaningful emotional connections with brand. We again blended purpose and product with our spring finder courage campaign, inspiring consumers to embrace confident self-expression. The campaign takes place between the physical and virtual worlds, brought to life with the help of members of the Coach family, including Lil Nas X, Camila Mendes, Young Gili and Wujen Yan as well as our newest member, EMA, a virtual model and digital creator.\nFurther, we launched deeply unique and immersive retail experiences across the globe, engaging the consumer across all 5 senses. We took Coach Play to Tokyo, opening our largest concept store yet on Cat Street which celebrates the brand's heritage, self-expression and local Japanese culture. Importantly, the store resonates with younger consumers and has outperformed expectations.\nIn March, we launched the brand's first full-service restaurant at the Grand Indonesia Mall in Jakarta, highlighting Coach's expanding presence in Southeast Asia and our strategy to connect with consumers through experiences beyond product. Overall, the brand's marketing and focus on omnichannel experiences helped to drive new customer acquisition, including nearly 800,000 new customers in North America, of which nearly 60% were Gen Z and millennials. And we've seen gains in brand awareness in the U.S. per our brand tracking work, underscoring that our investments in brand building are working.\nFinally, we continue to build our sub-brand, Coachtopia, our reimagination of the product creation process to evolve our vision of circularity, which has driven incremental brand relevancy and desire. During the quarter, we launched the road to circularity, a Coachtopia docu series that explores how we're reimagining waste as a valuable raw material. And in April, we unveiled Coachtopia's inaugural store in Hainan, an initiative that combines our mission of sustainability and our commitment with investing in brand building in China and with Chinese consumers. While Coachtopia remains a small portion of the assortment, we're excited by the momentum we're building specifically with younger audiences.\nIn closing, Coach is fueling consumer desire, bringing expressive luxury to life while driving sustainable, healthy profit growth that funds investments in brand building. We are confident in the future and the tremendous potential for this iconic brand.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, while top line results were challenged as anticipated, profit exceeded expectations in prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. Importantly, we advanced our strategic agenda, sharpening our execution to bring enhanced innovation to consumers. And where we've offered newness, we've seen our customer respond. This progress reinforces our path forward as we build a more profitable business while remaining focused on driving the top line growth required to realize the long-term potential of the brand.\nNow touching on our strategic priorities and results in more detail. First, we remain focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag foundation, a requirement to win in today's dynamic consumer backdrop. During the quarter, we broadened the core assortment across channels through new introductions, including the Suite Work Tote, Seabee and Spade Flower Signature programs. Importantly, newness drove higher customer recruitment, AUR and gross margin versus the balance of the offering.\nAt the same time, the performance of newness also reinforces our sense of urgency to refresh our carryover families, which remain pressured. To this end, the pipeline of handbag newness will continue to increase into fiscal year '25, building on the progress we're seeing today and supporting the brand's runway for enhanced revenue and profitability.\nAnd as we innovate our core handbag offering, we will also continue to deliver emotional lifestyle assortments, a differentiator for the brand. During the quarter, we delivered growth in jewelry, which is a key recruitment vehicle and profit driver for the brand.\nNow turning to our second strategic focus area, powering the omnichannel experience to drive customer engagement. As you know, we recently launched a dedicated Kate Spade outlet.com site, replacing the brand's surprise site and providing a more seamless way for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. As a result of this effort, our outlet omnichannel customer penetration increased in the quarter and remains an opportunity to drive customer lifetime value over time.\nFurther, by bringing a more unified experience to consumers across all brand touch points, we can continue to more efficiently scale our marketing and merchandising efforts, supporting our goal of driving sustainable direct-to-consumer growth.\nThird, we are focused on creating emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat. During the quarter, we launched a new global campaign Time to Spring anchored in the brand codes of Joy, color in New York City, which garnered significant media impressions and strong engagement on social platforms.\nOur marketing investments supported the acquisition of approximately 400,000 new customers to the brand in North America. Moving forward, we will continue to distort our marketing efforts to top and mid-funnel activations that support brand building and growth.\nAnd finally, we will maintain a commitment to operational excellence, positioning the brand for long-term success, this focus has underpinned the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion this year and is embedded in our strategies and ways of working for the future. Overall, we continue to advance our long-term strategies with a relentless focus on accelerating our progress. Our path forward is clear, and our vision for the brand and its potential is unchanged.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. Results in the quarter were pressured, reflecting headwinds in the brand's 2 key markets of North America and Greater China. Despite the challenged financial performance, we remain focused on supporting brand health by investing in product and marketing to drive growth and profitability long term.\nTouching briefly on these focus areas. During the quarter, we expanded our assortment of casual styles in keeping with market trends. This included new block heels, wedges, bale flats and Loafers, which are performing particularly well across key full-price wholesale accounts, supporting strong sales gains at POS in North America. Further, our fall and pre-spring wholesale bookings are up meaningfully, reflecting our progress in delivering product innovation and relevancy.\nFurther, we continued to build out new categories with the launch of the brand's men's collection and an expanded sneaker assortment. At the same time, our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment drove growth at high AUR.\nNow turning to marketing. During the quarter, we drove relevance by tapping into cultural moments to amplify our key product strategies -- for example, we launched our pre-spring collection with the backdrop of Palm Beach and leveraged a multifaceted influencer approach to reinforce our recently launched sneaker offering with Sofia Richie Grainge, Suki Waterhouse and GenOn showcasing Stuart Weitzman trainers.\nAs a result of these efforts, U.S. Google search queries for the brand increased while consideration also rose in the U.S. per YouGov. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team is leaning in to accelerate progress and enhance profitability longer term through relevant, differentiated product and emotional marketing to fuel brand desire.\nIn closing, Tapestry delivered third quarter earnings ahead of expectations, successfully advancing our strategic agenda to power our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer in an ever-changing environment while investing in our future. We remain confident in our vision and the significant long-term opportunity to drive sustainable organic top and bottom line gains and meaningful shareholder value.\nBefore turning the call over to Scott to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail, I'd like to provide an update on our pending acquisition of Capri. First and foremost, we remain excited by the opportunity to expand our house of powerful brands, positioning Tapestry as a leader in innovation. The combined company will bring significant benefits to customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world.\nBy investing in and growing Capri's brands, we will bring more innovation to more consumers globally, positioning us to better compete within the growing over $200 billion global luxury market for handbags, accessories, footwear and apparel. Further, through this combination, we will be a home and incubator for talent, driving our purpose-led and people-centered mission and continuing to elevate employee and consumer experiences.\nWith regard to the transaction time line, following unconditional approval from the European Commission and regulatory approvals in China and Japan, the FTC filed a suit on April 22 to block the proposed acquisition. We remain confident in the merits and pro-competitive pro-consumer nature of this transaction and look forward to presenting our strong legal arguments in court.\nOur time line always contemplated the potential for litigation, and we continue to expeditiously work to close the transaction in calendar year 2024. In the meantime, and as always, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our current business and strategic growth agenda.\nI'll now turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, our fiscal Q3 operating income and EPS exceeded expectations, demonstrating our disciplined execution and agility. Importantly, we significantly expanded gross margin and generated strong free cash flow while investing in future growth drivers for our brands and business.\nNow moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and at the low end of our guided range. These results were led by 3% growth internationally, driven by gains in Japan, other Asia and Europe, even as we anniversaried growth from the prior year.\nIn Japan, sales grew 2%, and in other Asia, revenue rose 15% with growth in each country in the region, notably Korea and Malaysia. In Europe, growth continued with revenue 19% above last year. And in Greater China, as expected, revenue declined 2% as we lapped last year's resurgence in traffic and spend following the end of COVID-related restrictions in the region.\nIn North America, sales declined 3% compared to the prior year amid a challenging consumer backdrop, though gross margin rose significantly and outperformed plan as we supported brand health.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business declined 4% due to declines in North America and Greater China. And in Wholesale, revenue grew over 20%, led by strength in international, supported by our strategic growth initiatives on digital platforms.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered the strongest third quarter gross margin in nearly 2 decades, which was ahead of our expectations and 190 basis points above last year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by the benefit of 100 basis points from lower freight expense, FX tailwinds as well as operational outperformance.\nSG&A was relatively flat with last year and favorable to our forecast on both a dollar and rate basis, reflecting operational savings as we continue to tightly control costs while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. In addition, SG&A benefited from an expense timing shift of approximately $20 million into the fourth quarter, primarily relating to marketing.\nSo taken together, operating margin expanded 110 basis points, and operating income rose 6% compared to the prior year, well ahead of plan and third quarter EPS of $0.81 beat our expectations by approximately $0.15 fueled by an operational beat as well as the previously mentioned favorable expense timing shift worth roughly $0.06.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.4 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.7 billion which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $79 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $29 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 12% below the prior year, underscoring our focus on disciplined inventory management and driving inventory turn. Looking forward, our inventory is well controlled and current, and we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea disruption with only modest impact, which has been incorporated into our outlook. Importantly, we expect to end Q4 with inventory in line with the prior year, well positioned into fiscal year '25.\nTurning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $80 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal year '24, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. We are maintaining our fiscal year '24 EPS outlook supported by the third quarter's outperformance while taking a prudent approach to the fourth quarter planning. For the year, we're modifying our top line outlook to incorporate more moderate trends in both North America and Greater China across brands. That said, our EPS outlook is unchanged, supported by stronger margin results and a commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands.\nMoving to the fiscal year in further detail. We expect revenue of over $6.6 billion, approximately in line with the prior year on a reported basis and representing growth of about 1% on a constant currency basis. Moving to sales details by region at constant currency.\nIn North America, we expect revenue to decline slightly versus last year. In Greater China, we anticipate low single-digit sales growth. In Japan, revenue is forecasted to grow mid-single digits, while Other Asia is expected to increase at a low double-digit rate. And in Europe, we anticipate low double-digit growth.\nIn addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of 110 basis points. We anticipate gross margin to expand approximately 230 basis points, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs of roughly 130 basis points. On SG&A expenses, we expect deleverage of roughly 120 basis points, reflecting reinvestments in our brands, people and business in supportive growth initiatives.\nMoving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $12 million, which incorporates higher yield on cash and investments compared to the previous outlook. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 233 million shares. So taken together, we continue to expect EPS of $4.20 to $4.25 representing 8% to 9% growth versus last year.\nFinally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we still anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $140 million. This forecast includes nearly half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia, with the balance primarily related to ongoing digital and IT investments.\nQuickly touching on our outlook for the fourth quarter specifically. Our guidance implies an expected sales decline in the area of 1% at constant currency or roughly 3% below the prior year on a reported basis including an FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points. Further, we anticipate an operating margin decline in the area of 50 basis points, which incorporates the expectation for continued strong gross margin gains, offset by higher SG&A in part due to the negative impact of the expense timing shift from the third quarter. Taken together, EPS for the fourth quarter is forecasted to be in the area of $0.85.\nNow to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we initiated a long-term leverage target of less than 2.5x on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the Capri transaction close.\nFinally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future.\nBefore closing, I'd like to touch on the acquisition of Capri and reiterate our confidence in the excellent strategic fit and value creation opportunity it presents. We believe the transaction will enhance our strong organic growth and TSR potential, supported by double-digit EPS accretion on an adjusted basis, enhanced cash flow more than $200 million of cost synergies and compelling ROIC, accelerating benefits for our consumers, employees, partners and shareholders for years to come.\nIn closing, for the quarter, we built on our track record of operational excellence, driving margin and EPS outperformance against a challenging demand backdrop, advancing our long-term growth initiatives and controlling the controllables. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow while continuing to invest for the future. Our consistent earnings delivery demonstrates the power of our operating model and talented global teams.\nLooking forward, we remain confident in our vision and in our ability to realize it. with a steadfast commitment to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns.\nI'd like to now open it up for your questions."

Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we delivered a strong holiday quarter, achieving record second quarter revenue and earnings per share with growth outpacing expectations. Importantly, we advanced our strategic agenda, driving consistent progress through the power of brand building, customer centricity and disciplined execution. I want to recognize our talented global teams whose creativity, passion and agility continue to fuel consumer engagement and our standout financial results.\nTouching on the highlights for the quarter. First, we powered global growth to achieve a 3% sales gain, demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business model. This increase was driven by 12% growth at constant currency internationally, which included 19% growth in Greater China, consistent with our expectations. Further, sales to Chinese consumers globally grew at a mid-teens rate, which included continued growth with Chinese tourists. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our brands, leveraging Tapestry's established platform in the region to build our business not only in China but with this important cohort worldwide.\nTurning to Japan. Revenue rose 6%. And in Other Asia and Europe, sales increased 9% and 11%, respectively, with each delivering strong growth against last year's double-digit gains. Finally, in North America, we delivered revenue in line with last year and better than our expectations. We are continuing to drive a healthy business, underscored by significant gross and operating margin expansion compared to last year and plan. Second, we remain focused on building customer engagement across our brands. In the quarter, we acquired approximately 2.5 million new customers in North America alone, of which roughly half were Gen Z and millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, demonstrating our ability to engage with our existing customer base while bringing new customers to our brands.\nThird, we delivered unique and seamless omnichannel experiences, reinforcing the benefits of our data-rich direct-to-consumer operating model. To this end, we drove mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis, both in stores and online as we continue to meet our customers where they choose to shop. Our exceptional retail teams welcome more customers to our stores around the world, while we maintained our strong positioning in digital, which represented 1/3 of revenue. During the quarter, we were proud to open a new multi-brand fulfillment center in Las Vegas as we continue to invest in our omnichannel capabilities, supporting speed, sustainability and growth.\nFourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence by delivering compelling newness and value to consumers, which supported overall handbag AUR gains globally. At the same time, we drove growth in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, important for the holiday gifting season. Overall, we generated record second quarter EPS, which exceeded expectations and increased significantly compared to the prior year, highlighting the power of brand building and disciplined execution. We achieved these strong results while making strategic investments in our brands to accelerate future growth.\nNow turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. We delivered another standout quarter as our team continues to fuel brand desire by bringing expressive luxury to life, a positioning that is relevant and unique to Coach. Our strategy supported by consistent execution are driving strong innovation, consumer connections and financial results, highlighted by revenue growth across geographies and significant margin expansion.\nNow touching on some details of the second quarter. We achieved growth in our leather goods offering fueled by our iconic platforms. Tabby again, outperformed expectations, nearly doubling versus last year and over-indexing with new and younger consumers at above-average AUR. We're continuing to bring newness to this iconic family across bags and small leather goods, including the recently launched Quilted Tabby with further runway ahead. At the same time, we drove growth across the balance of the assortment anchored by our Willow and Rogue families, which remain foundational volume drivers. We also drove momentum with the recently introduced Idle Family, expanding the offering with new sizes. Overall, our creative and innovative products supported a mid-single-digit gain in global handbag AUR including growth in North America. Looking forward, we see continued opportunity for pricing improvements given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. At the same time, we fueled gains in lifestyle as we focus on building the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, customer lifetime value. In ready-to-wear, we advanced our strategy to build a core assortment of key styles that represent compelling value. Growth in the quarter was driven by outerwear. In footwear, the Leah Loafer offer continued to outperform. And in men's leather goods, growth was driven by the key Gotham, Charter Hitch and Relay families. Next, we created purpose-led storytelling, building meaningful emotional connections with the brand. We continue to lean into the strength of the Wear your Shine campaign, which inspires consumers to use fashion as a means for personal expression and empowerment. The Shine collection included a range of gold and metallic bags, ready-to-wear and accessories, allowing customers to own their shine with confidence. We also delivered emotional content through our More than a gift campaign, which celebrates the gifts that give us the confidence to be ourselves. Overall, the success of these campaigns helped to support the acquisition of approximately 1.5 million new customers in North America, including a growing number of Gen Z and millennials. And according to U.S. brand tracking work fielded during the quarter, Coach saw a lift in unaided awareness versus led by gains with Gen Z consumers, underscoring that our investments in brand building are working.\nAnd finally, we continue to build momentum in our subbrand Coachtopia, a reimagination of the product creation process to evolve our vision of circularity. During the quarter, Coachtopia's Ergo shoulder bag made with either repurpose-ed leather or leather scraps was the top-selling style. While Coachtopia remains a small portion of the assortment, we are excited by the significant consumer attention it's receiving specifically with younger audiences.\nIn closing, Coach continues to build strength on strength, with a clear strategy, unique purpose and commitment to investing behind sustainable growth. The power of expressive luxury rooted in deep consumer insights and consistent execution is bringing new innovation, new customers and new potential to this iconic brand, and we're confident in the tremendous runway ahead.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to advance our long-term priorities, reinforcing our strategic direction. Profits were ahead of both expectations and the prior year, led by gross margin expansion, demonstrating our agility and discipline. Having said that, top line trends remain challenged. In order to realize the ambition we have for the brand, we need to accelerate our progress through improved execution. To this end, we see an opportunity in 3 key areas: first, strengthening Kate Spade's core bag offering; second, powering the omnichannel experience; and third, driving more emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat.\nNow I'll touch on our quarterly results in each of these focus areas in more detail. First, we are reimagining and broadening the brand's core handbag assortment across channels, creating the foundation to be a larger and more profitable brand consistent with our strategic intent. And where we've provided more newness, innovation and emotion, our customers have responded. However, the traction we've seen with new products was offset by declines in carryover families, which underperformed our expectation. This reinforces the need to move faster to build a more innovative core assortment that's required to win in today's dynamic consumer backdrop.\nMoving forward, we are laser-focused on improving the execution of our handbag offering, bringing more relevancy to the assortment. The pipeline for the back half of the year and into fiscal year '25 will increase the penetration of newness across channels with the launch of bags featuring new materials, silhouettes and distinctive branding elements. This innovation builds on the green shoots we're seeing today, while incorporating consumer feedback and insights, which help to inform our product strategies and investments. At the same time, we'll maintain the strength of our novelty and lifestyle offerings, differentiators for the Kate Spade brand. To this point, footwear rose double digits in the quarter, while jewelry remains an important acquisition vehicle consistent with our strategy and focus on enhancing customer lifetime value.\nSecond, the execution of a cohesive omnichannel strategy is a key opportunity to drive stronger customer engagement. During the quarter, we launched a dedicated Kate Spade outlet.com site, replacing the brand surprise site and providing a more seamless way for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. Overall, by bringing a more focused and unified experience to consumers across all brand touch points, we can more efficiently scale our marketing and merchandising efforts, supporting our goal of driving sustainable direct-to-consumer growth.\nThird, we are focused on creating emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat on a global scale. During the quarter, our marketing investments supported the acquisition of approximately 950,000 new customers to the brand in North America. In keeping with our strategy to become a more global brand, we launched a series of physical activations from London to Shanghai that brought the brand Coach to life and helped grow brand awareness internationally. Moving forward, we recognize the need to distort our marketing efforts to brand building to enhance our impact. Unique storytelling has been a strength of the brand over time. And as we move into spring, we will focus on creating marketing to drive fashion credibility and customer engagement by shifting our investment to top-of-funnel marketing through the launch of our campaign anchored in the brand codes of joy, color and New York City.\nFinally, as we fuel enhanced innovation, we will maintain a commitment to operational excellence, positioning the brand for long-term success. This focus has supported the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion thus far this year and is embedded in our strategies and ways of working for the future. Overall, while we're continuing to advance our long-term strategies at Kate Spade, we're leaning in with intention to accelerate our progress. Our path forward is clear and our vision for the brand and its potential is unchanged.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. Top line results in the quarter were pressured, reflecting in part the ongoing strategic reduction in off-price wholesale shipments. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in China against last year's COVID-impacted compare and continued positive wholesale POS trends. Further, we grew AUR, expanded gross margin and improved profitability versus prior year. That said, we remain unsatisfied with the brand's pace of recovery, and we continue to focus on prioritizing brand health and delivering innovation for consumers.\nTouching on key elements of the brand's strategic growth pillars from the quarter. First, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product. We delivered growth in our core boot classification, fueled by gains in the Soho and 5050 families. Further, we continued to build out our assortment with more seasonless casual styles, including loafers and belle flats. During the quarter, we also launched a new sneaker assortment featuring a range of innovative designs, engineered to combine fashion and function. At the same time, our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment, drove growth at high AUR. As we move forward, we will deliver more newness into the core assortment in keeping with rapidly evolving consumer trends.\nNext, we created engaging marketing to fuel brand heat and consideration. In celebration of the brand's 30th anniversary, we employed a multipronged approach to our marketing, including utilizing an array of influencers to organically engage with consumers from Kong to Kim Kardashian to Sofia As a result, we saw brand awareness improve in the U.S. per YouGov and drove increased customer engagement across our social channels. Similarly, in China, brand exposure rose significantly following the launch of this campaign. Overall, Stuart Weitzman team is focused on executing against its strategic priorities, fueling brand heat and deepening customer engagement through a stronger, more diversified foundation of differentiated product and emotional purpose-led storytelling to drive enhanced growth and profitability long term.\nIn closing, Tapestry delivered a strong second quarter, positioning us to raise our earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year. Importantly, this reflects the progress we're making to advance our strategic agenda and power our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer in an ever-changing environment while investing in our future. We remain confident in our vision and in our ability to bring that vision to life, putting the customer at the center of everything we do to drive sustainable organic top and bottom line gains. Further, through the planned acquisition of Capri, we see a significant opportunity to accelerate our strategies while driving accretion to our strong stand-alone financial plan. Overall, we remain excited by the opportunity to expand our house of powerful brands, positioning Tapestry as a leader in innovation, talent development and shareholder returns for years to come. We continue to make progress towards closing the transaction and look forward to sharing more detailed growth strategies for the future at an appropriate time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, our fiscal Q2 results exceeded expectations. We delivered top line growth, significantly expanded gross margin and drove record revenue and EPS for the key holiday quarter while generating over $800 million in free cash flow. Our strong and consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our globally diversified direct-to-consumer business model as well as our financial discipline and agility. It's this discipline that allows us to continue to invest in long-term brand growth while delivering record earnings.\nNow moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 3% compared to the prior year, fueled by strong international growth of 12%. In Greater China, revenue rose 19% as we anniversaried last year's COVID impacted results. At the same time, we've continued to see an uptick in travel spend from Mainland China tourist with increases across Asia and Europe. While these trends have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain well below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead. Outside of China, we drove growth in our key international regions, anniversarying strong gains in the prior year. In Japan, sales grew 6% due to increased tourist demand, and in Other Asia, revenue grew 9%, including strength in Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, momentum continued with revenue 11% above last year. And in North America, sales were in line with the prior year and above expectations on stronger margins, supporting brand health and not chasing sales.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 4%, fueled by mid-single-digit growth in both stores and digital. And in wholesale, which represents about 10% of sales globally, revenue declined 4%, reflecting wholesale market pressure in North America, partially offset by growth in international accounts.\nMoving down to P&L. We delivered our strongest second quarter gross margin in over a decade, which was ahead of our expectations and 300 basis points above last year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by a benefit of 170 basis points due to lower freight expense as well as operational outperformance, fueled by geographic mix tailwinds and net pricing improvements. SG&A rose 5%, which was favorable to our forecast on both a dollar and a rate basis, reflecting operational savings compared to plan. Importantly, we're continuing to tightly control costs while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. So taken together, operating margin expanded 220 basis points and operating income rose 14% compared to the prior year, both ahead of our expectations. And our record second quarter EPS of $1.63 was ahead of guidance and represented growth of 20%.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.7 billion, which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri, which I'll touch on momentarily. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $804 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $30 million. And inventory levels at quarter end were 15% below prior year, reflecting our focus on disciplined inventory management and driving inventory turn.\nBefore moving on, I did want to touch on the disruption related to the Red Sea conflict. We're closely monitoring this situation and currently estimate a modest increase in lead times and freight costs in the back half of the fiscal year, which has been incorporated in the outlook provided today. Importantly, we currently anticipate minimal impact to our operating results and customer experience given our well-positioned inventory.\nTurning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $81 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. Our strong second quarter results position us to raise our EPS outlook for the fiscal year, while taking a prudent approach to our second half planning. On revenue, we're maintaining our outlook on a reported basis as we reflect Coach's outperformance in the second quarter as well as moderating headwinds from FX, offset by lower expectations at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. At the same time, we're raising our EPS estimate for the year, given our stronger margin results and commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands. Our guidance also reflects the strategic decision to invest a portion of our Q2 profit be back into our brands and business to support our long-term strategies.\nMoving to the fiscal year in further detail. We expect revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, representing an increase in the area of 1% versus prior year on a reported basis. Excluding an FX headwind of roughly 100 basis points, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of 2%.\nTurning to sales details by region at constant currency, which are unchanged from the ranges previously provided. In North America, we expect revenue to be in line with to slightly above prior year. This forecast contemplates our commitment to maintaining higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term. In Greater China, we expect mid-single-digit sales growth. In Japan, revenue is forecasted to grow mid-single digits, while Other Asia is expected to increase at a low double-digit rate. And in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth.\nIn addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate gross margin gains in the area of 200 basis points, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs of roughly 120 basis points.\nOn SG&A expenses, we expect deleverage of roughly 100 basis points, reflecting reinvestments in our brands, people and business in support of growth initiatives.\nMoving to the below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 233 million shares.\nTo take we're now projecting EPS of $4.20 to $4.25, representing 8% to 9% growth versus last year. Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we still anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. This forecast includes roughly half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments.\nNow let me take you through the shaping of the year. We continue to expect relatively consistent constant currency top line growth between the first half and second half at around 2%. This includes the expectation for stronger growth in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, helped by the anniversary of easier comparisons in North America. On operating income, as noted, we're utilizing a portion of our outperformance in the second quarter to reinvest in our people, brands and business. Therefore, our outlook now contemplates second half operating income to be roughly in line with the prior year. By quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in both the third and fourth quarters, with modestly higher SG&A dollar growth in Q3 versus Q4 based on the pace of our investments versus the prior year.\nFor the third quarter specifically, we anticipate revenue to be in line with to slightly above prior year in constant currency and down slightly on a reported basis, including roughly 120 basis points of FX pressure. In aggregate, we expect EPS for the third quarter to be in the area of $0.65, with growth anticipated for Q4.\nNow to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We are committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we initiated a long-term leverage target of less than 2.5x on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the Capri transaction close. Finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend.\nImportantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future.\nBefore closing, I want to touch more holistically on the planned acquisition of Capri. We believe the acquisition will drive significant value creation with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns, underpinned by a compelling industrial logic that is consistent with our commitment to being disciplined financial operators. To this end, it's important to highlight that we continue to expect Capri to generate double-digit EPS accretion on an adjusted basis and compelling ROIC. Embedded in these expectations is the assumption that the stand-alone Capri business will generate free cash flow in the area of $500 million on a non-GAAP unsynergized basis.\nAnd as noted, we've made further progress towards transaction close. In November, we issued $6.1 billion in USD and euro bonds, achieving an all-in debt interest rate of 6.5%, inclusive of Tapestry's existing debt and consistent with our expectations. Our financing strategy supports rapid debt paydown in order to achieve our stated leverage target within 24 months post close, given the combined company's strong free cash flow generation. We're moving forward with integration planning efforts and continue to gain confidence in our ability to achieve run rate cost synergies of over $200 million within 3 years of closing.\nAnd finally, we're continuing to work towards receiving all required regulatory approvals, and as publicly announced by the Chinese regulatory authority, the transaction received clearance in China. In terms of timing, we remain confident in our ability to complete the transaction with a close expected in calendar 2024, consistent with our original expectations.\nIn closing, for the quarter, we drove strong results, highlighted by revenue gains, significant margin expansion, earnings growth and cash flow generation while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. This outperformance demonstrates the power of our strategies, operating model and talented global teams. Looking forward, we will remain disciplined stewards of our brands and business with an unwavering commitment to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator and take your questions."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we achieved record first quarter earnings per share as we meaningfully advanced our strategic priorities against the dynamic external backdrop. Our consistent progress demonstrates the power of brand building, customer centricity and disciplined execution, which enable us to fuel innovation [ cultivate ] new and lasting relationships with consumers around the world.\nI want to thank our talented global teams for their passion and unwavering focus, which continue to drive our strong and differentiated results. Touching on the strategic and financial highlights for the quarter. First, we powered global growth, achieving 2% constant currency revenue gains consistent with our outlook and underscoring the benefits of our globally diversified business model. This top line growth was fueled by a 7% gain internationally, which included a 9% increase in Greater China, again surpassing our peak in FY '21. In addition, our business with Chinese consumers globally rose low double digits, supported by improving tourist trends in Asia and Europe.\nLooking ahead, while the consumer environment in China continues to be volatile, we remain committed to investing behind our brands leveraging [ established ] platform in the region to drive long-term growth, both in China and with this important consumer cohort worldwide. Turning to Japan. We drove continued momentum with revenue rising 12%. And in other Asia and Europe, sales were relatively in line with the prior year. Finally, in North America, we delivered revenue roughly in line with last year and consistent with our expectations.\nDespite the challenging consumer backdrop in the United States, we are driving a healthy business, underscored by significant growth and operating margin expansion compared to last year. Second, we remain focused on building customer engagement across our brands, harnessing the power of our data-rich platform. In the quarter, we acquired over 1.2 million new customers in North America alone of which roughly half were Gen Z and millennials as we advance our strategy to attract younger consumers to our brands. Importantly, we continue to see new customers transact at a higher AUR than the balance of our customer base.\nThird, we delivered unique and seamless omnichannel experiences, reinforcing the benefits of our operating model. We drove growth in direct-to-consumer sales on a constant currency basis, including a low single-digit gain in brick-and-mortar sales supported by our world-class field organization and a store fleet that is proven and highly profitable. In addition, we maintained our strong positioning in digital, leveraging our established capabilities to connect with consumers across their purchase journey. While sales declined slightly, revenues still represented nearly 25% of sales, approximately 3x pre-pandemic levels. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence delivering compelling newness and value to customers around the world with success in new launches and bring elements outperforming expectations and fueling handbag AURs globally. At the same time, we delivered outsized top line gains in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, key to enhancing brand relevance and fueling customer lifetime value.\nTaken together, we generated record first quarter earnings per share, increasing at a high teens rate compared to the prior year, which we accomplished despite a volatile demand backdrop. Our strong and consistent results reinforce the power of our brands and strategies amplified by the advantages and agility of our model. As we look forward, we remain laser-focused and confident in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. Our team continued to bring expressive luxury to life building the brand through emotional consumer connections, innovation that encourages self-expression and immersive omnichannel experiences. These strategies are driving sustainable momentum and exceptional financial results highlighted by 5% constant currency revenue growth and 180 basis points of operating margin expansion, supported by strong gross margin gains.\nTouching on some details of the quarter. First, we fueled growth in our leather goods offering by leaning into our iconic platforms. We reinforced our key families, including Tabby, Willow and Rogue through a continued focus on core styles while animating the icons to drive excitement. Tabby again outperformed expectations, nearly doubling versus last year, with strength across bags and small leather goods at strong AUR relative to the balance. We're continuing to iterate on this icon, including a new size in our shoulder bag, which over-indexed with the younger consumer as well as a braided option of our soft style. Overall, Tabby remains an important volume and recruitment driver for the brand, and we see even further runway ahead.\nAt the same time, Willow and Rogue remained important volume drivers within the assortment. In keeping with consumer trends, we also launched new silhouettes across a range of price points and sensibilities, including the idle shoulder bag, which was a notable highlight in Greater China, where AUR was well ahead of the average. Overall, our creative and innovative products supported a mid-single-digit gain in global handbag AUR at constant currency, including growth in North America. Importantly, we see continued runway for pricing improvements given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. Second, we delivered gains across lifestyle, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. We drove top line growth in ready-to-wear, footwear and men's as we develop our core families with a goal of driving customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, customer lifetime value. In ready-to-wear, we focused on our strategy of building a timeless assortment of key styles that represent a compelling value. This included the successful launch of our Snap front leather jacket at a $695 price point as well as success in our evergreen trench coats.\nIn footwear, the [ Lea loafer ] remained a top seller and delivered significant growth. And in men's we delivered outsized gains driven by the performance of our relay code, which was again a top style while the newly introduced [ Beck ] family of sporty and sophisticated options also delivered strong results. Third, we created purpose-led storytelling directly tied to our product. We began the quarter with the debut of our third purpose campaign [ wear your shine ] which inspires consumers to express themselves authentically using fashion as a means for personal expression and empowerment. The Shine collection includes metallic and sparkle bags, ready-to-wear and accessories allowing customers to shine brightly.\nOur campaign featured new global ambassadors, including [indiscernible]. We brought the campaign to life through experiences across the world with physical and digital activations from campus takeovers in the U.S. to a partnership with Vogue world in Europe to pop up installments across Asia. Overall, the success of this campaign helped to support the acquisition of approximately 800,000 new customers in North America including a growing number of millennials and Gen Z. Fourth, we focused on deepening connections with consumers by further developing our customer insights capabilities to build stronger and longer-term connections. In keeping with this strategic pillar, we launched a trial on Amazon in September. The platform provides broad consumer reach and plays a vital role in the customers' discovery and purchase journey, specifically for young cohorts.\nAnd finally, we built momentum in our subbrand Coachtopia, a reimagination of the product creation process to evolve our vision of circularity. We expanded our reach in North America while launching in Japan with additional international opportunities in the pipeline. We've also further innovated across the assortment, including our Coachtopia loop collection designed with a mono material approach, recycled PET plastic. While Coachtopia remains a small portion of the assortment, we are very excited by the significant consumer attention, specifically with younger audiences.\nLooking ahead to holiday. We're continuing to focus on building stronger emotional connections with our consumer base while prioritizing brand health, and we remain disciplined in our approach to discounting in an increasingly promotional environment. We're bringing our purpose to life, delivering an emotional narrative through our more than a gift holiday campaign, which celebrates the gifts that give us confidence to be ourselves. We're also leaning into the strength of our Shine campaign, layering on to the successful launch of our metallic series with a gold addition to capitalize on the holiday theme.\nIn closing, Coach continues to deliver with a clear strategy, unique and authentic purpose and commitment to driving sustainable, healthy growth through profit gains that fund brand building. We remain focused on fueling further momentum and are confident in the tremendous runway ahead for this iconic brand.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, top line performance improved sequentially amid a difficult demand backdrop. Importantly, we expanded gross margin and delivered another quarter of handbag AUR gains, which fueled increases in operating profit and margin. At the same time, we continue to invest in the brand and capabilities that underpin our long-term ambition. We remain confident in our strategies and are agile as we focus on driving enhanced innovation and financial results.\nIn the quarter, we advanced our strategic initiatives. First, we remain focused on building a compelling and innovative handbag offering. We launched the Dakota family in retail, which features new signature hardware. The bold and modern collection outperformed our expectations, resonating with younger consumers at an above-average AUR. Based on Dakota's initial performance, we're excited to build momentum through marketing amplification and the introduction of new styles within the family. And in outlet, we accelerated the introduction of Madison, a collection of reinvigorated Saffiano Leather styles to build out the core offering. The family outperformed plan and over-indexed with new and younger customers while also driving an increase in customer reactivation underscoring future opportunity.\nHaving said that, performance in carryover families declined, reinforcing our strategic decision to move with urgency to accelerate the pace of newness to drive stronger customer engagement and financial results. Touching on novelty, which continued to bring heightened emotion to the brand and build out the world of Kate Spade our Martini collection, embedded across our lifestyle categories resonated with our customer base, notably among our highest spending customers. Overall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported mid-single-digit handbag AUR growth globally, demonstrating our commitment to brand building and fueling innovation.\nNext, we advanced our strategy to become more lifestyle with momentum in jewelry and footwear where we delivered double-digit top line growth. Jewelry remained an important acquisition vehicle with outsized resonance among younger consumers, while footwear outperformed on strength in loafers and sneakers as we infuse Kate Spade's branding and codes into key styles. We know that customers who shop across categories are our highest value customers, demonstrating the importance of the brand's lifestyle offering as a long-term growth driver.\nNow touching on marketing. We delivered campaigns that express the world of Kate Spade with a direct link to our product offering. In the quarter, we evolved our New York Fashion Week presentation to further engage the broader community, including our creators loft, a 3-day pop-up design to support up-and-coming Gen Z creators. Further, in keeping with our brand values, we hosted the Global Summit on women's mental health and empowerment in partnership with Pinterest, which brought together leaders from Kate Spade's Social Impact Council and key industry partners to encourage conversation, education and research around this important cause. These campaigns and engagements alongside our compelling product offering, drove an improvement in brand consideration in the U.S. compared to last year which included notable increase among young female millennials for YouGov.\nAt the same time, our efforts helped to support the recruitment of over 400,000 new customers in North America alone. Next, consistent with our priority of becoming more global, we invested in brand activations across international markets to drive awareness, a key opportunity. As such, we launched experiential events supporting the introduction of Dakota including a playful giant Dakota bag in Japan, a traveling bus serving Matcha across Singapore and branded taxis, featuring our iconic green dots and strikes in the U.K. These activations successfully introduce new and younger customers to our brand.\nFinally, we remain focused on the omnichannel opportunities for the brand. In October, we launched a dedicated Kate Spade outlet.com site, replacing the brand's surprise site in order to provide a more cohesive way for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. Importantly, the seamless launch of the site enables us to offer our customers a consistent omnichannel outlet experience across products, marketing and messaging. For the upcoming holiday shopping season, we will lean into Kate Spade positioning as a brand that embodies joy and celebration. Reliance of newness in core platforms across channels. In retail, we will expand the Dakota family building on our recent success. In outlet, we will animate the Madison collection with the introduction of a mini Duffel. We're also excited to launch our spade flower coated cannabis pattern, establishing a new signature branding platform for the channel. We also have compelling gifting and novelty assortments designed to drive differentiation and customer engagement.\nIn marketing, we will focus on storytelling, highlighting Kate Spade's optimistic and playful spirit true to the brand and the holiday season. In addition, we are launching physical activations of our brand codes globally while delivering content that reinforces our product strategies. Overall, we're making important progress at Kate Spade, executing with intention and agility to forge strong emotional bonds with consumers, while at the same time, driving enhanced profitability. Our go-forward strategy is clear, and we are well positioned to successfully navigate the dynamic environment in the near term while delivering on our long-term ambition for the brand.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. Results in the quarter were pressured against the volatile external backdrop. Specifically, top line trends reflected a continued reduction in off-price wholesale shipments as well as a slower-than-anticipated recovery in China. That said, we achieved positive wholesale trends at POS and expanded gross margin. While we are unsatisfied with the brand's performance, we are focused on prioritizing brand health and delivering innovation for consumers.\nTouching on key elements of the brand's strategic growth pillars. First, during the quarter, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product. Our core collection of boots and booties drove outsized recruitment of younger customers, while at the same time, driving lapsed customer reactivation. Our expanded 50-50 family outperformed expectations as we introduced modern takes on the iconic boot, including new colorways backed by our fall campaign, which I'll touch on in a moment. Further, we continued to build out the brand's offering, notably with more seasonless casual styles and keeping with evolving consumer preferences. To this end, loafers as well as our assortment of on-trend valet style flats resonated with consumers, highlighting potential in these relatively underpenetrated categories. And just this month, we launched a new sneaker campaign, featuring an extensive range of innovative designs, engineers to fashion and function, a hallmark of the brand.\nAt the same time, our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment drove engagement with both new and existing clients at high AUR. Next, we leveraged new marketing tactics to fuel brand heat in federation. In September, we launched the inventively iconic Fall campaign centered around a nostalgic 50-50 boot and celebration of our 30th anniversary. We've employed a multipronged approach to our marketing, including utilizing an array of influencers to organically engage with consumers from [ Hakon ] to Kim Kardashian to Sofia Richie Grainge. For holiday, we will continue to drive engagement through this campaign, celebrating the brand's heritage and capitalizing on its strength in boots and booties during the peak season.\nOverall, while the brand has seen continued pressure from external conditions in its core markets, the Stuart Weitzman team is focused on executing against the brand's strategic priorities building a stronger foundation with relevant assortments in new categories to deepen consumer engagement and improve profitability over the long term.\nIn closing, we have meaningfully advanced our strategic agenda, remaining focused on powering our iconic brands to move the consumer in an ever-changing environment. As a result, we are in a position of strength with meaningful runway for sustainable growth. Through a relentless drive to fuel brand magic and deliver for our customers, we are confident in our ability to achieve organic top and bottom line gains. Further, through the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings, we see a significant opportunity to accelerate our strategies while driving accretion to our strong stand-alone financial plan. Importantly, this combination establishes a new powerful global house of luxury and fashion brands that expand portfolio reach across consumer segments, geographies and product categories. By bringing together 6 iconic brands with heritage in design and craftsmanship and leveraging our modern consumer engagement platform, we will drive greater innovation, consumer connectivity and cultural relevance creating superior value for our consumers, employees, communities and shareholders around the world.\nWe are making progress towards closing the transaction and look forward to sharing more detailed strategies for the future at the appropriate time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our business model as well as our financial discipline and agility. In the first quarter, we drove growth across revenue, operating income and earnings despite the volatile backdrop.\nMoving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased roughly 2% compared to the prior year when excluding a 130 basis point FX headwind. Our results were again fueled by international, which grew 7% and in Greater China, revenue rose 9% and represented growth against our prior peak levels in 2021. At the same time, we've continued to see an uptick in travel spend from Mainland China tourists with notable increases in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia and, to a lesser extent, Europe. While these trends have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead.\nIn Japan, we drove continued momentum with sales growth of 12%, aided by increased of the tourist and in other Asia, revenue was roughly flat to last year as the region lapped last year's growth of over 100%. In Europe, revenue was 1% below last year, largely in line with plan. And in North America, sales were roughly flat to last year as expected. Despite the continued difficult backdrop in the region, we delivered gross and operating margin expansion, underscoring our commitment to brand health and not chasing sales.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 1%, fueled by low single-digit gain in stores and in wholesale, revenue was 4% ahead of prior year, reflecting growth in our full-price accounts, mostly from Coach's trial on Amazon partially offset by a strategic reduction in off-price shipments and broader wholesale market pressure in North America.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered our strongest first quarter gross margin in a decade which was ahead of our projection and 250 basis points above last year, This year-over-year expansion included 150 basis points of favorable freight expense as well as operational outperformance, fueled by net pricing improvements. SG&A rose 3% favorable to our forecast on both a dollar and rate basis, reflecting operational savings. We continue to utilize these savings to reinvest in the business through high-return initiatives, notably platform investments and brand-building activities to drive long-term growth.\nTaken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of the prior year and our expectations and our record first quarter EPS of $0.93 was ahead of our guidance and represented growth of 18%.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $639 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.65 billion. Free cash flow was an inflow of $54 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $29 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 17% below prior year reflecting our focus on disciplined inventory management as well as a lower level of in-transits given the normalization and lead times. Heading into the important holiday season, we're pleased with the makeup of our inventory and are well positioned globally.\nTurning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $80 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend for an annual rate of $1.40 per share a 17% increase compared to last year. As a reminder, given the acquisition of Capri Holdings, we've made the strategic decision to suspend share repurchase activity.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. We are maintaining our earnings and operating cash flow outlook for the fiscal year despite forecasting a more moderate rate of sales growth and have reduced our top line guidance by approximately $175 million. This includes roughly $100 million of FX pressure on a year-over-year basis and approximately $75 million related to a more cautious outlook in Asia and North America, given the difficult demand backdrop. Despite these pressures, we are able to reiterate our fiscal '24 EPS expectations on a stronger-than-anticipated margin performance, reinforcing the benefits of our agile platform and our focus on disciplined execution and brand management.\nMoving into the fiscal year in further detail. We expect revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, representing a slight increase versus the prior year on a reported basis excluding an FX headwind of roughly 150 basis points, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of 2% to 3%.\nTurning to sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we anticipate revenue to be in line with to slightly above last year. This forecast reflects our commitment to maintaining promotional discipline and higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term. In Greater China, our outlook contemplates mid-single-digit growth, led by gains in the first half as we lapped last year's COVID-related headwinds. In Japan, we expect to grow mid-single digits, while Other Asia is forecasted to increase at a low double-digit rate. And in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth.\nIn addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of over 70 basis points. We anticipate gross margin gains to drive this increase, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs. On SG&A expenses, we anticipate slight deleverage for the year, reflecting continued investments in growth driving initiatives across the portfolio. In light of the current environment, we're continuing to monitor our cost base and take proactive actions where needed.\nMoving to below the line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 235 million shares. So taken together, we continue to project EPS of $4.10 to $4.15, representing 6% to 7% growth versus last year. And finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we still anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion. This includes the expectation for CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $200 million. We expect roughly half to be related to stores, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia. The balance of spend is primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments.\nNow let me take you through the shaping of the year. We expect relatively balanced constant currency top line and operating income growth between the first and second half of the year. Our operating margin expansion in the first half is fueled by gross margin gains, while SG&A growth is expected to moderate in the second half based on the pace of investments. We continue to forecast EPS growth to be front half weighted, primarily due to the phasing of our share count and tax rate assumptions. Looking at the second quarter specifically, we expect revenue growth of approximately 2% on a constant currency basis, which excludes roughly 60 basis points of FX pressure and we anticipate second quarter EPS to be in the area of $1.45, representing 6% to 8% growth over the prior year.\nNow to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We are committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we initiated a long-term leverage target of less than 2.5x on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the Capri transaction close.\nFinally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future.\nBefore closing, I wanted to touch more holistically on the planned acquisition of Capri. We believe the acquisition will drive significant value creation with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns underpinned by a compelling industrial logic that's consistent with our commitment to being disciplined financial operators. It's important to highlight that we still expect Capri to generate double-digit EPS accretion on an adjusted basis and compelling ROIC. Embedded in these expectations is the assumption that the stand-alone Capri business will generate free cash flow in the area of $500 million on a non-GAAP unsynergized basis.\nImportantly, we're making progress towards transaction close. First, the shareholders of Capri Holdings Limited approved the transaction last month, satisfying one of the conditions to close. Second, we're working towards receiving all required regulatory approvals, including responding to the FTC's second request. We remain confident in our ability to complete the transaction with a close anticipated in calendar 2024, consistent with our prior outlook. Third, we expect to fund the purchase through a combination of permanent financing, term loans, excess tapestry cash and expected future cash flow, a portion of which will be used to pay certain of Capri's existing outstanding debt. Our financing strategy will support rapid debt paydown with prepayable debt in order to achieve our stated leverage target within 24 months post close, given the combined company's strong cash flow generation.\nAnd finally, our integration planning efforts are moving forward as planned, and we continue to project run rate cost synergies of more than $200 million achieved within 3 years of the close. Overall, we remain excited by the opportunity to expand our house of powerful brands, increasing our position in growing and durable categories with enhanced cash flow to invest in brand building, while funding debt pay down. This combination is transformational and we are confident in our ability to execute, positioning Tapestry as a leader in innovation, talent development and shareholder return for years to come.\nIn closing, for the quarter, we delivered revenue growth, strong margin expansion and high teens EPS increase despite a rapidly shifting backdrop. Our differentiated and consistent performance demonstrates the strength of our brands and our business model and the disciplined execution of our talented global teams. We remain focused on delivering against our long-term priorities driving sustainable, profitable growth, strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. I'd now like to open it up for your questions."

Following that, we will hold a Q&A session where we will be joined by Todd Kahn, CEO and Brand President of Coach. After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nChief Financial Officer, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we achieved record EPS this fiscal year, reinforcing the power of brand building, consumer-centric strategies and disciplined execution. Importantly, we meaningfully advanced our strategic priorities, engaging with consumers around the world through product excellence, unique storytelling and distinctive omnichannel experiences. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and our data-rich consumer engagement platform, which underpin our growth agenda. I want to thank our talented global teams for continuing to drive our strong results.\nTouching on the strategic and financial highlights for the year. First, we powered global growth achieving 3% constant currency revenue gains consistent with our outlook and underscoring the benefits of our globally diversified business model. These top line results were led by our international businesses, which grew 13% excluding FX. This included a 5% increase in Greater China despite facing incremental COVID-related pressures in the first half of the year. Importantly, our business in China rebounded in the second half, achieving 50% growth in the fourth quarter supported by a strong improvement in traffic and representing an increase compared to the region's peak fiscal '21 levels.\nOur international results were also fueled by strong momentum in Other Asia with sales growth of 36% as well as in Japan, where revenue rose 15%. In Europe, sales increased 7% for the year. In North America, sales for the year declined low single digits against a challenging consumer backdrop. In the fourth quarter, our business decreased 8% versus last year, though we delivered significant gross margin improvement and handbag AUR growth, consistent with our commitments to prioritize long-term brand health. Importantly, our business in North America has improved meaningfully on a sequential basis quarter-to-date in Q1 with revenue trending in line with prior year on continued higher margins as we began to anniversary easier comparisons.\nSecond, we continue to focus on building new and lasting customer relationships. To this end, we acquired approximately 6.5 million new customers in North America alone during the fiscal year. Importantly, these new customers transacted at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base and approximately half were Millennial and Gen Z consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers to our brands.\nThird, we delivered seamless omnichannel experiences, harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. We drove 3% growth in direct-to-consumer sales on a constant currency basis. This was led by mid-single-digit growth in brick-and-mortar sales as we welcome an increasing number of consumers to our stores. In addition, we maintained our strong positioning in digital.\nWhile sales were down slightly compared to the prior year, revenues still represented nearly 30% of sales, approximately 3x pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, we enhanced our capabilities this year, bringing all of our brands on a unified digital enterprise platform.\nFourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence informed by data analytics and consumer research. To this end, we drove handbag AUR growth globally and in North America for both the quarter and the year. We also delivered outsized top line gains in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, key to enhancing brand relevance and fueling customer value over time.\nTaken together, we generated record fiscal year earnings per share, increasing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year, which we accomplished despite a volatile demand backdrop and currency headwinds. This included a strong finish to our year with EPS growth of over 20% in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our fiscal '23 results reinforce the meaningful progress we've made in differentiating our brands and our business.\nFurther, our performance highlights our agility and the advantages of our model, underscoring our confidence in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. At the start of the year, we introduced our brand positioning of expressive luxury, laying the groundwork for deeper customer connections. Our team has brought this concept to life through impactful marketing campaigns, unique retail experiences and relevant and innovative product designs. As a result, the brand delivered revenue of nearly $5 billion on stronger operating margin, fueled by a material improvement in gross margin.\nNow touching on some of the details of the fourth quarter. We built on the momentum of our leather goods offering, reinforcing our icons to drive consumer engagement. We innovated across our key families, Tabby, Willow, Field and Rogue by introducing new iterations and launching strong go-to-market activations. Tabby outperformed expectations with notable success in our shoulder bag. Additionally, we have seen strong results from extensions of the family into small leather goods, including a wristlet and chain clutch, both of which over-indexed among younger customers. Willow continued to be a volume-driving style, while the Rogue family fueled stronger AUR aided by animations, including our [indiscernible]. The introduction of Field tote and washed signature denim was a success, which bodes well for our various denim introductions in the year ahead.\nOur innovative product supported by data and consumer insights throughout the creation process, fueled a low double-digit gain in global handbag AUR at constant currency, including an increase in North America. Importantly, we see continued runway for pricing increases into fiscal year '24, given our commitment to expanding gross margin as well as benefits from outsized growth in higher AUR international markets.\nNext, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities, connecting emotionally with customers through the unique purpose of the brand. This spring in North America, we supported the important Mother's Day holiday with a two-pronged marketing approach. First, we led with content from Gen Z creators, highlighting Coach is a gifting destination. We followed this with an iconic Mother's Day campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. Overall, our marketing activities helped to support the acquisition of over 900,000 new customers in North America in the fourth quarter or approximately 3.9 million for the fiscal year.\nTurning to Greater China. We saw strong growth in brand momentum, delivering a 50% top line gain versus last year, excluding FX. In the quarter, we continued to recruit new customers with our product offering resonating with the younger consumers. This further supports our optimism for the future of this market.\nMoving to lifestyle. We drove a strong top line increase in the offering, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In ready-to-wear, we continue to see success, delivering mid-single-digit constant currency growth fueled by success in our branded denim options and T-shirt assortment.\nIn men's, we delivered outsized growth driven by leather goods, including the successful launch of a cross grain leather program. At the same time, our Gotham, Charter and League families remained top sellers.\nAnd finally, we created omnichannel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand purpose, the courage to be real through self-expression. As such, we continued to roll out multisensory immersive concepts. This included the extension of In My Tabby activations with bespoke events and pop-ups across the globe. And in Malaysia, we launched Coach Airways, a full takeover of a retired airplane featuring our brand codes, a coach cafe and content creation opportunities throughout.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year '24, we're building on our success, focused on: first, deepening our connection with consumers, utilizing data to drive experiences that enrich a customers' life building a stronger long-term connection.\nSecond, growing leather goods by animating our icons and Hero families, including the introduction of new sizes and hardware while continuing to focus on maintaining a productive assortment.\nThird, fueling gains across lifestyle by establishing more evergreen wardrobe essentials that align with the younger timeless Coach aesthetic.\nFourth, leading with purpose-led storytelling through high-impact and sustained brand building campaigns, including the distortion of investments toward a younger generation, notably through digital innovation.\nAnd fifth, building momentum in our sub-brand Coachtopia with a focus on attracting a new Gen Z consumer. Coachtopia is off to a strong start, garnering significant consumer attention. While still a small portion of the assortment, it is tracking a year ahead of our original projections.\nIn closing, Coach is just getting started. Our success is rooted in a blend of magic and logic, and we're building on our strong foundation with a clear strategy to deliver another year of growth in fiscal year '24. We are confident in the opportunity to deliver continued healthy growth for years to come.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. During the year, we advanced our strategic initiatives, navigating near-term external headwinds while keeping a sharp focus on our long-term objectives. We delivered revenue of $1.4 billion, in line with the prior year on a constant currency basis despite a more challenging backdrop in North America. To this end, we drove strong international growth, underscoring opportunity for the brand.\nFurther, we expanded gross margin, a key element of our strategic and financial strategy and have delivered over 2 years of handbag AUR gains in keeping with our focus on elevating the brand. At the same time, we also made foundational investments in the brand that position us for the future.\nHaving said that, we are clear-eyed about our path forward and the higher aspirations we have for the brand. We entered the current fiscal year front footed with focus and actions that build upon our progress and leverage the investments we've made to drive accelerated top and bottom line growth in fiscal year '24 and beyond.\nTurning to details of the fourth quarter. First, we remain focused on delivering an innovative and distinctive handbag offering. The Knott remains the top global handbag group, followed by the recently expanded Hudson family, which now includes options and whipstitched in straw. In addition, the iconic Sam bag, which was a pillar of the brand's 30th anniversary celebration, continued to deliver growth and resonated with both new and existing customers. As we move forward, we will further strengthen the brand's core handbag foundation. I'll touch on these strategies in a moment.\nTurning to novelty, which outperformed expectations as we bring heightened the motion to the brand. The Shell collection was a highlight of the fourth quarter, significantly outpacing expectations across categories. It drove engagement with younger consumers, resulting in strong full price sell-throughs and high margins.\nOverall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported low single-digit handbag AUR growth, both globally and in North America, demonstrating our commitment to brand building for the long term. Importantly, we achieved this against the North America backdrop that was more challenging than expected, resulting in conversion and traffic headwinds, notably in the brand's value channels.\nTo navigate the external challenges, we moved quickly. We successfully accelerated new product launches helping to drive a material improvement in Q1 revenue trends, which are now roughly in line with last year.\nNext, we advanced our strategy to become more lifestyle with momentum in jewelry and footwear. We continue to see that customers who shop across categories are our highest value customers. demonstrating the importance of the brand's lifestyle offering as a long-term growth driver. In keeping with this strategy, we delivered an increase in average spend per customer in the quarter and the year.\nNow touching on marketing. We expressed the world of Kate Spade through unique storytelling and messaging connected to the brand's purpose and values, creating authentic consumer engagement. We invested in our brand codes globally, creating activations behind our Kate Spade Green and iconic dots and stripes, which are distinctive and key to driving brand awareness and global consistency.\nAt the same time, we remain focused on women's empowerment through the lens of mental health, highlighted by our partnership with the Boris Lawrence Hensen Foundation, which provides mental health services to women at HBCUs.\nOverall, our marketing helped to support the recruitment of approximately 500,000 new customers in North America for the quarter or approximately 2.4 million customers for the year.\nAnd finally, in keeping with our priority of becoming more global, we drove double-digit international gains at constant currency, underscoring the growth potential of the brand. Importantly, we fueled strong growth in China, where the brand has significant runway based on its relatively low awareness and small distribution footprint.\nAt the same time, we launched marketing activations internationally, including pop-ups in Japan and Thailand as well as at Grand Gateway in Shanghai, which led us to securing a permanent location in that mall. We also continued the rollout of our new store concept, which began earlier in the year with the Marina Bay Sands store in Singapore, where we continue to outperform. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to more than 20 doors across the globe, creating a compelling brand experience.\nNow turning to our priorities at Kate Spade for fiscal '24 in keeping with our long-term strategies. First, we are focused on strengthening our core handbag foundation with a goal of developing more global key items building a strong branded signature platform and continuing to provide innovation that supports ongoing AUR growth. We're excited to launch our new Dakota handbag collection this fall, which features new hardware and will be the hero product story in our marketing campaigns. And this quarter, as mentioned, we accelerated the introduction of a new core collection in outlet, the Madison, which is driving an improvement in top line trends at accretive margins.\nSecond, we'll continue to fuel the lifestyle offering led by growth in jewelry, which represents both a revenue and margin driver for the brand.\nThird, we'll invest in marketing to drive both acquisition and retention, continuing to build relationships with younger customers.\nFourth, we will focus on the omnichannel opportunity by driving in-store productivity, including accelerating lifestyle and small leather goods. At the same time, we will leverage our recent investments in our digital platform with a focus on enhancing our online experiences.\nFinally, we will grow in China where the business is small, though seeing rapid increases. During the fiscal year, we expect to open a net of approximately 10 locations on the mainland. We will also invest in marketing to drive awareness, including through KOL partnerships.\nIn closing, we remain focused on cultivating what makes the Kate Spade brand unique and special. To do this, we will continue to prioritize brand building and forging strong emotional bonds with our customers while executing on high-return initiatives that underpin our profitability goals. Importantly, we have a clear strategy and remain confident in the long-term opportunities for the brand.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. In the fiscal year, the brand was significantly impacted by the difficult external backdrop in China and North America. Improvement in the back half did not fully offset the impact of a slower China business in the first half. Despite these pressures, we focused on our long-term potential, maintaining brand health, which was underscored by gross margin expansion.\nMoving to the details of the fourth quarter. First, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product to spark desire. Our low first pumps and booties continue to perform in keeping with the broader consumer shift to casual and wear to work styles. SoHo remained a top collection while we saw continued strength in the Stewart family of pumps. And our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment drove engagement with both new and existing clients at high AUR and accretive margins. And we fueled brand heat by leveraging new marketing tactics to increase awareness. We focused on creating relevant marketing, including partnerships with influential social media creators to deliver our spring campaign. Importantly, this helped to drive a favorable brand impression among Millennials in the U.S. relative to last year per YouGov.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '24, we will increase marketing relevancy and drive brand consideration as we emotionally engage with our target consumers.\nSecond, we will focus on driving growth in our core and iconic categories while adding depth to underpenetrated classifications that represent significant opportunity. This includes the launch of our extended sneaker assortment planned in the second quarter as well as expanded offering of flat, specifically trend-right valet styles.\nThird, we will accelerate growth in China, leveraging deep customer affinity to maximize the impact of our brand through product and marketing investments. Importantly, we expect to benefit from the recovery of this highly profitable region this fiscal year, which represented nearly 40% of the brand sales in fiscal year '21.\nAnd finally, we will fuel digital by leveraging Tapestry's platform to improve the online shopping experience and better engage with consumers.\nOverall, we're sharpening our focus on the consumer and are committed to driving top and bottom line growth in fiscal '24 and beyond.\nIn closing, building on our strong foundation, we are focused on the future. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver revenue and profit gains across our current portfolio where our runway is significant. Further, last week, we were excited to announce the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings, establishing a new powerful global house of luxury and fashion brands that expands our portfolio reach across consumer segments, geographies and product categories. By bringing together 6 iconic brands with a heritage and design and craftsmanship and leveraging our modern consumer engagement platform, we will drive greater innovation, consumer connectivity and cultural relevance creating superior value for our consumers, employees, communities and shareholders around the world. We look forward to closing the transaction and sharing more detailed strategies for the future at the appropriate time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, we clearly demonstrated our financial discipline and agility. We powered global growth, delivering a 3% increase at constant currency, fueled by international. We increased gross margin by 120 basis points, and we grew earnings per share by 12% versus last year while continuing to invest in marketing and digital capabilities. Importantly, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders, demonstrating our strong cash flow generation and confidence in the future.\nTurning to the details of the fourth quarter. I'll begin with a discussion of revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 1%, consistent with our guidance for low single-digit increase as 22% international growth was largely offset by pressure in North America given the difficult consumer backdrop. In Greater China, as anticipated, we delivered 50% revenue growth against last year's COVID impacted compare. This represented growth against our prior peak levels in 2021. And recently, we've seen an uptick in Chinese travel spend, specifically within Japan, Other Asia and Hong Kong and Macau and to a lesser extent, Europe.\nWhile these reads have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead.\nIn Japan, sales rose 12%, while Other Asia grew 7% with continued traction among local customers. Sales to tourists also improved versus the prior year, though remain below pre-pandemic levels.\nIn Europe, revenue declined 13% as we lapped last year's 50% gains.\nAnd in North America, sales declined 8% given softer consumer demand. Importantly, despite the difficult backdrop, we delivered gross margin gains across brands, underscoring our disciplined approach to pricing. As Joanne mentioned, we've seen a sequential improvement in revenue trends Q1 to date, with the business now performing in line with prior year as we've begun to anniversary easier compares.\nNow touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 2%, fueled by a low single-digit gain in stores. And in wholesale, revenue was 5% below the prior year, reflecting growth in international markets, offset by a decline in North America, which included a strategic reduction in off-price shipments as well as overall wholesale market pressure.\nMoving down the P&L, we delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 350 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 200 basis points of favorable freight expense, partially offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds. Excluding these impacts, gross margin was well ahead of last year, fueled by operational outperformance, reflecting net pricing improvements and a tailwind related to the increased penetration of the higher-margin China business.\nSG&A rose 5%, in line with our expectations and including the anticipated timing shift of expenses from the third quarter into Q4, as previously discussed.\nWe are continuing to reinvest in the business by prioritizing high-return initiatives, notably platform investments and brand-building activities to fuel long-term growth.\nTaken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of the prior year, and our fourth quarter EPS of $0.95 was in line with our guidance range, representing growth of 22%.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the year with $742 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.66 billion. Free cash flow for the year was an inflow of $791 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $261 million. Inventory levels at year-end were 8% below prior year, reflecting our focus on driving higher inventory turn while delivering stronger gross margins. Inventory levels were favorable to our expectations due in part to receipt timing with Q1 fiscal '24.\nEntering the new year, we are pleased with the quantity and quality of inventory across all brands and geographies.\nMoving to shareholder returns. As anticipated, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year which consisted of $700 million in share repurchases and dividend payments totaling $283 million for an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share, which represented a payout ratio of 30%.\nBefore turning to our go-forward expectations, I want to touch on the recent exciting announcement outlining the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings. This acquisition positions us to create significant value for shareholders with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns.\nWhile our current focus remains on the existing business, we've hired Ernst & Young to lead our integration efforts alongside a dedicated internal team ahead of the estimated transaction close in calendar 2024.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue to approach $6.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately 3% to 4% on both the reported and constant currency basis.\nTouching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we anticipate slight growth for the fiscal year. This forecast reflects our commitment to maintaining promotional discipline and higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term.\nIn Greater China, our outlook contemplates high single-digit growth, including outside strength in the first half as we lapped last year's COVID-related headwinds.\nIn Japan, we expect to grow high single digits, while Other Asia is forecasted to increase at a high-teens rate.\nAnd in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth. In addition, our outlook includes a modest improvement in operating margin versus last year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase, which includes a benefit from moderated freight costs with the most notable tailwind coming in the first quarter.\nOn SG&A expenses, we anticipate slight deleverage for the year, reflecting continued investments in growth driving initiatives across the portfolio. In light of the current environment, we're continuing to monitor our cost base and take proactive actions where needed.\nMoving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 235 million shares.\nTaken together, we project EPS of $4.10 to $4.15 representing 6% to 7% growth versus last year. This takes into account our decision to suspend share repurchase activity due to the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings resulting in a $0.10 headwind versus our prior expectations.\nFinally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we would expect free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we forecast CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $220 million. We expect over half of this spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia. The balance of the spend is primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments.\nTouching now on the shaping of the year, we expect relatively consistent top line growth between the first and second half of the year. As mentioned, we see the opportunity for gross margin expansion for the year, with the most significant improvement in Q1, benefiting from lower freight expense versus the prior year. SG&A growth is expected to be higher in the first half relative to the second half based on the pace of investments.\nTaken together, while we expect operating income growth to be relatively balanced between the halves, we would anticipate EPS growth to be front-half weighted, primarily due to the phasing of our share count and tax rate assumptions. This contemplates first quarter earnings per share to approach $0.90, representing a low double-digit growth rate.\nNow to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are consistent with those shared in our acquisition announcement last week. First, we will continue to invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth.\nSecond, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. We've also initiated a long-term leverage target of under 2.5x on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within 2 years of the transaction close.\nFinally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. As previously announced, we anticipate dividend payments of $325 million in fiscal '24, reflecting a 17% increase to our dividend per share to $0.35 for an annual rate of $1.40. Importantly, we believe the strong cash flow profile of the combined company provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. To this end, following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future.\nIn closing, we delivered strong fiscal '23 results, highlighted by revenue gains at constant currency significant gross margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth despite a rapidly shifting backdrop. This marked record EPS for the company, underscoring our agility and the consistent execution of the global teams. We remain focused on staying disciplined to deliver against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns.\nI'd now like to open it up for your questions."

Importantly, we continue to advance our long-term strategic agenda, creating lasting customer relationships around the world through product innovation and compelling omnichannel experiences a testament to the ingenuity of our talented global teams who continue to drive our results.\nTouching on the strategic and financial highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth achieving 9% constant currency revenue gains, meaningfully surpassing our outlook. These top line results were led by our international businesses, which grew nearly 20% excluding FX. This included a greater-than-anticipated inflection in Greater China, where sales increased 20%, supported by a strong rebound in traffic and returning to growth compared to the region's peak fiscal '21 levels. Importantly, given our history in the market and the brand building investments we've made, our brands are well positioned to capture the opportunity with the Chinese consumer, both in Greater China and around the world.\nIn the quarter, we also drove continued momentum in Japan and other Asia with sales growth of over 20% as well as a mid-single-digit increase in Europe. In North America, sales rose low single digits against an increasingly challenging consumer backdrop. Of note, these results benefited from growth in January as we anniversaried more acute COVID-related disruptions in the prior year. Taken together, we delivered strong sales growth globally, while driving higher growth and operating margins compared to prior year, underscoring our commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands and business.\nSecond, we continue to build lasting customer relationships. During the quarter, we acquired over 1.2 million new customers in North America alone. Importantly, these new customers transacted at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base and approximately half of these customers were millennial and Gen Z, consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers to our brands. At the same time, we reactivated lapsed customers across the portfolio.\nThird, we delivered seamless omnichannel experiences, harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. We drove 10% growth in direct-to-consumer sales on a constant currency basis. This was led by low-teens growth in brick-and-mortar sales as we welcome an increasing number of consumers to our stores. In addition, digital sales rose mid-single digits and remained over 3x ahead of prepandemic levels.\nFourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence informed by data, analytics and consumer research. To this end, we drove handbag AUR growth globally and in North America, which supported our gross margin increases in the quarter. We also delivered outsized gains in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings key to enhancing brand relevance and fueling customer value over time. Taken together, we generated third quarter earnings well above our expectations, rising over 50% compared to the prior year which we accomplished despite a volatile demand backdrop and currency headwinds. Based on this performance, we are raising our outlook for the fiscal year, underscoring our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nNow turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. We outperformed expectations in the third quarter as we continue to build strength on strength. We drove an 11% revenue increase at constant currency, while delivering over 300 basis points of operating margin expansion fueled by gross margin gains. Throughout the quarter, we advanced our strategic initiatives, bringing expressive luxury to life.\nFirst, we built on the momentum of our leather goods offering, extending our iconic families to drive consumer engagement. Tabby was again a top performer, resonating with both new and existing customers with notable success in the core shoulder bag. During the quarter, we launched new styles, including the Tabby Box bag, which provided silhouette diversification as well as the fun and nostalgic Jelly tab, which drove strong sell-through specifically with younger consumers. In the Road family, our top handle silhouette gained momentum, becoming the #1 style within the collection. At the same time, Willow drove significant volume while Bandit outperformed expectations at elevated price points. In addition, we're creating compelling and emotional small leather goods assortment. As a result, we drove outsized growth in the category aided by success across wallets and micro bags in keeping with current trends.\nOverall, our product innovation supported by the use of data and consumer insights throughout the product creation process fueled a high single-digit global handbag AUR growth at constant currency including gains in North America. Second, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities, connecting emotionally with customers through the unique purpose of the brand. Building on Coach's courage to be real mission, we debuted our latest marketing that connects product and purpose. Our In My Tabby campaign featuring Will mass X, alongside a cast of global brand ambassadors redefines what we carry, not just in terms of physical objects but the experiences, journeys and aspirations that shape who we are.\nImportantly, our 360-degree activation efforts supported the acquisition of approximately 800,000 new customers in North America alone, with over half being millennial or Gen Z. We also drove strong engagement with existing clientele and reactivated lapsed customers, reaffirming our ability to attract new customers while retaining our existing customer base. And in China, we drove strong growth and brand momentum, capitalizing on Coach's leadership positioning and track record of success since entering the market 2 decades ago. During the quarter, we were pleased with the performance of our collaboration with the Nostalgic White Rabbit Candy brand, which debuted a celebration of Lunar New Year. This collection successfully drove the acquisition of new customers with over half of its purchasers being new to the brand.\nThird, we drove a strong top line increase in our lifestyle offering, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In ready-to-wear, we delivered outsized growth with success across genders as we leaned into the key branding elements. This performance was led by our compelling outerwear selection anchored by the brand's iconic trench. In men's, double-digit constant currency gains were fueled by our leather goods offering, aided by the continued strength of our Gotham family as well as the successful launch of the relay tote offered in a range of colors and featuring Coach New York graphics.\nFourth, we created omnichannel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand purpose of self-expression. We tested new experiential and immersive retail concepts across the globe, creating opportunities for customers to engage their senses throughout their brand and product discovery journeys. In Chicago, we launched Coach Play, the first in a series of concept stores, encouraging customers to play in coach spaces. These highly interactive locations, which we have since opened in Japan and Singapore, are bespoke, balancing design elements of the brand's heritage with local elements to connect with each store's community.\nFurther, we leaned into the success of our TAVI family to create TAVI shops in select stores around the world. These compelling environments utilize existing store architecture and were inspired by traditional ice cream shops to celebrate the different flavors of this iconic handbag collection. We also showcased these pop-ups across our digital channels, allowing the brand to scale the experience to a broader audience. And just last month, we were excited to officially launch Coach Topia, a sub-brand created with the goal of reimagining and disrupting the fashion industry. By working with a community of partners, including Gen Zs, we kept circularity as our North Star, delivering a line of products crafted from reused leather bags and recycled materials.\nWhile a small assortment today, we are extremely pleased with the response to the product and purpose and see further opportunity ahead. In closing, Coach continues to differentiate both in its brand positioning and its financial performance. This success is rooted in the brand's magic. Its unique DNA and iconic product offerings, blended with the logic of deep customer understanding. Importantly, through expressive luxury, we're writing Coach's next chapter by connecting our history and purpose with innovative product and experiences, enabling self-expression for modern consumers around the world. We are confident in our strategy and the opportunity to deliver continued healthy growth for years to come.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. Our third quarter results outpaced expectations, supported by revenue gains on a constant currency basis and gross margin expansion. At the same time, we made further foundational investments that are supporting our long-term strategic growth agenda. Positioning the brand to be more emotional, more lifestyle and more global in order to drive customer connectivity and deliver profitable growth. Touching on the details of the quarter. First, we remain focused on delivering an innovative and distinctive core handbag offering. The not remained the top global handbag group, while the recently introduced Hudson, which features wear-to-work styles was a recruitment driver for younger consumers.\nIn addition, the iconic sandbag offered in recycled nylon drove strong growth. The success of this family highlights the opportunity to engage consumers by leaning into the brand heritage and innovation. We also amplified our novelty offering, bringing heightened emotion and newness to the brand. The sheep dog collection resonated with both new and existing customers. In fact, this was the #1 full-price novelty style in the quarter, priced at nearly $500. Overall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported low single-digit handbag AUR growth at constant currency, both globally and in North America.\nNext, we advanced our strategy to become more lifestyle, delivering strong revenue growth in the assortment, led by momentum in ready-to-wear, footwear and jewelry. Importantly, we continue to see that customers who shop across categories are our highest value customers, demonstrating the importance of the brand's lifestyle offering as a long-term growth driver.\nNow touching on marketing. We expressed the world of Kate Spade through unique storytelling. In celebration of the brand's 30th anniversary, we leaned into its DNA as a beloved lifestyle brand that sparks Joy. To do this, we increased our top of funnel marketing spend, targeting millennial and Gen Z consumers to support the reimagination of our heritage codes. Stripes, dots and Kate Spade Green, which we launched in partnership with Pantone. This signature shade, which was featured an exclusive capsule across categories as well as updated recyclable and reusable packaging has been particularly successful with the brand's loyal fan base.\nWe're also continuing to engage with consumers through our social impact effort, which connects our customers to our brand beyond products. Taken together, our impactful marketing helped fuel the recruitment of approximately 400,000 new customers in North America. Additionally, we saw strong lapsed customer reactivation and an overall increase in spend per customer.\nAnd finally, in keeping with our priority is becoming more global, we remain focused on meeting our target consumer where they shop around the world. To this end, we continue to roll out our new store concept, which began with Marina Bay Sands in Singapore in October. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to more than 15 doors across the globe, creating a compelling brand experience. And in Greater China, an area of opportunity for the brand, we launched Lunar New Year capsule collections, pop-ups and WeChat activations featuring our rabbit novelty offering, which drove strong engagement.\nIn addition, we collaborated with Starbucks China on a series of limited time-only merchandise to help build Kate Spade's brand awareness and excitement. The capsule had strong sell-throughs with more than half of the assortment selling out in just 2 days, signaling the brand's appeal to a broad base of Chinese consumers.\nIn summary, we continue to make progress in advancing the brand's strategic growth agenda and see further opportunity ahead. Kate Spade is a unique lifestyle brand with global relevance, and we're making key investments to deepen consumer engagement through compelling products, marketing and experiences to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement over the long term.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. In the third quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth in constant currency, supported by double-digit growth in North America and a mid-single-digit increase in Greater China. Importantly, we achieved this top line performance while significantly expanding margins with higher full price selling driving gross margin gains.\nTurning to the details of the quarter. We made further progress on our strategy to win with heat and improve brand awareness. First, we curated a highly relevant assortment of emotional product to spark desire. Our newer iconic families led our results with notable outperformance in pumps, booties and loafers. SoHo was again a top collection, anchored by the on-trend Luxol which saw a strong performance with millennial and Gen Z customers, while the Stewart family continued to grow and resonated across age groups. And our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment, drove engagement with both new and existing clients at high AUR and accretive margins.\nSecond, we focused on creating compelling shopping experiences across the globe. As a result, we drove revenue growth in our global direct business, led by increases in North America, which included significant growth in digital. We also continue to strengthen our wholesale partnerships. Specifically, in North America, we saw an increase in sales at full price accounts while continuing to reduce off-price exposure as we focus on brand elevation. And internationally, we delivered continued growth as we increased our presence across key accounts.\nThird, we fueled brand heat by leveraging new marketing tactics to increase buzz and organic awareness. This included an influencer back campaign with a compelling styling series to highlight our spring collection. In addition, we were pleased with the performance of our limited edition collection with Kids Super, a New York City-based streetwear brand and creative studio, which featured artistic plays on our icons that reach new customers across the globe at higher-than-average AUR. As a result of our focus on connecting with consumers in new ways, we drove an increase in the number of active customers in the quarter, fueled by engagement with our existing client base, including growth in reactivated customers.\nOverall, we continue to advance our strategic initiatives to drive brand heat and awareness while maintaining financial and operational rigor to further support profitable growth. In closing, our third quarter results reinforce our progress in differentiating our brands and business. Although the environment remains uncertain, we operate in attractive durable categories from a position of strength with iconic brands amplified by a digitally enabled platform that powers them to move at the speed of the consumer. We remain steadfast in our commitment to building enduring brands and relationships with consumers, and we're investing behind these priorities.\nAt the same time, we're being agile and disciplined financial operators. Controlling what we can control to successfully navigate the near term while advancing our long-term strategic growth agenda. Our runway is significant, and we have a relentless drive to deliver sustainable growth and value for all stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '23 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VF Corp.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, we delivered significant top and bottom line outperformance.\nIn the quarter, we drove revenue growth of 9% on a constant currency basis, including 20% growth internationally. We expanded operating margin by approximately 280 basis points versus last year, led by gross margin gains and grew earnings per share by over 50%.Importantly, we also returned $270 million to shareholders, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing long-term value.\nTurning to the details of the quarter, I'll begin with revenue, which will be shared on a constant currency basis. Sales rose 9%, well ahead of our expectations for an increase of 3% to 5% fueled by games both internationally and in North America. In Greater China, we returned to revenue growth in the quarter, driven by an improvement in traffic. Sales increased 20% with double-digit gains across stores, digital and wholesale. At the same time, we've started to see an uptick in domestic Chinese travel, including significant gains in our Hong Kong and Macau businesses as well as a pickup in Hainan. Importantly, although these initial reads have been encouraging, global Chinese tourist trends still remain well below pre-pandemic levels, representing an area of further opportunity.\nIn Japan, sales rose approximately 23%, while Other Asia grew 22%, driven by strength across Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, with notable traction among local consumers. Sales to tourists also improved versus the prior year, although remained well below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, sales increased 4%, fueled by gains with international tourists, notably from the Middle East. And in North America, sales rose 3%, driven by growth in January against last year's atypical comparisons related to COVID.\nFor the balance of the quarter and into April, trends in the region softened amid an increasingly challenging consumer backdrop. As such, we've incorporated a mid-single-digit decline in sales in North America into our fourth quarter outlook. By channel, our direct-to-consumer business grew 10%, led by a low-teens gain in stores as well as a mid-single-digit increase in digital. Importantly, we delivered higher operating margin in both channels relative to last year. And in wholesale, revenue was 7% below the prior year, reflecting growth in the international markets, fully offset by a decline in North America, which included a strategic reduction in off-price shipments.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 290 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 360 basis points of favorable freight expense, partially offset by 120 basis points of FX headwinds. Therefore, excluding these impacts, gross margin was still ahead of the prior year, fueled by operational outperformance based on AUR increases, promotional discipline and a tailwind related to the increased penetration of higher-margin China business.\nSG&A rose 5% compared to the prior year and included approximately $10 million of timing benefit with the fourth quarter. Throughout the quarter, we continued to prioritize high-return initiatives, including platform investments and brand building activities. Taken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of our forecast and ahead of prior year. As a result, our third quarter EPS was approximately $0.20 ahead of our forecast, primarily due to $0.10 of operational outperformance as well as a favorable timing shift of $0.05 with the fourth quarter and roughly $0.05 associated with below-the-line benefits. Overall, we delivered earnings growth of over 50% despite $0.10 of year-over-year FX headwinds.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $652 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.67 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $71 million including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $57 million. Inventory levels for the quarter ended 2% ahead of prior year favorable to our expectations on higher sales and tight inventory control. Given this performance, we're now well positioned to end the fiscal year with inventory approximately flat to last year as we continue to focus on higher inventory turn while delivering gross margin expansion.\nMoving to our capital allocation priorities. We continue to plan for approximately $1 billion in shareholder returns in fiscal 2023, which consists of share repurchases of $700 million including $500 million repurchased fiscal year-to-date as planned and dividend payments totaling approximately $300 million. This is based on an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share which represents a 20% increase over the prior year.\nOur priorities remain unchanged. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the future, we believe our platform is scalable and would evaluate M&A that is accretive to our organic TSR plan.\nSo moving to guidance. We're raising our fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings outlook, which reflects our outperformance in the third quarter of $0.15, excluding the impact of timing. Let's touch on the details of this outlook, which replaces all previous guidance. For the fiscal year, we expect constant currency revenue growth of approximately 3%. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to approach $6.7 billion, which is in the area of prior year and includes roughly 320 basis points of FX pressure. This implies constant currency revenue growth of approximately low single digits in the fourth quarter, excluding FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points.\nTouching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, our guidance continues to contemplate a low single-digit decline for the year. As previously noted, this implies a mid-single-digit sales decline in the fourth quarter based on the increasingly challenging backdrop we're seeing. This also reflects our commitment to maintaining promotional discipline and higher margins as we manage our brands and our business for the long term. In Greater China, given the third quarter's outperformance, we anticipate a mid-single-digit gain for the fiscal year which includes an increase of approximately 50% in the fourth quarter.\nIn Japan, we expect to grow mid-teens, while other Asia is forecasted to grow 40%. And in Europe, we anticipate a high single-digit sales increase. In addition, our outlook includes a year-over-year operating margin decline in the area of 50 basis points, which assumes FX pressure of roughly 115 basis points. We expect the majority of this FX headwind to flow through the gross margin line. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 100 basis points ahead of the prior year, largely reflecting the operational beat in the third quarter and the expectation for continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, our gross margin forecast incorporates the benefit of moderating freight costs of 140 basis points as well as AUR growth, which is being partially offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials as well as the negative impact of FX, as mentioned. On SG&A expenses, we anticipate deleverage for the year, reflecting growth-driving initiatives, including increased marketing expenses to fuel long-term customer value, investments in digital and the opening of our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas, partially offset by proactive actions we've taken to reduce our expense base.\nMoving to below the line items. Net interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $30 million, a significant decline versus fiscal '22, reflecting the benefit of our cross-currency swap agreements. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19%, which is below our prior forecast given the lower actualization in the third quarter due primarily to geographic mix. Weighted average diluted share count is expected to be in the area of 242 million shares. This reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases expected in the fiscal year as noted. Taken together, we project EPS of $3.85 to $3.90, representing a low double-digit growth rate compared with the prior year which includes a year-over-year currency headwind of approximately $0.40.\nFor the fourth quarter, this guidance implies earnings of $0.92 to $0.97, inclusive of the $0.05 timing impact with the third quarter. Finally, we now forecast CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $280 million. We expect approximately 30% of this spend to be related to openings and renovations with the majority of the balance dedicated to our ongoing digital and IT initiatives, including investments related to our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.\nIn closing, we delivered strong third quarter results with sales, margin and earnings growth all outpacing expectations, positioning us to raise our top and bottom line outlook for the fiscal year. In addition, we remain on track to return $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23, highlighting the power of our balance sheet and significant free cash flow generation. Importantly, our performance underscores our competitive advantages and reinforces our strategic agenda.\nAs we look forward, we remain focused on staying agile and discipline to deliver against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns. I'd now like to open it up and take your questions."

Crevoiserat\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we delivered record second quarter earnings despite the challenging backdrop. During the key holiday season, where brand magic, compelling product and operational excellence are required to win with consumers, we outperformed expectations. This is a direct reflection of our talented teams and the benefits of our globally diversified business model, which continue to fuel innovation and customer engagement across our portfolio.\nImportantly, we remain disciplined stewards of our brand, which is underscored by gross margin expansion as well as the ongoing investments we're making to support our long-term growth agenda. Now touching on the strategic and financial highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth, delivering low single-digit constant currency revenue gains, excluding Greater China, which experienced incremental pressure associated with COVID.\nThese results were led by double-digit sales increases in Europe, Japan and other Asia, which together outpaced our expectations. In North America, as expected, we realized a slight decline in revenue amid a difficult consumer backdrop. We did this while driving higher gross margin, operating margin and profit dollars compared to both prior year and pre-pandemic levels, underscoring our commitment to brand building and operating discipline.\nIn Greater China, sales declined 20% on a constant currency basis. This was below our expectations as we, like many others, experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID-related disruption. That said, following the change in the COVID containment policy in China, we experienced a meaningful improvement in traffic trends, driving a positive Lunar New Year performance and a solid start to the third quarter.\nSecond, we continued to build lasting customer relationships. During the quarter, we acquired nearly 2.6 million new customers in North America alone. Importantly, these customers transacted at higher AURs than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, nearly half of these customers were millennial and Gen Z, consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers. We also drove higher average spend across our customer base, which included an increase in units per transaction, reflecting the rising traction of our lifestyle offering and focus on solidifying our brands as gifting destinations during the holiday season.\nThird, we delivered seamless omnichannel experiences, harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. Excluding Greater China, we drove a low single-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales at constant currency. This was fueled by a mid-single-digit growth in brick-and-mortar sales as consumers embrace the return to in-person experiences. We leaned into this shift, welcoming more customers to our stores around the globe where we leveraged our expertise and world-class field teams to deliver exceptional customer experiences.\nGiven this dynamic, our digital business declined low single digits as anticipated. With that said, digital sales were 3x ahead of fiscal '19 levels and represented 1/3 of total revenue, underscoring the continued importance of this channel.\nNext, we've continued to invest in our platform capabilities. In fact, this marks the first holiday season that all our brands were on our digital enterprise platform, which was designed to enhance engagement and simplify the customer journey. In addition, we leverage new data analytics capabilities to optimize our product allocation processes such as utilizing artificial intelligence to forecast customer demand and better position inventory in stores.\nThis led to an increase of inventory availability and helped to ensure our product was in the right place at the right time as we match supply with demand to help deliver superior customer experiences.\nBefore moving on, I want to recognize the incredible work of our teams across the organization. Their ingenuity and partnership drove our results and importantly, fueled omnichannel engagement across our brands. Fourth, on a constant currency basis, we drove handbag AUR gains globally and in North America.\nThis reflects a blend of magic and logic. Our commitment to driving fashion innovation and product excellence informed by analytics and consumer research. Together, this supported our ability to drive gross margin expansion in the quarter, allowing us to capitalize on lower freight costs and drive these savings to the bottom line.\nOverall, we generated second quarter earnings well above expectations, supported by stronger-than-anticipated margins. On a currency-neutral basis, EPS rose 10%, which we accomplished despite headwinds in China and continued investment in our platform capabilities and our brands.\nBuilding on this performance, we are raising our earnings outlook for the fiscal year, demonstrating the power of brand building and customer centricity, augmented by an agile operating model and financial discipline.\nIn addition to our financial progress, I'm proud of the work we've done to continue to advance our corporate responsibility strategy, which we're calling the fabric of change. Last month, we published our tenth Annual Corporate Responsibility Report, highlighting our progress and launching new and bolder ambitions to support an increasingly equitable and sustainable future for our business and our planet.\nNow turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. In the second quarter, our revenue outperformed expectations, while driving an increase in operating margin to over 31% despite facing incremental headwinds from Greater China. We advanced our strategic initiatives, which fueled our results. First, we remain focused on our core leather goods, as we continue to build equity in our most important families, while simultaneously introducing emotional newness into the offering.\nOur iconic platforms, Willow, Tabby and Rogue drove our handbag performance in the quarter. Willow remain the #1 handbag family with a timeless aesthetic and compelling functional silhouettes. Rogue was again a top seller with notable strength in North America at premium AUR.\nThe Tabby collection continued to resonate with consumers, led by outperformance in the core shoulder bag. We continue to animate this family, introducing new colorways and fabrics, including shearling, to add depth and excitement. And following its strong launch in the first quarter, Bandit outperformed expectations and was the key recruitment vehicle with approximately 40% of shoulder bag sales coming from new customers at strong AURs. Based on the consumer demand we've seen, we are further investing behind this collection, which is emerging as an iconic family.\nAt the same time, we fueled innovation through trend-right launches with a focus on appealing to younger consumers. We relaunched the Demi bag, an icon from our archives in a blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester. We also continue to lean into the micro and mini handbag trend, including our Studio Baguette and Mini Tabby which resonated with Gen Z consumers. These examples showcase the innovation we're delivering to translate fashion trends into our brand language.\nOverall, our product assortment fueled a mid-single-digit constant currency gain in handbag AUR both globally and in North America. Importantly, our brand strength and pricing discipline helped to drive gross margin expansion in the quarter. Second, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities to create emotional connections with consumers, harnessing the brand's unique purpose.\nOur first Courage To Be Real campaign featuring global ambassador, Lil Nas X, cut through with consumers with its message of confidence and authenticity.\nFollowing the launch last September, the campaign video has approximately 350 million views, and we have seen improvements in purchase consideration for Gen Z consumers per YouGov.\nIn addition, we continue to test and learn new ways to engage consumers on digital channels in keeping with our multifaceted marketing strategy designed to increase customer lifetime value. For example, we utilized an array of YouTube shorts to deliver high-impact brand and product stories. As a result of these efforts and our innovative product offering, we acquired nearly 1.5 million new Coach customers in North America alone. Importantly, these customers entered the brand at a higher AUR than the balance.\nThird, we drove double-digit top line gains in our lifestyle offering at constant currency, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In footwear, outsized growth was led by trend-right styles, including the Leah Loafer and the Men's Low Line Sneaker as well as boots and booties across genders. In men's, Revenue growth was fueled by our core leather goods families, notably the Gotham, League, Charter and Hitch. And in ready-to-wear, we continue to see success in both men's and women's styles featuring iconic branding across outerwear, including puffers with Signature C as well as our cut and so gifting items adorned with Rexy, our brand's favorite mascot.\nFourth, we focused on creating omnichannel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand's purpose of self-expression. We launched an array of in-person experiences, including a one-of-a-kind Coach Mart in Japan inspired by the region's iconic local convenience stores. At the end of December, our collaboration was a beloved White Rabbit candy brand debut in China in anticipation of the Lunar New Year holiday, celebrating the year of the rabbit. We amplified this multi-category collaboration through exciting activations and including an experiential event at The Bund in Shanghai.\nWe're also connecting with new customer segments through immersive online environments and high-impact content to allow Coach's physical world to have greater reach. This included partnerships with digital artists, 3D installations and high-profile physical retail locations and hyper-local mobile games.\nIn closing, we delivered a solid holiday quarter, highlighted by margin expansion despite the challenging backdrop. Our success is rooted in our strategy of bringing expressive luxury to life through a clear understanding of our target consumer and an unwavering commitment to our brand purpose.\nCoach is truly unique. It's a brand that enables confidence, self-expression and authenticity with products crafted to last. Building on the strong foundation, we are confident in our ability to write the next great chapter of profitable growth for this iconic brand.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. We delivered second quarter revenue ahead of our expectations. These results were driven by outperformance during peak selling periods, including a record Thanksgiving week and Cyber Monday event in North America. Importantly, we continue to invest in and advance the brand strategic priorities, becoming more emotional, more lifestyle and more global to drive lasting customer relationships and deliver balanced and sustainable growth.\nTouching on the details of the quarter. First, we created emotional connections with consumers through a focus on delivering an innovative and distinct offering. To this point, we reinforce the pillars of our handbag collection, highlighted by the Knott and Katy families, which continue to fuel our performance. And in December, we introduced the Gramercy, which has delivered strong performance and has over-indexed with new customers, underscoring the opportunity to expand the silhouette going forward.\nIn addition, we launched new branding through a Chanel monogramming platform on our Manhattan code. Given the success of this style, we're expanding our logo offering with further iterations of the spade flower across the assortment, which we believe represents an important platform for future growth and innovation.\nWe also amplified our novelty offering, a differentiating element of our assortment and an important vehicle for brand storytelling. Our Zebra collection was particularly successful, while the candy-themed offering was a hit with consumers. At the same time, the Swara slingback pump, which featured a champagne Corkill, was a top-performing style within footwear.\nOverall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported mid-single-digit handbag AUR growth at constant currency both globally and in North America despite more normalized promotional levels.\nThis season, the North America consumer was more value-driven, over-indexing during holiday sale periods, which resulted in promotions that were above the prior year, though below 2 years ago.\nImportantly, we delivered overall gross margin improvement as we continue to manage the business for the long term, balancing brand health and inventory management. Second, we remain focused on our strategy of becoming more lifestyle, delivering mid-teens revenue growth in the assortment. Importantly, we continue to see the customers who enter the brand through these categories are our highest value customers demonstrating the importance of lifestyle as a long-term driver of sustainable growth.\nIn ready-to-wear, our collection of festive sweaters and skirts for the holiday season as well as trend-right outerwear pieces helped fuel mid-single-digit sales growth. And in footwear, our evergreen styles, notably boots and booties, led our performance, while jewelry delivered growth with strength across core and fashion pieces.\nThird, touching on marketing. We expressed the unique world of Kate Spade leaning into the power of brand storytelling and community.\nOur Have A Ball campaign reinforced Kate Spade's Joy Colors life purpose in a celebratory, highlighting the brand as a gifting destination for the holiday. We synchronized activations to amplify our message across touch points, including global pop-up center around our candy collection, which were successful in attracting new customers.\nFrom a digital perspective, we continue to diversify across social platforms, notably TikTok and YouTube where we focused on engaging with a younger consumer. Taken together, our impactful marketing helped to fuel the recruitment of approximately 1 million new customers in North America with these customers continuing to enter the brand at a higher AUR than the balance.\nAdditionally, we saw an overall increase in spend per customer. Importantly, we're engaging with consumers through our social impact effort, which connects our customers to our brand beyond product. Our purpose focuses on women's empowerment and mental health. As such, we have broadened our brand work to reach younger and more diverse audiences, notably through our social impact council.\nFinally, in keeping with our priority of becoming more global, we remain focused on meeting our target consumer where they shop around the world. To this end, we continue to roll out our new store concept, which began with our Marina Bay Sands store in Singapore in October. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to Taipei and Chicago where we have seen strong initial reads.\nIn closing, we continue to make important progress in advancing Kate Spade's strategic growth agenda. It is a global lifestyle brand synonymous with optimism and joy, a differentiated positioning with global relevance. As we enter the brand's 30th anniversary year, we have an appreciation for its past and confidence in the future. With an unwavering eye on our consumers and our unique DNA, we will continue to drive innovation while investing in capabilities to support sustainable, profitable growth.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. Revenue declined in the quarter, impacted by the brand's significant exposure to China as well as a decrease in wholesale, reflecting in part a reduction in off-price shipments as we remain focused on tight inventory management and brand elevation.\nImportantly, in our North America direct business, sales rose mid-single digits.\nTurning to the details. We made further progress on our strategy to win with heat and improve brand awareness. First, we curated an assortment of high-motion product across occasion wear and casual styles. We continue to lead with our iconic styles as we build out the offering to engage with a wider set of consumers. Soho remained a top collection with notable success among younger customers given the family's on-trend lug soul. The Stuart, a new staple in our offering resonated across age groups, while the iconic land styles acted as a strong recruitment tool.\nAdditionally, we were pleased with the consumer response to our handbag launch. While a small assortment, the top handle style sold at an AUR of over $700 with engagement from both new and existing clients. Second, we focused on brand building in the wholesale channel, notably in international markets. We created high-impact activations across key accounts globally from London to Dubai. And after a successful pop-up at La Reina chante in Milan, we are now moving into a permanent space on the designer floor there in mid-February.\nThird, we fueled bread heat by delivering impactful marketing campaigns, amplifying our brand purpose to celebrate women who stand strong. The debut of Kim Kardashian as our global ambassador helped to drive an improvement in customer trends driving growth in new customers, including outsized gains with millennials.\nLooking to the balance of the year, we're innovating on our approach to connect with consumers and increase awareness. In February, we're set to launch our Kids Super collaboration, followed by a styling series utilizing influencer marketing to highlight our spring collection. Overall, we're progressing against our strategies to build brand awareness and offer products that spark desire. We're continuing to navigate the significant profit headwinds the brand is facing from pressures in the highly penetrated Greater China region, to remain focused on delivering a profitable fiscal year.\nIn closing, our foundation is strong and our runway is significant. We are staying agile and disciplined in a volatile environment to successfully navigate current headwinds and at the same time, drive forward our long-term growth agenda. Importantly, we are well positioned in attractive, durable categories, amplified by our digitally enabled direct-to-consumer platform, which powers our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer. We are confident that our competitive advantages and strategy will continue to drive sustainable growth and value for all our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '23 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nCFO & COO, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, we delivered solid results in the face of a volatile backdrop as we focused on the factors within our control. We achieved revenue of over $2 billion, while realizing the operating margin ahead of expectations and grew earnings per share 10% against last year, excluding $0.11 of currency pressure. At the same time, we returned $272 million to shareholders, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing long-term value.\nTurning to the details of the quarter. I'll start with revenue, which will be shared on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Sales declined 2%, which included pressure in Greater China as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding Greater China, revenue increased 1%, led by outperformance in the balance of our international regions.\nIn Japan, revenue increased 10%, while Other Asia grew 29%, driven by strength across Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Korea. These trends were again led by traction with local customers.\nAt the same time, sales to tourists improved versus the prior year that remained well below pre-pandemic levels, highlighting future opportunity. In Europe, sales were 20% above last year, fueled by higher international tourist traffic, notably from the Middle East and within Europe as well as continued growth with local customers.\nFor Greater China, sales declined 20%, which was below our forecast due to incremental pressure associated with COVID impacting both stores and online. As Joanne mentioned, following the lifting of certain government restrictions in December, we've seen a meaningful improvement in traffic Q3 to date, notably during the Lunar New Year holiday.\nTherefore, as we approach guidance, we maintained the expectation for a strong sequential improvement in the second half of the year, albeit from a lower second quarter base. Overall, we still expect strong double-digit growth in the second half to fuel an increase for the fiscal year at constant currency.\nTurning to North America. Sales declined by 2% for both the total region and our direct business, in line with our guidance for a low single-digit decline. Importantly, we delivered North America operating income ahead of forecast and realized handbag AUR growth at both Coach and Kate Spade, underscoring our focus on brand health.\nBy channel, our direct business declined 2%. That said, excluding Greater China, direct revenue grew low single digits, which included a mid-single-digit increase in stores fueled by continued traffic improvements and a low single-digit decline in digital. And in wholesale revenue was 3% below the prior year.\nMoving down the P&L. We delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 50 basis points ahead of prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 130 basis points of favorable freight offset by 100 basis points of FX headwinds and the negative impact from lower penetration of high-margin China business. Therefore, excluding these impacts, gross margin was still ahead of prior year, driven by operational outperformance.\nSG&A declined 1% and was slightly favorable to our prior outlook. In the quarter, we continued to prioritize high-return initiatives, including platform investments and brand building activities underscored by mid-single-digit growth in our marketing spend. So taken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of forecast.\nEPS grew 2% compared to the prior year or 10% on a currency-neutral basis and was favorable to forecast due to operational outperformance as well as a $0.03 tailwind from a more moderate year-over-year FX impact.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $846 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.67 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $552 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $102 million.\nAs anticipated, inventory at quarter end was 30% above prior year. We're pleased with our sequential progression in the quarter and the quantity and quality of our current inventory. We continue to expect to end fiscal year '23 with inventory up single digits compared to the prior year.\nMoving now to our capital allocation priorities. We continue to plan for approximately $1 billion in shareholder returns in fiscal 2023, which includes share repurchases of $700 million including $300 million bought back in the first half, including $200 million in the second quarter as planned and dividend payments totaling approximately $300 million. This is based on an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share, which represents a 20% increase over the prior year.\nOur priorities remain unchanged. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the future, we believe our platform is scalable and would evaluate M&A that is accretive to our organic TSR plan.\nNow moving to our guidance for fiscal 2023. We we've raised our earnings expectation, incorporating 3 key changes versus the prior outlook. First, our outlook now reflects the second quarter's operational outperformance of approximately $0.08. Second, we're including a more moderate headwind from currency, which provides a $0.10 benefit versus our previous guidance. And third, as previously noted, we've incorporated the expectation of more modest growth in Greater China for the fiscal year based on the incremental pressure we experienced in the second quarter. We've rebased our second half outlook given the lower Q2 results, which equates to roughly $0.10 of negative impact versus our prior guidance.\nOverall, our ability to increase our earnings outlook despite a volatile external environment, highlights the resilience and agility of Tapestry's operating model.\nSo let's run through the details of our outlook, which replaces all previous guidance. For the fiscal year, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 3%. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to be approximately $6.6 billion, which represents a slight decline compared to the prior year, including roughly 300 basis points of FX headwinds.\nTouching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, our guidance continues to contemplate a low single-digit decline in the second half of the year, consistent with year-to-date trends.\nIn Greater China, as previously mentioned, we expect a slight increase in the fiscal year. In Japan, we now expect mid-teens growth, while Other Asia is forecasted to grow approximately 35% reflecting strength in the second quarter and the continuation of these trends into the second half.\nIn Europe, we continue to anticipate low double-digit gains. In addition, our outlook includes a year-over-year operating margin decline of over 70 basis points, which contemplates FX pressure of approximately 115 basis points. We expect the majority of this FX headwind to flow through the gross margin line. We anticipate gross margin slightly ahead of the prior year, largely reflecting favorable freight costs relative to prior expectations.\nCompared to fiscal '22, gross margin incorporates the benefit of moderating freight costs of 130 basis points as well as AUR growth, which is being partially offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials as well as the negative impact of FX, as mentioned.\nOn SG&A, we continue to anticipate deleverage for the year reflecting growth-driving initiatives, including increased marketing expenses to fuel long-term customer value, investments in digital and the planned 2023 opening of our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas partially offset by proactive actions we've taken to reduce our expense base.\nMoving to below the line items, which are consistent with our prior guidance. Net interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $30 million to $35 million a significant decline versus fiscal '22, reflecting the benefit of our cross-currency swap agreements. Tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This represents an increase against last year, primarily due to the anticipated geographic mix of earnings. Weighted average diluted share count is expected to be in the area of 242 million shares. This reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases expected in the fiscal year as noted.\nTaken together, we project EPS of $3.70 to $3.75 representing high single-digit growth compared to the prior year, which includes a year-over-year currency headwind of approximately $0.40.\nFinally, we now expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $300 million. This decrease from the prior outlook is due to the timing of store openings and renovations in Asia, mainly in China, some of which have been deferred to fiscal year '24. Given the shift, we now expect approximately 1/3 of this spend to be related to openings and renovations with the balance dedicated to our ongoing digital and IT initiatives, including investment related to our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.\nAs previously outlined, given the volatile environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we continue to expect significant variability by quarter. Specifically, we project revenue and earnings growth to be back half weighted, helped by the planned return to growth in Greater China and lower freight costs on a year-over-year basis, providing a tailwind to margin.\nDrilling down in the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% in constant currency, which includes gains in Greater China. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to be up slightly, including a negative impact of approximately 350 basis points from FX. We expect EPS to approach $0.60, representing a strong year-over-year increase despite a currency headwind of approximately $0.10 versus the prior year.\nSo in closing, we delivered record second quarter earnings, outperforming expectations and are raising our earnings outlook for the year despite a volatile backdrop. In addition, we remain on track to return $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23, underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and significant cash flow generation.\nImportantly, our performance reinforces our competitive advantages and validates our strategy. As we look forward, we remain focused on delivering against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable growth and shareholder returns. I'd now like to open it up for your questions."

Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. Our first quarter earnings were ahead of expectations despite the more challenging backdrop, demonstrating the strength of our brands, the agility of our operating model and the consistent execution of our passionate global team. Importantly, this performance also underscores our competitive advantages and Tapestry's successful transformation into a consumer-centric and data-driven organization, which has enabled us to successfully navigate the uncertain environment.\nTo this point, as we outlined at our Investor Day in September, our strategic agenda future speed is designed to drive strong, sustainable growth by powering our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer in an ever-changing world. It requires resiliency, continuous innovation and adaptability to pivot and evolve to effectively build our brands and foster enduring customer relationships.\nDuring the quarter, we did just that. Although the landscape continued to shift at a rapid pace, we were nimble and responsive to change, remaining on track to deliver our fiscal year earnings target, excluding the impact of currency, while intentionally advancing our long-term initiatives.\nNow turning to the financial and strategic highlights of the quarter, first, we powered global growth, delivering record first quarter revenue. These results were led by double-digit constant currency growth in international markets which we achieved despite COVID-related headwinds in China with pressure fully offset by outsized gains in the rest of Asia and Europe. In North America, sales grew slightly amid an increasingly difficult consumer backdrop. Overall, we achieved our top line expectations, highlighting the benefits of our globally diversified brands and business.\nSecond, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences to drive another quarter of growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses. Our global stores led the growth, driven by significant traffic increases as consumers continue to embrace the return of in-person experiences. We leaned into this trend, supported by our world-class field organization and a fleet that is proven and highly profitable.\nAgainst this backdrop, our digital business declined versus the strong gains from a year ago though remained over 3x ahead of fiscal year '19 prepandemic levels. We continue to believe e-commerce represents a significant growth driver for our company long term as we leverage our established capabilities to connect with consumers across their purchase journey.\nMoving forward, our goal is to continue to offer our customers seamless, consistent and unparalleled brand experiences wherever they choose to engage with us.\nThird, on a constant currency basis, we drove AUR increases in each brand's core category globally and in North America, supported by fashion innovation and product excellence. In addition, we continue to use data and analytics to enhance our go-to-market strategies, including assortment planning and pricing optimization, enabled by a deeper understanding of the preferences and drivers of customer purchases.\nFourth, we continue to build lasting customer relationships with more active customers shopping our brands in the quarter in North America. At the same time, we drove higher average spend among our customer base led by increases across units per customer, transactions per customer and purchase frequency. This was a direct result of our marketing efforts focused on improving productivity of our existing customer base.\nImportantly, our customers in North America were increasingly omni, purchasing in both stores and online. This increased engagement is key as our omnichannel customers spend over 2.5x more than customers who shop with us in a single channel. In addition, we continue to acquire new customers across the portfolio with approximately 1.4 million new customers transacting with us in North America this quarter. Taken together, we generated first quarter earnings above our\nOn a currency-neutral basis, EPS rose 8%, which we accomplished even as we invested in platform capabilities and in our brands. notably with higher marketing. Overall, we continue to see significant runway ahead and are on track to deliver our 2025 strategic and financial goals as we remain focused on moving at the speed of the consumer to drive sustainable growth across our brands for years to come.\nNow turning to highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. In the first quarter, we advanced our strategic initiatives, which fueled top line gains of 4% on a constant currency basis. First, we drove growth in our core leather goods offering with a focus on continuing to build equity in key families. Our icons again outperformed as we reinforced these pillars of the assortment through new and exciting platforms to create emotional connections with consumers. Our Willow family continued to resonate with customers and was the #1 family in the quarter. In Tabby, we debuted a seasonal refresh consisting of jewel tone leathers as well as a new version of our signature C. Importantly, we continue to see new introductions reinforce customer demand for the core Tabby style, which remained a top seller globally. And we expanded our Rogue family, which originally debuted in 2016 through a broader, well-balanced timeless offering. In addition, as a unique take on the style, we launched a limited edition Coachies collection, which features the brand's heritage details to create playful characters out of the handbags. The novelty collection was extremely successful, underpinned by an AUR of nearly $800 well above our average.\nDuring the quarter, we also introduced the new and elevated Bandit family, which outperformed expectations globally at higher-than-average AUR. We Importantly, the Bandit crossbody has proven to be a successful recruitment vehicle, specifically with Gen Z customers. The brand's compelling and innovative product assortment fueled a mid-single-digit constant currency increase in global handbag AUR, including an increase in North America as anticipated.\nSecond, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities to drive connections with consumers, leveraging the brand's purpose. At New York Fashion Week, we are excited to announce Lil Nas X as one of our new global brand ambassadors. Our Courage To Be Real campaign, which launched in early October, has resonated with our core customer base and attracted new younger cohorts. The campaign has generated high engagement rates, highlighted by user-generated video content with consumers sharing their own courage to be real stories, igniting a conversation around self-expression across social platforms.\nThird, we drove another quarter of outsized growth in our lifestyle offering, an area of significant opportunity as we know customers that transact across multiple categories have higher lifetime value. In footwear, strong revenue gains were fueled by our new styles, including the Lea loafer and the Lucy sandal, as well as continued momentum in the men's low line sneaker. These options have been successful with both our core customer and younger consumers.\nIn ready-to-wear, our cut and sew assortment featuring our signature C, Rexy and Horse & Carriage continued to resonate with consumers, highlighting the importance and resonance of Coach's iconic brand codes. In men's, our core leather goods families, including Gotham, League, Charter and Hitch continued to drive our results with success in backpack and messenger silhouette, while the traction in our field tote offering showcases the potential of our all gender assortment.\nFourth, we focused on enhancing omnichannel experiences to drive engagement and brand heat, showcasing expressive luxury. We delivered gains in our store business and leaned into experiential brand building through immersive pop-ups across the globe. We debuted our Mint & Surf collaboration through a 360-degree campaign, anchored by a disruptive space in Lower Manhattan aimed at attracting a new and younger audience through partnerships with influencers and interactive programs.\nAnd in Korea, we created a localized pop-up to celebrate Coach's legacy through the lens of a quintessential American neighborhood, featuring an interactive post office, coffee shop and bakery. Additionally, we were excited to launch our first-ever virtual store just last week to kick off the holiday season, a nod to our focus on the omnichannel experience and our test-and-learn agenda. The store was inspired by a nostalgic gift shop and allows guests to move through themed rooms to shop the holiday collection.\nLooking ahead, we're continuing to prioritize long-term brand health and remain disciplined in our approach to discounting amid an increasingly promotional environment. To this end, this holiday, we're focused on winning with consumers through emotional product and storytelling, including impactful visual installations in stores.\nSpecifically, we will offer innovation across the assortment, including the relaunch of Demi, a classic icon from the brand's archive, as well as differentiated capsule collections and collaboration. And we're building on the momentum of the recent launch of the Courage To Be Real campaign. Coach's holiday marketing is inspired by its unique heritage and purpose, and highlights the timelessness of the brand in a fun and joyful way. Our campaigns will feature our global ambassadors and will be amplified with high-impact placements, notably on social channels such as YouTube and TikTok.\nIn closing, Coach is an iconic brand, and we are committed to continuing to grow in a healthy, sustainable way. In its next chapter, we are bringing expressive luxury to life to engage with the modern consumer through emotional brand storytelling and product innovation that allows for self-expression. We believe this builds on our recent momentum and the best of Coach's past while taking the brand to new heights in the future.\nNow moving to Kate Spade, in the first quarter, revenue rose 10% in constant currency, led by a 7% gain in North America and 23% growth in international markets. Overall, we're harnessing the power of the brand to fuel multifaceted growth by focusing on 3 priorities: becoming more emotional, more lifestyle and more global. During the quarter, we made progress against these strategic priorities. First, we continued to amplify our key handbag platforms while simultaneously launching emotional newness. We saw continued traction in our #1 Knott collection. In addition, new platforms such as the Katy family resonated with both new and existing customers and outperformed expectations. Looking ahead, we're continuing to build out these platforms as we create iconic families for the brand. At the same time, we introduced new on-trend handbags, including exciting fashion shapes, such as Boxxy. Importantly, this style was a recruitment driver, bringing younger, more diverse customers to the brand.\nWithin our novelty assortment, which remains a unique and differentiating factor for Kate Spade, we launched Lady Leopard, an elevated yet highly wearable offering that performed well globally. In fact, the Lady Leopard tote was a top-performing style during the quarter with an AUR of well over $400. Together, the success of our product offering supported the brand's handbag AUR growth of low single digits at constant currency, including gains in North America.\nSecond, we expressed the unique world of Kate Spade through distinctive storytelling and engaging campaigns to fuel brand heat. Our fall campaign was centered on our townhouse team and featured local activations showcasing the full lifestyle offering of the brand. We also experimented with our first foray into the Metaverse with our digital townhouse. In addition, we are excited by our return to New York Fashion Week in September to debut our upcoming spring/summer collection amid a wide array of female influencers that embody the brand's purpose. And we continue to increase our reach on social channels, focusing on the younger audience through platforms such as TikTok, Pinterest and YouTube.\nThird, we built on the strong foundation of our lifestyle positioning and delivered high single-digit growth across ready-to-wear footwear and jewelry. As we've shared previously, these categories fostered deeper connections with customers supporting higher lifetime value and global expansion. To this end, growth in lifestyle contributed Kate Spade's increase in average customer spend in North America.\nFourth, we delivered growth in North America while fueling significant sales growth internationally in keeping with our long-term goal of expanding the brand's global reach. To drive brand awareness and increase engagement in key regions, we hosted localized and relevant events to bring our fall townhouse campaign to life. For example, at our Ginza store in Japan, we created an immersive pop-up highlighted by live music, well-being discussions and flower arranging workshops. And just last month, we launched a new store design concept in Singapore. The environment is elevated and luxurious, while at the same time, warm and inviting, a representation of the brand. The initial performance has been strong, and we intend to leverage this format for our new store openings going forward.\nLooking to holiday, we will connect with consumers by leading with a motion in everything we do. We're continuing to build iconic handbag styles with the expansion of key families, including the best-selling Knott collection and the new Katy family, as well as the introduction of Gramercy, an elevated core platform, which will include a (inaudible) monogram. We're also offering emotional newness within novelty, including a Zebra animal print and playful candy theme styles. And we'll continue to fuel lifestyle with an emphasis on jewelry, footwear and ready-to-wear, capitalizing on our recent success.\nTo amplify our compelling product offering, we're continuing to lean into emotional storytelling. We just launched our Have A ball marketing campaign, which reinforces Kate Spade's Joy Colors Life mantra and a celebratory spirit to drive gifting and self-gifting. We're also focused on driving engagement with consumers across channels in new ways. For example, in key cities, we're bringing local influencers together with our store associates to co-create content, highlighting a full range of products. Further, Kate Spade store associates will be live streaming on our e-commerce site throughout the season to showcase our collections and offer gifting ideas, underscoring our focus on delivering innovative omnichannel experiences.\nOverall, we remain confident in the significant long-term runway ahead and are committed to investing in brand building activities that further unlock the power of the Kate Spade brand and community. Importantly, we've made meaningful progress over the last 2 years, and we have the right strategy in place to take us into the future to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth over our planning horizon.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. We delivered growth in North America, aided by strength in the wholesale channel, while pressure remained in the highly penetrated Greater China region given COVID headwind. Importantly, we made progress on our strategy to win with heat to drive brand awareness and growth. First, we sparked consumer desire with high emotion product and a compelling assortment as we lean into our authority in occasion wear and build on our casual foundation. Recent introductions continue to resonate with our consumer base, specifically wear to work styles as we capitalize on the shifting needs within the market. The Stuart family, which was launched earlier in the calendar year is quickly becoming a staple within our offering. This collection of pumps and boots drove 15% of sales and was a favorite among both new and existing customers. At the same time, the recently introduced Soho loafer delivers outsized growth.\nThrough our elevated assortment, coupled with price increases and a significant pullback in promotional activity, the brand delivered another quarter of AUR gains at constant currency, rising slightly versus the prior year on a global basis and high single digits in North America.\nSecond, we focused on strengthening wholesale partnerships and an increasing visibility of the brand for consumers. We've created disruptive activations, including pop-ups with key accounts and online takeovers. Additionally, we've improved placement within high-end wholesale locations, highlighted by a shoe floor takeover at the New York City Nordstrom in September, which well outperformed expectations.\nThird, we created brand heat through impactful marketing campaigns, highlighted by the launch of our new purpose new visual identity and new ambassador in September. At the end of the quarter, we kickstarted brand heat with the debut of Kim Kardashian as the global brand ambassador, as we amplify Stuart Weitzman's purpose to celebrate women who stand strong. We were pleased to be listed in the best campaigns of the season by both Elle and Harper's Bazaar, as we diversified the placement of the announcement across social channels and out-of-home imagery across key global cities, including New York City, Los Angeles, London and Milan.\nLooking to Holiday at Stuart Weitzman, we're focused on our strategy to win with heat to execute in a rapidly changing environment.

Importantly, our foundation is solid, and our strategic direction is clear. We remain focused on successfully navigating near-term headwinds, staying agile and close to consumers while advancing our long-term growth initiatives. We see significant opportunity ahead to drive meaningful, sustainable growth and value for all stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '23 outlook. Scott?\n\n>>Scott Roe - CFO\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results in the face of a volatile backdrop as we focused on the factors within our control. In the first quarter, we achieved record revenue of $1.5 billion despite FX headwinds and COVID disruption in China and grew earnings per share at 8% against last year, excluding $0.10 of currency pressure. At the same time, we returned $175 million to shareholders demonstrating our commitment to enhancing long-term value.\nTurning to the details of the quarter, starting with revenue, which will be shared on a constant currency basis, sales rose over 5% led by international, delivering 11% growth versus prior year, which was ahead of our expectations. We achieved strong growth in APAC, which rose 9% versus prior year despite COVID-related headwinds in Greater China. In Japan, revenue increased 16%, while Other Asia grew over 135% with notable strength in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia and New Zealand. These trends were driven by a pickup in store traffic as we anniversary last year's pandemic-related headwinds.\nIn Europe, sales increased 24%, fueled by higher international tourist traffic, notably from the Middle East and within Europe, as well as continued growth with local customers. For Greater China, sales declined 11% data COVID related headwinds, though improved meaningfully on a sequential basis from the 32% decrease reported in Q4. However, as we enter our second quarter, trends softened due to the further lockdowns and business disruption. As a result, we have tempered our fiscal year '23 outlook based on the expectation for a delayed recovery in China, which I'll touch on shortly.\nTurning to North America, sales rose slightly versus prior year, representing an increase of nearly 45% on a 2-year basis. By channel, we delivered low single-digit gains in our direct business, which included a high single-digit increase in stores fueled by the return of traffic and a high single-digit decline in digital, given the combination of lapping last year's strong gains as well as a consumer shift to shopping in store. To that point, on a 2-year basis, digital sales rose over 35% and remained over 3x ahead of our fiscal year '19 prepandemic levels. For wholesale, revenue increased over 20% compared to the prior year, partially aided by approximately $15 million of earlier-than-expected shipments across key accounts globally.\nMoving down the P&L. As expected, gross margin declined due to incremental freight pressure of 130 basis points and FX headwinds of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, our results included a negative impact from mix due to a lower penetration of the high-margin China business, as well as a higher penetration of wholesale impacted by timing. Outside of these factors, our operational gross margin expanded versus prior year.\nSG&A grew 5% versus last year, reflecting an increase in marketing as we continue to invest in brand-building activities along with planned investments in our operating platform. Compared to our expectations, expenses were largely in line with plan and included a slight timing benefit with the second quarter. Taken together, operating income was in line with our expectations, while EPS outperformed. The primary contributors were a $0.05 benefit related to timing with the second quarter as well as a $0.03 tailwind from a favorable tax rate, which offset incremental FX headwinds of $0.03 in the quarter.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows, as expected, we ended the quarter with $557 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.68 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $198 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $45 million. As anticipated, inventory at quarter end was 39% above prior year, including an increase in in-transit of nearly 50%, impacted by longer lead times.\nOverall, we are pleased with the makeup of our current inventory, which is highly penetrated in core and seasonless styles. We are well positioned into holiday and continue to expect to end fiscal year '23 with inventory up single digits compared to the prior year as we've taken proactive measures to align our second half inventory receipt plans with our updated revenue outlook.\nMoving to our capital allocation priorities. We continue to plan for approximately $1 billion in shareholder returns in fiscal 2023 which includes share repurchases of $700 million, including $100 million bought back in the first quarter as planned, and dividend payments totaling approximately $300 million. This is based on an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share, which represents a 20% increase over the prior year. Overall, our priorities are unchanged and consistent with what we outlined at our recent Investor Day. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the future, we believe our platform is scalable and would evaluate M&A that is accretive to our organic TSR opportunity.\nNow moving to our outlook for fiscal 2023, we are updating our full year earnings outlook to reflect a $0.20 FX headwind from further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a currency-neutral basis, our EPS guidance is unchanged, but reflects our latest thinking across 3 areas of the business. First, we've incorporated a more modest revenue outlook in North America and Greater China, partially offset by momentum in Other Asia and Europe. Second, we're planning for an additional SG&A savings through proactive expense management and variable expense reductions. And third, we expect a favorable tax rate for the fiscal year. Our ability to maintain our earnings outlook on a currency-neutral basis despite the volatile external environment highlights the resiliency and agility of Tapestry's operating model.\nSo let's run through the details of our outlook. For the fiscal year, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 4%. On a reported basis, we anticipate sales to be in the area of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion, which represents a slight decline compared to the prior year, including roughly 450 basis points of FX headwinds.\nTouching on details by region at constant currency, in North America, our guidance contemplates low single-digit declines throughout the balance of the year, in line with the Q1 trend for our direct business. In Greater China, while we continue to expect growth for the fiscal year, we now anticipate a delay in the recovery compared to our prior assumption. In Japan and Europe, we expect low double-digit gains, while Other Asia contemplates growth of over 30%. In addition, we anticipate a year-over-year operating margin decline of over 70 basis points which now incorporates the expectation for FX pressure of roughly 120 basis points compared to our prior outlook for 100 basis points of impact. We expect the majority of this FX headwind to flow through the gross margin line. This contemplates gross margin relatively in line with to slightly below prior year, reflecting the benefit of moderating freight costs as well as AUR increases across all brands. We expect these tailwinds to be offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials, as well as the negative impact of FX, as mentioned.\nOn SG&A expenses, we anticipate modest deleverage for the year, reflecting continued investments in growth drivers, including in digital and the planned 2023 opening of our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas partially offset by proactive actions we're taking to reduce our expense base, as mentioned previously.\nMoving to below the line items, net interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $30 million to $35 million, a significant decline versus fiscal year '22, reflecting the benefit of our recently executed cross-currency swap agreements. Tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This represents an increase against last year, primarily due to the anticipated geographic mix of earnings. Weighted average diluted share count is expected to be in the area of 242 million shares. This reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases expected in the fiscal year as noted. So taken together, we project EPS of $3.60 to $3.70, representing mid-single-digit growth compared to the prior year, which includes a year-over-year currency headwind of approximately $0.50.\nFinally, we continue to forecast CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $325 million. We anticipate approximately half of the spend to be related to new stores and renovations primarily in China, with the balance dedicated to our ongoing digital and IT initiatives, including investment related to our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.\nAs previously outlined, given the volatile environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we continue to expect significant variability by quarter. Specifically, we expect revenue and earnings growth to be back half weighted, helped by the planned return to growth in Greater China beginning in the third quarter. In addition, we will anniversary the substantial incremental headwinds from freight beginning in the second quarter, providing a tailwind to margin.\nFor the second quarter in total, we expect revenue to decline low single digits in constant currency, which includes Greater China sales to be in the area of 10% below prior year, largely consistent with the Q1 trend. On a reported basis, we anticipate global sales to be down mid-single digits compared to prior year, including the negative impact of approximately 450 basis points from FX. We expect EPS of approximately $1.25, which includes a currency headwind of approximately $0.15 versus last year, as well as the previously mentioned timing impact with Q1 of $0.05.\nSo in closing, we delivered first quarter results ahead of expectations and maintained our earnings outlook for the year, excluding the impact of currency. This is a testament to the resilience of the categories where we play, the strength of our brands, the benefits of our transformed globally diversified business model and our talented teams around the world I.\nmportantly, we remain on track to return $1 billion in cash to shareholders in fiscal year '23, consistent with our prior outlook. As we look forward, we are focused on successfully navigating near-term volatility while delivering against long-term strategies as outlined in our recent Investor Day.\nAnd now I'd like to open it up to your questions."

Crevoiserat\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. We drove standout results this fiscal year, delivering accelerated revenue and profit growth across our portfolio, a direct reflection of the vibrancy of our brands and the agility and ingenuity of our talented teams around the world.\nOur performance also demonstrates both our competitive advantages as well as the success of our strategic growth agenda, which we developed nearly 3 years ago to radically transform our organization to compete and win in a new world of retail. This meant changing the way we worked, adopting a more consumer-centric mindset and utilizing our data-rich platform to acquire new consumers and better connect with our existing customers.\nAt the same time, our ambition required a commitment to leading in digital to complement our world-class store operations, recognizing the increasing importance of the omnichannel journey. We also embraced the need to fundamentally pivot, driving efficiencies in many areas of the business to support brand building and high-return investments.\nOverall, we had to be more agile while doubling down on the innovation we bring to consumers at every touch point of our brands. As we crystallized our vision, which we actually named the Acceleration Program, we could have never predicted the ways the external environment would change with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this profoundly altered the world around us, it reaffirmed our strategic direction. And with consistent execution, we emerged a stronger company.\nThrough an unwavering focus on the consumer, we acquired 15 million new customers in North America alone over the last 24 months, including approximately 7.7 million new customers in fiscal '22. Importantly, we have seen these new customers transact at higher AURs and they have returned to the brands with higher frequency. At the same time, we've increased retention rates and continued to reactivate lapsed customers across brands, all of which has led to more active customers engaging with our brands at higher average spend.\nNext, we fueled significant growth in digital, which reached $2 billion in sales at accretive margins in fiscal '22, more than triple fiscal '19 levels. We see runway ahead to further increase our e-commerce sales, leveraging our established capabilities online. In addition, we grew AUR, highlighting the strength of our brands and the increasing traction of our product offerings through innovation and craftsmanship. This growth was also supported by a 40% to 50% reduction in SKU counts and a significant pullback in promotions as we utilize data and analytics to enhance our go-to-market strategies.\nOverall, these accomplishments contributed to Tapestry reaching record annual revenue of $6.7 billion in the fiscal year. This performance underscores the power of our globally diversified business model in the face of a challenging backdrop. In the back half of our fiscal year, while our operations in China were materially impacted by COVID-related disruptions, outperformance throughout the rest of the world led by North America, drove strong top line growth.\nOur results for the year were also fueled by gains across our portfolio with each brand delivering double-digit sales increases in the fiscal year. And we achieved accelerated growth versus fiscal '19 despite facing meaningful supply chain headwinds that required us to adapt to meet growing demand for our brands.\nAt the same time, we have transformed our business model, realizing $300 million in run rate expense savings, which helped to fund our growth initiatives, including a significant step up in brand marketing, which reached 8% of sales, doubling from fiscal '19. Overall, we drove earnings growth 35% ahead of pre-pandemic levels, and we utilized our robust free cash flow generation to return $1.9 billion to shareholders in fiscal '22 alone.\nImportantly, we also made significant progress on many of our corporate responsibility commitments in fiscal year '22. We took bold actions through our newly created Tapestry Foundation, becoming a founding partner of FIT's Social Justice Center and establishing a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to launch a pioneering leather traceability program in Brazil. In addition, we hired our first Chief Inclusion and Social Impact Officer, and we were a signatory of the Open to All's Mitigate Racial Bias in Retail Charter, underscoring our commitment to build a company that's equitable, inclusive and diverse.\nOverall, we've made tremendous strides forward under our Acceleration Program. I'm confident in the foundation we've built, which positions us to continue to be agile in an ever-changing environment as we remain focused on moving at the speed of the consumer to drive sustainable growth across our brands for years to come.\nNow turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. In fiscal year '22, we delivered 18% top line growth or an increase of 15% over fiscal '19 pre-pandemic levels, as we recruited over 4 million new customers in North America while driving momentum with our existing customers. Importantly, we achieved this while delivering strong operating margin of 30%. This speaks to the heightened level of innovation we're bringing to consumers, underpinned by consistent execution and reinforcing Coach's significant potential ahead.\nFor the fourth quarter, we achieved a sales increase of 8% compared to prior year, including 14% growth in North America by advancing our strategic initiatives. First, we delivered a focused and compelling product assortment across categories. Our core families of Tabby, Willow, Rogue and Field, which have become pillars of our assortment, continued to resonate with consumers as we fuel innovation to maintain the relevance and emotional appeal.\nIn Rogue, we added new shapes, including a classic top handle handbag, as well as options in our seasonal platforms. For Tabby, the collection continues to outperform expectations, including our core women's offering and the family's recent expansion into men's with the soft messenger gaining momentum.\nIn addition to the Tabby expansion in men's, we delivered outsized gains overall in the men's category as well as across our lifestyle assortment, specifically footwear. Going forward, these will be important growth vehicles for Coach by increasing brand heat and top line momentum to drive customer recruitment, purchase frequency and overall basket size.\nTouching on AUR. While we delivered an increase for the year, we saw pressure in the fourth quarter, primarily due to geographic mix headwinds. In North America, handbag AUR remained approximately 40% ahead of fiscal '19 pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the third quarter, though declined slightly versus prior year. Importantly, we remain confident in Coach's pricing power going forward and see further AUR opportunity in fiscal '23 helped in part by broad ticket increases, which began in August.\nSecond, we continue to infused data into our decision-making to ensure we're meeting the needs of the consumer while driving efficiencies in our go-to-market strategies. To this point, through product and concept testing as well as predictive analytics, we delivered a more focused and compelling assortment to consumers, resulting in higher sell-throughs and increased SKU productivity.\nThird, we strengthened our consumer outreach to emotionally appeal to customers and drive engagement. Throughout the quarter, we utilized multilayer influencer strategies to amplify our offering and enhance our marketing campaigns, including on social platforms such as TikTok.\nOverall, we've driven stronger customer metrics, including the acquisition of approximately 1 million new customers transacting in our North America channels. In fact, over the course of the acceleration program, Coach recruited over 8 million new customers, which included a higher penetration of millennial and Gen Z customers. Importantly, during this timeframe, we've continued to engage with our existing customers while increasing both overall spend per customer and purchase frequency.\nFourth, we invested in our digital business, which led to a low double-digit revenue increase in the quarter. As of fiscal year-end, e-commerce represented nearly 30% of sales for the brand, a material increase compared to the high single-digit penetration pre-pandemic.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year '23, we are capitalizing on the foundational changes we've made and are advancing our agenda to drive continued growth at the brand. Specifically, we will focus on expanding our customer reach and increasing lifetime value by recruiting new customers with a particular focus on younger audiences while increasing overall purchase frequency and retention rates.\nWe will drive growth in our core leather goods [offering], continuing to build equity in iconic families, accelerate gains in men's and lifestyle categories, notably footwear and ready-to-wear, where we've been delivering outsized growth, invest in digital and China long-term, high-growth opportunities for the brand, and translate and infuse Coach's narrative into messaging across consumer touch points to reinforce our brand purpose.\nIn closing, Coach is an iconic brand with significant runway ahead as we continue to create deeper connectivity with consumers through innovative product, emotional storytelling and a purpose-led agenda that together, creates a virtuous flywheel for customer engagement. Our success over this past fiscal year, highlighted by a significant acceleration in sales at strong margins, underscores our confidence in the brand and its meaningful opportunity for long-term, sustainable growth.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. The brand delivered record revenue of over $1.4 billion in the fiscal year, representing growth of 22%, while expanding operating margin. Throughout the year, our team has been laser-focused on rebuilding the brand's foundation and clarifying our purpose. We have delivered consistent results, a testament to our strong team, the solid execution of our strategic actions and the increasing traction and unique positioning of our brand. In fact, over the past year, in North America, we acquired over 3 million new customers, reactivated nearly 1.5 million lapsed customers and drove low double-digit growth in average customer spend.\nBriefly touching on highlights from the fourth quarter, Kate Spade outperformed expectations on both the top and bottom line, reflecting progress against our growth strategies. First, we amplified key handbag platforms as we continue to build and innovate our product, infusing newness across the assortment.\nKnott, our core family and #1 collection again fueled the quarter's performance, delivering strength across the offering, most notably the crossbody option, which was launched last quarter. In addition, fashion shapes, such as the Manhattan Tote and the recently introduced top handle [Merang] outpaced our expectations.\nNovelty remains an important asset, a unique and differentiating factor for the brand that plays a key role in our storytelling culture. In fact, the newest novelty collections once again delivered strong sell-throughs at well above overall AUR. Importantly, the traction of our core, new introductions and novelty offering, coupled with a pullback in promotional activity, drove a low double-digit increase in global handbag AUR.\nSecond, we drove brand heat by engaging the consumer through emotional storytelling and a community-driven approach. Our Cabana capsule acted as an engagement engine as well as an opportunity to test product drops and build best practices.\nTo amplify the campaign, we launched a series of pop-ups in key cities, including New York, London and Kuala Lumpur. These locations evoke the color and joy that Kate Spade is known for, leading to new customer acquisition with over 50% of purchases made at the pop-ups from new customers. At the same time, our Kate Spade New York Cabana hashtag challenge on TikTok, which boasted a wide cast of influencers, well outpaced expectations, garnering 8 billion views since launch.\nThird, we're utilizing data to maintain a consumer-centric approach and gain a deeper understanding of the preferences and drivers of customer purchases. For example, we've seen our mini and micro shapes drive recruitment of new customers, while fashion shapes and novelty resonate with our existing customer base. This knowledge comes into play as we develop our assortment architecture and targeted marketing campaigns.\nOur focus on consumer centricity is highlighted by strong customer metrics. In North America, we drove an increase in the number of active customers, driven by reactivating lapsed customers and reengaging our existing customer base. At the same time, we recruited over 700,000 new customers to the brand in the quarter.\nFourth, we built on the strong foundation of our lifestyle positioning and delivered double-digit growth across ready-to-wear, footwear and jewelry. We're offering innovative and distinctive product in these categories, which emotionally connects consumers to our Kate Spade stories and the brand's DNA. Ultimately, these categories foster deeper connections with consumers, supporting higher lifetime value and global expansion.\nAnd fifth, we have continued to invest in our digital business as we test innovative ways to engage with consumers online, including an expanded use of influencers. Overall, we've made significant progress building out this channel. In fact, Kate Spade's digital revenue represented 1/3 of total sales, well ahead of the brand's 20% penetration just 3 years ago.\nOverall, Kate Spade is entering fiscal '23 with momentum. Our intent for this fiscal year is to connect more deeply with our community, leaning into the power of our brand to drive global growth.\nTo accomplish this, we will deliver a distinctive leather goods offering, capitalizing on the brand's unique positioning within the market and continue to drive higher AUR; accelerate lifestyle, focusing on jewelry, footwear and ready-to-wear; drive customer lifetime value by continuing to reactivate, engage existing customers while recruiting younger, more diverse customers; and fuel the emotional power of the Kate Spade brand and community through marketing that amplifies its unique positioning and universally relevant purpose.\nOur success at Kate Spade is a direct reflection of the power of customer centricity and commitment to brand building. Through a focus on what differentiates the brand in the eyes of the consumer, including its lifestyle offering and community engagement through storytelling, we're resonating with new and existing customers, driving higher AUR and increasing our traction internationally. We are increasingly confident in the brand's opportunity to achieve $2 billion in revenue and a high-teens operating margin over our planning horizon.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. Throughout fiscal '22, the brand maintained a focused strategy to drive growth, improving execution while remaining nimble to foster increasing consumer demand. The success of these actions resulted in double-digit sales gains for the fiscal year and a return to profitability despite managing through challenging external dynamics, notably COVID-related pressures in China.\nIn the fourth quarter, Stuart Weitzman continued to advance its growth strategies. First, we improved profitability as we leaned into strength in North America, which helped to offset the pressures in China. Despite headwinds in the margin-accretive China region, we delivered operating margin improvement compared to the prior year and above our forecast in the quarter.\nSecond, we maintained a consumer-centric strategy as we delivered a compelling and trend-right offering for our customers, leveraging data and analytics. Sandals were a key category as we capitalized on the increased consumer need for occasion wear. This included a standout performance from our iconic Nudist collection, which accounted for 5 of our top 10 styles.\nAt the same time, we increased product relevancy through newer introductions, which continue to see traction. In fact, our versatile Stuart pump, which has resonated for return to work, will be featured as a new family in fiscal '23, given the style's outperformance.\nOur streamlined and relevant offering, coupled with lower promotional activity and the benefit of price increases, drove AUR growth of over 20% in North America. Going forward, we see continued opportunity to increase prices and drive full price selling while maintaining our positioning within the overall market.\nThird, our engaging messaging helped to recruit new customers while continuing to reengage and reactivate clients. Fourth, we accelerated our wholesale partnerships and expanded the brand's footprint in key accounts across the globe.\nFifth, and finally, we continue to invest in digital, resulting in nearly 20% sales growth. For the fiscal year, digital represented over 20% of revenue, which while a significant increase from a low double-digit penetration pre-pandemic, highlights the significant opportunity to continue to grow our e-commerce business.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '23, Stuart Weitzman's focus is to fuel continued momentum through innovation across all customer touch points with the brand. Specifically, we will spark desire with high emotion product, leaning into our authority on occasion wear and building on our casual foundation; drive brand awareness through impactful marketing campaigns; accelerate China while continuing to grow North America; increased digital revenue by continuing the online experience; and further improve profitability through a focus on high-margin growth opportunities as well as increased store productivity.\nOverall, we believe these are the right strategic priorities to build brand awareness, grow market share and position the brand for continued profitable growth.\nIn closing, our results underscore the power of our brand, the strength of our teams and the success of our strategic actions. In addition, this performance highlights the attractive and durable nature of our categories, which have proven resilient over time, given both the emotional and functional needs they fulfill for consumers.\nAs we embark on a new fiscal year, the environment remains challenging and continues to rapidly evolve. However, the foundation we've built positions us to be nimble and responsive to change, balancing near-term headwinds with our long-term ambition.\nImportantly, we see significant runway ahead as we harness our unique combination of authentic brands amplified by an agile and data-rich operating model. This has supported our significant acceleration over the last 3 years and is key to our ongoing success as we focus on powering our iconic brands to move with the speed of the consumer.\nOverall, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term, sustainable growth and look forward to sharing the details of our financial and strategic road map at our Investor Day in September.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '23 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nCFO & COO, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at fiscal year '22, we delivered strong results in the face of a volatile backdrop as we focused on the factors within our control. We have fundamentally transformed the company, creating a solid foundation that enables investment in high-return initiatives to fuel a sustainable top and bottom line growth.\nThis year, we delivered a record $6.7 billion in revenue; grew earnings per share 20% against last year and 35% versus pre-pandemic levels; and we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, demonstrating our strong cash flow generation, confidence in the future and our commitment to enhancing value for all stakeholders.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. Our results capped a strong year. Revenue rose 9% in constant currency or 7% on a reported basis. By region, North America again drove the results in the quarter, delivering a sales increase of 12%. Revenue in Greater China was pressured as anticipated due to headwinds associated with the pandemic, including lockdowns in major cities. As such, sales declined 32% versus last year due entirely to the pullback in store traffic as digital trends in the region rose 10% compared to the prior year.\nImportantly, overall trends in Greater China improved modestly throughout the quarter and into fiscal '23. In Japan, on a year-over-year basis, sales trends accelerated meaningfully compared to the prior quarter, increasing over 25% on a constant currency basis or approximately 10% on a nominal basis.\nFor Europe, sales rose approximately 65% against last year with strength in both stores and online. While 1-year trends in Japan and Europe have improved significantly due to the anniversary of last year's pandemic-related headwinds as well as strong traction with domestic consumers, revenue in both regions remained below fiscal '19 pre-pandemic levels.\nAcross the balance of Asia, trends again accelerated sequentially on a 1-year basis, rising nearly 60%, driven by Malaysia and Singapore. By channel, sales in the margin-accretive digital channel rose high single digits in the quarter, while stores and wholesale saw continued growth.\nMoving down the P&L, as expected, gross margin declined in the quarter given the incremental freight expense of $36 million, representing approximately 215 basis points of pressure as well as unfavorable geographic mix from the lower penetration of high-margin China business. That said, performance of our underlying business remains strong, and we continue to utilize data to better understand and meet the needs of our consumers while simultaneously lowering overall promotional activity.\nSG&A was slightly above the prior year and better than our expectations. Even excluding the anniversary of a $25 million contribution towards the endowment of the Tapestry Foundation last year, we improved our SG&A rate, reflecting leverage across the expense base. Taken together, operating income was largely in line with our expectations and 7% above last year. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.78, 20% ahead of last year and nearly 30% above FY '19 pre-pandemic levels.\nSo now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $953 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.69 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolver.\nFree cash flow for the fiscal year was an inflow of $759 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $162 million. CapEx for the year came in favorable to our expectations and included a timing shift of approximately $35 million into FY '23 due to shifts in projects mostly in Asia.\nInventory was up 35% at year-end, including an increase in in-transits of over 50% impacted by longer lead times. Overall, we're pleased with the makeup of our current inventory, which is highly penetrated in core styles. We expect inventory to end fiscal '23 up single digits versus the prior year.\nMoving to our capital allocation priorities. In fiscal '22, we returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders. That was led by $1.6 billion in share repurchases, which is over $1 billion ahead of our original guidance for $500 million. The incremental buyback was supported by our significant free cash flow generation as well as our strong liquidity position as we emerge from the acute pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal '21 with a more conservative cash position.\nTherefore, the momentum we drove in our business and our confidence in the future allowed us to return to more normalized cash balances by the end of fiscal '22. In addition, we returned $264 million to shareholders through our dividend program.\nNow looking forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term, profitable growth; and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Therefore, in fiscal 2023, we're planning approximately $1 billion in shareholder returns, primarily through share repurchases of $700 million under our existing $1.5 billion authorization.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, bringing our anticipated annual dividend rate to $1.20 per share. We remain committed to increasing our dividend over time at a rate faster than earnings growth.\nNow moving to our outlook for fiscal 2023. We're entering '23 with a number of tailwinds. We operate in high-margin categories, which have proven to be durable and resilient. We have strength and pricing power at each of our brands, underscored by the gains we've made throughout the Acceleration Program, and margins will benefit from a reduction in incremental levels of air freight versus the prior year.\nThat said, our eyes are wide open, and we're not immune to headwinds that exist in our space: the appreciation of the U.S. dollar; ongoing COVID-related disruption in China; soft consumer sentiment compared to historical averages in the U.S.; and ongoing cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. In times like these, we're leveraging our established capabilities and leaning into our competitive advantages while investing in our brands to drive growth over the long term.\nFor the fiscal year, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 6% to 7%. On a reported basis, we anticipate revenue in the area of $6.9 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 4% and includes roughly 300 basis points of FX headwinds from the significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar.\nOur guidance assumes balanced growth with all brands and channels contributing to constant currency top line gains for the year. By region at constant currency, this contemplates low to mid-single-digit growth throughout the year in North America and a gradual recovery in Greater China resulting in growth for the fiscal year as well as double-digit gains in Japan and Europe.\nIn addition, we anticipate a year-over-year operating margin decline in the area of 50 basis points, due entirely to FX headwinds of roughly 100 basis points. This contemplates gross margin relatively in line with the prior year, reflecting the benefit of moderating freight costs as well as AUR increases across all brands. We expect these tailwinds to be partially offset by the previously anticipated rising input costs for materials as well as the negative impact of FX. On SG&A, we anticipate modest deleverage for the year, reflecting continued investments in growth drivers, including digital and the planned 2023 opening of our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.\nMoving to below line items. Net interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $35 million, a significant decline versus fiscal '22, reflecting the benefit of our recently executed cross-currency swap arrangements. Tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. This represents an increase against last year, primarily due to the anticipated geographic mix of earnings.\nWeighted average diluted share count is expected to be in the area of 242 million shares. This reflects approximately $700 million in share repurchases expected for the fiscal year as noted. So taken together, we expect EPS of $3.80 to $3.90, representing double-digit growth compared to the prior year.\nFinally, CapEx and cloud computing costs are forecasted to be in the area of $325 million, including the previously mentioned $35 million shift from fiscal '22. We anticipate approximately half of the spend to be related to new stores and renovations, primarily in China, with the balance dedicated to our ongoing digital and IT initiatives and investments related to our new fulfillment center in Las Vegas.\nGiven the volatile environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we again expect significant variability by quarter. Specifically, we expect revenue and earnings growth versus prior year to be back half weighted, helped by the sequential improvement planned in China as we move throughout the year. In addition, we will anniversary the substantial incremental headwinds from freight beginning in the second fiscal quarter of the year, providing a tailwind to margin.\nFor the first quarter, we expect revenue to increase mid-single digits in constant currency, which included a decline of approximately 15% projected in Greater China. On a reported basis, we anticipate global sales to increase slightly, including a negative impact of approximately 350 basis points from FX with EPS in the area of $0.75.\nIn closing, we delivered strong results in fiscal '22 with 18% top line growth driving record annual sales. EPS increased 20% versus prior year and 35% over pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders. This is a testament to the resilience of the categories where we play, the strength of our brands, the benefits of our transformed globally diversified business model and our talented teams around the world who continue to drive our strong performance.\nAs we look forward, we remain confident in our trajectory and disciplined in our approach to driving long-term sustainable growth and total shareholder return.\nAnd now I'll open it up for your questions."

Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions).\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations, Christina Colone.\n\nChristina Colone\n\nGlobal Head of IR, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us.

Joanne will begin with third quarter highlights for Tapestry and our brands. Scott will continue with our financial results, capital allocation priorities and outlook going forward. Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session, where we will be joined by Todd Kahn, CEO and Brand President of Coach. After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks.\nI'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\n\nJoanne C. Crevoiserat\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone.\nOur third quarter results were well ahead of our expectations, despite the challenging environment. We drove increased customer demand across our portfolio, resulting in double-digit top line growth at Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, and EPS well ahead of our outlook. Our continued outperformance demonstrates the vibrancy of our brands, the power of our digitally-enabled platform and the successful execution of our strategy by our talented teams around the world.\nImportantly, our progress reinforces the significant runway we have ahead of us as we harness our unique blend of magic and logic. The combination of iconic brands amplified by an agile and data-rich operating model creates tremendous opportunity.\nOur brands are at the heart of our company. They occupy distinctive positions in the attractive and resilient accessories market. Each has a rich heritage and substantial potential for growth. This is evidenced by the strengthening brand heat we're seeing through meaningful new customer acquisitions as well as growth with existing customers across our portfolio. We are focused on building lasting relationships with our customers to increase lifetime value through continuous innovation in both our product and the experiences we offer throughout the purchase journey.\nThe opportunities for our brands are enhanced by our platform, which has been transformed to power them to move at the speed of the consumer. We are leaning into our digital leadership, meeting consumers where they want to shop and providing exceptional experiences when they get there. We're also leveraging our rich consumer data and sophisticated analytics to establish and enrich our customer connections, augmenting our creative processes with a deep understanding of our customers, while bringing faster and more consistent execution to bear.\nThe benefits of investments in digital and data analytics are highlighted by our results over the last 2 years, and we're still in early innings in terms of unlocking this potential. Our platform also affords the benefits of scale, shared learnings and talent mobility. These advantages are increasingly important in today's rapidly evolving landscape and allow us to have a greater positive impact on our customers, our people and the world at large.\nBefore moving to our recent highlights, I want to recognize those that are being impacted by conflict in Ukraine and by the ongoing ravages of COVID-19 in China and elsewhere. Our hearts go out to them during this turbulent time.\nNow turning to Tapestry's performance in the third quarter. First, we maintained a consumer-centric lens by leveraging the magic of our brands and our powerful customer data and analytics capabilities to drive improvements in key customer metrics. We acquired over 1.4 million new customers, who transacted with our brands across channels in North America, a mid-teens increase compared to the prior year, with continued growth in both stores and [online].\nSince the start of the Acceleration Program 21 months ago, we have brought in nearly 13 million new customers to our brands. Importantly, these customers purchased at higher AURs and have already returned to shop again at a higher frequency than the average. At the same time, we continue to effectively reactivate lapsed customers, while realizing increased average spend, highlighting our focus on driving lifetime value to fuel sustained growth. Overall, the underlying momentum across customer metrics drove our standout performance in North America in the quarter.\nSecond, we continue to lead in digital, driven by the investments we've made in our capabilities online. In the quarter, we delivered sales growth of over 20% in the channel, which represented approximately 30% of our total business. As consumers remain extremely engaged in shopping online, we continue to expect to achieve $2 billion in revenue in digital in fiscal '22 with further runway ahead.\nThird, we continue to see pricing power across the portfolio and realized another quarter of global AUR gains in each brand's core category. Importantly, we have seen no negative impact on customer demand from these price increases, highlighting our value proposition, brand relevance and the increasing traction of our product offering.\nAnd fourth, touching on China, our business was impacted by COVID-related restrictions in the quarter. Although we expect these headwinds to continue in the near term, we remain optimistic given the proven resilience of the Chinese consumer and the long-term opportunity for growth. Overall, brand awareness and handbag purchase intent in China remains high, reflecting the quality of our efforts to build brand equity with Chinese consumers.\nIn summary, we continue to make meaningful progress supported by the Acceleration Program, and we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth going forward.\nI will now touch on third quarter highlights for each of our brands, starting with Coach. We drove another quarter of top and bottom line outperformance, achieving a sales increase of 11% compared to prior year, including a nearly 20% gain in North America. This continued growth reflects our consumer-centric strategy and agile execution and underscores the significant potential ahead for the brand.\nDuring the quarter, Coach continued to advance its strategic initiatives. First, we delivered a focused and compelling product assortment across categories. Our iconic leather goods families are the foundation of our assortment and fuel consistent growth. Tabby, Rogue, Field and Willow were our top-selling groups in the quarter, driving half of retail's handbag revenue. To continue to spark consumer interest, we've animated these families with new colorways, fabrics and embellishments.\nOutside of our core styles, the Studio bag, featuring a push lock C closure, resonated with consumers, while the launch of the new Hero shoulder bag, posting a Horse & Carriage snap closure, outpaced our expectations.\nIn our lifestyle categories, we're driving outsized growth, yet remain underpenetrated versus the market. In both footwear and ready-to-wear, customers are embracing our highly branded pieces, reinforcing Coach's desirability and the incremental commercial opportunities these categories represent currently and over the long term.\nSecond, we continue to build brand awareness within men and delivered over 20% growth in the quarter, led by strength across backpacks, ready-to-wear and footwear. Importantly, given the success, we expect to approach $950 million in revenue this fiscal year, closing in on our near-term target to reach $1 billion in sales.\nThird, our product offering was further enhanced by the use of data, which provides customer insights and analytics to support new, more agile ways of working and higher SKU productivity. Together, this supported a significant pullback in promotions and drove full-price selling, resulting in an increase in global handbag AUR.\nIn North America, handbag AUR rose at a high single-digit pace, marking 12 consecutive quarters of gain. Our momentum and the customer's response to the style and craftsmanship of our product reinforces Coach's pricing power and a further opportunity to increase prices to offset inflationary cost pressures. While we have raised prices selectively over the last quarter, the majority of the benefit will be realized at Coach beginning in fiscal year '23.\nFourth, we drove customer engagement through 360-degree marketing activations. We amplified our spring product introductions on social platforms, notably TikTok, targeting Gen Z and millennial consumers. Additionally, building on the success of the brand's February fashion show, themed Somewhere in America, we created localized, immersive experiences through a collection of pop-ups across the globe, including a Coach laundromat, convenience store and bagel shop. These fun and unexpected venues enabled us to attract new customers and expand the way our brand is perceived.\nWe also emphasized our values through the Coach ReLoved Program, an opportunity to engage with the customer in different ways by offering circular pathways for our products, whether through upcrafting, restoring or remaking. Given the success of the program thus far, we've expanded its reach across our North America retail stores.\nOverall, the combination of these actions drove further improvements in customer metrics, including the acquisition of over 800,000 new customers transacting in North America channels. At the same time, purchase frequency again rose, and we reactivated lapsed customers at an increasing rate.\nFifth and finally, we again drove outsized revenue growth in the digital channel, which rose nearly 25% compared to last year or more than 5x where we were 3 years ago. In the quarter, e-commerce represented nearly 30% of sales.\nIn closing, Coach is consistently building momentum, reflecting the new and innovative ways we're engaging with consumers. Based on our underlying growth, we continue to expect the brand to approach $5 billion in revenue this fiscal year, while maintaining exceptional margins despite the COVID-related challenges we're facing.\nLooking ahead, we have significant runway to drive growth across our product offering by enhancing our leadership position in leather goods and delivering outsized gains in men's and our lifestyle categories. Additionally, we see meaningful long-term potential across high-growth channels and geographies, such as digital and China, given consumer demand and the brand's value proposition. Taken together, we remain confident in Coach's ability to gain market share, given increasing brand heat and the relationships we're fostering with our growing customer base.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. Sales and operating income significantly outperformed expectations once again this quarter. Revenue rose 19%, which included a 25% increase in our North America business. The brand continues to gain momentum as we forge connections with our customers by leaning into Kate Spade's unique positioning within the market. Overall, our strong results year-to-date speak to the relevance and clarity of our brand purpose and underscore that we have the right strategy in place to drive sustainable growth over the long term.\nTurning to progress against our strategic priorities in the third quarter. First, we amplified key platforms as we continue to build and innovate our core product offering, while infusing newness in our novelty platform. Within handbags, success was balanced across our core styles and new introductions. The Knott remained our #1 collection, which we expanded to include a crossbody tote. At the same time, recently launched styles, such as the Carlyle and Avenue, outperformed expectations.\nFurther, we invested in novelty introductions that demonstrate the brand's unique personality and play a key role in storytelling to drive interest and engagement with consumers. This quarter's offering featured handbag shaped as flowers, tennis balls and butterflies. These styles won with our highest-value customers, and they carry AUR well ahead of the average. Importantly, this strong performance as well as deliberate actions to decrease promotional activity and strategically raise prices resulted in nearly 20% global handbag AUR growth.\nSecond, we drove brand heat by engaging the consumer through emotional storytelling and a community-driven approach in keeping with our DNA. Our floral-focused spring campaign reinforced our brand purpose by evoking the color and joy that Kate Spade is known for. We delighted our community with the opening of an experiential Kate Spade townhouse in New York City, which was met with a line of enthusiasts nearly 2 city blocks long. This pop-up embodied the full brand expression as we offer custom experiences pulled from the pages of our new Kate Spade book and also included a preview of our upcoming fall collection.\nDigitally, we increased our reach on social channels, notably TikTok, where we're engaging with a younger and more diverse audience. Importantly, our successful execution of these brand-building activities is underscored by a 3-point sequential increase in brand awareness per surveys hosted in the U.S. by YouGov.\nThird, we strengthened the foundation of our lifestyle positioning through a focused assortment across ready-to-wear, footwear and jewelry. These categories help boost customer acquisition and engagement and they remain an important driver of purchase frequency. Lifestyle currently represents over 20% of total sales. And looking forward, we see opportunity to grow these categories to serve all customers, boost lifetime value and fuel global expansion.\nFourth, we drove strong trends in our e-commerce business, building on Kate Spade's already solid digital presence. Recently, we've implemented live streaming across social platforms to gain further reach for our pop-ups and events, including the Kate Spade townhouse experience. Through continued digital innovation, we fueled mid-teens growth in e-commerce, which was nearly double pre-pandemic fiscal year '19 levels.\nFifth and finally, we maintained a consumer-centric approach and utilized data to gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences and purchase drivers. Our performance in the quarter was led by higher spend among our existing customer base, including those deeply lapsed. At the same time, our investments in the brand have resulted in continued customer acquisition, adding nearly 600,000 new customers this quarter in our North America direct channel.\nStepping back, during the initial phase of Kate Spade's transformation, we focused on rebuilding the brand's foundation and clarifying our purpose. We kept our brand vision at the forefront of our strategy as we set out to reestablish our core products and customer base. Today, as a result of these efforts, we are clear in our positioning within the market with consistent results that indicate our increasing traction.\nLooking ahead, our next phase is to [weave the why] of Kate Spade into our mission, expression and execution to connect more deeply with our community. We're harnessing the power of the brand to drive growth, enabled by diversified categories and a balanced global distribution. We also continue to be laser-focused on delivering higher AUR, building on our recent success. This will be a key element of capturing the significant margin potential we see in front of us. Overall, we remain incredibly excited for the opportunity ahead and remain confident in our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue and a high-teens operating margin over the planning horizon.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. During the quarter, the brand continued to make progress against its growth strategies. First, we delivered significant operating margin expansion, reflecting the bold and nimble execution by the Stuart Weitzman team in the face of a challenging environment. Importantly, despite a deterioration in trends in China due to COVID, we remain confident in our ability to return to profitability this fiscal year. We're leaning into the strength we're seeing in North America, notably in the wholesale channel, which is helping to offset the pressures in China.\nSecond, we maintained a consumer-centric strategy by leveraging our data analytics capabilities to deliver a compelling assortment for our customers as we capitalize on the recent market shift toward occasion wear. Sandals fueled the quarter's demand as iconic styles, including the Nearlynude as well as new introductions, such as the Ryder Platform and Summer Wedge, resonated with customers, specifically millennials. In addition, we introduced the versatile and timeless Stuart Pump, which exceeded expectations and has been well received for return to work.\nOur streamlined and relevant offering, coupled with lower promotional activity and select price increases, drove AUR growth in the quarter. In fact, AUR rose over 20% in North America. Looking ahead, we see further opportunity to increase prices, while maintaining our positioning within the overall market.\nThird, we fueled brand heat through focused narrative, backed by emotional and relevant marketing. Our spring campaign featured the mother-daughter duo of Kate Hudson and Goldie Hawn, wearing the [Alina, Discoplatform] and Stuart Pump, all of which became a top 10 style following the launch. Our engaging messaging helped to drive (technical difficulty) customers at a double-digit rate, while continuing to reengage and reactivate clients.\nFourth, we gained momentum in the wholesale channel. Stuart Weitzman has now reestablished a presence in all Nordstrom full-price stores in North America, representing significant progress from where we were just 1 year ago. At the same time, we've added depth within our international luxury accounts across Europe.\nFifth and finally, we continue to invest in digital and delivered a double-digit increase in demand. While digital now represents 20% of global sales, an increase of 5 points compared to fiscal year '19 prepandemic levels, we still see runway ahead.\nOverall, Stuart Weitzman remains on track to deliver a profitable year in fiscal year '22 fueled by better-than-expected performance in North America. The brand's product and marketing initiatives, coupled with solid execution, continue to drive results. We are confident in our significant top and bottom line improvements long term as we build brand awareness globally and capitalize on the recovery in China, where Stuart Weitzman has a strong position.\nIn closing, Tapestry is a powerful combination of iconic brands that offer tremendous value for our customers and a platform that has been transformed to drive innovation and customer engagement. Our foundation is solid and our brands are poised for growth. Further, we participate in advantaged categories that have increased at mid- to high single-digit rate over time and have proven resilient in the face of macroeconomic shocks and global crises. These categories serve an important emotional and functional need for consumers, which is as relevant today as ever before.\nWith the resilient nature of our categories, the attractive positioning of our brands and the emotional connections we are building with our customers, we are confident in the significant runway ahead. We look forward to discussing each of these elements in more detail along with our road map for continued growth at our upcoming Investor Day in September.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '22 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nCFO & Head of Strategy, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter performance beat our expectations, fueled by our North American business. In addition, we utilized our free cash flow to return over $550 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our dividend payment. While the external environment remains difficult, our teams are continuing to effectively navigate the backdrop by focusing on the factors within our control.\nTurning to the details of the quarter. Revenue rose 13% compared to prior year, including double-digit growth at each of our brands. By region, North America fueled our results, delivering 22% growth amid a strong consumer backdrop. Sales in Greater China declined at a low teens rate. This included a mid-teens decline in Mainland China, so it still represented a 20% increase in revenue compared to FY '19 prepandemic levels.\nAnd to give more color on China, while the quarter started off with year-over-year growth, trends weakened due to pressures from COVID-related restrictions, including declines in traffic with locked down cities as well as throughout the balance of the region. By the end of March, over 40% of our mainland store base was closed or operating on modified hours, and our regional distribution center located in Shanghai temporarily shut down. Digital sales growth of over 20% was not sufficient to offset pressure to our stores and wholesale businesses. We're continuing to navigate these near-term headwinds and believe in the resiliency of the Chinese consumers.\nIn Japan, excluding the headwind from currency, revenue increased mid-single digits compared to the prior year as COVID lockdowns and cases eased in the region. And in Europe, sales rose nearly 60% against last year. While year-over-year trends have improved in both Japan and Europe from an increased focus on the domestic consumer, revenue remains below FY '19 prepandemic levels due to the continued lack of tourist inflows.\nIn the balance of Asia, trends accelerated sequentially, rising over 45%, driven by Malaysia and Singapore. By channel, top line results were led by continued outperformance in the margin-accretive digital channel, which grew over 20% in the quarter. In addition, we saw further strength in wholesale and growth in stores compared to the prior year.\nMoving down the P&L. Gross margin was better than expected due primarily to higher full price sell-throughs and lower discounting. As a reminder, while our results included 440 basis points or $63 million of pressure from incremental freight, our underlying trends remain strong, given our better use of data analytics to improve assortment planning and marketing messaging as well as strategic price increases at each of our brands.\nSG&A rose 14% compared to the prior year, reflecting a 260 basis point increase in our marketing spend as we continue to invest in brand-building activities, while leveraging across the balance of our expense base. Overall, SG&A was in line with our expectations even with the top line beat. So taken together, operating income was better than forecast due to revenue outperformance, favorable gross margin and well-controlled SG&A.\nEarnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.51, in line with prior year and well ahead of our expectations.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $1.07 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.59 billion. Inventory at quarter end was 30% above prior year, primarily due to in-transits, which remained elevated in light of continuing industry-wide supply chain and logistics challenges. To this point, on-hand inventory was up low single digits. As a reminder, we have adjusted the timing of our buys and recognition of elongated lead times supported by investments in core styles. Overall, we're pleased with the makeup of our current inventory, which supports our future growth expectations.\nMoving to our capital allocation priorities. Based on our strong results year-to-date, significant free cash flow generation, robust balance sheet and outlook for growth, we're now on track to return approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2022, an increase from the prior outlook of over $1.5 billion. We've raised our share buyback expectations for the fiscal year and now anticipate the repurchase of $1.6 billion in common stock, which includes $1.25 billion bought back through Q3. Our shareholder return plans continue to assume approximately $270 million through our dividend program.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors have approved a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to begin utilizing in fiscal 2023, highlighting our confidence in the company's trajectory for growth. These capital deployment plans underscore our commitment to our shareholders and our confidence in the momentum of our business. Overall, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nTouching on our capital structure. Subsequent to quarter end, we refinanced our existing credit facility by entering into a new credit facility, which extends maturity, upsizes the revolver to $1.25 billion and includes the $500 million 5-year term loan. The proceeds from this term loan will be utilized to repay our July 2022 bonds totaling $400 million by the end of the fiscal year and for general corporate purposes. These actions support the company's incremental share repurchase activity, while maintaining a strong liquidity position and financial flexibility.\nNow moving to our fiscal 2022 outlook, which replaces all previously issued guidance. As noted in our release, we're modifying our outlook for the fiscal year. Let's peel back the layers and associated EPS impacts.\nFirst, escalating COVID-related headwinds in Greater China have had a greater impact than previously anticipated, representing approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of pressure. Second, due to uncertain legislative timing, we have now removed the assumption that GSP would be reinstated with retroactive benefit in the fiscal year from our outlook. This translates to a negative impact of approximately $0.17.\nOn the other hand, we're reflecting $0.25 to $0.30 tailwind, primarily due to the healthy underlying momentum across the rest of the world, notably North America, and inclusive of a $0.04 contribution from higher share repurchase activity.\nTurning to the details of our guide. Please note that all growth rates compared to prior year are on a comparable 52-week basis, excluding the impact of our 53rd week last year. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, which would mark a record for the company. This represents a high-teens increase compared to fiscal '21, with double-digit increases in each brand.\nFor the fourth quarter, specifically, we would expect continued strength in North America and Europe, with accelerating growth in the rest of Asia, which is helping to partially offset the near-term COVID-related disruption in China. In Greater China, we're now anticipating a revenue decline of approximately 35% in the fourth quarter. On the Mainland specifically, we're assuming that Shanghai lockdowns will be lifted at the beginning of June, followed by gradual improvements thereafter. In addition, our guidance incorporates the expectation that our regional distribution center will reopen in mid-May. Of note, we've not assumed full lockdowns in other major cities.\nFor the year, we've anticipated a gross margin decline compared to the prior year, assuming, first, a headwind of approximately $175 million or 260 basis points of margin, associated with increased freight expense. This includes the expectation for a moderating impact in the fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year.\nAnd second, geographic mix pressure due to China, a high-margin business. These impacts are being partially offset by AUR growth across brands through lower promotions supported by enhanced SKU productivity as well as select price increases. Thus far, the AUR gains we realized have largely been driven by lower promotional activity. We would expect to see further benefits from pricing actions beginning in fiscal year '23.\nFinally, as mentioned, we have removed the retroactive benefit associated with the reinstatement of GSP from our outlook and now anticipate paying the associated duties in the fourth quarter as we have in the previous 5 quarters.\nTurning to SG&A. We continue to anticipate modest leverage for the fiscal year. This incorporates the expectation for $300 million in structural gross run rate expense savings from the acceleration program. Importantly, we're continuing to utilize these savings to reinvest in areas of the business that fuel long-term growth, notably digital and marketing. So taken together, we now expect operating margin to decline over 70 basis points compared to the prior year.\nNet interest expense for the year is anticipated to be approximately $62 million. In addition, our guidance contemplates a fiscal year tax rate of 18%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. We expect weighted average diluted share count to be in the area of 271 million shares. This reflects the $350 million increase to our share buyback expectations. We anticipate EPS to be in the area of $3.25, representing nearly 20% growth compared to the prior year.\nFor the fourth quarter, this guidance implies high-teens earnings growth, outpacing the high single-digit revenue increase on a 13-week basis. Finally, we now plan to deploy approximately $180 million towards capital expenditures and cloud computing implementation costs in the fiscal year.\nIn closing, we continue to leverage the benefits of our transformed, diversified business model and strong underlying trends, notably in North America. The opportunity ahead for Tapestry and each of our brands is meaningful, and we remain focused on driving sustainable growth and total shareholder return. In addition, we're generating significant free cash flow and now plan to return approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders in this fiscal year alone, further demonstrating our financial strength and confidence in the future.\nI'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

Crevoiserat\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. We delivered record sales and adjusted earnings in the holiday quarter, highlighted by an inflection at Kate Spade, ongoing momentum at Coach and a return to pre-pandemic revenue levels at Stuart Weitzman. Importantly, we realized the significant acceleration in sales trends, driving strong double-digit growth over pre-pandemic levels and well outpacing our expectations across brands.\nWe took bold and deliberate actions to deliver for our customers and effectively navigated industry-wide challenges to meet increasing demand for our brands. These results are a testament to the significant transformation of our business, the strong consumer backdrop and engagement with our categories and the ingenuity and agility of our teams across the globe. We are a different company than we were just 18 months ago, backed by the strength of our unique brands and the benefits of our multi-brand platform.\nNow turning to the highlights from the second quarter. We continue to make meaningful progress against the acceleration program by sharpening our focus on the consumer, leveraging data to lead with a digital-first mindset and working with speed and agility. First, we maintained a consumer-centric lens by utilizing our customer data and analytics capabilities to enhance engagement, resulting in improvements to key customer metrics. We acquired nearly 3 million new customers who transacted with our brands across channels in North America, a low double-digit increase compared to the prior year with growth in both stores and online.\nThis brings total new customer acquisition to over 11 million over the past 18 months. Importantly, in each brand, we're increasing retention rates and reactivating lapsed customers effectively as we continue to prioritize driving customer lifetime value to fuel sustained growth.\nSecond, we advanced our digital capabilities through significant investments in the channel to improve the customer experience and drive conversion. We realized another quarter of outperformance with sales up approximately 30% versus last year, nearly 3x pre-pandemic levels. Digital sales represented 1/3 of our total business as customers continued to shop online even as in-store traffic trends improved. Given strong consumer engagement in this channel and the power of our platform, we expect digital to reach $2 billion in revenue in this fiscal year with further runway ahead.\nThird, we again increased global AUR at each of our brands, reflecting the power of our brands, the traction of our compelling product assortments and our innovative marketing. In addition, we've benefited from the infusion of data into our decision-making to streamline our offering and tailor messaging to consumers. This has resulted in lower promotions and higher SKU productivity, while also helping to identify opportunities to strategically raise prices to offset inflation.\nAnd fourth, we invested further in our China platform to foster distinctive connections and engagement with Chinese consumers. In the quarter, revenue on the Mainland rose mid-single digits, representing an increase of over 35% compared to fiscal year '20, despite disruption associated with COVID, including travel restrictions, traffic pressure and lockdowns in certain cities.\nGreater China revenue rose high single digits in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to resonate with the Chinese consumer globally as sales for this cohort rose low single digits against pre-pandemic levels. In the quarter, sales growth in China was fueled by digital as we continue to innovate and meet consumers where they want to shop. As such, we've expanded our presence on social media platforms while maintaining leadership positions on Tmall and TikTok even as new brands have launched on the platform, highlighting our prominence in the market and strong brand engagement, specifically with younger consumers. In fact, we achieved record sales during 11/11 on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion with Coach as the #1 ranked brand in the handbags, luggage and leather goods category and Stuart Weitzman as the #1 ranked footwear brand.\nLooking forward, while we anticipate volatility in the near term due to the pandemic, we remain confident that China represents a meaningful long-term opportunity across our brands. This was reinforced by our recent China brand tracking survey results, which showed handbags and small leather goods as a category where consumers intend to spend more over the next 12 months.\nI will now touch on second quarter highlights for each of our brands, starting with Coach. We again outperformed expectations, delivering 24% sales growth compared to last year. Revenue trends accelerated on a 2-year basis, increasing 20% above pre-pandemic level. This strong growth was enabled by the foundational changes we've made to ensure the consumer remains at the forefront of our strategy. As a result, Coach achieved its highest quarter revenue and profitability in nearly 10 years. The brand continues to gain traction with consumers globally across categories and genders, further increasing our confidence in the runway ahead.\nDuring the quarter, Coach made progress against its strategic initiatives. First, we remain focused on building iconic families to create a foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons. Our core assortment, notably the Taavi, Willow and Fields continue to drive our performance. At the same time, newly launched styles, including the studio bag and reinvigorated icons, such as the Rogue resonated with our customer base.\nSecond, we further infused data into our decision-making to more effectively address the functional and emotional needs of our clients. This enabled a significant pullback in promotions and drove full-price selling, resulting in an increase in global handbag AUR. In North America, handbag AUR rose low double digits, marking the region's 11th consecutive quarter of gains. Our momentum and the customers' response to the style and craftsmanship of our product reinforces Coach's pricing power and the further opportunity to increase prices to offset inflationary cost pressures.\nThird, we emphasize the brand's values through approachable messaging, highlighted by our inclusive holiday campaign. In addition, we connected with all audiences through the authentic recreation of Jennifer Lopez's iconic \"All I Have\" music video, which resulted in strong social engagement. Our marketing initiatives were rounded out by the unique storytelling moments created by our successful Ski capsule including pop-up cabins at Rockefeller Center, a custom-branded virtual game and our first foray into the NFT world featuring characters from the collection, which were claimed in second.\nOverall, these actions helped to drive strong customer metrics, including the acquisition of over 1.5 million new customers transacting in North America. At the same time, purchase frequency again rose, and we reactivated lapsed customers at an increasing rate.\nFourth, we again drove strong revenue growth in the digital channel, which rose over 30% compared to last year and has nearly quadrupled since fiscal year '20. We maintained this momentum even as store trends improved, underscoring the long-term opportunity for our online business.\nFifth, we delivered mid-single-digit sales growth in China or an increase of nearly 45% against pre-pandemic level. This improvement was led by outperformance in digital. At the same time, we continued to invest in our physical presence. In keeping with our focus on growing the brand with the emerging middle class, we're adding approximately 10 new Coach stores in the region this year on a net basis, primarily in Tier 3 and 4 cities. We're also renovating key storefronts and expanding our footprint in nontraditional locations to build awareness particularly with younger consumers.\nSixth and finally, we drove double-digit growth in our men's business with notable success in our horse and carriage pattern. We believe men has runway in bags and small leather goods as well as in broader lifestyle categories, increasing our conviction in reaching $1 billion in revenue at high margins over the planning horizon.\nIn summary, we're combining Coach's iconic history of quality and craftsmanship with new and innovative initiatives to engage with consumers. The continued outperformance of the brand is a direct reflection of the advantages of the Tapestry platform, the benefits of the strategic investments we're making in marketing and our ability to meet the consumer where they want to shop. We're driving sustainable [Technical difficulty] Coach approaching $5 billion in sales in fiscal year '22, while maintaining exceptional margins.\nNow moving to Kate Spade. Before I turn to the details of the second quarter, I'd like to take a step back to acknowledge the significant transformation and tangible improvements the team has made through the acceleration program. Over the last 18 months, we've returned Kate Spade to the brand our customers know and love. We've rebuilt our product foundation through the introduction and amplification of brand codes, which will serve as the platform for future icons. At the same time, we're maintaining a consumer-centric lens and infusing data into assortment planning and marketing.\nIn North America, we acquired nearly 5 million new customers and have improved brand awareness. We've also reactivated over 2 million customers during this time frame. In addition, we increased overall digital sales penetration to over 35% as of the most recent quarter as we focus on meeting the customer where they want to shop. And in keeping with the progress we've made to deliver great products, we've grown the brand's global handbag AUR highlighting pricing power for the future. Our work has fueled increasing momentum, giving us further confidence in the long-term opportunity for meaningful sales and market share growth.\nMoving to our second quarter. Kate Spade sales grew 33% compared to last year. Importantly, we drove a significant inflection against pre-pandemic levels and realized an 18-point sequential acceleration. At the same time, the brand delivered operating margin expansion ahead of both prior year and pre-pandemic level. These results were fueled by the successful execution of our strategic priorities. First, we maintained a consumer-centric approach, resulting in approximately 1.3 million new customers purchasing with the brand across North America direct channel. At the same time, we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in both existing and reactivated customers by utilizing data to gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences and purchase drivers.\nSecond, we amplified key platforms as we continue to build and innovate our core product offering, notably our Knott and spade flower jacquard again outperformed expectations. In addition, newly introduced core styles resonated with the consumer, including our Carlyle family (inaudible) pattern, which brought in a new and younger customer. Importantly, the strong performance of the core offering as well as deliberate actions to decrease promotional activity resulted in low double-digit global handbag AUR growth.\nThird, we drove brand heat through activity centered around increasing engagement with the consumer, while reinforcing our brand values to surprise and delight customers. This included new and exciting experiential initiatives such as opening a Disco truck in downtown, Manhattan, offering an exclusive jacquard handbag at a pop-up in Tokyo and wrapping some of (inaudible) in our signature spade flower. Further, in keeping with the brand heritage, we continue to invest in novelty platforms to maximize our emotional connection with shoppers. The Sequin embellished Slice Pizza bag at an AUR of over $300 was a top novelty performer and it hit across our social media accounts. Overall, these activities to increase brand heat are paying off with growing brand awareness per our most recent U.S. brand tracking survey.\nFourth, we maximized our lifestyle positioning through a focused assortment, including occasion options across ready-to-wear footwear and jewelry that were embellished with emotional details such as Pearls and Rhinestone Bows. Overall, these categories outperformed expectations and helped to boost customer acquisition and engagement as lifestyle remains an important driver of purchase frequency.\nFinally, we're building on the brand's already strong digital presence. We've continued to test and learn new ways to foster consumer engagement, such as the infusion of shoppable content through key social media platforms. Our innovative online approach backed by the passionate Kate Spade community helped to drive approximately 30% revenue growth in the channel compared to last year or double pre-pandemic level.\nOver the past year, we've rebuilt the brand foundation. These fundamental adjustments are taking hold and unlocking the next phase of growth for Kate Spade. We're continuing to lean into our iconic roots infusing our recently introduced brand codes and delivering strong marketing aligned with our product and values. We are incredibly excited for the opportunity ahead and remain confident in our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue and high-teens operating margins over the planning horizon.\nTurning to Stuart Weitzman. The brand drove significant trend improvements in the holiday quarter, highlighted by 37% revenue growth compared to last year and a return to pre-pandemic sales level. In addition, we delivered improving operating profit with operating margin expanding over 250 basis points. We continue to advance our overall growth strategies in the second quarter. First and importantly, the Stuart Weitzman team delivered the brand's highest quarter of operating income since fiscal year '18. This progress was fueled by the strategic actions we've taken through the acceleration program, notably optimizing our fleet globally, improving our digital foundation and reestablishing our presence with wholesale partners.\nSecond, we remain focused on digital in China, areas that represent significant long-term growth opportunities. In the quarter, digital sales rose over 35%, representing an increase of approximately 70% compared to 2 years ago at attractive margins. For Mainland China, we delivered growth on both a 1- and 2-year basis.\nThird, we maintained a consumer-centric strategy by infusing data analytics into assortment planning and capitalizing on market shifts to \"buy now, wear now\" styles and dress and occasion wear. This drove the recruitment of new customers at an increasing rate, while continuing to reengage and reactivate clients.\nFourth, we drove brand heat by sparking desire through our product assortment backed by engaging marketing, which featured Kate Hudson for the holiday campaign. We built upon our authority in boots and booties with outperformance in the [Nora] and Stuart. We also infused newness into our icons, including updated constructions of the [lift] and the introduction of our Nudistcurve. Our compelling assortment, coupled with higher full price sell-throughs and a reduction in promotional activity drove our second consecutive quarter of AUR growth. Going forward, we see continued opportunity to increase prices while maintaining our positioning within the overall market.\nAnd fifth, the brand continued to regain momentum in the wholesale channel, notably with key domestic full-price partners. Overall, we're making continued progress at Stuart Weitzman and remain on track to drive strong revenue growth with a return to profitability this fiscal year. In closing, our strong holiday results across each of our brands, support the higher revenue and earnings outlook provided today. Importantly, the outperformance we've delivered is a direct reflection of our consumer-centric strategy as we continue to grow our data and consumer insights capabilities to enable increasingly powerful customer engagement. Our momentum also highlights the incredible execution of our team and the agility of our platform as we've successfully navigated the volatile backdrop.\nWe're continuing to offer compelling and innovative products, underscored by the increased traction and pricing power of each of our brands. I'm confident in the long-term potential of our multi-brand portfolio and look forward to sharing our continued progress as we move forward.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital deployment priorities and fiscal '22 outlook. Scott?\n\nScott A. Roe\n\nCFO & Head of Strategy, Tapestry, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of high-quality results, including sales outpacing last year, pre-pandemic levels and expectations despite a difficult backdrop. At the same time, we utilized our strong free cash flow to return over $550 million to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Through the acceleration program, we're a fundamentally different company as evidenced by our better use of data, higher digital penetration and stronger margins compared to pre-pandemic levels. We're increasingly building momentum across our portfolio of brands.\nTurning now to the details of the second quarter. Revenue increased 27% compared to prior year, outpacing expectations of each brand. Against pre-pandemic level, sales rose 18%, a 9-point sequential acceleration driven by better trends in stores, along with continued strength in the digital channel. By region, North America delivered over 35% revenue growth compared to last year. And the region accelerated to 25% growth on a 2-year basis amid a strong consumer backdrop with increasing demand for all of our brands.\nSales in Greater China rose high single digits, including a mid-single-digit increase in Mainland China. Compared to 2 years ago, the region grew nearly 35%. Trends in both Europe and the balance of Asia improved versus the prior quarter on a 1-year basis, though remain below pre-pandemic levels, largely due to the lack of tourist inflows and COVID resurgences.\nMoving down the P&L. As anticipated, gross margin contracted in the quarter, reflecting our early and deliberate actions to invest in incremental freight to maintain product flow. In spite of a 320 basis point headwind from these freight investments, the gross margin was still nearly 150 basis points ahead of where we were just 2 years ago. This is a testament to the better use of data analytics to improve assortment planning and marketing messaging, driving lower promotional activity, increased SKU productivity and higher full-price sell-through. SG&A growth slightly outpaced the sales increase as anticipated given last year's unusual compares associated with the pandemic, including wage subsidies and rent concessions as well as a gain from the deferred purchase price of the Kate Spade China joint venture.\nExcluding these nonrecurring items in the prior year, we drove leverage in the business while making continued investments in digital, marketing and talent. So taken together, operating income grew double digits in each brand. And while operating margin was impacted by freight, the quarter was still nearly 2 points ahead of where we were just 2 years ago.\nEarnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.33, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year and over 20% versus FY '20.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $1.65 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Inventory at quarter end was 19% above prior year, including a significant increase in in-transit. While our actions to aggressively secure goods positioned us well for the holiday period, top line sales in excess of our expectations, notably at Kate Spade, resulted in lower than projected inventory balances.\nTouching on capital allocation and cash management. Based on the strong results of our second quarter, significant free cash flow generation, robust balance sheet and our outlook for growth, we now expect to return over $1.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal '22, an increase from the prior outlook of $1.25 billion. We now anticipate the repurchase of $1.25 billion in common stock, which includes $750 million bought back through Q2. In addition, our shareholder return plans continue to assume approximately $270 million through our dividend program.\nOur capital deployment plans underscore our commitment to our shareholders and our confidence in the momentum of our business. Overall, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we're investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, we're returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Separately, during the quarter, we completed a $500 million tender offer on our notes due in 2025 and 2027, funded by a $500 million 2032 bond offering, a leverage-neutral transaction that allowed for effective debt maturity management and a modest benefit to our interest expense. In addition, we still intend to repay our July 2022 bonds totaling $400 million by the end of this fiscal year.\nNow turning to our fiscal '22 outlook. Before we move into the details of our guidance, I'll touch on the current external environment. Across the world, the backdrop continues to be volatile. Consumer demand in the United States remains high, while near-term headwinds associated with the pandemic exist in China, which I'll expand upon shortly. Further, supply chain constraints persist throughout the industry. We're continuing to act boldly to mitigate these headwinds and deliver for our customers. Please note that all growth rates compared to prior year are on a comparable 52-week basis excluding the impact of our 53rd week last year.\nWe now expect revenue to be approximately $6.75 billion, which would mark a record for the company. This represents an increase of nearly 20% compared to fiscal '21 with strong double-digit growth at each brand. Our guidance contemplates ongoing strong momentum in North America in the second half which is helping to offset the expected near-term COVID-related disruptions in China. This is proof of the benefits of our globally diversified platform. Our guidance also incorporates lower-than-expected on-hand inventory due to the revenue outperformance in the first half as well as higher levels of in-transit. These longer lead times from ongoing supply chain disruptions are expected to limit our ability to change stronger underlying demand in the second half of the year, specifically in Q3.\nWe continue to expect modest operating margin expansion for the fiscal year, maintaining our gross margin and SG&A rate expectations. As previously shared, we expect gross margin to contract modestly due to incremental cost pressures associated with freight. The pressure is now expected to be approximately $170 million in the fiscal year. Excluding this impact of 250 basis points, underlying gross margin continues to expand through lower discounting and improved SKU productivity. In addition, we're capitalizing on the pricing power exhibited by each of our brands by increasing prices selectively going forward. In addition, modest SG&A leverage is anticipated for the fiscal year. We continue to expect about $300 million in structural gross run rate expense savings as a result of the acceleration program.\nWe're committed to reinvesting in the business to fuel long-term growth. Net interest expense for the year is now anticipated to be between $60 million and $65 million. In addition, our guidance contemplates a fiscal year tax rate of 18.5%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. We are now expecting weighted average diluted share count to be in the area of 274 million shares. This lower guide largely reflects our more aggressive posture in the second quarter along with the previously mentioned $250 million increase to the buyback expectation for the year. So taken together, we now expect EPS to be $3.60 to $3.65 above our prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.50.\nFinally, we now anticipate CapEx to be about $200 million for the year.\nTurning to the second half, we continue to contemplate double-digit revenue, operating income and EPS growth with particular strength in the fourth quarter. So to provide some more guardrails on Q3 specifically, revenue is expected to increase low double digits, which contemplates the inventory constraints previously mentioned. While these pressures are being realized across the portfolio, we anticipate an outsized financial impact on our smaller brands, given their relative size.\nLooking at the bottom line, third quarter operating margin is expected to contract largely due to incremental freight expense in the area of $55 million as well as increases in SG&A primarily due to marketing investments. In addition, while we're continuing to incorporate a 50 basis point benefit to gross margin from the reinstatement of GSP for the fiscal year, we're now reflecting the positive impact in the fourth quarter. Overall, EPS is expected to decline approximately 20% in the third quarter, an increase over 60% in the fourth quarter, which has been contemplated in today's higher outlook for the year.\nSo in closing, we're further leveraging the benefits of the acceleration program and our transformed business model, evidenced by increasing momentum at each of our brands. Our strong holiday results underscore our confidence in the benefits of our multi-brand platform and direct-to-consumer business model, which supported the increase in the fiscal year outlook. In addition, we're generating significant free cash flow and now plan to return over $1.5 billion to shareholders in this fiscal year alone. Overall, we remain confident in our long-term ability to drive continued revenue and operating income gains.\nI'd now like to open it up for your questions."
